childhood   rose was an unaccountable child from the start she learned to speak early and while she did not use babytalk she had strange words of her own she called hard money tow and a picture tac names which had nothing to do with onomatopoeia though it seemed so in some cases bread and milk she called plop  she began to read of her own accord when four years old picking out the letters from the advertisements of the newspapers and running to her mother at the sink or breadboard to learn what each word meant her demand for stories grew to be a burden she was insatiate nothing but sleep subdued her eager brain  as she grew older she read and reread her picture books when alone but when older people were talking she listened as attentively as if she understood every word she had the power of amusing herself and visited very little with other children it was deeply moving to see her with her poor playthings out under the poplar tree talking to herself arranging and rearranging her chairs and tables the sunlight flecking her hair and the birds singing overhead  she seemed only a larger sort of insect and her prattle mixed easily with the chirp of crickets and the rustle of leaves  she was only five years old when her mother suddenly withdrew her hands from pans and kettles gave up all thought of bread and butter making and took rest in death only a few hours of waiting on her bed near the kitchen fire and ann dutcher was through with toil and troubled dreaming and lay in the dim bestroom taking no account of anything in the light of day  rose got up the next morning after her mothers last kiss and went into the room where the body lay a gnomish little figure the child was for at that time her head was large and her cropped hair bristled till she seemed a sort of brownie also her lonely childlife had given her quaint grave ways  she knew her mother was dead and that death was a kind of sleep which lasted longer than common sleep that was all the difference so she went in and stood by the bed and tried to see her mothers face it was early in the morning and the curtains being drawn it was dark in the room but rose had no fear for mother was there  she talked softly to herself a little while then went over to the window and pulled on the string of the curtain till it rolled up then she went back and looked at her mother she grew tired of waiting at last  mamma she called wake up cant you wake up mamma  she patted the cold rigid cheeks with her rough brown little palms then she blew in the dead face gravely then she thought if she could only open mammas eyes shed be awake so she took her finger and thumb and tried to lift the lashes and when she did she was frightened by the look of the set faded gray eyes then the terrible vague shadow of the unknown settled upon her and she cried convulsively mamma mamma i want you thus she met death early in her life  after her mothers burial rose turned to her father more hungrily than before she rode into the fields with him in the spring when he went out to sow sitting on the seeder box with the pockets of her little pink apron filled with wheat and her sweet piping little voice calling to the horses or laughing in glee at the swarms of sparrows when he was plowing corn she rode on the horses clinging like a bluejay to the rings in the backpad her yellowbrown hair blowing  she talked sagely about the crops and the weather and asked innumerable questions often john could not hear her questions which were like soft soliloquies but she babbled on just the same  see the little birds pappa john theys bout a million of um aint they theyre glad spring has come aint they pappa they can understand each other just the same as we can cant they pappa john  john dutcher was not a talker and he seldom answered her unless she turned her eager face to him and her birdlike voice repeated her question but it mattered very little to rose she had her fathers power of selfamusement in case she got tired of riding about with him she brought her playthings out and established them in a corner of the fence her favorite game was playing horses  her horses were sticks of the size of canes and of all sorts and colors each one had a name how she selected them and why she selected them out of the vast world of sticks was a mystery to john dutcher  the brown stick she called dan the fork handle nellie and the crooked stick with the big knot was barney she had from six to ten and she never forgot their names each had a string for a bridle and they all were placed in stalls which she built with infinite labor and calculation out of twigs she led each stick by its halter up to the manger a rail on which she had placed oats and grass she talked to them  now barney whoawhoa there now dont you kick kit againnow sir kit you better stand over here by petebarney you need exercise thats what you needyessir  she exercised them by riding them in plunging circles about the fields forgetting with the quick imagination of a child that she was doing all the hard work of the riding with her own stout brown legs it was a pleasure to john to have her there though he said little to her  often at night as he saw her lying asleep her long lashes upon her roughened sunburned skin his heart went out to her in a great gush of tenderness his throat ached and his eyes grew wet as he thought how unresponsive he had been that day his remorseful memory went back over her eager questions to which he had not replied dear sweet restless little heart and then he vowed never to lose patience with her again and sometimes standing there beside her bed his arms closed about the little mound under the quilts and his lips touched the round sleepenraptured face at such times his needy soul went out in a cry to his dead wife for help to care for his child  he grew afraid of the mystery and danger of coming womanhood her needs came to him more powerfully each day  when she began going to school with the other children the effects of her lonely life and of her companionship with her father set her apart from the boys and girls of her own age and placed her among those several years older whom she dominated by her gravity and her audacity she was not mischievous or quarrelsome but she was a fearless investigator she tested their childish superstitions at once  when they told her that if she swore at god and shook her fist at the sky she would certainly drop dead she calmly stepped forward and shook her little fist up at the sun and swore while the awestricken children cowered like a covey of partridges  there you see thats a lie she said scornfully god cant kill meor else he dont care  she went on exploding these strange superstitious fancies which are only the survivals in civilized children of savage ancestry she stood erect in the door of the schoolhouse when she was eight years old and pointed her hand at the lightning while the teacher sat cowed and weeping at her desk  you said i dassnt the little elf cried but i dasst and nothing aint struck me yet  her absolute fearlessness of the things which children shrank from the dark and things of the dark made her a marked figure the women of the coolly thought it due to the lack of a mothers care they spoke to the minister about it and urged him to see dutcher and ask him to try and do something for the childs good  but dutcher simply said oh dont bother the child about her soul shes all right i dont bother myself about those things and whats the use o spoilin the childs fun if she wants to go to sundayschool why all right shell go where shes interested  but brother dutcher the child is doing outrageous thingsheathenish defying her god  i dont spose what she does will make any particular difference to god we understand each other rosie and me dont worry if she does anything real bad shell come an tell me of it chk chk g wan barney he cut the matter short by driving away into the field of corn  he saw rushing upon him the most solemn and severe trials of a parent rose was a sturdy girl and promised to develop into a maiden early and there were a hundred things which ought to be said to her which must be said by some one he was not philosopher enough to know that she held in her expanding brain the germs of selfknowledge  he had been passing through a running fire of questions from the child for two years but these questions now took hold of deeper things and they could no longer be put aside by saying wait a few years and then ill tell you she would learn them elsewhere if not from him he braced himself for the trial which increased in severity  the childs horizon was limited but within its circle her searching eyes let nothing escape she came to dutcher with appalling questions  she not only asked him who made god but she wanted to know how she came to be born and a thousand other questions of the same searching nature he saw that the day of petty fictions had gone by the child knew that little lambs and calves and kittens did not grow down in the woods she knew that babies were not brought by the doctor and that they did not come from heaven  good lord groaned her father one day after an unusually persistent attack from her caused by the appearance of a little colt out in the barn i wish your mother was here or some woman you do make it hard for me rosie  how do i make it hard for you pappa was her quick new question o lord what a young un he said in deeper despair come aint it about time for you to be leggin it toward school give me a rest rosie but ill answer all your questionsdont ask about them things of the childrencome right to me alwaysonly dont pile em all on me to once  all right pappa i wont  thats a good old soul he said patting her on the back after she had gone he sat down on the feedbox and wiped his face i wonder how women do explain things like that to girls he thought ill ask the preachers wife to explain itno i wont ill do it myself and ill get her books to read about itgood books  it was evidence of the girls innate strength and purity of soul that the long succession of hired hands had not poisoned her mind they soon discovered however the complete confidence between the father and child and knew that their words and actions would be taken straight to john as soon as night came and rose climbed into his lap this made them careful before her and the shame of their words and stories came to the childs ears only in fragments  dutcher concluded that he should have a woman in the house and so sent back to pennsylvania for his sister lately widowed rose looked forward to seeing her aunt with the wildest delight she went with her father down the valley to bluff siding to meet her bluff siding was the only town the child knew and it was a wonderful thing to go to town  as they stood on the platform waiting her eyes swept along the great curve of the rails to the east and suddenly like a pain in the heart came her first realization of distance of the infinity of the world  where does it go to pappa  o a long way off to madison chicago and pennsylvany  how far is it could we go there with old barney and nell  o no if we drove there it would take us days and days and the wheat would grow up and get yellow an the snow come almost before wed get there  o dear she sighed i dont like to have it so big do people live all along the whole way  yes the whole way and lots of big cities  big as madison madison was her unseen measure of greatness  o yes a hundred times bigger  she sighed again and looked away to the east with a strange unchildish set stare in her eyes she was trying to realize it  it makes me ache pappa she sighed putting her little brown hand to her throat  when the engine came in with its thunder and whizz she shrank back against the station wall white and breathless not so much with fear as with awe she had never stood so close to this monster before it attracted all her attention so that for the moment she forgot about the coming of her aunt  when she looked into the large dull face of mrs diehl she was deeply disappointed she liked her but she not love her  she had looked forward to her coming almost as if to the return of her mother she had imagined her looking strange and beautiful because she came out of the mystical faroff land her father often spoke of instead of these things mrs diehl was a strongfeatured mildvoiced woman rather large and ungraceful who looked upon the motherless child and clicked her tonguetch  you poor chick  but the thing which had happened was this rose had conceived of distance and great cities  the next day she said pappa john i want to go way up on the bluffs i want to go up to table rock where i can see way way off  its a long climb up there rosie youll get tired  but rosie insisted and together they climbed the hill up beyond the pasturebeyond the blackberry patchbeyond the clinging birches in their white jacketsup where the rocks cropped out of the ground and where curious little waveworn pebbles lay scattered on the scant grass  once a glittering rattlesnake lying in the sun awoke and slipped under a stone like a stream of golden oil and the child shrank against her fathers thigh in horror  they climbed slowly up the steep grassy slope and stood at last on the flat rock which topped the bluff rose stood there dizzy out of breath with her hair blown across her cheek and looked away at the curving valley and its river gleaming here and there through the willows and elders it was like looking over an unexplored world to the child her eyes expanded and her heart filled with the same ache which came into it when she looked down along the curving railway track she turned suddenly and fell sobbing against her father  why rosie whats the matter poor little girlshes all tired out climbin up here he sat down and took her on his lap and talked to her of the valley below and where the river wentbut she would not look up again  i want to go home she said with hidden face  on the way down john rolled a big stone down the hill and as it went bounding crashing into the forest below a deer drifted out like a gray shadow and swept along the hillside and over the ridge  rose saw it as if in a dream she did not laugh nor shout john was troubled by her silence and gravity but laid it to weariness and took her pickaback on the last half mile through the brush  that scene came to her mind again and again in the days which followed but she did not see it again till the following spring it appealed to her with less power then its beauty overshadowed its oppressive largeness as she grew older it came to be her favorite playing ground on holidays she brought down those quaint little bits of limestone and made them her playthings in her house which was next door to her barnand secondary to her barn     chapter ii  childlife pagan free   rose lived the life of the farm girls in the seven great middlewest states in summer she patted away to school clad only in a gingham dress white untrimmed cotton pantalets and a straw hat that was made feminine by a band of gay ribbon her body was as untrammeled as a boys she went barefoot and bareheaded at will and she was part of all the sports  she helped the boys snare gophers on the way to school and played house with the girls on the shady side of the schoolhouse and once while the teacher was absent at noon rose proposed that a fire be built to heat the tea for the dolls  she it was who constructed the stove out of thin bricks and set a fire going in it in the corner of the boys entryway and only the passing of a farmer saved the building from disaster  she it was who found the groundbirds nest and proposed to make a house over it and ended by teaching the bird to walk through a long hallway made of sticks in order to get to its eggs again  she despised hats and very seldom wore hers except hanging by the string down her back her face was brown and red as leather and her stout little hands were always covered with warts and good brown earth which had no terrors for her  bugs and beetles did not scare her any more than they did the boys she watched the beetles bury a dead gopher without the slightest repugnance indeed she turned to after a long time to help them a kindness which they very probably resented to judge from their scrambling  she always urged the other girls to go down to the creek and see the boys go in swimming and would have joined the fun had not the boys beaten her back with hands full of mud while they uttered opprobrious cries she saw no reason why boys should have all the fun  when the days were hot they could go down there in the cool nice creek strip and have a good time but girls must primp around and try to keep nice and clean she looked longingly at the naked little savages running about and splashing in the water there was something so fine and joyous in it her childish heart rebelled at sexdistinction as she walked slowly away she too loved the feel of the water and the caress of the wind  she was a good student and developed early into a wonderful speller and reader she always listened to the classes in reading and long before she reached the pieces herself she knew them by heart and said them to herself in the silence of the lane or the loneliness of the garret she recited the battle of waterloo and locheil long before she understood the words the roll of the verse excited her and she thrust her nut of a fist into the air like miriam the hebrew singer feeling vaguely the same passion  she went from primer to first reader then to the second and third readers without effort she read easily and dramatically she caught at the larger meanings and uttered them in such wise that the older pupils stopped their study to listen  scraps and fragments of her reading took curious lodgment in her mind new conceptions burst into her consciousness with a golden glory upon reading these lines      field of wheat so full and fair     shining with a sunny air     lightly swaying either way     graceful as the breezes sway  they made her see the beauty of the grainfield as never before it seemed to be lit by some mysterious light      cleon hath a million acres     neer a one have i  seemed to express something immemorial and grand she seemed to see hills stretching to vast distances covered with cattle the pied frogs orchestra came to her with sudden conscious meaning as she sat on the doorstep one night eating her bowl of bread and milk and watching the stars come out these fragments of literature expressed the poetry of certain things about her and helped her also to perceive others  she was a daring swinger and used to swing furiously out under the maple trees hoping to some day touch the branches high up there and when her companions gathered in little clumps in dismayed consultation she swung with wild hair floating free a sort of intoxication of delight in her heart  sometimes when alone she slipped off her clothes and ran amid the tall cornstalks like a wild thing her slim little brown body slipped among the leaves like a weasel in the grass some secret strange delight drawn from ancestral sources bubbled over from her pounding heart and she ran and ran until wearied and sore with the rasping corn leaves then she sadly put on civilized dress once more  her feet were brown as toads but graceful and small and she washed them when the dew was heavy enough by running in the wet grass just before going in to bed a trick the boys of the neighborhood had taught her she ran forward to clean the insteps and backward to clean the heels if the grass was not wet she omitted the ceremony dust was clean anyhow her nightgowns were of most sorry pattern till her aunt came thereafter they were clean though it mattered little they were a nuisance anyway  she wore a pink sunbonnet when she could find one generally there were two or three hanging on the fences at remote places she sat down in the middle of the road because she had a lizards liking for the warm soft dust and she paddled in every pool and plunged her hand into every puddle after frogs and bugs and worms with the action of a crane  she ate everything that boys did that is to say she ate sheep sorrel indian tobacco roots of ferns may apples rose leaves rosebuds raw turnips chokecherries wild crabapples slippery elm bark and the green balls on young oak trees as well as the bitter acorns these acorns she chewed into pats and dried in the sun to eat at other times like a savage  she ate pinks and grass blades and green watermelons and ground cherries and blackhaws and dewberries and every other conceivable thing in the woods and fields not to mention the score of things which she tried and spit out she became inured to poison ivy like the boys and walked the forest paths without fear of anything but snakes  summer was one continuous and busy playspell for her in those days before her lessons became a serious thing for as she sat in school she was experimenting in the same way she chewed paper into balls and snapped them like the boys she carried slips of elm bark to chew also and slate pencils she crunched daily she gnawed the corners of her slate tasted her ink and munched the cedar of her pencil  and through it all she grew tall and straight and brown she could run like a partridge and fight like a wildcat at need her brownblack eyes shone in her dark warm skin with an eager light and her calloused little claws of hands reached and took hold of all realities  the boys respected her as a girl who wasnt afraid of bugs and who could run and throw a ball above all she was strong and well     chapter iii  dangerous days   a farmers daughter is exposed to sights and sounds which the city girl knows nothing of mysterious processes of generation and birth go on before the eyes of the farm child which only come as obscure whisperings to the city child of the same middle condition and these happenings have a terrifying power to stir and develop passions prematurely  rose heard occasionally obscene words among the hands she listened unperceived to the vulgar cackling of old women during afternoon calls before her eyes from the time of her toddling youth had proceeded the drama of animal life she had seen it all courtship birth death nothing escaped her keen searching inquisitive eyes she asked her father about these dramatic and furious episodes of the barnyard but he put her off and she finally ceased to ask about them she began to perceive they were considered of that obscure and unmentionable world of sin with which men alone had proper right to deal  when the girls of her age in the grasp of some gale of passion danced about her shouting foul words in the unknowing way children have she could not take part by word of mouth though she felt the same savage frenzied delight in it  she learned early the hideous signs which pass in the country to describe the unnamable and the covert things of human life she saw them scrawled on the fences on schoolhouse doors and written on the dust of the road there was no escaping them the apparently shameful fact of sex faced her everywhere  and yet through it all she lived a glad free wholesome life her blood was sweet and clean and kept off contagion her brown skin flushed with its unhindered current she dipped into this obscure questionable world only momentarily and came back to her father wholesome and happy except occasionally when some outrageous gesture or word had stricken her into weeping  then her father told her not to mind just be good and sweet herself and it would help the others to be good too he blundered sometimes and struggled for words and talked in grotesque riddles but she understood his meaning some way and was comforted  she did not go to her aunt she had heard her say coarse words and she did not care to go and tell her of these strange things her father was her hero and guide she went to him as naturally as to a mother it was a great thing for him to achieve but he did not know it he did not seek it it was indeed thrust upon him he would gladly have escaped from it but rose refused to listen to anyone else so the puzzled and disturbed father continued to be her timorous guide as a matter of need  he could not understand her quick perceptionsomething seemed to rise in the child to help him explain germs of latent perception seemed to spring up like a conjurors magic seed here a kernel there a tree one by one obscure ideas rose from the deep like bubbles and burst into thought in her conscious self a hint organized in her brain long trains of sequential conceptions which she had inherited with her sex she did not require teaching on the most fundamental problems of her nature  rose began to work early but her work like her playing was not that of other girls as she never played with dolls caring more for hobbyhorses so she early learned to do work in the barn from taking care of makebelieve stick horses she came easily to take care of real horses  when a toddling babe she had moved about under the huge plowhorses in their stalls and put straw about them and patted their columnar limbs with her little pads of palms talking to them in soft indefinite gurgle of love and command  she knew how much hay and oats they needed and she learned early to curry them though they resented her first trials with the comb she cared less for the cows and pigs but before she was ten she could milk the easy cows she liked the chickens and it was part of her daily duty to feed the hens and gather the eggs  she could use a fork in the barn deftly as a boy by the time she was twelve and in stacking times she handed bundles across the stack to her father it was the variety of work perhaps which prevented her from acquiring that pathetic and lamentable stoop or crook in the shoulders and back which many country girls have in varying degree  all things tended to make her powerful lithe and erect the naked facts of nature were hers to command she touched undisguised and unrefined nature at all points her feet met not merely soil but mud her hands smelled of the barn yard as well as of the flowers of the wild places of wood and meadow  meanwhile her comradeship was sweet to john dutcher he hardly knew his loss of a son so completely was he companioned by rose he had put far away the time when she should wear shoes and long dresses and become a young lady  let her be as long as you can he said to his sister shes a mighty comfort to me now and shes happy dont disturb her time to wear long dresses and corsetsll come soon enough without hurryin things     chapter iv  an opening cloverbloom   there are times in a childs life when it leaps suddenly into larger growth as the imprisoned bud blooms larger than its promise when the green fist of its straining calyx loosens in the warm glow of a may morning knowledge comes to the child especially all the subtler knowledge of time of space of love in a vague indefinite unconscious way developing out of the childs organic self precisely as the flower blooms  this knowledge comes to definite knowledge for an instant only and then returns to the subconscious waiting the next day of warm sun shining water and smell of spring each time it stays longer till at last the child can contemplate its own thought and finally express it these times form our real life epochs  one day in june a party of the school children with flashing tin pails and willow baskets went up into the woods after the wildwood strawberries it was late june and the strawberries of the meadows and uplands were nearly gone the roads were dusty the pastures closeclipped  merry barefooted little creatures they started forth in the early morning while the dew still flamed on the cloverleaves and around each cornhill the ground was still moist the girls romped and picked wild flowers the boys threw stones at the chipmunks on the fence and tossed their tin pails in the air performing feats of deftness in imitation of the circusmen whom they had lately seen on the green at tyre  they entered the forest and kept on up the woodroad until it seemed as if they were explorers they had the delicious tremulous feeling of having penetrated into the primeval where nothing but the birds and animals lived on past cool deeps of poplar where the mandrake grew and the sweet fern spread its magnificent leaves on until the strawberries appeared growing in clumps on long swaying stems pale scarlet globes of delicious tartness  they fell to work mostly in pairs curlyhaired carl kept with rose and his sharp eyes and knowledge of the patch enabled them to fill their pails first then they went about helping the others whose voices babbled on like streams  everywhere the pink sunbonnets and ragged straw hats bobbed up and down everywhere fresh voices the sunlight fell in vivid yellow patches through the cool odorous gloom everywhere the faint odor of ferns and mandrakes and berries and the faint rustle of leaves as if the shadows of the clouds trampled the treetops  there was something sweet and wild and primeval in the scene and the children were carried out of their usual selves rose herself danced and romped her eyes flashing with delight under her direction they all came together on a little slope where the trees were less thick and near a brook which gurgled through mosscovered stones  o lets have our picnic here  all right lets  they made short work of the lunch they had their buttered biscuits were spread with berries and mixed with water from the brook which the girls drank like the boys that is by lying down on their breasts and drinking as the hunter drinks their hunger eased they fell to games games centuries old games which the skandinavians played in the edges of their pine forests games the english lads and lassies played in the oakopenings of middleage england  the little ones were ruled out after awhile and the five or six elder children the oldest only fourteen went on with their games which told of love they joined hands and circled about carl they sang      king william was king james son     and from the royal race he run     upon his breast he wore a star     which points away to a conquest far     go choose you east go choose you west     go choose the one that you love best  carl selected rose as they all knew he would they stood together now holding hands      down on this carpet you must kneel  they knelt      as sure as the grass grows in the field     salute your bride with a kiss so sweet  carl kissed her gravely      now you rise upon your feet  again they circled and again a little bride and bridegroom knelt the fresh young voices rang under the spaces of the trees silencing the joy of the thrush the flecking sunlight fell on their towsled hair and their flushed faces they had forgotten home and kindred and were living a strange newold life old as history wild and free once more and in their hearts something bloomed like a flower something sweet shook them all something unutterable and nameless something magnificent to attain and sorrowful to lose  when they tired of king william they all flung themselves down on the grass and grew quiet some of the girls made wreaths of flowers strung on grass stems while the boys studied the insects under the chips and stumps or came slyly behind the girls and stuck spears of foxtail down their necks some of them rolled down the bank carl when he was tired of this came and lay down by rose and put his head in her lap other bridegrooms did the same with their brides some of the boys matched violets by seeing which would hook the others head off  silence fell on them some passion thrilled rose as she looked down into carls sunny blue eyes she brushed his hair as he looked up at the clouds sailing above the trees like wonderful mountains of snow  she was thirteen years of age but prophecy of womanhood of change of sorrow was in her voice as she said slowly a look not childish upon her face  id like to live here forever wouldnt you carl  i guess wed have to build a house said carl the practical one  she felt a terrible hunger a desire to take his head in her arms and kiss it her muscles ached and quivered with something she could not fathom as she resisted she grew calm but mysteriously sad as if something were passing from her forever the leaves whispered a message to her and the stream repeated an occult note of joy which was mixed with sorrow  the struggle of wild fear and bittersweet hunger of desirethis vague mystical perception of her sex did not last to rose it was lost when she came out of the wood into the road on the way homeward it was a formless impulse and throbbing stir far down below definite thought it was sweet and wild and innocent as the first coquettish lovenote of the thrush and yet it was the beginning of her lovelife it was the second great epoch of her life     chapter v  her first peril   she came in contact during her school life with a variety of teachers most of the women she did not like but one sweet and thoughtful girl had her unbounded love and confidence she was from madison that was in itself a great distinction for the capital of the state had come to mean something great and beautiful and heroic to rose  there it was the governor lived there the soldiers went to enter the army she remembered hearing the neighbors say and her fathers weekly paper was printed there it was a great thing to have come from so far away and from madison and rose hung about the door of the school house at the close of the first day hoping the teacher would permit her to walk home by her side  the young teacher worried almost to despair over the arrangement of her classes did not rise from her desk until the sun was low rolling upon the treefringed ridge of the western bluff  she was deeply touched to find this duskycomplexioned barelegged girl waiting for her  it was very nice of you rose she said and they walked off together she talked about the flowers in the grass and rose ran to and fro climbing fences to pick all sorts that she knew she did not laugh when the teacher told her the botanical names she wished she could remember them  when you grow up you can study botany too but you must run home now its almost dark  i aint afraid of the dark said rose stoutly and she went so far miss lavalle was quite alarmed  now you must go  she kissed the child goodbye and rose ran off with her heart big with emotion like an accepted lover  it was well rose turned to her for help for most of her teachers had not the refinement of miss lavalle they were generally farmers daughters or girls from neighboring towns who taught for a little extra money to buy dresses withworthy girls indeed but they expressed less of refining thought to the children  one day this young teacher with rose and two or three other little ones was sitting on a sunny southward sloping swell her hands were full of flowers and her great dark eyes were opened wide as if to mirror the whole scene a valley flooded with light and warm with the radiant grass of spring she was small and dark and dainty and still carried the emotional characteristics of her french ancestry she saw nature definitely and did not scruple to say so  o it is beautiful she said as her eyes swept along the high broken line of the western coulé ridge down to the vast blue cliff where the river broke its way into the larger valley children see how beautiful it is the children stared away at it but rose looked into the teachers eager face then her flowers dropped to the ground the sunlight fell upon her with a richer glow the dandelions shone like stars in a heaven of green the birds and the wind sang a wild clear song in the doors of her ears and her heart swelled with unutterable emotion she was overpowered by the beauty of the world as she had been by its immensity that day on the hill top with her father  she saw the purple mists the smooth green warm slopes dotted with dandelions and the woodlands with their amber and purplegray and graygreen foliage the big world had grown distinctly beautiful to her it was as though a gray veil had been withdrawn from the face of created thingsbut this perception did not last the veil fell again before her eyes when the presence of the teacher was withdrawn she felt the beautiful and splendid phases of nature and absorbed and related them to herself but she did not consciously perceive except at rare moments  the men who taught in winter were blunt and crude but occasionally one of a high type came some young fellows studying law or taking a course at some school teaching to keep their place or to go higher these men studied nights and mornings out of great latin books which were the wonder of the children such teachers appealed to the better class of pupils with great power but excited rebellion in others  it seemed a wonderful and important day to rose the first time she entered the scarred and greasy room in winter because it was swarming with big girls and boys she took her seat at one of the little benches on the north side of the room where all the girls sat at some far time the girls had been put on that the coldest side of the house and they still sat there change was impossible  rose was a little bit awed by the scene the big boys never seemed so rough and the big girls never seemed so tall they were all talking loudly hanging about the old square stove which sat in the middle of a puddle of bricks  she was an unimportant factor in the winter school however for the big boys and girls ignored the little ones or ordered them out of their games  in winter also her physical superiority to the other girls was less apparent for she wore thick shoes and shapeless dresses and muffled her head and neck like the boys  she plodded to school along the deep sleigh tracks facing a bitter wind with the heart of a man it made her cry sometimes but there was more of rage than fear in her sobbing she coughed and wheezed like the rest but through it all her perfect lungs and sinewy heart carried her triumphantly  the winter she was fourteen years of age she had for teacher a girl whose beautiful presence brought a curse with it she was small and graceful with a face full of sudden tears and laughter and dreams of desire she fascinated the children and the larger boys woke to a sudden savagery of rivalry over her which no one understood the older boys fought over her smiles and lowvoiced words of praise  the girls grew vaguely jealous or were abject slaves to her whims the school became farcical in session with everincreasing play hours and evershortening recitations and yet such was the teachers power over the students they did not report her she gathered the larger girls around her as she flirted with the young men until children like carl and rose became a part of it all  at night the young men of the neighborhood flocked about her boardingplace absolutely fighting in her very presence for the promise which she withheld out of coquettish perversity she herself became a victim of the storm of passion which swept over the neighborhood she went out to parties and dances every night and came languidly to school each morning most of the men of the district laughed but the women began to talk excitedly about the stories they heard  at school the most dangerous practices were winked at the older boys did not scruple to put their arms about the teachers waist as they stood by her side all the reserve and purity which is organic in the intercourse of most country girls and boys seemed lost and parties and sleighrides left remorse and guilt behind there was something feverish and unwholesome in the air  the teachers fame mysteriously extended to tyre and when known libertines began to hitch their horses at the fence before her house and to enter into rivalry with the young men of the neighborhood then the fathers of the coulé suddenly awoke to their childrens danger and turning the teacher away tearful and looking harmless as a kitten they closed and locked the schoolhouse door  instantly the young people grew aware of their outbreak of premature passion some of them like rose went to their parents and told all they knew about it john dutcher received his daughters answers to his questions with deep sorrow but he reflected long before he spoke she was only a child not yet fifteen she would outgrow the touch of thoughtless hands  he sent for carl and as they stood before him with drooping heads he talked to them in his low mild voice which had the power of bringing tears to the sturdy boys eyes  carl i thought i could trust you youve done wrongdont you know it youve made my old heart ache when you get old and have a little girl you may know how i feel but you cant now i dont know what i can say to you i dont know what i am going to do about it but i want you to know what youve done to meboth of you look into my face nowyou too roselook into your old fathers face  the scared children looked into his face with its streaming tears then broke out into sobbing that shook them to their hearts center they could not bear to see him cry  thats what you do to your parents when you do wrong i havent felt so bad since your mother died rose  the children sobbed out their contrition and desire to do better and john ended it all at last by saying now carl you may go but i shall keep watch of you and see that you grow up a good true man when i see youre real sorry ill let you come to see rose again  after carl went out rose pressed into his ready arms i didnt mean to be bad pappa  i know you didnt rosie but i want you to know how you can make me suffer by doing wrongbut there there dont cry any more if you are good and kind and true like your mother was youll outgrow this trouble now run away and help get supper  the buoyancy of a healthy childs nature enabled her to throw off the oppression of that dark day the most terrible day of her life and she was soon cheerful again not the child she had been but still a happy child after a few weeks john sent for carl to come over and they popped corn and played dominos all the evening and the innocency of their former childish companionship seemed restored     chapter vi  her first ideal   one june day a man came riding swiftly up the lanes in a buggy with a gilded box as he passed the schoolhouse he flung a handful of fluttering yellow and red bills into the air  a circus a circus was the cry as the boys rushed for the blowing sheets of paper it was a circus the annual monstrous aggregation of gregorian games and colossal cataracts of gilded chariots and it was coming to tyre  the children read every word of those high sounding posters standing in knots by the roadside it was the mightiest event of their lives most of them had never been to a circus many had never been so far as tyre some had however and they straightway became fountains of wisdom and declaimed upon the splendors of other aggregations  rose looked at the lines of knights and ladies winding down the yellow broadside of the sheet and wondered if she would ever see them  the courier rode on he flung a handful of the bills over into the cornfield where carl was plowing corn with the hired man and carl straightway began to plan  he flung a handful of the alluring yellow leaves into the bed of the wagon which poor old john rapp was driving and he sighed and wondered how he would raise the money to take the children down and also he longed to see it himself the whole county awoke to the significance of the event and began preparation and plans though it was nearly three weeks away an enormous distance it seemed to the boys and girls  at school and at church it was talked of the boys selected their girls and parties of four or six were made up to go to tyre ten miles away in the larger valley below in some way without words rose agreed to go with carl john nixon and ella pierce made up the other couple they were to go in a bowery wagon  the whole population awoke to pathetic absorbing interest in the quality of the posters and the probable truth of the foreword the circus was the mightiest contrast to their slow and lonely lives that could be imagined it came in trailing clouds of glorified dust and grouped itself under vast tents whose lift and fall had more majesty than summer clouds and its streamers had more significance than the lightning  it brought the throb of drum and scream of fife and roar of wild beast for one day each humdrum town was filled with romance like the arabian nights with helmeted horsemen glittering war maidens on weirdly spotted horses elephants with howdahs and headplates of armor with lions dreadful sorrowful sedate and savage with tigers and hyenas in unmanageable ferocity pacing up and down their gilded dens while their impassive keepers dressed in red sat in awful silence amidst them  there was something remote and splendid in the ladies who rode haughtily through the streets on prancing horses covered with red and gold trappings there was something heroic something of splendid art in the pose of the athletes in the ring  from the dust and drudgery of their farms the farm boys dreamed and dreamed of the power and splendor of the pageantry they talked it each sunday night as they sat up with their sweethearts the girls planned their dresses and hats and the lunch they were to take everything was arranged weeks ahead carl was to furnish one team john the other ella was to bring cake and jelly and biscuit rose to take a chicken and a shortcake  they were to start early and drive a certain route and arrive at the ground at a certain hour to see the parade after the parade they were to take dinner at the hotel and then the circus no court ball ever thrilled a young girls heart like this event  it was trebly important to rose it was her first really long dress it was her first going out into the world with an escort and it was her first circus she trembled with excitement whenever she thought of it and sometimes burst into tears at the uncertainty of it it might rain she might be sick or something might happen  she worked away with feverish haste trimming her hat and helping on her dress which was to be white trimmed with real lace from the store some dim perception of what it all meant to his girl penetrated john dutchers head and he gave rose a dollar to buy some extra ribbon with and told mrs diehl to give the child a good outfit  on the night before the circus carl could not work in the corn he drove furiously about the neighborhood on inconsequential errands he called twice on rose and they looked into each others face with transports of fear and joy  o if it should rain  it wont i just know its going to be fine dont you worry i am the son of a prophet i know it cant rain  there was no real sleep for rose that night twice she woke from an uneasy doze thinking she heard the patter of rain but listening close she knew it was only the rustle of the cottonwood trees about the house  her room was a little roughplastered garret room with an eastern window and at last she saw the yellow light interfiltrate the darkblue of the eastern sky and she rose and pattered about in her bare feet while she put up her hair like a woman and slipped on her underskirt stiff with starch and then her dress with its openwork sleeves and ruche of lace threaded with blue ribbon she moved about on her bare feet rejoicing in the crisp rustle of her new clothing and put on her wide hat with its hectic rosebuds and parisgreen thick leaves her undistorted feet were the most beautiful of all but she did not know that  she sat on the bed completely dressed but hardly daring to move for fear of waking her aunt she watched the yellow glow deepen to a saffron dome of everspreading light she knew the weather signs herself and she was sure the day was to be hot but clear she did not fear the heat  as she sat so a feeling of joy of realization of the abounding goodness and sweetness of living made her want to thank somethingto give praise she moved her lips in a little prayer of thanks to the sun as his first glittering rim of light came above the low hills  rosie called mrs diehl  im up she replied and hastily drew on her shoes and stockings she took her hat in her hands and went down the stairs and through the little sitting room out to the doorstep she heard someone whistling then a shout of laughterthey were coming  she had packed her basket the night before and she stood ready at the gate when carl and his companions drove up they had four horses hitched to a large wagon which was set about with branches of oak and willow carl was driving and rose mounted to the front seat with him he cracked his whip and they whirled away leaving the old folks calling warnings after them  the sun was just rising the dew was still globed on the wild roses the wagon rumbled the bower over their heads shook with the jar of the wheels the horses were fresh and strong and the day was before them rose felt something vague and sweet something that laved the whole world like sunlight she was too happy to sing she only sat and dreamed she felt her clothes but she was no longer acutely conscious of them  carl was moved too but his emotion vented itself in shouts and cheery calls to the horses and to the pistollike cracking of his whip  he looked at her with cleareyed admiration she abashed him a little by her silence she seemed so strangely womanly in that pose and the glow of her firm arms through her sleeve was alien somehow  the road led around hill sides under young oak trees across dappled sands and over little streams where the horses stopped to drink it was like some worldold idyl this ride in a heavy rumbling wagon it led to glory and light this road among the hills  rounding a long low line of bluffs they caught the flutter of flags in tyre and saw the valley spotted with other teams crawling like beetles down the sandy river roads the whole land seemed to be moving in gala dress toward tyre everywhere appeared the same expectancy the same exultation between lovers  carl pulled up with a flourish at the wooden porch of the farmers hotel and the girls alighted and went into the parlor while the boys took the horses into a back alley and gave them their oats and hay in the end of the box  as rose walked into the parlor filled with other girls and young men the proud consciousness of her clothes came back to her and she carried herself with a lift of the head which made her dark gipsylike face look haughty as a young queens she knew her dress was as good as any other there and she had no need to be ashamed and besides it was her first long dress and she wore low shoes  the boys came bustling back and hurried the girls out on the sidewalk theyre coming they cried breathlessly as a faroff burst of music came in on a warm puff of wind  on they came a band leading the way just behind with glitter of lance and shine of helmet came a dozen knights and fair ladies riding spirited chargers they all looked strange and haughty and sneeringly indifferent to the cheers of the people the women seemed small and firm and scornful and the men rode with lances uplifted looking down at the crowd with a haughty droop in their eyelids  rose shuddered with a new emotion as they swept past she had never looked into eyes like those they had wearied of all splendor and triumph those eyes they cared nothing for flaunt of flag or blast of bugle they rode straight out of the wonder and mystery of the morning to her they came from the unknown spaces of song and story beyond the hills  the chariots rumbled by almost unheeded by rose she did not laugh at the clown jiggling by in a ponycart for there was a face between her and all that followed the face of a barearmed knight with brown hair and a curling mustache whose proud neck had a curve in it as he bent his head to speak to his rearing horse he turned his face toward where rose stood and her soul fluttered and her flesh shrank as if from fire but he rode on his face was fine like pictures she had seen it was a pleasant face too proud but not coarse and stern like the others  the calliope a musical monster hideous as the hippopotamus and the dens of beasts went past without arousing her interest then the open cage of lions rolled by with a trainer carelessly seated on a camp stool amid his duncolored monsters his gaudy redandgold continental coat and his impassive face made a deep impression on her at last the procession passed carrying with it swarms of detached boys and girls whose parents fearfully called after them and unavailingly plead with them to come back as they broke away  o i wish it would all come by again sighed ella  so do i said carl  rose remained silent somehow those knights and ladies dwarfed all else she did not look forward to eating a hotel dinner with the same pleasure now but was eager to get to the tent whose pennants streamed above the roofs of the houses  the hotel swarmed with farmer folks whose loud voices uttered shouts of satisfaction over the promise of the parade it was the best ever seen in the town  right this way ladies and gentlemen said the landlord as he ushered carls party down to a table at the end of the diningroom  rose felt a thrill of delight she was a grownup person at last this landlord recognized her assumption and it made the dinner almost enjoyable she saw no one better dressed than herself and she had a feeling that she was good to look at she was really more beautiful than she knew a city drummer sitting at another table eyed her all through the meal with breathless admiration her health and color and the firm lines of her nose and chin were especially attractive  they all ate with unusual formality using their forks instead of knives for their pie and otherwise trying to seem citified ella laughed at the antics john cut up over his fork and the sly digs that he gave carl who chased the crust of his pie around his plate with a fork and at last gave it up and seized it with his fingers  no one noticed these pranks because everyone else was carrying on in much the same way at length they rose and returned to the parlor where they sat about on the cheap red plush chairs and waited for 1 oclock  well its about time to go said carl on one of his reentries from the street geewhittaker but its hot out there  itll be cool under the tent  well come on  out on the street they joined the stream of lovers like themselves moving hand in hand down the walk assaulted by cries of lemonade candy and fruit hucksters  the sun beat upon their heads a dust arose from the feet of the passing teams and settled upon the white dresses of the girls and sank through the meshes of their sleeves and gathered in the moist folds of their ruches they moved on rapidly toward the clanging band the flutter of the pennants and the brazen outcries of the tickettakers  on to the square before the tents thronged with innumerable people an avenue of sideshows faced them like a gauntlet to be run before each flapping sign of fat woman or snake charmer stood a man who cried in strange clanging monotonous and rhythmical voice  you still have a half an hour ladies and gentlemen before the great show opens come in and see the wonders of the world  before the ticket wagon a straggling excited crowd wrestled suspicious determined hurried leaving their girls in the more open space the boys drew deep breaths of resolution and plunged into the press with set determined faces  they returned soon hot disarranged but triumphant come on girls  they moved upon the main entrance where a man stood snatching at the tickets which were handed to him he was humorous and talked as he pushed the people in  hurry up old man trot close after your mother have your tickets ready everybody yes right this way uncle bless your dear little faceright ahead hyere bub this tickets no goodoh so it is i didnt see the right sideget on quick  as rose passed him he said you go in free my dear and resumed his bawling cry have your tickets ready  under the tent rose looked up at the lifting tremulous translucent canvas with such awe as the traveler feels in st peters dome her feet stumbled on while she clung to carls hand without knowing it o the enormous crowds of people the glitter and change of it all  they followed in the stream which flowed around the circle of animal dens and rose silently looked at all she saw the others laughed and exclaimed but she did not everything seemed inexplicable and mysterious and roused confusing trains of thought  she saw the great tigers and caught the yellowgreen sheen of their eyes she saw the lions rise like clouds of dust in their corners silent as mist and terrible as lightning she looked at the elephant and wondered how he could live and be so like the toy elephants she had at home on past shrieking tropical birds and grunting wallowing beasts and chattering crowds of people she moved without a word till they came around to the circus entrance and then she lifted her eyes again around the great amphitheater  peanuts peanuts here five a bag  heres your lemonade cool and fresh  on all sides brazenvoiced young men were selling at appalling prices sticks of candy glasses of lemonade palmleaf fans and popcorn balls there was something about them that frightened her and she walked a little closer to carl  they heard familiar voices call and saw some young people from their coulé and so clambered up where they sat the boards were narrow and the seats low but nobody minded that for that was part of the circus  they were settled at last and ready to enjoy all that came two or three volunteered to say this is great the best place to see em come in then they passed the peanut bag in reckless liberality  rose sat in a dream of delight as the band began to play it was an ambitious band and played operatic selections with modulations and it seemed to rose to be the most splendid music in the world all other bands she had heard played right along tumtummy tumtummy tummy tummytum this band sang and talked and whispered and dreamed it shook her like a stallions neigh and soothed her like the coo of a dove on the barn roof  she heard nothing that was said about her and she did not know she sat squeezing carls arm  people streamed by in enormous crowds ladies in elegant dresses and hats such as she had never seen before handsome young men went by and yet she gave them no second look they were like figures in a dream  at last the band blared an announcing note and the uniformed attendants filed into the ring and took positions at set points like sentries then the music struck into a splendid galop and out from the curtained mysteries beyond the knights and ladies darted two and two in glory of crimson and gold and green and silver at their head rode the man with the brown mustache  they came around into position and then began a series of bewildering changes directed by her knight whose shout dominated the noise of the horses and the blare of the band with hollow wild sound  they vanished as they came and then came the clowns and tricks and feats of strength the ironjawed woman lifted incredible weights the japanese jugglers tossed cannonballs knives and feathers the baby elephant stood on his headand then suddenly six men dressed in tights of blue and white and orange ran into the ring and her hero led them  he wore blue and silver and on his breast was a rosette he looked a god to her his naked limbs his proud neck the lofty carriage of his head made her shiver with emotion they all came to her lit by the white radiance they were not naked they were beautiful but he was something more  she had seen naked boys and her own companions occasionally showed themselves naked and cowering before her but these men stood there proud and splendid they invested their nakedness with something which exalted them they became objects of luminous beauty to her though she knew nothing of art  as she grew clearereyed she saw that one was a little too short another too lean but he of the rosette was perfect the others leaped with him doing the same feats but as distances were increased and the number of camels and horses grew the others stood by to see him make his renowned double somersault over a herd of animals when the applause broke out she joined it while her temples throbbed with emotion to see him bow and kiss his fingers to the audience was a revelation of manly grace and courtesy he moved under the curtain bowing still to the cheering crowd  once more he came back later on leading a woman by the hand she too was in tights throughout and like him she walked with a calm and powerful movement but she seemed petty beside him  something new seized upon roses heart a cold contraction that she had never felt and her teeth pressed together she wondered if the woman were his wife  the woman seized a rope with her right arm and was drawn to the tent roof he took a strap in his mouth and was drawn to his trapeze also there in midair they performed their dangerous evolutions it was all marvelous and incredible to the country girl  she heard him clap his hands then his glorious voice rang above the music and the lithe figure of his companion launched itself through the air was caught by the shoulders in his great hands thence with a twist he tossed her and hooked her by the hands  each time the blood surged into roses throat as if to suffocate her a horrible fear that was a pleasure some way rose and fell in her she could not turn away her head she must look  she was a powerful girl and the idea of fainting had never come to her but when at the conclusion he dropped in a revolving ball into the net far beneath she turned sick and her eyes seemed to whirl in their sockets then as he leaped to the ground bowing and smiling the blood rushed back to her face and the perspiration stood like rain on her face  thereafter riders came and the clowns capered and the ringmaster cracked his whip and she enjoyed it but it was an afterclimax she saw it but saw it dimly nothing but the lions and their trainers aroused her to applause her brain was full it was a feast of glories and her very hunger made her lay hold upon the first that came to the neglect of what came after  at last the brazen resounding voice of the ringmaster announced the last of the show and the audience arose and moved out in a curious sort of a hush as if in sorrow to think it was all over and the humdrum world was rushing back upon them  rose moved along in perfect silence clinging to carls hand around her was the buzz of low speech the wailing of tired and hungry babies and the clamor of attendants selling tickets for the minstrel show to follow  suddenly she perceived that her dress was wet with perspiration and grimy with dust she saw all about her women with flushed faces and grimy hands their hats awry and their brows wrinkled with trouble over fretful children the men walked along with their coats over their arms and their hats pushed back the dust arose under their feet with a strange smell out in the animal tent the odor was stifling and rose hurried carl out into the open air  somehow it seemed strange to see the same blue sky arching the earth things seemed exactly the same and yet rose had grown older she had developed immeasurably in those few hours it took her some time to fully recover the use of her feet and it took longer to get back a full realization of where she was  the grass crushed and trampled and littered with paper and orange peel gave out a fresh farmlike odor that helped her to recover herself she would not talk she could not talk yet she only urged them to go home she wanted to get home to think                                       as they climbed the slope on the other side of the river they looked back at the tents with their wilted streamers at the swarming buglike teams and the antlike human beings and it seemed to rose as if she should weep so poignant was her sense of personal loss  she knew something sweet and splendid and mystical was passing out of her life after a few hours stay there her feeling of loss was none the less real because it was indefinable to her  the others chattered about each part of the show and shouted admiration about this and that feat but rose was silent when they stopped at sunset beside a spring to eat their lunch she merely said  i dont feel hungry  the others fell silent after a time and they rode dreamily forward with the roll of wheels making them sleepy and the trample of the horses feet telling them how rapidly they were leaving their great days pleasure behind them  when rose huddled into her little attic bed her eyes were wide open and her brain active as at noonday there was no sleep for her then lying there in the darkness she lived it all over again the flutter of flags the wild voices the blare of music the chariots the wild beasts the knights and ladies the surging crowds but the crowning glory the pictures which lingered longest in her mind were the splendid and beautiful men whose naked majesty appealed to her pure wholesome awakening womanhood with the power of beauty and strength combined with sex and art both included  these glorious glittering graceful beings with their marvelous strength and bravery filled her with a deep sad hunger which she could not understand they came out of the unknown led by her chosen one like knights in ivanhoe  she fell asleep thinking of the one in blue and silver and in her sleep she grew braver and went closer to him and he turned and spoke to her and his voice was like waters running and his eyes shone some way into her eyes like a light                                       when she rose the next day she was changed she moved about the house dull and languid never before had she failed to sleep when her head touched the pillow she managed to be alone most of the time and at last her mind cleared she began to live for him her ideal she set him on high as a being to be worshiped as a man fit to be her judge  in the days and weeks which followed she asked herself would he like me to do this or she thought i must not do that what would he think of me if he saw me now and every night when she went to sleep it was with the radiant figure in blue and silver before her eyes  when the sunset was very beautiful she thought of him when the stars seemed larger in the blue sky she could see the star upon his grand breast she knew his name she had the bill in her little box of trinkets and she could take it out and read william de lisle the worldfamous leader in ground and lofty tumbling in his stupendous leap over two elephants six camels and two horses  in all the talk of the circus which followed among her companions she took no part because she feared she might be obliged to mention his name when others spoke his name she could feel a hot flush surge up all over her body and she trembled for fear some one might discover her adoration of him  she went about with carl and rob as before only she no longer longed for them they seemed good familiar comrades but nothing more to them she seemed stranger every day her eyes had lost their clear brave look they were dreamy black and her lids drooped  vast ambitions began in her she determined to be a great scholar she would be something great for his sake she could not determine what but she too would be great at first she thought of being a circus woman and then she determined that was impossible  she dreamed often of being his companion and coming on hand in hand with him bowing to the multitude but when she was drawn to the tentroof she awoke in a cold sweat of fear and so she determined to be a writer she would write books like ivanhoe those were great days her mind expanded like the wings of a young eagle she read everything the ledger the weekly and all the dogeared novels of impassioned and unreal type in the neighborhood  in short she consecrated herself to him as to a king and seized upon every chance to educate herself to be worthy of him every effort was deeply pathetic no matter how absurd to others she took no counsel allowed no confidants she lived alone among her playmates  this ideal came in her romantic and perfervid period and it did her immeasurable good it lifted her and developed her it enabled her to escape the clutch of mere brute passion which seizes so many boys and girls at that age and leads to destructive early marriages it kept her out of reach of the young men of the neighborhood  she did not refuse the pleasures of the autumn and the winter only she did not seem so hearty in her enjoyment of the rides and parties she rode with the young fellows on moonlit nights lying side by side with them on the strawfilled bottom of the sleigh and her heart leaped with the songs they sang but it all went out towards her ideal he filled the circle of her mind the thought of him made the night magical with meaning as she danced with carl it was her heros arm she felt at night when carl left her on the doorstep she looked up at the stars and the sinking moon and lifted her face in a wild vow inarticulatei will be worthy of him that was the passionate resolution but it did not reach to the definiteness of words  as she worked about the house she took graceful attitudes and wished he might see her he would be pleased with her the grace and power of her arm acquired new meaning to her her body she recognized had something the same statuesque pose of his in the secrecy of her room she walked up and down feeling the splendid action of her nude limbs muscled almost like his and all this was fine and pure physical joy her idea remained indefinite wordless  these were days of formless imaginings and ambitions i will do i will do was her ceaseless cry to herself but what could she do what should she do  she could be wise that she would be so she read she got little out of her reading that she could make a showing of but still it developed her it made her dream great things impossible things but she had moments when she tried to live these things  meanwhile her manners changed she became absentminded and seemed sullen and haughty to her companions at times she never giggled like the rest of the girls she had fine teeth and yet her smile was infrequent she laughed when occasion demanded and laughed heartily but she was not easily stirred to laughter  just in proportion as she ignored the young beaux so they thronged about her one or two of them eyed her with a look which made her angry she took refuge in carls company and so escaped much persecution for carl was growing to be a powerful young man with fists like mauls and was respected among the athletes of the neighborhood  she did not realize that she would need at some time to settle with carl she accepted his company as a matter of course he filled social requirements for the time being  her teacher that winter was a plaintive sort of a little middleaged man a man of considerable refinement but with little force rose liked him but did not respect him as she had two or three of the men who had filled the teachers chair she could not go to him for advice  as the winter wore on the figure of william de lisle grew dimmer but not less beautiful her love for him lost its undercurrent of inarticulate expectancy it was raised into a sentiment so ethereal it would seem a breath of present passion would scatter it like vapor and yet it was immovable as granite time alone could change it he still dominated her thought at quiet times at dark when the stars began to shine but in the daytime he was faint as a figure in a dream     chapter vii  rose meets dr thatcher   the schoolhouse in dutchers coulé like most country schoolhouses was a squalid little den it was as gray as a rock and as devoid of beauty as a dry goods box it sat in the midst of the valley and had no trees to speak of about it and in winter it was almost as snowswept as the schoolhouses of the prairie  its gray clapboarding was hacked and scarred with knife and stone and covered with mud and foul marks a visitor who had turned in from the sunsmit winter road paused before knocking and looked at the walls and the door with a feeling of mirth and sadness was there no place to escape the obscene outcome of sexual passion  dr thatcher had been a pupil here in this same schoolhouse more than twenty years before and the droning shuffling sound within had a marvelous reawakening power he was a physician in madison now and was in the coulé on a visit  his knock on the door brought a timidlooking man to the door  id like to come in awhile said the doctor  certainly certainly replied the teacher much embarrassed by the honor  he brought him the chair he had been sitting on and helped his visitor remove his coat and hat  now dont mind me i want to see everything go on just as if i were not here  very well thats the way we do the teacher replied and returned to his desk and attempted at least to carry out his visitors request  a feeling of sadness mingled with something wordlessly vast came over the doctor as he sat looking about the familiar things of the room  he was in another world an old familiar world his eyes wandered lovingly from point to point of the room filled with whispering lips and shuffling feet and shockheads of hair under which shone bright eyes animallike in their shifty stare the curtains of a characterless shade the battered maps the scarred and scratched blackboards the patched precarious plastering the worn floor on which the nails and knots stood like miniature mountains the lopsided seats the masters hacked unpainted pine desk dark with dirt and polished with dirty hands all seemed as familiar as his own face  he sat there listening to the recitations in a dreamy impassivity he was deep in the past thinking of the days when to pass from his seat to the other side of the room was an event when a visitor was a calamityfor the teacher when the master was a tyrant and his schoolroom a ceaselessly rebellious kingdom  as his eyes fell at last more closely upon the scholars he caught the eyes of a young girl looking curiously at him and so deep was he in the past his heart gave a sudden movement just as it used to leap when in those faroff days stella baird looked at him he smiled at himself for it it was really ludicrous he thought ill tell my wife of it  the girl looked away slowly and without embarrassment she was thinking deeply looking out of the window his first thought was she has beautiful eyes then he noticed that she wore her hair neatly arranged and that her dress though plain looked tasteful and womanly about the neck the line of her head was magnificent her color was rich and dark her mouth looked sad for one so young her face had the effect of being veiled by some warm dusky color  was she young sometimes as he studied her she seemed a woman especially as she looked away out of the window and the profile line of her face could be seen but she looked younger when she bent her head upon her books and her long eyelashes fell upon her cheek  his persistent study brought a vivid flush into her face but she did not nudge her companion and whisper as another would have done  that is no common girl the doctor concluded  he sat there while the classes were called up one after the other he heard again these inflections tones perpetuated for centuries in the schoolroom thecatsawarat  again the curfew failed to ring in the same hard monotonous rapid breathless singsong every other line with a falling inflection the same failure to make the proper pause caused it to appear that bessie saw him on her brow  again the heavy boy read the story of the ants and the teacher asked insinuatingly sweet questions  what did they do  made a tunnel  yes now what is a tunnel  a hole that runs underground  very good it says that the ant is a voracious creature what does that mean  dunno  you dont know what a voracious creature is  no sir  and then came the writing exercise when each grimy fist gripped a pen and each red tongue rolled around a mouth in the vain effort to guide the pen cramp cramp scratch scratch sputter what a task it was  the december afternoon sun struck in at the windows and fell across the heads of the busy scholars and as he looked dr thatcher was a boy again and rose and her companions were the big girls of the school he was looking at stella the prettiest girl in the district the sunlight on her hair a dream of nameless passion in her eyes  the little room grew wide as romance and across the aisle seemed over vast spaces girlish eyes met his like torches in the night the dusty air the shuffle of feet the murmuring of lips only added to the mysterious power of the scene  there they sat these girls just as in the faroff days trying to study and succeeding in dreaming of love songs and vague sweet embraces on moonlight nights beneath limitless starshot skies with sound of bells in their ears and the unspeakable glory of youth and pure passion in their souls  the doctor sighed he was hardly forty yet but he was old in the history of disillusion and in contempt of human nature his deepset eyes glowed with an inward fire of remembrance  o pathetic little band of men and women thought he my heart thrills and aches for you  he was brought back to the present with a start by the voice of the teacher  rose you may recite now  the girl he had been admiring came forward as she did so he perceived her to be not more than sixteen but she still had in her eyes the look of a dreaming woman  rose dutcher is our best scholar smiled the teacher proudly as rose took her seat she looked away out of the window abstractedly as the teacher opened the huge geography and passed it to the doctor  ask her anything you like from the first fiftysix pages the doctor smiled and shook his head  bound the sea of okhotsk commanded the teacher  thatcher leaned forward eagerlyher voice would tell the story  without looking around with her hands in her lap an absent look in her eyes the girl began in a husky contralto voice bounded on the north and went through the whole rigmarole in the same way careless but certain  what rivers would you cross in going from moscow to paris  again the voice began and flowed on in the same measured indifferent way till the end was reached  good heavens thought the doctor they still teach that useless stuff but how well she does it  after some words of praise which the girl hardly seemed to listen to she took her seat again  rose on her part saw another man of grace and power she saw every detail of his dress his dark sensitive face and splendid slope of his shoulders the exquisite neatness and grace of his collar and tie and coat but in his eyes was something that moved her drew her she felt something subtile there refinement and sorrow and emotions she could only dimly feel  she could not keep her eyes from studying his face she compared him with william de lisle not deliberately always unconsciously he had nothing of the bold beauty of her ideal this man was a scholar and he was come out of the world beyond the big ridge and besides there was mystery and allurement in his face  the teacher called as if commanding a regiment of cavalry books ready there was a riotous clatter which ended as quickly as it begun  kling they all rose kling and the boys moved out with clumping of heavy boots and burst into the open air with wild whoopings the girls gathered into little knots and talked glancing furtively at the stranger some of them wondered if he were the county superintendent of schools  rose sat in her seat with her chin on her clasped hands it was a sign of her complex organization that the effect of a new experience was rooted deep and changes took place noiselessly far below the surface  rose come here a moment called the teacher bring your history  dont keep her from her playmates thatcher remonstrated  o shed rather recite any time than play with the others  rose stood near a lovely figure of wistful hesitation she had been curiously unembarrassed before now she feared to do that which was so easy and so proper at last she saw her opportunity as the teacher turned away to ring the bell  she touched thatcher on the arm do you live in madison sir  yes i am a doctor there  she looked embarrassed now and twisted her fingers  is it so very hard to get into the university  no it is very easyit would be for you he said with a touch of unconscious gallantry of which he was ashamed the next moment for the girl was looking away again do you want to go to the university  yes sir i do  why  o becausei want to know all i can  why what do you want to do  you wont tell on me will you she blushed red as a carnation now strange mixture of child and woman thought thatcher  why certainly not  they stood over by the blackboard the other girls were pointing and snickering but she did not mind them  i guess i wont tell she stammered youd laugh at me like everybody elsei know you would  he caught her arm and turned her face toward his her eyes were full of tears  tell me ill help you  his eyes glowed with a kindly smile and she warmed under it  i want to writestoriesand books she half whispered guiltily the secret was out and she wanted to run away the doctors crucial time had come if he laughedbut he did not laugh he looked thoughtful almost sad  you are starting on a long long road rose he said at last where it will lead to i cannot tellnobody can what put that into your head  rose handed him a newspaper clipping containing a brief account of how a wisconsin poetess achieved fame and fortune  why my dear girl he began dont you know that out of ten thousand he stopped she was looking up at him in expectation her great luminous greybrown eyes burning with an inward hungry fire which thrilled him  she may be the one in ten thousand and ill help her he said to himself  the bell ringing brought the boys clattering back into their seats puffing gasping as if at last extremity for a couple of minutes nothing could be done so great was the noise  while they were getting settled he said to her  if you want to go to the university you will have to go to a preparatory school here is my cardwrite to me when you get done here and ill see what can be done  rose went back to her seat her eyes filled with a burning light her hands strained together this great man from madison had believed in her o if he would only come home and see her father  she painfully penciled a note and handed it to him as she came past to the blackboard he was putting on his coat to go but he looked down at the crumpled note with its spencerian handwriting  please sir wont you come down and see pappa and ask him if i cant go to madison  he looked at the girl whose eyes big and sombre and full of wistful timidity were fixed upon him obeying a sudden impulse he stepped to her side and said yes ill help you dont be troubled  he stayed until school was out and the winter sun was setting behind the hills rose sat and looked at him with more than admiration she trusted him he had said he would help her and his position was one of power in her fancy and something in his face and dress impressed her more deeply than any man she had ever seen save william de lisle her dim and shadowy yet kingly figure  on his part he was surprised at himself he was waiting a final hour in this schoolroom out of interest and curiosity in a country school girl his was a childless marriage and this girl stirred the parental in him he wished he had such a child to educate to develop  the school was out at last and as she put on her things and came timidly towards him he turned from the teacher  so you are john dutchers daughter i knew your father when i was a lad here i am stopping at the wallace farm but ill come over a little later and see your father  rose rushed away homeward full of deep excitement she burst into the barn where john was rubbing the wet fetlocks of the horses he had been driving her eyes were shining and her cheeks were a beautiful pink  o pappa he said i ought to go to madison to school he said hed help me go  john looked up in astonishment at her excitement  who said so  dr thatcher the man who visited our school today he said id ought to go and he said hed help me  her exultation passed suddenly somehow there was not so much to tell as she had fancied and she suddenly found herself unable to explain the basis of her enthusiasm the perceived but untranslatable expression of the doctors eyes and voice was the real foundation of her hope and that she had not definitely and consciously notedto explain it was impossible if her father could only have seen him  i guess youd better wait awhile her father said with a smile which rose resented  hes coming tonight  whos he  dr thatcher he used to live here he knows you  john grew a little more intent on her news  does i wonder if he is old stuart thatchers son he had a boy who went east to school somewheres  rose went into the house and set to work with the graceful celerity which mrs diehl called knack  rose you can turn off work when you really want to to beat anything i ever see  rose smiled and hummed a tune mrs diehl was made curious  youre wonderful goodnatured it seems to me whats the reason already  were going to have company  who for peters sake  dr thatcher  whats he come here for  to see pappa said rose as she rushed upstairs into her atticroom it was cold up there warmed only by the stovepipe from the sittingroom but she sat down and fell into a dream in which she recalled every look and word he had given her  she came suddenly to herself and began putting on her red dress which was her company dress when she came downstairs in her creaking new shoes mrs diehl was properly indignant  well i declare couldnt you get along in your calico  no i couldnt rose replied with easy sharpness which showed the frequent passages at arms between them  when thatcher came in with the teacher he was quite startled by the change in her she looked taller and older and more intricate some way  she took his hat and coat and made him at home in much better form than he had reason to think she knew she on her part watched him closely his manner at the table was a source of enlightenment to her she felt him to be a strong man therefore his delicacy and consideration meant much to her it suggested related things dimly it made her appreciate vaguely the charm of the world from whence he came  dr thatcher was not young and his experience as a physician had added to his natural insight he studied rose keenly while he talked with john concerning the changes in the neighborhood  he saw in the girl great energy and resolution and a mental organization not simple she had reason and reserve force not apprehended by her father the problem was should he continue to encourage her education of a girl like that might be gloriousor tragic after supper john dutcher took him into the corner and while rose helped clear away the dishes the two men talked  you see john explained shes been talkin about going on studyin for the last six months i dont know whats got into the girl but she wants to go to madison i suppose her learnin of that bluffsidin girl goin has kind o spurred her on i want her to go to the high school at the sidin but she wants to go awayhe choked a little on that phrasebut if you an teacher here think the girld ought to go why ill send her  the younger man looked gravevery grave he foresaw lonely hours for john dutcher  wellthe girl interests me very much mr dutcher its a strong point in her favor that she wants to go most girls of her age have little ambition beyond candy and new dresses i guess its your duty to send her what she wants is the larger life that will come to her in madison the preparatory work can be done here at the siding i believe it is one of the accredited schools of course she will come home often and when she comes to madison i will see that she has a home until she gets wunted as you farmers say  the teacher came in at this point full of wild praise of roses ability shes great on history and geography she knows about every city and river and mountain on the maps  shes always been great for geography confirmed john used to sit and follow out lines on the maps when she wasnt kneehigh to a tater a tender tone came into his voice almost as if he were speaking of a dead child he too had a quick imagination and he felt already the loss of his girl his daily companion  the matter was decided there you send her to me when she gets ready and ill have mrs thatcher look after her for a week or so till we find her a place to stay  rose was in a fever of excitement she saw the men talking there and caught disconnected words as she came and went about the table at last she saw dr thatcher rise to go she approached him timorously  well rose when you come to madison you must come to our house mrs thatcher will be glad to see you she could not utter a word in thanks after he had gone rose turned to her father with a swift appeal  oh pappa am i going  he smiled a little well see when the time comes rosie  she knew what that meant and she leaped with a joy swift as flame john sat silently looking at the wall his arm flung over the back of his chair he wondered why she should feel so happy at the thought of leaving home when to him it was as bitter as death to think of losing her for a single day out of his life  thenceforward the world began to open to rose every sign of spring was doubly significant the warm sun the passing of wildfowl the first robin the green grass the fall of the frost all appealed to her with a power which transcended words all she did was only preparation for her great career beyond the ridge  she pictured the world outside in colors of such splendor that the romance of her storypapers seemed weak and pale  out there in the world was william de lisle out there were ladies with white faces and heavylidded haughty eyes in carriages and in ballrooms out there was battle for her and from her quiet coulé battle seemed somehow alluring     chapter viii  leaving home   as the time for leaving came on rose had hours of depression wherein she wondered if it were worth while sometimes it began when she noticed a fugitive look of sorrow on her fathers face and sometimes it was at parting with some of her girl friends and sometimes it was at thought of carl she had spent a year in the siding in preparation for the work in madison and the time of her adventure with the world was near  carl came to be a disturbing force during those last few weeks he had been a factor in all of the days of her life almost without thought on her part she had relied upon him she had run to him for any sort of material help precisely as to a brother and now he was a man and would not be easily set aside  he generally drove her to meeting on sunday and they loitered on the shady stretches of the coulé roads he generally put his arm around her and she permitted it because it was the way all the young fellows did but she really never considered him in the light of a possible husband  most of the girls were precocious in the direction of marriage and brought all their little allurements to bear with the same object in view which directs the coquetry of a city belle at sixteen they had beaux at seventeen many of them actually married and at eighteen they might often be seen riding to town with their husbands covered with dust clasping wailing babes in their arms at twenty they were often thin and bent in the shoulders and flat and stiff in the hips sallow and querulous wives of slovenly careless husbands  rose did not hold that carl had any claim upon her the incidents of two years before were lived down both by herself and carl for as manhood and womanhood came to them they put away all that which they had done in the thoughtlessness of childhood to rose it was an unpleasant memory because associated with her fathers grief she supposed carl to feel in the same way about it and so no allusion to it was ever made by any one  but carl was grown to be a great stalwart young fellow with the blood and sinew of a man and the passions of a man were developing in his rather thick head the arm which he laid along the buggy seat was less passive and respectful of late it clutched in upon her at times though she shook herself angrily each time he merely laughed  so matters stood when she told him she was going away to school in madison  that so he said and not much else till the next sunday with all the week to think about it in he began to ask himself in current slang where do i come in  so the next time they drove together he tried again to tighten his arm about her while he said  ill miss you rosie  soll pap she said  there was a long pause then he said whats the use o going away anyhow i thought you an me was goin to be married when we grew up  she shook herself free we aint grown up yet  i guess we wont never get our growth then he said with a chuckle you dont need that extra schoolin any moren i do  they rode in silence down the beautiful valley with the charm of early autumn lying over it  you mustnt go and forget me off there in madison he said giving her a squeeze  carl you stop that you mustnt do that ill jump out o the buggy if you do that again  there was genuine anger in her voice  why its all right rosie aint we engaged  no were not and we never will be either  there was a note in her voice that struck through even carls thick thought he did not reply but continued to dwell upon that reply until its entire meaning came to him then his face became pitiful to see it was usually round and red but now it looked long and heavy and bitter he was so infertile of phrases he could only say  then we might as well drive right back home  well you made me say it she went on in a softer tone being much moved by the change in his face i like you carl but im not agoin to promise anything ill see when i come back after i graduate  they drove on she was not much more of a talker than he and so they rode in silence that was sullen on carls part at the gate she relented a little wont you come in carl  no i guess not he said shortly and drove off  after she went in the house she felt more and more the injustice of her anger if he hadnt pinched me like that she said to herself  she went to work at her packing again putting in things she would not possibly have any use for as she worked the ache and weariness at her heart increased and when they called her to supper the tears were falling again like a shower it was a silent and miserable meal though the doors and windows were open and the pleasant sounds of the farmyard came in and the red light of the setting sun shone in magically warm and mellow  john ate slowly his eyes fixed on his plate rose ate not at all and looked out of the window with big tears rolling childishly down her cheeks she didnt want to go at all now her home seemed all at once so comfortable and happy and safe  john looked up and saw her tears and immediately he was choked and could not eat  there there rosie dont cry well be all right and youll be back almost fore you know it june comes early in the summer you know they were both so childlike they did not consider it possible to come home before the year was up she came around and knelt down by his side and buried her face on his knees  i wish i hadnt promised to go she wailed i dont want to go one bit i want to stay with you  he understood her feeling and soothed her and diverted her though tears would have been a relief to him  she went with him out to the barn and she cried over the bossies and the horses and said goodby to them under her breath so that her father might not hear  when she went to bed she lay down disconsolate and miserable o it was so hard to go and it was hard not to go life was not so simple as it had seemed before why did this great fear rise up in her heart why should she have this terrible revulsion at the last moment so she thought and thought her only stay in the midst of chaos was dr thatcher william de lisle was very far away like a cold white star  just as she made up her mind that she could not sleep she heard her father call her  rose time to get up  her heart contracted with a sharp spasm that almost made her scream the time had come for actionmomentous irrevocable action like napoleons embarking from elba for france  it was very chill and dark she rose and groped about for a light her teeth chattered with cold and it seemed to her she was going to be sick she dressed hurriedly and went down  john and her aunt were seated at breakfast she slipped into her seat white and silent it was still dark and the lighted lamps made it seem like a midnight meal  john was strenuously cheerful we have to get up early if we get that seven oclock train he said  better take some coffee anyhow urged mrs diehl  o i cant eat a thing rose insisted  dont worry her sis interposed john shell feel like it later  while john went to get the team rose got on her things and walked about uttering a little moaning sound like a babe in delirium it was terrible to hear her and mrs diehl lost patience at last  stop that fuss good land anybodyd think you was goin to die dead as a hammer the way you take on and after all the time weve had gettin you ready i declare to goodness i never see such a youngun in all my born days i will be glad to get rid of you  this was good strong medicine to rose and she uttered no more of her grief she punished her aunt by refusing to say goodbye at the door which grieved john very much  you folks had a tiff this morning aready  it was cold and damp the wind pushed against their faces like the touch of wet palms the horses splashed along in pools of water and out of the dim light the hills rose against the sky full of soft sprawling rainclouds  they rode in silence rose saw no more of the splendid visions of the world it was all dark and rainy ahead home and peace and comfort were all behind her she was so miserable it seemed as if she must cry out but her aunts contemptuous words helped her to silence  john talked a little about the trains on the road and the weather but talk was an effort to him also as he rode he thought of it all again he felt as if he were losing his heart but he did not waver  he helped her on the cars and then stooped and hugged her hard without kissing her and so stumbled out again while she sat white and rigid breathing hard  the sun came out after a little and covered the earth with a glory that found its way into the girls heart she ceased to sob and the ache passed out of her throat although the shadow still hung in her eyes  the car interested her it seemed a palace and of enormous size she figured out the number of people it would hold and wondered how the seats which were turned the other way came to be so the car was mainly occupied by men in careless clothing everybody seemed sleepy and unkempt she wondered where they all came from and so speculating she lost something of her poignant sorrow  then came one moment of quiet elation she was going out into the world the enormous the incredible had happened she was going to madison the state capital the speed of the train which seemed to her very great aided her to realize how swiftly she was getting into the world the fields and farms whirled by in dizzying fashion and the whistle of the engine was like the furious defiant neigh of a rushing horse it was all on a scale more splendid than her dreams  in the midst of her exultant moment the brakeman came through and eyed her with the glare of a sexmaniac she felt as if a hot iron had touched her flesh and she shrank back into herself like a scared mollusk the man passed on but her exultation was gone  she noticed that the hills grew lower as they sped southward and queer rocks rose squarely out of the flat lands which were covered with wild swamps of small trees out of which long skeletons of dead pines lifted with a desolate effect  there were several tunnels and every time they went through one rose clung to the seat in terror some young men in the rear of the car smacked their lips to represent kisses and laughed boisterously afterward as if that were a very good joke indeed  the conductor when he came through the next time eyed her closely and smiled broadly she did not understand why he should smile at her after he had been through the car several times he came and sat down by her  nice day aint it live in madison  no sir she replied looking away she did not want to say more but some power made her add i am going to school there  he seemed pleased  ah hah going to the university  yes sir  o i see he put his knee against the back of the seat in front of her and took an easy position  its a nice town wish i could stop off and help you find a boardingplace  the brakeman coming through winked at the conductor as if to say i like your mash and the terror and shame of her position flashed over rose flushing her from head to foot her eyes filled with angry tears and she looked out of the window not knowing what to do she was so helpless here for she was out in the world alone  the conductor went on serenely knowing well how scared and angry she was  yes sir its a fine little town great place for boating summer or winter youll see a hundred iceboats out on monona there all at once ive got a cousin there who has a boat hed be glad to take you out if id tell him about you  i dont want to know him she said in what she intended to be a fierce tone but which was a pitifully scared tone  the conductor saw the brakeman looking at him and in order to convey the impression that he was getting on nicely he bent forward and looked around into her face  o youd like him first rate  rose would have screamed or burst out into some wild action had not the engine whistled this gave the conductor an excuse to give the talk up for the moment  shes a daisy and as green as grass he said to the brakeman her innocence seemed to place her in his hand  for the next hour they persecuted the girl with their low presences first one and then the other came along the aisle and sat down beside her and when she put her valise there blocking the seat the brakeman sat on the armrest and tormented her with questions to which she gave no answer  just after pine city she heard a cool firm womans voice ask may i sit with you  she looked up and made room for a handsome middleaged woman in a neat traveling dress  its a shame she said ive just got in but i saw at once how those men were torturing you strange no one in the car could see it and take your part  rose turned to her gratefully and laid her head on the ladys stalwart shoulder  there there no harm done you must learn to expect such things from some men it would be libelous on the brutes to call them beasts she said a great many things which rose hardly understood but her presence was strong and helpful rose liked her very much  how far are you going  rose told her in a few words  ah are you you could not have made a better choice who sends you therepardon me  dr thatcher  dr thatcher well well how things come about i know the doctor very well  do you im going to live there for a while  rose was smiling now  well you couldnt be more fortunate youll get into the most progressive home in the city  from this on they had a royal good time rose grew happier than she had been for weeks there was something strangely masterful about this woman in spite of her sweet smile and soft gray eyes  when the conductor came down the aisle again she met his eye with a keen stern glance  young man i shall have you discharged from this road  the astonished cur took her card and when he read the name of a famous woman lawyer of milwaukee his face fell  i didnt mean any harm  i know better i shall see mr millet and see that he makes an example of you  rose was awed by her calm and commanding voice  it has been our boast that our girls could travel from east to west in our broad land and be safe from insult and im not going to let such a thing pass  she returned to her grave sweet mood presently and began to talk of other things  as they neared the town where they were to part company the elder woman said  now my dear i am to get off here i may never see you again but i think i shall you interest me very much i am likely to be in madison during the year and if i do i will see you i am getting old though and things of this life are uncertain to us with gray hair i like that forehead on you it tells me you are not to be a victim to the first man who lays his hand on you let me give one last word of advice dont marry till you are thirty choose a profession and work for it marry only when you want to be a mother  she rose you dont understand what i mean now but keep my words in your mind some day you will comprehend all i meangoodbye rose was tearful as mrs spencer kissed her and moved away  rose saw her on the steps and waved her hand back at her as the train drew away her presence had been oppressive in spite of her kindness and her last words filled the girls mind with vague doubts of life and of men everything seemed forcing her thoughts of marriage to definiteness her sex was so emphasized so insisted upon by this first days experience in the world that she leaned her head against the window and cried out o i wish i was dead  but the train shot round the low green hills fringed with the glorious foliage of the maples the lake sparkled in the afternoons sun the dome of the capitol building loomed against the sky and the romance and terror of her entry into the world came back to her driving out her more morbid emotions she became again the healthy country girl to whom madison was a center of art and society and literature     chapter ix  rose enters madison   the train drew up to a long platform swarming with people moving anxiously about with valises in hand broadhatted and kindly many of them were like the people of the coulé but the young hackmen terrified her with their hard bold eyes and cruel tobaccostained mouths  she alighted from the car white and tremulous with fear and her eyes moved about anxiously when they fell upon thatcher the blood gushed up over her face and her eyes filled with tears of relief  ah here you are he said with a smile as he shook her hand and took her valise i began to fear youd been delayed  she followed him to the carriage with downcast eyes her regard for him would not permit her to say a word even when they were seated together in the carriage and driving up the street her breath came so quick and strange the doctor noticed it  a little bit excited about it arent you he smilingly said i remember how i felt when i went to chicago the first time i suppose this seems like chicago to you how did you leave the people in the coulé all well  yes sir she replied without looking up  well now you are about to begin work ive got everything all arranged you are to stay with us for the present at least my niece is with us and you will get along famously i know how do you like my horse he asked in his effort to get her to speak  she studied the horse critically  first rate she said at last  he laughed well i am glad you like him for i know you are a judge he is a pretty good stepper too though he hasnt quite enough fling in his knees you notice ill let you drive him some time  he drew up before a pretty cottage set in the midst of a neat lawn it was discouragingly fine and handsome to the girl she was afraid it was too good for her to enter  a very blonde young girl came dancing out to the block  o uncle joe did rose rose suddenly appeared  this is rose rose this is our little chatterbox  now uncle joe come right in rose im going to call you rose maynt i  mrs thatcher a tall thin woman welcomed rose in sober fashion and led the way into the little parlor which seemed incredibly elegant to the shy girl  she sat silently while the rest moved about her there was a certain dignity in this reserve and both mrs thatcher and josie were impressed by it she was larger and handsomer than either of them and that gave her an advantage though she did not realize that she was comparing in swift disparaging fashion her heavy boots with their dainty soft shoes and wondering what she could do to escape from them  josie take her right up to her room said mrs thatcher and let her get ready for dinner  yes come up you must feel like a good scrub  rose flushed again wondering if her face had grown grimy enough to be noticeable  the young girl led rose into a pretty room with light green walls and lovely curtains at the windows there were two dainty little beds occupying opposite corners  were to occupy this room together said josie this is my dressing case and thats yours  rose saw at once josie had given her the best one josie bustled about helping her lay off her things pouring water for her and talking on with gleeful flow  im awful glad youve come i know well be just as thick i wish you were in my classes though but you wont be so doctor says dont you think this is a nice room  rose washed her hands as quickly as possible because they looked so big and dingy beside the supple whiteness of josephines she felt dusty and coarse and hopeless in the midst of this exquisite room the most beautiful room she had ever seen  her eyes moving about fell upon a picture which had the gleam of white limbs in it josephine followed her look o thats young samson choking the lion i just love that isnt he lovely  rose blushed and tried to answer but could not the beautiful splendid limbs of the young man flamed upon her with marvelous appeal it was beautiful and yet her training made her think it somehow not to be talked about  josephine led the way downstairs into the little parlor which was quite as uncomfortably beautiful as the bedroom the vases and flowers and simple pictures and the piano all seemed like the furnishings of the homes she had read about in stories  but dazed as she was she kept her selfcommand at least she kept silence and sat in sombre almost sullen dejection amid it all mrs thatcher hardly knew what to think of her but the doctor comprehended her mood better for he had passed through such experiences himself he talked to her for a few minutes about her plans and then they went out to dinner  rose entered the diningroom with a great fear in her heart she longed to run away and hide  o i dont know anything was the bitter cry welling up in her throat again and again and she nearly cried out upon the impulse  the doctor liked to have his dinner at one and so rose found two knives and two forks at her plate and two spoons also she had read in stories of banquets and she saw that this was to be her greatest trial she sat very stiff and silent as the soup was brought on by the norwegian girl  she took the plate as it was handed her and handed back the one which was turned down with the napkin on top of it the norwegian girl smiled broadly and handed them both back then rose saw her mistake and the hot blood swept over her brown face in a purple wave  the doctor and his wife passed it in silence josie fortunately was talking to the cat and did not see it  rose could hardly touch her soup which was delicious her whole mind was filled with a desire to escape as soon as possible  which of the knives should she use first and what was the extra little plate for were the disturbing questions she could use a fork but she was afraid of betraying herself in the minutiæ of the service as a matter of fact she got along very well but of that she had no knowledge  some way she lived through the dainty dinner scarcely tasting anything of it at the close of it mrs thatcher said  wouldnt you like to lie down for a little while arent you tired rose hardly knew what weariness was but she assented because she wished to be alone  ill call you at three may i asked josie who was wildly in love with rose already  o isnt she big and splendid but shes queer she said when she came down  thatll wear off said the doctor she feels a little strange now i know all about it i went from a farm to the city  rose hardly dared lie down on the spotless bed a latent good taste in her enabled her to see in every detail harmony of effect and herself as the one discordant note in the house o how dirty and rough and awkward she was  looking out of the window she saw a couple of ladies come out of a large house opposite and walk down toward a carriage which waited at the gate the ladies held their dresses with a dainty action of their gloved hands as they stood for a moment in consultation how graceful their hats were then they entered the carriage  as they gathered their soft dresses about their limbs and stooped to enter the door the flexile line of waist and hip and thigh came out beautifully modestly  they were a revelation of elegance and grace to the farmers daughter their gaiters were of the same color as their dresses this was most wonderful of all such unity and completeness of attire was unknown to her before she looked down at her red dress which mattie teel had cut out for her and she saw it in all its deformity the sleeves didnt fit like josies did it didnt hang right it just wrinkled all around her waist and hung in bunches and she knew it and her hat made over from her last winters hat was awful  she might just as well die or go back home and never go out of the coulé again she was nothing but a great country gawk anyway  in this bitter fashion she raged on lying face downward on the sofa she lay there until she heard dancing steps and josie called out may i come in  yes said rose coldly  o youve been having a good cry i know i just like to go off and have a good cry that way it makes your eyes red but you can fix that just sit still now and let me see what i can do  she bustled about and rose let her bathe her face with cool water and cologne and fuss about her little fingers were like a babys and she murmured and gurgled in the goodness of her heart like a kitten rose actually fell asleep under her touch  josie stopped astonished and startled for a moment and then tiptoed out of the room like a burglar and told mrs thatcher all about it  and o auntie shes very poor isnt she her clothes  tut warned mrs thatcher you must be careful not to notice that edward is she so very poor  the doctor seated at his desk in the little office looked up a moment  no i dont think so it is lack of judgment partially a little tact and taste will fix her all right dutcher is fairly welltodo and she is all he has he wrote me to get her what she needed but ill leave that to you girls  josie danced with delight buying things for yourself was fun but buying for another was ecstasy  the poor child hasnt a dress that she can wear without alteration and she is such a splendid creature too i cant conceive how they failed to fit her  it seems to me that putting her beside josie is pretty hard on her i am afraid you are not conversant with the wardrobe of farmers girls  well i didnt supposeand the other room is so small  o well it all depends upon josie josie come here  the girl rose up and he put his arm around her  now my kitten you must be very careful not to allude to any little mistakes rose makes  o uncle edyou know  yes i know chatterboxes mean all right but they forget now rose is going to be a great scholar and she is going to be a lady very quick too but she is awkward now and my little girl mustnt make it hard for her  after josie went out thatcher said  i know just how the girl feels i went through it myself its hard but it wont hurt her only dont try to talk it over with her if shes the girl i think she is shell work the whole matter out in a week herself more than that let me talk to her myself if shes rested ask her to come down  rose came into the doctors office in a numb sort of timidity for there was a great change in the doctor he was hardly the same man who had eaten at their table she couldnt describe it but there was something in his voice which awed her he sat now surrounded by his professional books and tools which gave him dignity in her eyes  sit down rose he said i want to talk with you ive had a letter from your father about you and your expenses  and then in some way she never knew exactly how he talked away her bitterness and gave her hope and comfort he advised about books and said and youll need some little things which bluff siding doesnt keep mrs thatcher will drive you up town tomorrow and you can get what you need your father has deposited some money here to pay your expenses i am going over to university hill to make a call perhaps youd like to go  she assented and went to get her hat  it was the largest town she had ever seen and the capitol was wonderful to her set in its park where squirrels ran about on the velvet green of the grass the building towered up in the sky just as she had seen it in pictures swarms of people came and went along the hard blueblack paths and round it the teams moved before the stores of the square it was all mightily impressive to her  they passed the public library and the doctor said  youll make great use of that i imagine  she could not make herself believe that she saw students coming and going on the street and they all seemed so gay and well dressed  all this will trouble you for a little while the doctor said when i came to the university the first time i seemed like a cat in a bath tub i thought everybody was laughing at me but as a matter of fact nobody paid any attention to me at all then i got mad and i said well ill make you pay attention to me before im done the doctor smiled at her and she had the courage to smile back it was wonderful how well he understood her  he drove her around the lake drive it was beautiful but in her depression the more beautiful anything was the more it depressed her the doctor did not demand speech of her well knowing she did not care to talk  im not mistaken in the girl he said to his wife when they were alone she has immense reserve forcei feel it wait until she straightens up and broadens out a little youll see theres some halfsavage power in her magnetism impelling quality i predict a great future for her if  if what  if she dont marry she is passionate willful as a colt it seems impossible she has come thus far without entanglement shes going to be very handsome when she gets a little more at ease i thought her a wonderful creature as she sat in that schoolroom with the yellow sun striking across her head she appeared to me to have destiny in her favor  shes fine but i think youre overenthusiastic edward  wait and see she isnt a chatterbox like josie that is evident  in fact my dear he went on to say after a silence i should like to adopt heri mean of course take a particular interest in her she has appealed to me very strongly from the first you can be a mother to josie and ill be a father to rose  there was something sombre under his smiling utterance of these words their eyes did not meet and there was a silence at last the doctor said  the girls physical perfection is wonderful most farmers girls are round in the shoulders and flat in the hips but rose has grown up like a young colt add culture and ease to her and shell mow a wide swath largely without knowing it for the girl is incapable of vanity  the wife listened with a brooding face roses splendid prophecy of maternity oppressed her some way  when the girls went up to bed terror and homesickness and depression all came back upon rose again she sat down desolately upon the little creamandgold chair and watched josie as she pattered about taking down her hair and arranging it for the night she could not help seeing the multitude of bottles and little combs and powder puffs and boxes and brushes which josie gloated over seeing that rose was interested  they were presents she said and named the givers of each it was a revelation to rose of the elegancies of a dainty finicky girls toilet she thought of the ragged washbrush and woodenbacked hairbrush and horn comb which made up her own toilet set and grew hot and cold  josephine was delighted to have some one sit and stare in that admiring way at her therefore she displayed all her paces she brushed her hair out with her ivorybacked brush and laid out all her beautiful underwear trimmed with lace and embroidered in silk she did it without malice but rose thought of her worn cotton things shapeless and ugly she never could undress before josephine in the world  she delayed and delayed until josie had cuddled down into her bed with her little pink nose sticking out and her merry eyes blinking like the gaze of a kitten rose waited hoping those bright eyes would close but they would not at last a desperate idea came to her she sprang up and went to the gaslight  how do you put this out she asked  josie gurgled with laughter just turn that thingamabob underneath yes thatturn it quickthats right o aint it dark but you aint undressed yet and the matches are out in the bathroom  rose was more at her ease in the dark  never mind i can undress in the dark im used to it she loosened the collar of her dress slipped off her shoes and lay down on the bed bitter and rebellious  when josie awoke in the morning the country girl was awake and fully dressed and reading a book by the window  the wrinkly red dress could not utterly break up the fine lines of her firm bust and powerful side and thigh and the admiring little creature hopped out of bed and stole across the room and threw her arms about rose  how big and beautiful you are  these wonderful words ran into the country girls blood like hot scented wine to be beautiful made some amends for being coarse and uncultured as she had never felt abasement before so she had never felt the need of being beautiful until now  she turned a radiant tearful face to josie and seized her hands  ii like youo so much  i knew wed be friends cried the little one dancing about and youll let me go and help you buy your things wont you  o ill be glad to have youim such a fool i dont know anything at all that i ought to know  youre just splendid im the one who dont know anything  then they entered upon a day of shopping they toiled like ants and buzzed like bees  rose came home at night worn out discouraged and dumb as an indian she had submitted to her fate but she was mentally sore lame and confused she no longer cared whether josie saw her poverty or not and she went to sleep out of utter fatigue her eyes wet with tears of homesickness all she hoped for seemed impossible and of no account and sleep in her own attic bed appeared to be the sweetest thing in the world  her good vigorous blood built up her courage during the night but she was hardly a sweet and lovable companion in the days which followed she temporarily hated josie and feared mrs thatcher thatcher himself however was her savior for she would surely have gone home had it not been for him  she had a notable setto with the dressmaker  i wont come here again she said sullenly i dont want any dresses im going home im tired of being pulled and hauled  the dressmaker was a brisk little alsatian with something of the french adroitness in her manner  o my dear young friend if you only knew i am in despair you have such a beautiful figure you would give me such pleasure if i might but finish this lovely gown  rose looked at her from under a scowling prominent forehead she had never been called beautiful before at least not by one who was disinterested or a stranger and she did not believe the woman  the dressmaker passed her hands caressingly over the girls splendid bust and side  ah i can make myself famous if i may but fit those lines  rose softened and put on the gown once more and silently permitted herself to be turned and turned about like a tin sign while the little artist which she was went about with a mouth full of pins gurgling murmuring and patting this was the worst of the worry and the end of all the shopping was in sight  the touch of soft flannels upon her flesh the flow of ample and graceful gowns helped her at once her shoulders lifted and her bust expanded under properly cut and fitted garments quickly unconsciously she became herself again moving with large unfettered movements she dominated her clothing and yet her clothing helped her being fit to be seen she was not so much troubled by the faces of people who studied her  it was wonderful to see how she took on in the first few weeks the graces and refinements of her new life she met her schoolmates each day with added ease and came at last to be a leader among them just as in the home coulé her strength and grace and mastery they felt at once  her heart beat very hard and fast on the first day as she joined the stream of students moving toward the central hall the maple trees were still in full leaf and blazing color the sunlight was a magical cataract of etherealized gold and the clouds were too beautiful to look at without a choking in the throat  as she stepped over the deeplyworn stone sill she thought of the thousands of other country girls whose feet had helped to wear that hollow and her heart ached with unaccountable emotion  above her noisy feet clattered and bounded on the winding stairway and careless voices resounded she climbed in silence in such wise she began to climb the way of knowledge the way which has no returning footsteps and which becomes ever more lonely as the climber rises     chapter x  quiet years of growth   outwardly her days were uneventful she came and went quietly and answered her teachers with certainty and precision she was not communicative to her companions and came to know but few of them during the first term she watched the trees go sere and bare and calculated on the progress of the farmwork she wondered if the men were in the corn yet or whether it were too cold a morning to plow she studied the sky to see if there were signs of snow she could not at once throw off her daily supervision of the weather and of farmwork  her father wrote only at long intervals his chapped and stiffened hands managed the penstock but painfully he wrote of the farm affairs the yield of corn the weight of the steers or hogs he had sold and asked her how many turkeys he had best keep over  carl wrote once or twice and stopped he was a still more reluctant correspondent carl meant little to her now the doctors dominion was absolute and yet there was a subtle change she no longer blushed in his presence and he seemed older and nearer to her more like an uncle and adviser the figure he had been took its place beside that of william de lisle more substantial but less sweet and mythical  her school life was not her entire intellectual life by any means she had the power of absorbing and making use of every sight and sound about her she saw a graceful action at table or in the drawing room and her mind seized upon it and incorporated it she did not imitate she took something from every one but from no one too much  her eyes lost their round nervous stare but they searched searched constantly as was natural for a girl of her years and fine animal nature but there was brain back of it all the young men knew nothing of her searching eyes indeed they thought her cold and a little contemptuous of them  meanwhile their elegance often alienated them from her there were many types not far removed from carl and henry farmers boys with some touch of refinement and grace but others had a subtle quality which told of homes of refinement and luxury  two wonderful things had come to her one was the knowledge that she was beautiful which she came to understand was the burning desire of all women and again that she was master of things which had scared her she could wear lovely dresses unconsciously and sit at table with ease and walk before her classmates without tremor she felt power in her heart as well as in her fist  her winter was a quiet one she came and went between her classes and her home at dr thatchers she studied in her own room or recited to the doctor when he was at leisure he liked to have the girls come into his study when he was not too busy and there he sat figuring on the probable effect of cocaine or atropine in a certain case while the girls read or talked  those were wonderful hours to the country girl she was a long way from the little cottage on the old coulé farm at such times dr thatcher felt the same beauty and power in the droop of the head which had attracted him first in the old schoolhouse only enriched and in nobler colorings here  they went sleighing together with shouting and laughter as if the doctor were a girl too they went skating and once in awhile to some entertainment at the church they were not theatregoing people and the lectures and socials of the town and college made up their outings it was the doctors merry interest in their doings which made young men so unnecessary to rose as well as to josephine  then came spring again the southwest wind awoke snow began to go the grass showed here and there and roses thoughts turned back toward the coulé there were days when every drop of her blood called out for the hills and the country roads the bleat of lambs the odor of fields and the hum of bees but she kept on at work  something elemental stirred in her blood as the leaves came out the young men took on added grace and power in her eyes when they came before her in their athletic suits lithe cleanlimbed joyous then her eyes dreamed and her heart beat till the blood choked her breathing  o the beautiful sky o the shine and shade of leaves o the splendor of young manhood she fought down the dizziness which came to her she smiled mechanically as they stood before her with frank clean eyes and laughing lips and so slowly brain reasserted itself over flesh and she too grew frank and gay  then came the vacation the partings the bitter pain of leaving the young people she had learned to love and too came the thought of home the dear old coulé with its peaks and camel humps and pappa john he was waiting to see her there  so the pain of leaving her mates was mingled with the joy of homecoming she romped on the grass with the young lambs she followed pappa john about as of old in the fields while he wondered and marveled at her she was so fine and white and ladylike  she was fain to know all the news of the farm and the neighborhood she felt like kissing all the dear old ladies in the coulé o the old friends were the best after all you could rest on them they didnt care how you ate soup they didnt keep you keyed up to company manners all the time  she went back to her old dresses and cotton underwear and went dirty as she liked and got brown and ironmuscled again  carl met her on the road one day and bowed and drove on with hurried action of the lines he still bore her rejection of him fresh in mind it is everlastingly to his credit let it be said now that he never made use of his youthful intimacy with her he was a man with all the honesty and sincerity and chivalry of a race of gentlemen in his head slowwitted as he was     chapter xi  study of the stars   she came back each september with delight and exultation it was not so much like going to the worlds end now and besides her father seemed resigned to it back to the gleam of the lakes the flaming sunsets the moonlit nights filled with twang of guitars and floating harmony of fresh boyish voices back to her girllovers and her books back to the chalky odor of the recitation room  it was so sweet to climb the circular stairway again the booming roar of the feet did not disturb her now the greetings of the professors as they passed made her eyes dim with pleasure the spirit of the university had established dominion over her  these were days without care days of silent pleasant growth a year of sweet gravity over books and wholesome laughter over games she studied hard but it was a quiet pleasure to study for she had the power of concentration which gives mastery  she was never behind never fagged out with study she had time for the splendor of nature and for the world of books she read more and more each year because she felt lacking in literary knowledge she read the books she ought to knowread them religiously occasionally it chanced the books were those she loved to read but not often generally she had to bend to them as if they were lessons  she read also scott dickens and thackeray a volume or two each then one day in midwinter it chanced she fell upon mosses from an old manse and then all the other books waited she read it while she walked home from the library she read it after dinner and put it in her satchel as she went to recite she finished it and secured the second volume then came twice told tales then the scarlet letter and the world of womans sin opened to her  she read that terrible book rebelling against the dark picture raging against the insatiable vengeance of the populace who condemned hester as if she had opened the gates of hell in the path of every daughter of new england  she could not understand then nor thereafter the ferocity of hate which went out against the poor defenseless woman what had the woman done she struggled over the problem she felt in herself that terrible ceaseless urging her thoughts were not clear they were still only raised figures in the web of organic thought but she was accomplishing great conceptions  she knew it was wrong but why it was wrong troubled her the lawyes but what lay behind the law the mormon had one law the turks another why was this english law better than any other why were the animals freer than men their lives were good and healthy they lived in the sunshine and were untroubled such were a few of the questions she grappled with  god only knows the temptations which came to her she had days when all the socalled unclean things she had ever seen all the overheard words of mens coarse jests came back like vultures to trouble her sometimes when she walked forth of a morning the sun flamed across the grass with ineffable beauty the whole earth was radiant every sound was a song every lithe youth moved like a god before her and it was then that something deep in her something drawn from generations of virtuous wives and mothers saved her from the whirlpool of passion  at such times she felt dimly the enormous difference between her nature and that of josephine josephines passion was that of a childhers that of an imaginative and complex man  she was silent after these days of gayety she was not a chatterer at any time but after these moods she was almost sullen once more and she fell upon her lessons with renewed zeal as a monk flagellates his rebellious flesh  after these days of searching eyes she refused to look at any of her young male friends she answered them crustily and turned away from them but this did not serve to cure her nor to keep the young men away  always at such times william de lisles glorious presence drew near in the dusk insubstantial and luminous as a cloud and she set her teeth in fresh resolve to be wise and famous to be worthy his look and his word of praise  she had suitors constantly her dark haughty face warm with blood her erect and powerful figure excited admiration among the young men and they courted her with the wholesome frankness of clean and vigorous manhood the free and natural intercourse of the college kept the young people healthy as a home circle  as the doctor came to take a different place in her love rose became open to the advances of other men twice during the winter she felt the power of love touch her in the first instance her eyes sought and found among her classmates a young mans physical beauty and her imagination clothed him with power and mystery and she looked for him each day and life was less interesting and purposeful when he was not present  she made no open advances she scarcely needed to for he also saw and when he came to her and she flushed and trembled with weakness it seemed as if her life had at last taken a fixed direction for a few weeks the man was her ideal she saw him before her constantly she knew his smile the lift of his eyebrows the shape of his ears the slope of his shoulders the sound of his voice she looked at him stealthily from her book she contrived to sit where she could watch every motion she walked down the street with him each day half numb with her emotion  but this ecstasy did not last she felt eventually his shallowness and narrowness he was vain and ungenerous he grew sere and bare of grace and charm like the autumn elms and at last he stood empty and characterless before her and her eyes looked over and beyond him into the blue sky again and throughout it all she kept her place in her classes and no one was aware of her new ideal  when she turned away from him he did not grow pale and lean he grew a little vicious and said she is too cold and proud for my taste  her next suitor was a worthy young man who was studying law in the town a fine clean young fellow who paid court to her with masterly address he was older than she and was a better scholar and brought to her less of the clotheshorse and more of the man than her freshly outgrown lover before spring began he had won great intimacy with heralmost an engagement  he was adroit he did not see her too much and he came always at his best he appealed to the most imaginative side of her nature she glorified his calling as well as his person he was less handsome than his predecessor but he brought an ample and flowing phraseology and a critical knowledge of farmlife as well as of townlife once he took her to the courtroom to hear him plead  he took her to the socials and once to the theater there was his mistake the play made a most powerful impression upon her more powerful than anything since the circus at tyre  it raised new and wordless ambitions for the first time in her life she saw society dress on the stage the play was one which pretended at least to show new york and london life therefore men in clawhammer coats came and went with strange accents and with cabalistic motions of hats and gloves and women moved about with mystic swagger  the heroine glowed like a precious stone in each act now sapphire now pearl now ruby she spoke in a thick throaty murmur and her white shoulders shone like silver and her wide childish eyes were like wells of lightdiffusing liquid  rose gazed at her with unwearying eyes her bosom rose and fell as if she had been running and she said in her heart i can do that i could stand there and do that  then the theme of the play filled her with strange new thoughts these people lived out before her a condition which she had read about but which had never been discussed in her presence a husband discovers his wife to have been a lover and mother in her girlhood and in a tempest of selfrighteous passion flings her to the ground in scorn and horror  she clings to his feet in approved stage fashion pleading for mercy i was so young  he would not listen goor no stayi will go i make the home over to you but never look upon my face again  while rose burned with shame and indignation the outraged woman on the stage grew white and stern  who are you to condemn me so she asked in icy calm are you the saint you profess to be will one offence contain your crime against me  what do you mean thundered the man and husband  you know what i mean in my weakness i was stained ineffaceably i admit itbut you in your strength have you not preyed upon weak women the law allows you to escape disgracenature and law force me to suffer with mine  rose thought of carl and his courtship with such a shudder as one feels in remembering a rescue from an abyss a hundred great confusing questions floated by in her mind like clouds in a mist of rainformless vast trailing deeper shadow beneath them the selfsufficient young lawyer beside her said as the curtain fell  there was nothing else for her husband to do but just fire her out  rose heard him but did not reply she felt a sharp revulsion of feeling toward him for his coarse hard tone when he laid his hand on her she shook it off and when he asked a question of her she did not reply he was annoyed also and so they waited for the curtain to rise on the final act  the wife was sick and dying the dramatist had not the courage to work out his theme he killed the wife so that the husband should not appear to condone and take her to wife again she died while he magnanimously forgave her                                       as they walked home with fatuous insistence her lover talked with rose about the case he took the mans side he hinted at the reasonpresuming upon their intimacy men outgrow such experiences he said women do not they are either one thing or the othereither pure as angels or black as devils  rose closed her lips tight and her eyes flamed with indignant protest but she said nothing in reply in her heart she knew it was a lie a woman can set her foot above her dead self as well as a man  when he tried to kiss her goodbye she pushed him aside and left him without a word he too was a bare and broken ideal her heart went back again to william de lisle as the young eagle goes back to the sunwarmed cliff to rest and dream with eyes to the sun  that night put her girlhood far from her she grew five years older in the weeks which followed her mind took up irresistibly one insoluble problem after another and wrestled with it in silence josies chatter went on around her like the sound of the swallows in the eaves of the old barn at home  her mind was like a piece of inconceivably intricate machinery full of latent and complicated motion a word a touch and it set to work and out of its working some fine inner heat and glow changed the whole mental and physical equilibrium of her nature and she became something else finer more mysterious and more alluringthough this she did not realize  thereafter the young man of her acquaintance did not draw her her eyes had been raised to higher altitudes she fell upon her books with terrible industry in the hope that they would throw some light on her problems and ambitions  there was nothing she did not think of during these characterforming days the beauty and peace of love the physical joy of it the problem of marriage the terror of birthall the things girls are supposed not to think of and which such girls as rose must irresistibly think of came to her tormenting her shaking her to the inmost center of her nature and through it all she seemed quite the hearty young school girl she was for this thought was wholesome and natural not morbid in any degree  she was a child in the presence of the doctor but a woman with her suitors the doctor helped her very much but in the most trying moments of her life and no man can realize these moments some hidden force rose up to dominate the merely animal forces within some organic magnificent inheritance of moral purity  she was saved by forces within not by laws without opportunities to sin always offer in every life virtue is not negative it is positive it is a decoration won by fighting resisting this sweet and terrible attraction of men and women towards each other is as natural and as moral as the law of gravity and as inexorable its perversion produces trouble love must be good and fine and according to nature else why did it give such joy and beauty  natural as was this thought she hid it from her associates most women die with it unacknowledged even to their own spoken thought she would have been helped by talk with the doctor or at least with his wife but there was a growing barrier between mrs thatcher and herself and the doctor did not seem the same good friend she felt a change coming in the whole household  when she went home at the close of her second year she had a feeling that she would never again return to the old sweet companionship with dr thatcher he was too busy now apparently to give her the time he once seemed so glad to give he never asked her to ride with him now she was troubled by it and concluded they were tired of her and so she too grew cold and reserved                                       the day she left the doctor after he had driven rose to the train called his wife into the office  sit down a moment wife i want to talk with you he faced her bravely i guess wed better arrange for rose to go to one of the chapterhouses next year theres no need to beat around the bushshe takes up too much of my thought and you know it and i know it  it drew blood to say that it took manhood to look his wife in the eyes then but he did it  it isnt her fault and it isnt yoursit isnt mine as a matter of justice rose is just what shes always been a good sweet girli wouldnt have her see anything but friendly interest in my eyes for half my heartim afraid she will soi guess  he was talking through set teeth i wish youd tell her we cant offer her a home i cant do it  he rose and went to his wife my dear dont cryyouve watched this thing come on in brave silencenot every wife would have kept silence so long it wont break up our comradeship will it dear weve jogged along so peacefully these fifteen yearswe ought to overlook a little thing like this he smiled a little then he stooped and put his arm about her  come give me a kiss and lets adopt no more handsome girls till im sixtyfive  she rose and lifted her sad face to his its my fault if i  he kissed her and said no more of that youre my faithful wife what helps the matter materially is thisrose thinks of me as a sober old settler now  this ended it so far as any outward showing ever defined his feeling but the presence of the girl never left him at night as he sat at his desk at the hour which almost always used to bring rose down from her room to discuss her lessons with him he grew sad and lonely if i had a child he said to himself i could bear it more easily  when rose returned she went into one of the cooperative boardinghouses and slowly drifted away from the doctor and his family she never quite knew why it puzzled her for a time and then she forgot itin the fashion of youth     chapter xii  the gates open wide   of what avail the attempt to chronicle those days they were all happy and all busy yet never alike when the sun shone it was beautiful and when the wind roared in the trees and the rain slashed like falling sails it was equally glorious on clear crisp bright winter days the air grew magical with bells and the grating snarl of the iceboats rudder was thrilling as a lions cry it was apart from the world of care and politics and revolution  there was fun whirlwinds of it at the chapterhouse when studies were over and there was fun at the professedlyformal girlbanquets where the chairman arose to say gentlemen the honor and everybody shrieked to see her pull an imaginary chinwhisker there was more fun on winter nights when loads of people packed into the bobtail mulecars which tinkled up the snowy street with wonderful persistency while the passengers trod on each others toes and chaffed the driver and the wonderful nights under the stars walking home with arm fast anchored in a fellows grip or strolls in summer beside the lake or dreamy hours floating at sunset in a boat which lay like a lilys petal where skies of orange and purple met water of russetgold and steelyblue  and there was the glory of mounting also one by one the formidable mesas of calculations conjugations argumentations fell below her feet and rose grew tall in intellectual grace she had no mental timidities truth with her came first or if not first certainly she had little superstitious sentiment to stand in the way she was still the same impatient soul as when she shook her little fist at the almightys lightning  it was this calm subconscious assumption of truths ultimate harmony with natures first cause which she delighted in as she entered physics and astronomy her enthusiasm for the hopeless study of the stars developed into a passion they exalted her and saddened her  she lifted her eyes to them and the ultimate distances of their orbits swept upon her with overwhelming power  she felt again the ache in the heart which came to her as a child on the blufftop when the world seemed spread out before her when she turned her face upward now it was to think of the awful void spaces there of the mysteries of each flaming planet and of the helplessness and weakness of the strongest man  for a year she plunged into astronomy it had the allurement and the sombre aloofness of unrequited love it harmonized well with her restless limitless inner desire  these sudden passions for this or that art were signs of her strength and not her weakness they sprang out of her swift and ready imagination which enabled her to take on the personality of the artist and to feel his joy of power it was quite normal that she should desire to be successively circus rider poet and astronomer and yet now that her graduation was near she was as far from a real decision as ever  what are you going to do after graduation josie said  rose grew grave i dont know go on studying somewhere  im going to have a good time  youre always having a good time you little oriole rose had come to patronize josie in these later days i envy you so she sighed the world is so simple for you  i dont understand you when you go on like thatyoull come tomorrow and see my new dress wont you  graduation meant for josephine the chance to wear a fetching gown and be looked at by an immense crowdand one extra man this was supposed to be a secret but everybody who cared to give it a thought knew of it and smiled at her as they would at a child josie could be nothing else but a child  to most of the students graduation day came rushing with sorrowful speed it meant passing from sunlit lanes of maple and lilac out into the bleak highways of trade and labor it meant the beginning of struggle with pitilessness in man and nature as students they were not in the race for subsistence but as citizens and professional men they were to be competitors in trades and crafts already overflowing  graduation day drew near and a tremulous ecstasy came into the lives of the outgoing studentsa joy made more precious by its certainty of passing  to rose graduation day came as the sweetest saddest day of her life it seemed to close a gate upon something in her history the smiling yet mournful faces of her friends the wistful eyes of the young men who loved her the rustle of leaves the gleam of the water the dapple of light and shade on the campus the exaltation of the public moment all these wondrous things rushed upon her like a flood and overwhelmed her ambitions and desires powerful as they were  at last the books were closed and packed away  the commencement exercises began with the reception in science hall the night fell slowly and the fine new building grew alight story after story and crowds began to stream in the students led the way rakish full of airs except when piloting their parents about the fun had been almost furious all day  there were many of the relatives of the students present and often they stood out in sharp contrast with the decorations and with the joy of the young people beautiful girls might be seen leading bent and wrinkled fathers and mothers who had sacrificed all for them rose wished for her father and passionately desired to do something for him he had written that he couldnt leave the farm and so she wandered about with others like herself free everywhere the young men met her she never escaped them for a moment their pursuit was relentless  the crowd swarmed into each room where the professors stood beside showcases polite and patient exhibiting machines specimens drawings at another place sherbet was served to the guests and music could be heard in the lower halls everywhere was the lisp of feet the ripple of talk  all this was a bore to many of the pupils for there was the peacepipe ceremonial preparing on the campus that they really waited for mysteriously in the deep dusk a huge heap of combustibles had been piled up on the wet grass and one by one the two classes began to gather there was a mutter of voices a command then a red flame flashed out and with it the college yell soared up from a little bunch of dark forms  rahrahrahwisconsin  the stragglers on the walks turned toward the fire like insects they came in crawling dark lines like ants across the wet grass they formed a blueblack mass lighted on one side by the orange light of the bonfire the stars overhead grew green and dim in the light of the fire and the encircling trees of the campus came out like silhouettes of purplegreen cardboard  the class rolled out its carpet for the girls and opened its boxes of long clay pipes it seemed so much more important to rose now that she stood there in the center as one of the graduating class there was not much talk they lined up and sang song after song then the boys moved about and showed the girls how to light their pipes  you want to suck not blow on it a voice called out and everybody laughed dutifully for a few moments all was laughter the girls tried to assume the airs of smokers and puffed their kinnikinnick furiously then as they sang they swung their pipes with rakish airthere is a tavern in our town and the bullfrog in the pool and their voices floated out and up into the wreathing smoke of the fire as deliciously sweet as though their songs were hymns of praise as they were hymns of youth  the pipes needed constant relighting in every silence some girl cried out o my pipes gone out one cried give me a bite as if the pipestem were taffy  to rose the whole ceremony was glorious it carried her out of herself it gave her a glimpse into the world which men keep to themselves and besides she had written the speech handing the pipe down to the custodian of the succeeding class a really admirable ceremony  here on this spot the red men warred and loved here with the sheen of lakes about and the wild grass under their feet it was beautiful and appropriate that they should be remembered by these young western sons and daughters of the white man  the mock antagonism between seniors and juniors seemed to have great meaning when tom harris spoke the lofty phrases she had written for him standing outlined against the soaring fire like a silhouette of velvet his voice rolling out with lofty suspensive power  here on the spot where our fathers have dwelt for countless suns and moons we ask for peace we call upon you to bury the hatchet forgive and forget you who have scars forgive and you who have wrongs forget let all evil spirits be exorcised by the pipe here we break the arrow here we tender the sacred pipe brotherssisters we have spoken  the fire burned low as they sat in circles on the ground and chanted their songs the sky grew blacker the trees melted into the darkness the last wailing cadence floated into silence and then subdued tender they rose and vanished in pairs and groups into the darkness like the songs they sang the class of 189 had entered upon its long long trail some to the plains of failure some to the mountains of victory  this quaint and suggestive custom received new strength from the oration which rose contributed all felt its power and beauty to the girls the whole ceremony was a rare and delicious piece of audacity it did them good it gave them something to look back upon with laughter into which a sigh and a little catching of the breath might also come  something elemental and primitive came to rose amid all the laughter and song what was she more than the swart women who had lived here and been wooed of men was there not something magnificent in their frank following of the trail of pure passion they loved and bore children and ground at the corn mills and died as the female bison died and other women came after them to do like unto them to what end  some such questions vague ever shadowy formless moved rose as she lay down to sleep that night outside a mandolin twangedthe boys were serenading her but she had not the wish to see them she did not go to the window as the other girls did deliciously excited almost hysteric with the daring of being possibly seen in their nightgowns she kept sombre silence stirred by profounder emotions than they were capable of  she thought of william de lisle but seldom now in open daylight she was a little ashamed of her idolatry but on nights like these when love songs and moonlight fused together his figure came before her not so clear a personality now but as a type of beauty as a center of dreams of something wild and free and splendidsomething she was to attain to some good day  she had no thought of attaining him but some one like unto him some one who was grand as her dream of heroes and loyal as her father  it was characteristic of her that while the lovers singing without made her companions utter hysterical laughter she was sad and wished to be alone their desires were on the surface shifting sparkling seeking kisses hers was dark and deep down sombre savage prophetic love with her was a thing not to be uttered she silenced all jests about it and all familiarity on the part of her suitors she had put away  during her first year she had allowed her lover to take her hand as carl used to do because it seemed the usual thing but after breaking off that entanglement she resolutely set to work to study and no man had since considered himself her lover to permit a caress now meant all the world to her it meant change undoing of plans throwing away ambitions it meant flinging herself to the immemorial sacrifice men demand of women  there were times when she felt the impulse to do this she felt it that night as the clear voices of the serenaders came floating in at her window what did it matter what could she do in the mighty world what did the indian girl when her lover sang from his canoe among the water lilies in the lake why not go to one of these good clean young men and be a wife what did it matterher ambitionher hope i will she said and a wild rush of blood choked her breathing ill end it all  but the singing died away the moonlight vanished out of the room and the passionate longing and tumult of her blood grew slowly quiet and she slept  when the sun rose there was no man in her world who could have won her consent to marriage her ambitions rose like the sun buoyant as young eagles while the singers of the night before were hapless fireflies tangled in the dewy grass their lovelight dim their singing lost                                       she was not done with this problem however  she saw in one mans eyes something to be answered she had her answer ready though she hoped to escape the ordeal he hovered close about her all the morning he came by the chapterhouse for her but she had gone to the chapel  she felt a little guilty toward him she had attended concerts with him she had accepted his company now and again because she liked him and becausewell it was convenient and by selecting him she escaped the attentions of others she had seemed to acquiesce in his proprietorship of her and yet always when alone she had tried to show him that they could only be friends this he had persistently misunderstood  she was almost the tallest of her classmates she led the march into the chapel for the final ceremonies a splendid and terrible moment toward which they had looked for weeks and for which they had elaborately planned dresses and procedure  it was all so wistfully beautiful the cool spacious hall filled with hushed people the vivid green trees looking in at the windows and the soft air burdened with bee songs and the smell of flowers the june sunlight dappled the lawn with marvels of shade and shine the music seemed to wail as they marched and the rustling stir and murmur of comment helped to unnerve them all even to men  the speaker looked down upon them with comprehension he was an eastern man and an old man also he was a poet he was just and he had seen how clean and fine this coeducational school was the day was beautiful to him as to them and he comprehended their feelings well he looked down into their pensive faces he saw the sorrowful arching of their brows the sad droop of their lips  his shaggy head drooped forward as he talked to them till his kind old face lined with genial wrinkles seemed to grow beautiful and tender and maternal he had reared many children of his own and he now took the young people into his heart he told them much of his life and trialshow work was in the world for them play toobut work hard work glorious work work for humanity as well as for themselves he conveyed to them something of the spirit of altruism into which the world seemed about to enter on its orbit as it swings through clouds of stardust  they cheered him when he ended and then the president in brief words presented their diplomas among them now were bitten lips and tremulous chins and tearful eyes the doors had closed behind them and they faced the whole world it seemed for years they had studied here in storm and sun but now they remembered only the sunlight all fused and blended into one radiant vista  as they stood for their final benediction a splendid snowy cloud sailed across the sun and the room darkened mystically a shudder of exquisite pleasure and pain thrilled rose and a little moan pushed from her throat but the shadow lifted the organ sounded out a fine brave strain and the class of 189 was ended it was now a group of men and women facing the open road  with low words of greeting and congratulation the graduates and their friends lingered about the chapel slowly it emptied and the hill grew populous again with groups of leisurely moving figures  there were scholars showing their parents about the grounds there were groups of visiting townspeople and there were the lovers two and two loitering wandering she in dainty white gown he in cap and jacket twoandtwo in worldold sexold fashion they lay on the banks and watched the boats on the gleaming lake where other lovers were they threaded the hillpaths where the thrush moved with quick rustle and the pale woodflowers peered above the fragrant mosses they stood on the beach skipping pebbles he lithe and laughing she tender palpitating wistful and sombre or fitfully gay everywhere laughter had a solemn sweet undertone goodbye trembled so close to i love you  rose saw young harris approaching and a faintness took hold upon her limbs he was at his princeliest estatenever would he be handsomer his summer suit set close to his agile and sinewy figure his cap rested lightly on his curly hair his frank blue eyes were laughing but his lips were tremulous with feeling  well rose all the girls have deserted me so im glad to find you alone he said but she knew he was never deserted lets take a walk the whole school seems to be divided off into teams looks as if the whole crowd would trot in double harness dont it  she did not reply he hardly expected her to do so  going to the ball with me tonight arent you  no i guess not  i was in hopes youd change your mind  i cant dance those newfangled figures  o youd catch on in a jiffy you should have gone out more  they moved down the hill to the beach road and as they walked harris talked talked against time he would have said they strolled on past the small boys fishing past other lowvoiced couples out into comparative solitude where the farms began she knew what was coming but she could not stop could not then turn back  they came at last to a grassy little knoll which looked out upon the lake and there he laughingly spread out his handkerchief for her  sit here my liege lady  it was red clover and its powerful fragrance swept upon her with a vision of the hayfield at home  harris lay down below her so that he could see her face and the look in his eyes made her shiver again nothing so beautiful and powerful and paganfree had come to her since that day when she danced with carl beneath the dappling leaves when womans passion first stirred within her the sailing clouds the clicking insects the smell of leaves and flowers all strove on the side of the lover it was immemorial this scene this impulse  well rose this is our last day at school and what i want to know is this is it the last we shall see of each other  she made an effort and answered  why no i hope not  you hope notthen there is hope for me confound it rose im not going to talk in riddles youre the only girl in the world for me he took her hand and i cant live without you you are going to live with me arent you rose  she shook her head but tears dropped upon his hand he allured her like the sunshine this lithe young lover  his keen eyes saw a lack of decision in this head shake he held her hand and his fingers caressed her wrist unconsciously with pure intent he used all the wiles of men which women love yet dread his voice grew vibrant yet remained low his clear eyes called in subtler speech than his tongue his wrist touched her knee his hair moved in the soft wind  i cant bear to go home without you rose darling come tell me dont you care for me at all not the least bit  she tried to draw her hand away but he held it and continued  ive got everything all planned im going into law with my father ive got plans for a house and well begin life together today  his physical charm united itself some way with the smell of clover the movement of the wind and the warm flood of sunshine she had never loved him though she had always liked him but now something sweet and powerful something deep buried rose in her heart and shortened her breath her face burned her throat was swollen shut her face was distorted for one moment she was mastered  then the swift revulsion came and she drew her hand away and sprang up  no she cried harshly and bitterly i cant do it it is impossible go away  then the blood slowly fell away from her neck and face and her heart ceased to pound her eyes cleared and she grew gentle again seeing his pained and frightened face  i didnt mean thati didnt mean to be so rough tom but its no use i dont want to marry you nor anybody else all i want is to be let alone im going to chicago i want to see the world i cant be shut up in a little town like lodi i want to see peoplethousands of people i want to see what the world is like i may go to europe before i get done with it im going to study art im going to be great i cant marry any one now  she poured out her confidences in swift almost furious protest she had never confided to him so much before  his pain was not so overpowering but he found strength to say  i thought you were going to be a writer  she flushed again well i am but im going to be a painter too im going home she said abruptly and in such wise they walked along the returning way  the glamour was gone from the young mans hair and eyes she saw him as he was clean boyish shallow his physical charm was lost and a sort of disgust of his supple waist and rounded limbs came upon her and disgust at herself for that one moment of yielding weakness and also the keen fear of having been unjust of having given him a claim which she was repudiating troubled her  he made one last attempt  rose i wish youd reconsider what can you do in the world  i dont know i can be my own master for one thing she replied i can see the world for another thingand besides i dont want to marry any one just yet her voice was abrupt merciless and the young fellow bowed his head to his sentence she was too mysterious and powerful for him to understand  what could i do in lodi gossip with old women and grow old i know those towns i had rather live in the country than in one of those flat little towns  but ill go to the city with you if you want me to i can get a place there i know two men  no no i cant do it i want to be free ive got something to do andi dont care for you  well go to the ball with me tonight wont you he pleaded  yes if you never speak about this to me again  he promised of course he promised standing where he did he would have promised anything                                       it was a singular and lovely ball the people came together simply and quietly on foot or on the tinkling mulecar  there were no ultrafashionable dresses and no jewelry the men came in various cuts of coats and the girls wore simple white or blue or mauve dresses beneath which their lithe untrammeled waists and firm rounded limbs moved with splendid grace  it was plain all were not practised dancers some of the young men danced with hands waggling at the wrist and the girls did not know all the changes but laughter was hearty and without stint  around the walls sat or stood the parents of the dancers dignified business men and their wives keeneyed farmers and village merchants and lawyers there were also the alumni from all over the west returned to take part in the exercises to catch a glimpse of the dear old campus it was all a renewal of youth to them many came from the prairies some came from the bleak mountain towns and the gleam of the lakes the smell of grass the dapple of sunlight on the hillside affected them almost to tears now they danced with their wives and were without thought or care of business  professors danced with their pupils husbands with their wives who had also been pupils here lovely lithe young girls dragged their bearded old fathers out into the middle of the floor amid much laughter and the orchestra played moneymusk and old zip coon and the firemans dance for their benefit  then the old fellows warmed up to it and danced right manfully so that the young people applauded with swift clapping of their hands plump mothers took part in the quaint old fashioned figures and swung and balanced and sashayed in a gale of fun  it was a beautiful coming together of the university it represented the unspoiled neighborliness and sex camaraderie of the west its refinement was not finicky its dignity was not frigidity and its fun was frank and hearty may the inexorable march of wealth and fashion pass by afar off and leave us some little of these dear old forms of social life  it had a tender and pensive quality also the old were reliving the past as well as the young and all had an unconscious feeling of the transitoriness of these tender and careless hours smiles flashed forth on the faces of the girls like hidden roses disclosed in deep hedges by a passing windgust to disappear again in pensive thoughtful deeps  rose danced with dr thatcher who took occasion to say  well rose you leave us soon  yes tomorrow doctor  what are your plans  i dont know i must go home this summer i want to go to chicago next winter  aha you go from world to world rose you will do whatever you dream ofprovided you dont marry he said this as lightly as he could but she knew he meant it  there isnt much danger of that she said trying to laugh  well no perhaps not they fell into a walk and moved slowly just outside the throng of dancers  now mark you i dont advise you at all i have realized from the first a fatality in you no one can advise you you must test all things for yourself you are alone advice cannot reach you nor influence you except as it appeals to your own reason to most women marriage is the end of ambition to you it may be an incentive if you are big enough you will succeed in spite of being wife and mother i believe in you cant you come and see me tomorrow i want to give you letters to some chicago people  the company began to disperse and the sadness impending fell upon them all one by one goodbyes were said and the dancers one and all slipped silently away into the night     chapter xiii  the womans part   it was all over at last the goodbyes the tearful embraces the cheery waving of hands and rose was off for home there were other students on the train but they were young students whom she did not know at the moment it seemed as if she were leaving all that was worth whilefive years of the most beautiful time of her life lay behind her  she had gone there a country girl scared and awkward she was now a woman it seemed to her and the time for action of some sort had come she did not look to marriage as a safe harbor neither had she regarded it as an end of all individual effort as many of her companions unequivocally had done  after her experiences during those last three days she felt as if sex were an abomination and she wished for freedom from love she had already the premonition that she was of those who seem destined to know much persecution of men  her strong forceful fullblooded magnetic beauty could not be hidden so deep under sober garments but that the everseeking male eye quickly discovered it as she entered the car she felt its penetrating remorseless glare and her face darkened though she was no longer exposed to the open insults of brakemen and drummers there was something in the droop of her eyelids and the curve of her mouth which kept all men at a distance even the most depraved she was not a victima girl to be preyed upon she was quite evidently a proud strong woman to be sued for by all flatteries and attentions  the train whirled along over the familiar route and the land was most beautiful fresh grass everywhere seas of green flashing foliage alternating with smooth slopes of meadow where cattle fed yet she saw little of it with sombre eyes turned to the pane she thought and thought  what was to be done now that was the question for a year she had been secretly writing verse and sending it to the magazines it had all been returned to her it made her flush hot to think how they had come back to her with scarcely a word of civility evidently she was wrong she was not intended for a writer after all she thought of the stage but she did not know how to get upon the stage  the train drew steadily forward and familiar lines of hilltops aroused her and as she turned her face toward home the bent and grizzled figure of her father came to her mind as another determining cause he demanded something of her now after nearly five years absence from home for he had paid her waymade it possible for her to be what she was  there he sat holding his rearing horses and watching waiting for her she had a sudden swift realization of his being a type as he sat there and it made her throat fill for it seemed to put him so far away seemed to take away something of her own sweet dignified personality  there was a crowd of people on the platform some of them she knew some of them she did not she looked very fine and ladylike to john dutcher as she came down the car steps and the brakeman helped her down with elaborate and very respectful courtesy  the horses pranced about so that john could not even take her hand and so she climbed into the buggy alone  carl will take care of your trunk he said give him the check  she turned to carl whom she had not noticed he bowed awkwardly  how de do rosie he said as he took the check he wore brown denims and a broad hat and looked strong and clumsy  she had no time to speak to him for the horses whirled away up the street the air was heavy with the scent of clover and the bittersweet pungent smells of lombardy poplar trees  they rode in silence till the village lay behind them and the horses calmed down  caps a perfect fool about the cars said john but i had to take him jennies getting too heavy i darsent take her  how is the stock  o all right we had a big crop of lambs this spring the bees are doing well but the clover dont seem to attract em this year the corn looks well except down near the creekits been wet there in rainy seasons you remember he gave other reports concerning stock  rose felt for the first time the unusualness of this talk all her life she had discussed such things with him but on previous vacations she had not been conscious of its startling plainness but now it came to her with a sudden hot flushthink of such talk being reported of her to the doctor and mrs thatcher  there was something strange in her fathers manner an excitement very badly concealed which puzzled her he drove with almost reckless swiftness up the winding coulé road he called her attention to the wayside crops and succeeded in making her ask  father what in the world is the matter with you i never knew you to act like this  john laughed im a little upset getting you home again thats all  she caught a gleam of new shingles through the trees  what have you been building  o nothing muchnew granarypatchin up a little he replied evasively when they whirled into the yard she was bewilderedthe old cottage was gone and a new house stood in its place  john broke into a laugh  hows that for a new granary  o father did you do that for me  for you and me together rosie  they sat in the carriage and looked at it rose peered through tearblurred lids he loved her sothis bent old father he had torn down the old home and built this for her  her aunt came out on the side porch hello rosie just in time the shortcake is about ready aint you comin in  john gave the team up to the hired hand who stared at rose with wondering eyes and then they walked upon the front porch and in the front door it was newso new it glistened everywhere and was full of the fragrance of new lumber and the odor of paint  i didnt get any new furniture john said i thought id let you do that  rose turned and put her arms about his neck  you dear old daddy what can i do for you youre so good to me  there now dont mind im paid for it now i just want you to enjoy it thats all and if any feller comes around and you like him why you can bring him right here its big enough now and im ready to let the farm any time  rose saw his purpose to the uttermost line he had built this to keep her at home how little he knew her now to think that she could marry and bring her husband home to this place  she kissed him and then they passed into all the rooms  come hereive got something to show you he said mysteriously i just determined to have it no matter what it cost he pushed open a door at the head of the stairway calling triumphantly  therehows thata bathroom  for an instant she felt like laughing then she looked at his kind and simple face and she broke down again and cried  john understood now that this was only her way of being glad so he just patted her shoulder and got her a chair and waited for her to dry her eyes  yes sir he went on cost me a hundred dollars to put that in say nothin of the fixins i had to have special set of eavespouts made to run the water into a cistern on top of the kitchen i thought of bringing the water from the spring but thats a little hard  they went down to supper at last he full of talk she very quiet his loquacity was painful to her for it seemed to indicate growing age and loneliness  the meagreness of the furniture and tableware never struck her so forcibly as now lost in the big new house intellectual poverty was shown also in the absence of books and newspapers for john dutcher read little even of political newspapers and magazines were quite outside his experimental knowledge till rose brought a few home with her in her later vacations  there were no elegancies at their tablethat too was borne in upon her along with the other disturbing things it was as if her eyes had suddenly been opened to all the intolerable meagreness of her oldtime life  i didnt buy any carpets or wallpaper rosie i thought youd like to do that yourself john explained as she looked around the room  but outside all was beautiful very beautiful under the trees the sinking sun could be seen hanging just above the purplegreen hills to the northwest robins clucked orioles whistled a ringdove uttered its never changing sorrowful sweet lovenote a thrush high on a poplar sang to the setting sun a wonderful hymn and the vivid green valley with its white houses and red barns was flooded with orange light heaped and brimming full of radiance and fragrance  and yet what was all that to a girl without love a brain which craved activity not repose vain were sunset sky flaming green slopes and rows of purple hills to eyes which dreamed of cities and the movement of masses of men she was young not old ambitious not vegetative she was seeking seeking and to wait was not her will or wish  the old man saw nothing difficult in all this she was educated now he had patiently sent her to school and now it was over she was to be his once more his pride and comfort as of olden time without knowing it he had forged the chains round her with great skill every carpet she bought would bind her to stay she was to select the wallpaper and by so doing to proclaim her intention to conform and to content herself in the new home  she rose the next morning feeling in spite of disturbing thought the wonderful peace and beauty of the coulé while her heart responded to the birds rioting as never beforeorioles thrushes bobolinks robins larkstheir voices wonderful and brilliant as the sunlight which streamed in upon her new uncarpeted floor  as she looked around at the large fine new room she thought of the little attic in which she had slept so many years yes decidedly there would be pleasure in furnishing the house in making her room pretty with delicate drapery and cheerful furniture  she began to plan only to break offit seemed in some way to be deceit no before she did anything to it she must tell him she could not stay here and she went down to breakfast with that resolution tightly clutched in her teeth but when she saw his smiling face she could not speak the word he was so pathetically happy she had never seen him so demonstrative and this mood showed her how deeply he had missed her  now that she was home for good he felt no need of concealing his exceeding great joy of her daily presence with him she remembered all the brave words he had spoken to her in order to make her feel he did not suffer when she was happy at school fortunately at breakfast he was full of another subject  i spose you heard that carl is to be married he announced rather than asked her  she looked up quicklyno is he to whom  little sary wilson  well im very glad to hear it she said quietly  some way at that moment she seemed more alien to him than ever before and he looked across at her in wonder how ladylike she was in her tasty dress how white her hands were and it was wonderful to think she could sit so at ease and hear of carls approaching marriage he remembered the time when he called them to his knee the two young rogues  she was thinking of that too it was far in the past yet far as it was it was still measurable and a faint flush crept over her face no one in the world knew of that experience but carl and her father would carls wife ever know of it that was the thought which caused the flush  the first day she spent in looking about the farm with john towards evening she climbed the hills alone and spent an hour on the familiar slope it helped her to look down on her plans and her daily life and the next day she met the question direct  well rosie when will you go to tyre and do our buyin  o not yet i want to look around a few days first  all rightyoure the captain only we cant have any company till we get some furniture  true enough there was the excuse for buying the furniture even if she were to go to the city she would be home during the summer and she would want to entertain her friends the fever seized her thereupon and she plunged into planning and cataloguing they had but little to spend and she was put to her wits end to passably furnish the house  this filled in the first week or two of her stay and she suffered less from loneliness than she expected it came only at intervals just before going to sleep or in the morning as she made her toilet for each new but eventless day  as the home came to look pretty and complete she thought of asking josie to come on to visit her and finally wrote her and when she had promised to come there was something to look forward to  meanwhile she found something wrong between herself and her old friends she meant to be just the same as ever and at first she seemed to succeed but she found herself not listening to them or looking at them with alien eyes she heard their harsh loud voices not their words and she saw their stiff ungraceful gestures instead of the fancywork and workedover dresses which they showed her they looked at each other with significant nods other young people had gone away to school without acquiring airs why should she  it was not her education in books but in manners which made her alien she was educated above them too her thoughts were higher than theirs and she did not attempt to play the hypocrite she was not interested in them for the most part they bored her in a few cases the misunderstanding grew to be anger and distrust  carl drove over once with his brideelect and they all sat stiffly in the front room for one distressing hour then they left never to come again  sarah counted the visit not all in vain however for she quite closely reproduced roses shirtwaist the following weekthat much she got out of the call carl was awed and troubled a little by the failure of his bride to get on with rose and rose was bitter over it in heart she could not see the fun of all this as so many storywriters had done it was all pitiful and bitter and barren and to eat with the knife and drink coffee with a loud sipping sound were inexcusable misdemeanors to her overwrought temper  josie came in like a little oriole she fluffed down off the train like a bunch of lilac bloom one july day  o what a funny little town she said after kissing rose howdedo are we to ride in this carriage o im so disappointed  why so  o i wanted to ride on a haycart or dray or whatever it is mr dutcher im so glad to see you she sprang upon john and kissed him like a swaller lightin on me he said afterward it astonished him but gratified him  do you live far out in the countrythe real country she asked  well youd think so if you had to haul corn over it in the spring he replied  id like to haul corn over it she replied may i  you can do anything you want to john said  josie got at the picturesque qualities of the people they all interested her and amused her like the cattle without horns and the guineahens which clacked like clocks and the tadpoles in the marsh she had no personal relationsno responsibilities toward them such as rose felt were inescapably hers josie had no responsibilities at all none under heaven  she laughed at the illmade dresses and winked over the heads of the old wives when they talked in dialect and made fun of the boys who came courting her and sang where did they get those hats after coming out of the church  rose laughed and yet suffered as one might whose blood relatives were ridiculed it was a new experience to john dutcher to have one about who cried out at everything as if it were the seventh wonder the summer visitor had never before penetrated to his farm and all the women he had ever known could talk about cattle and drainage and woolwashing almost like men in his interest and desire to do the part of entertainer he pushed on into subjects which the girl listened to with wonderwide eyes and a flushed face  he talked to her as he would with rose about farrer cows and other commonplaces of stockraising to which rose would have listened abstractedly or with a slight feeling of disgust to josie it was deeply fascinating and just a little bit like reading a forbidden book it affected her a little unwholesomely just as it would have made ed the hand spasmodically guffaw to stand before the venus de milouse and custom do much  she sometimes asked questions which she would not have dared to ask her uncle for john dutcher was beyond sex indeed he had always been a man of pure heart and plain speech he was even in youth perfectly free from any sensuality and now in his later middle life sex was a fact like the color of a horse or a squash and all that pertained to it he talked of on the same plane it did not occur to him that he was going beyond the lines of propriety in explaining to this delicate little woman various vital facts of stockraising  josie sometimes went back to rose smilingly and told her what had taken place  why didnt you ask meyou little goose i never thought you didnt know those things we farm girls know all that when we are toddlers we cant help it  all this should have been tonic thoroughly wholesome to the dainty overbred girl and so it ultimately became though it disturbed her at the time  the two girls went out into the meadows and upon the hills almost daily they sought wild strawberries in the sunny spots amid the hazel brush they buried themselves in the hay in the field and climbed on the huge loads with john and rode to the barn they drank water out of the spring lying flat on the ground rose showed how it was done they went up on the hillsides under the edges of great ledges of waterwashed sandstone where rose had made her playhouse in her childhood and she drew forth from the crevices in the rocks the queer little worn pieces of rock which she had called horses and cows and soldiers  rose had not been so girlish since her first vacation from school in madison she romped and laughed with the everjoyous josie and together they grew brown and strong but there came into the lusty splendid joy of these days hours of almost sombre silence and dreaming it all ended in nothing this attempt at amusement  here in the riant and overflowing opulence of july time without loves companionship was time wasted of what avail these soft winds the song of birds the gleam and lift and shimmer of leaves if love were not there to share it  josie frankly confessed the name of the one she wished to share it with but rose looked into the sky and remained silent her soul was still seeking restless avid yet evermore discerning evermore difficult to satisfy  they fell into long talks on marriage and rose confided to her some of her deepest thoughts though she felt each time that this little twittering sparrow was hardly capable of understanding her  i want to know the men who think the great thoughts of the world she said once as they lay under the beeches on the hillside far above the haying field i dont want to marryi only want to know men who can lift me up by their great plans i want to forget myself in work of some kindi dont know what kindany kind that will make me big and grand in my life i cant stand these little petty things here in this valley these women drive me crazy with their talk of butter and eggs and madeover bonnets  i think theyre funny said josie they talk so loud and they get so interested in such queer things  rose fell silent again she knew josie was of this type only her affairs happened to be of a different sort not larger only different pettinesses of dress and teas  o for a nice man sighed josie why didnt you tell me there werent any nice men up here  meanwhile the lack of men was not apparent hardly a day but some young fellow from tyre or the siding made bold to hitch his horses to the fence before dutchers place rose was annoyed and gave most of them scant courtesy josie however always saw them and managed to have great amusement out of their embarrassment  like summer girls in general she thought any man better than no man at all rose however could not endure a loveglance from any of them she found her household duties pressing when they called and josie entertained them and afterward entertained her by mimicking their looks and tones it was very funny to see josie screw her little face into shapes to represent her suitors bashful grins and sideglances  they were not always bashful it must be said sometimes they were distressingly bold and they came to the point of offensive warfare with a readiness and assurance which scared josie she had never seen anything like it  rose found josie entertaining in any mood     chapter xiv  again the question of homeleaving   but the day came at last when josie must say goodbye and then roses essential loneliness swept back upon her in a bitter flood that night she walked her room in her naked feet with her handkerchief stifling her sobs so that john might not hear she fought it out there she supposed and ended at last by determining to sacrifice herself to her father  he could not be deserted he needed her so now that he was growing old and a little weaker she must put away her vague ambitious dreams of success and apply herself to making him happy  and yet to what end was all her study she thought during these later years could it be applied to doing him good her indifferent talent as a musician seemed the only talent which gave him joy he cared nothingknew nothing of the things she loved and thought about  was her life like his to come down to the raising of cattle and the breeding of sheep was not his office served in educating her should not the old be sacrificed to the young  all these devilish questions came into her mind like flashes of lurid light but they all paled and faded before this one unchangeable radiance he was her father tender loving simple laborious and old  she fell asleep after hours of writhing agony worn out yet triumphantshe imagined  but she was not day followed day each one seemingly more hopeless than the other this consideration beat like a knell into her brain love could never come to her marriage with these young men was no longer possible love was out there somewhere in the great world in the city among artists and musiclovers and men of great thought and great deeds her powerful physical mental and emotional womanhood rebelled at this thought of lovelessness like the prisoner of old bound in a sunless cavern where the dripdrop of icy water fell upon his brain she writhed and seemed like to go mad  this was the age of cities the worlds thought went on in the great cities the life in these valleys was mere stagnant water the great stream of life swept by far out and down there where men and women met in millions to live here was to be a cow a tadpole grass grew here yesbut she could not live on grass the birds sang here yesbut there were patti and duse and bernhardt out there in the world  here you could arise at five oclock to cook breakfast and wash dishes and get dinner and sweep and mend and get supper and so on till you rotted like a post stuck in the mud your soul would rot she felt change going on all the time she was slipping back into shiftlessness into minute untidinessinto actual slovenliness there was no stimulus in these surroundings she told herself everything was against her higher self  once she had read a sentence from lowell which flamed upon her mind now each time she mused upon her lot  the wilderness is all right for a vacation but all wrong for a lifetime  she considered the coulé a wilderness it had nothing for her but nature and nature palls upon a girl of twenty with red blood in her veins and splendid dreams in her heart  out there was her ideal out there is the man who is to fill out my life she uttered to herself softly so that only her inner ear heard  so she argued fought wept surrendered and went to battle again while all about her john and his sister moved tranquilly to their daily duties calm as the cattle in the meadows to the discerning eye it was a wonderful sight to see that dark gloomy restless girl seated opposite those serene almost stolid faces to whom the world was a breeze blowing in the treetops she had the bearing of a rebellious royal captivea duchess in exile mrs diehl and the hired man were the peasants who waited upon her but ate with herand her father was the secure freeholder to whom kings were obscure worlddistant diseases  then the equinoctial storms came on and days of dull cold unremitting rain confined her to the house the birds fell silent the landscape blurred with gray mist looked grim and threatening and there was prophecy of winter in the air the season seemed to have rushed into darkness cold and decay in one enormous bound the hills no longer lifted buoyant crests to heaven they grew cheerless and dank as prison walls  one night rose spoke she had always been chary of caresses even when a child she sat erect upon her fathers knee with a sober little face and when she grew sleepy she seldom put hands to his neck but merely laid her head on his breast and went to sleep john understood her in all this for was he not of the same feeling love that babbled spent itself his had no expression  his heart was big with pride and affection when his splendid girl came over and put her arms about his neck and put her forehead down on his shoulder  o pappa john youre so good to meim ashamedi dont deserve this new house  o yes y do daughter his voice when he said daughter always made her cry it was deep and tender like the music of water it stood for him in the place of dear and darling and he very very seldom spoke it all this made it harder for her to go on  no i dont fathero father i cant stay herei cant bear to stay here now  why not rosie  o because its so lonesome for me there is nobody for me to talk to she had to use phrases he could understand and i want to go on with my studies  john considered a moment  but rosie seems to me youve got enough youre graduated  rose saw the hopelessness of making him understand that so she went back  its so lonesome for me here pappa john  he considered again i spose it is well you can go to the siding every day if you want to hitch up old doll every day  i dont care for the siding its just as lonesome there for me i want to go to chicago  john grew rigid chicago what you want to do there  i want to study pappa i want to go on with my work ill come home summers just the same ill come home christmas if you want me to it wont cost much ill live just as cheap as i can  taint that taint that rose he said then he lifted his head and looked around  she read his thought and the tears came to her eyes in blinding rush  i know pappa its terrible to go now when youve built this nice home for me but what can i do its so lonesome here i thought maybe id get used to it but it gets worse i cant stay here this winter you must let me go ill go crazy if i stay here all winter i must go out into the world i want to be an artist i want to see great people i cant stay here pappa john  the terrible earnestness of every sentence stabbed john dutchers heart like a poniard thrust he put her away and rose stiffly  well well rosie if you want to go  he did not finish but turned tremblingly and walked out she remained on the floor near his chair and watched him go her soul sick with wretchedness  why was the world so ordered why must she torture that beautiful simple soul why was it that all her high thoughts her dreams her ambitions her longings seemed to carry her farther away from him  she could have beaten her head against the wall in her suffering she rose at last and crawled slowly to her room and abandoned herself to black rayless hopelessness  john dutcher went out to the hedgerow and sat down on a stool around him bees were humming in the wet clover the calves thrust their inquiring noses through the fence and called to him the rainclouds were breaking up and the sun was striking under the flying canopy at the west  it was the bitterest moment of his life since his wifes death his eyes were opened to his fate he saw what he had done he had educated his daughter out of his world never again would she be content in the coolly beside him he saw how foolish he had been all these years to suppose he could educate and keep her for a moment he flamed with resentment and said to himself  i wish she had never seen a book  then he grew tender he saw her again in her little blue apron with its pockets full of wheathe saw her blowing hair her sunny face he heard again the windtossed chatter of her cunning lips he ran swiftly over her developmenthow tall she grew and how splendid she was now the handsomest girl in the coolly and he softened she was right who was there of the young farmers or even in tyre good enough for her  so he rose to a conception which had never come to him before and even now it was formlessly vast he felt the power of the outside world and reached to a divination of the fatality of it all it had to be for it was a part of progress he was old and bent and dull she was young gloriously young the old must give way to the young while she was the one to be bowed down to she was queen and he was subject  with these conceptions in his mind he went back and looked for her he called her softly but she did not hear she was sobbing deep into her pillow he came up the stairs and saw her lying face downward on her bed his heart rose in his throat because it was a terrible thing to see his imperious girl weep  rosie old pappa john surrenders youre right and hes an old dummy  she turned her face upon him  no youre right we wont be separated  but we aint going to be he came over and sat down on the edge of the bed  youll come home summers and maybe ill go to chicago winters  her face flashed into a smile she flung her arms about him again  o will you pappa john  course i will wait till you see me in a spiketail coat and a boiled shirt ill astonish the city dudes  rose laughed a little wildly and tightened her clasp about his neck  youre my dear old pappa john  she went at once to her desk and wrote a letter to mary compton an old schoolmate who had gone to chicago and whose guidance to bed and board now seemed valuable  that night john dutcher did not go to sleep at once as he usually did on entering his room he went to his bureauthe old bureau he had bought for his wife thirty years before in it he kept his pictures there were several tintypes of rose in awkward scared poses and there too was the last picture of his wife which had been taken with rose as a babe in her arms  dutcher sat for a long time looking at it and the tears ran down his face unheeded pitiful to see  when he got up at last he moved stiffly as if he had suddenly grown ten years older and in his sleep his sister heard him groan and talk in the morning he said he had a touch of rheumatism but it would most probably pass off as the sun came out     chapter xv  chicago   almost 6 oclock and the train due in chicago at 630 the city grew more formidable to rose as she approached it she wondered how it would first appear on the plain there was little sign of it yet  as she looked out of the car window she saw men stacking grain and plowing it was supper time at home and john was just rising from the table the calves were bleating for their pails of milk the guineahens were clacking and the little turkeys crying in the grass the bees were homing heavy with honey and here she sat rushing toward that appalling and unimaginable presencechicago  somewhere just ahead it sat this mighty hive of a million and a half of people the thought of it made her heart beat quick and her throat filled she was going there the lake was there art was there and music and the dramaand love always under each emotion always behind every success was the understanding that love was to be the womans reward and recompense it was not articulate nor feverish this thought it was a deep pure emotion streaming always toward the unknown  she dreamed as the train rumbled on she would succeed she must succeed she gripped the seatrail with her broad strong hands and braced herself like one entering a flood  it was this wonderful thing again a fresh young and powerful soul rushing to a great city a shining atom of steel obeying the magnet a clear rivulet from the hills hurrying to the sea on every train at that same hour from every direction others like her were entering on the same search to the same end  see that cloud some one said thats chicago  rose lookedfar to the southeast a gigantic smokecloud soared above the low horizon line in shape like an eagle whose hovering wings extended from south to east trailing mysterious shadows upon the earth the sun lighted its mighty crest with crimson light and its gloom and glow became each moment more sharply contrasted towards this portentous presence the train rushed uttering an occasional shrill neigh like a stallions defiance  the brazen bell upon the engine began to clang and clang small towns of scattered wooden houses came into view and were left behind huge misshapen buildings appeared in flat spaces amid hundreds of cars webs of railway tracks spread out dangerously in acres of marvelous intricacy amid which men moved sooty grimy sullen and sickly  terrors thickened smells assaulted her sensitive nostrils incomprehensible and horrible odors everywhere men delved in dirt and murk and all unloveliness streets began to stretch away on either side interminable squalid filled with scowling squawlike women and elfish children the darkness grew making the tangle and tumult a deadly struggle  was this the city of her dreams this the magnificent the home of education and art  the engines bell seemed to call back good cheer good cheer the buildings grew mightier but not less gloomy the freight cars grew fewer and the coaches more numerous it was an illimitable jungle filled with unrecognizable forms over which night was falling  the man with a hoop of clinking checks came through he was a handsome clean and manly fellow and his calm kindly voice helped rose to choke down her dread  baggage checkedbaggagebaggage checked to any part of the citybaggage  in him she saw the native denizen to whom all these horrors were commonplace sensations and it helped her it couldnt be so bad as it looked to her  chicago shecawgo called the brakeman and her heart for a moment stood still and a smothering sensation came upon her she was at the gate of the city and life with all its terrors and triumphs seemed just before her  at that moment the most beautiful thing in the world was the smooth pasture by the spring where the sheep were feeding in the fading light and if she could she would have turned back but she was afloat and retreat was impossible she pressed on with the rest wondering what she could do if mary did not meet her  mary had hardly been more than an acquaintance at school but now she seemed a staff to lean upon rose looked to her as a guide to a refuge a hidingplace from all these terrors  out under the prodigious arching roof she stepped into the tumult of clanging bells of screeching hissing steam and of grinding wheels the shouts of men echoed here and there in the vaulted roof mysteriously as in a cavern up the long walk streams of people moved each one laden like herself with a valise electric lamps sputtered overhead she hurried on with sensitive ears tortured by the appalling tumult her eyes wide and apprehensive  her friend was not to be seen and she moved on mechanically with the rest keeping step beside an old man who seemed to be familiar with the station and who kept off without knowing it the attentions of two human vultures in wait for such as rose  they moved up the steps into the waitingroom before rose gave up hope of her friend so far she had gone securely but could she find the house which was to be her home alone  she sat down for an instant on the long seat by the wall and listened to the obscure thunder of the street outside it was terrifying confusing shrill screams and hoarse shouts rose above a hissing scraping sound the clang of gongs and the click of shoeheels  every voice was pitched to an unnatural key like that of men in a mill the noise seemed hot some way like smitten iron and brass no sound was familiar to her nothing cool and reposeful her head throbbed and her tongue was dry she had eaten little since early morning and she felt weak  she looked far more composed and selfreliant than she was and when her friend came swinging up to her she cried out o mary and her friend realized a little of her relief and gratitude  o here you are i got delayedforgive me im all out o breath here she kissed her how well you look your complexion is magnificent give me your valise well send for your trunk save twentyfive cents by having it done up town this wayim glad to see you how is wisconsin  mary compton was tall redhaired and strong her eyes were keen and laughing and the tip of her chip hat and the swing of her skirts let everybody know how able she was to take care of herselfthank you she had been the smart girl of a small town near madison and had come to the city as her brother dan had gone to idaho for the adventure of it it was quite like hunting bears  shall we take the grip  rose didnt know what she meant but she said  just as you like  i like to take the grip it gives a fellow a little fresh air if there is any at all  a train of cablecars came nosing along like vicious boars with snouts close to the ground mary helped rose upon the open forward car which had seats facing outward a young man lifted his hat and made room for them  hello john said mary arent you a little early tonight rose my friend mr hardy mr hardy miss dutcher  the young fellow raised his hat again and bowed he was a pleasantfaced young man in round straw hat and short coat mary paid no further attention to him  ive got you a room right next to mine she said to rose who was holding to the seat with one hand and clinging to her hat with the other the car stopped and started with vicious suddenness  youd better hang on the gripman is mad tonight mary explained were most to our street anyway  to rose it was all a wild ride the noise the leaping motion of the cars and the perilous passage of drays made it as pleasant to her as a ride behind a running team on a corduroy road  they came at last to quieter spaces and alighted finally at a cross street  im pretty far up said mary but i want it decently quiet where i live i have noise enough at the office  rose thought it indecently noisy peddlers were crying out strange singsong cries children romped screaming in highpitched furious voices laundry wagons and vegetable wagons clattered about there was a curious pungent odor in the air  on the steps of the houses groups of young people like mary and john sat on strips of carpet and laughed and commented on the passersby mary turned upon one fool who called a smart word at her  left your manners in squashville didnt you little man  they came at last to an imposing block of houses situated at the corner they entered the door and climbed a gaslit stairway which went round and round a sort of square well they came at last to a door which closed all passage and mary got out her key and opened it  here we are she said cheerily  the main hall was carpeted and ran past several doors which were open in one room a young man in his shirt sleeves was shaving before a glass in another a girl was reading  hello called mary  hello said the girl without looking up  heres my room and thiss yours mary pushed open a door at the end of the hall it was a small room papered in light buff and blue it had an oak dresser and mirror a couple of chairs and a mantel bed it looked cheerful and clean but very small mary put down her valise  i guess youll find everything all right water and towels wash up right offdinnerll be ready soon  rose removed her hat and sat down her head throbbing with the heat and noise she heard the man at the glass whistling and mary was thumping about in her vigorous way  the dash of cold water cleared her brain but did not remove her headache her face was still flushed and her eyes expanded  mary coming back looked at her a moment and then rushed upon her and hugged her  o what a beauty you are i wish i had half what youve got  rose smiled faintly she didnt care just that moment whether she looked well or ill  the boys will all be dead in love with you before dinner is over let me tell you about them she softened her reedlike voice down and glanced at the transom furtively never forget the transom when youre talking secrets she explained  first theres mr taylor hes from colorado somewhere hes a lawyer hes a fine fellow tooyoull like him then theres mr simons hes a jew but hes not too much of a jew theres alice fletcher shes queer and grumpy but she reads a lot and she can talk when she wants to and theres you and myself  i dont feel like meeting them tonight rose said if i had a cup of tea id stay in my room  all right ill bring it  the bell rang and then the movement of feet and the banging of doors told of the rush to dinner  mary came back with a cup of tea and a biscuit and some pudding  have more if you wish she said  this will do nicely youre very kind mary compton i dont deserve it  you deserve the world cried the adoring girl if i had your figure and complexion id make the universe wait on me  in spite of all this fervor of praise rose felt herself to be a very dejected and spiritless beauty she was irritated and angry with the nagging of strange sights and sounds and smells the air seemed laden with disease and filth it was all so far from the coolly with its purple hills looming against the sapphire sunset sky  but this she came forto see the city to plunge into its life she roused herself therefore with a blush of shame at her weakness she had appeared to be a child before this girl who had always been her inferior at school  it was a very dignified young woman who arose to greet mrs wilcox the landlady whom mary brought back this dignity was not needed mrs wilcox was a sweetvoiced smiling woman of fiftybeing of those toilers who smile when they are tired enough to drop she was flushed with fatigue and moved languidly but her kind patient pathetic smile touched rose almost to tears  im glad to have you come here the landlady said were all nice people here arent we miss compton her eyes twinkled with humorous selfanalysis  every one of us corroborated mary  i hope youll rest well if theres anything we can do for you my dear let me know such was the spirit in which the overworked woman served her boarders they all called her mother she had no children of her own and her husband was not at all well yet nothing could sour her sweet kindliness which included all the world she was a familiar type and rose loved her at once  miss fletcher came in and was introduced she was a teacher in a school near by  what anybody should come to this town for i cant understand i stay here because im obliged to im just back from the country to my work  the country is all right for a vacation quoted rose  mary broke in thats what i say i lived on a farm and i lived in castle rock when i lived on the farm i wanted to get to castle rock when i got to castle rock i wanted to get to madison madison made me hone for chicago and when i had a chance to come i just dropped my work at the university and put for the city and here i am and glad of it  i cant understand such folly murmured miss fletcher  you could if youd stayed on the farm the year round with nobody to talk to and mighty little to read its all right for you to go up for a couple of months and lie about in a hammock but you take a place like castle rock all the year round its worse than the farm gossip they talk every rag of news to smithereens dont they rose  rose nodded  and then the people theyre the cullins all the bright boys and girls go to madison and chicago or dakota and then the rest marry and intermarry and have idiot boys and frecklefaced girls  they all laughed mary was always extreme no matter what her subject  miss fletcher sighed resignedly  well its fate here this big city sits and swallows you bright people like a great dragon and the old folks are left alone in these dull places you talk about  rose felt her eyes filling with tears the figure of her lonely old father came before her she saw him sitting beside the kitchen table his head on his palm and all the new house empty and dark  mary jumped up here now stop that talk we must leave rose alone and let her go to sleep  they left her alone but sleep was impossible the tramp of feet the sound of pianos the slam of doors the singing laughing of the other boarders made sleep impossible the cars jangled by the clickclack of horses hoofs and the swift rattle of wagons kept up long after the house was silent between midnight and four oclock she got a little sleep out of which she awoke while a booming clattering wagon thundered by other wagons clattered viciously along up the alleys and then some early riser below began to sing and rose wearily dressed and sat down by the window to listen  far to the south a low intermittent yet ever deepening crescendo bass note began to sound it was chicago waking from the three hours doze which is its only sleep it grew to a raucous hot roar and then to the north she heard the clear musical cry of a fruit vendorthen another blackberries fine fresh blackberries  the cars thickened the sun grew hot and lay in squares of blinding light across her carpet that curious pungent smell came in with the wind newsboys cried their morning papers children fought and played in the street distant whistles began to sound and her first morning in chicago came to rose hot brazen unnatural and found her blinded bruised discouraged abased homesick     chapter xvi  her first conquest   she was still sitting by the window wondering what to do next when mary tapped at her door  may i come in  she looked fresh and strong and her cheery smile made her seem beautiful to rose  how did you sleep  rose shook her head mary laughed  i can tell by the looks of you looks if youd been pulled through a knothole as they say up in molasses gap heard everything that took place didnt you i did too youll get over that i sleep like a top now  what is that smell pah shuddered rose  mary elevated her freckled nose what smell o you mean that rotten piney turpentiney smellthats the chicago smell it comes from the pavin blocks i guess i never inquired ill ask mr reed he knows everything mean about chicago well you hadnt better go to breakfast looking like that i want you to paralyze that boston snipe ill bring in your breakfast  rose accepted this service passively nothing else was to be done in mary comptons presence she had the energy of a steam threshing machine and affection to correspond  rose wondered again what she could do next she was here to study art and literaturethere was the library she would read and there were lectures perhaps what she was to do would come to her after awhile  mary returned a little hot of color bringing a tray  that boston clothespin says youre a myth or a country gawk you must lay him out cold as a handspike ive been bragging about you and they were all on tiptoe to see you this morning you sail in on em at dinner the way you used to do at our chapterhouse spreads werent they great there now ive got to vamoose im not a lady of leisure im a typewriter on trial and looks wont carry me through ive got to rustle and walk chalk as they say in molasses gap so goodbye take it easy today if you want to walk go over to the lake front and she banged out of the door and faced the city in her daily encounter  rose ate her breakfast and felt much better her trunk came and she got out her dresses and hung them up and made other preparations for staying although it seemed impossible she should ever sleep another night in this terrible city  she got out her portfolio and wrote a letter home and one also to dr thatcher then she looked over the little bunch of letters of introduction she had one was to doctor isabel herrick one to professor h bevan fowler at evanston and one was to orrin thatcher that was the doctors cousin a young lawyer in the womans building whatever that was with these and ten dollars a week she faced chicago the contest was unequal  she felt this more keenly as she stood on the lake front a little later on in the day she went there as the new hampshire girl goes to the sea this body of water majestic in its immense shoreless spread is wonderful to the young girl from iowa or interior wisconsin  a fresh keen east wind had arisen pure and exhilarating and the smooth expanse of glittering greenandblue water stretched out under a vivid blue sky in which great clouds floated like snow mountains trailing great shadows like robes of state upon the lake  the curving lakewall was wet and glistening with the upflung spray the slender elms were fronded at the top like palms and the vivid green grass set opposite the pinkgray wall and the brilliant manycolored lake in magnificent harmonious contrast the girl felt her soul grow larger as she faced this scene so strange so oriental and she looked and looked until it became a part of her  it was all so remote and so splendid there the great violetshadowed sails of ships stood as she had seen them in pictures of the sea there a gleaming steamer ran trailing great banners of smoke there glittered the white bodies and slant wings of gulls dipping upshooting and whirling to her eyes this was infinity and the purple mist in which the ships drave was ultimate mystery  at last she turned to look behind her there on the left stood rows of immense houses barred and grated like jails or fortresses palaces where lived the mighty ones of chicago commerce before their doors carriages stood with attendants in livery such as she had read about and had never seen up and down the curving ribbon of lavender sand other carriages were driving with jingle of silver chains and soft roll of wheels the horses flung foam from their bits they were magnificent horses she knew horses as well as any coachman and their brasstrimmed harnesses glittered in the sun like burnished gold  there was no noise here beyond the tread of these stately horses the babble of a few softvoiced children on the grass and the crackling infrequent splash of the leaping breakers it was a wide contrast to the chicago of her first glimpses the day before that side of the city terrified her this oppressed and awed her the social splendor of this life appealed to her perception as it would not to any man her quick imagination peopled these mansions with beautiful women and lordly men and she felt herself rightful claimant of a place among them  she turned and faced them with set teeth and a singular look in her halfclosed eyes and in her heart she said before i die ill go where i please in this city ill be counted as good as any of youpoor as i am  to the onlookerto mrs oliver frost she was a girl in a picturesque attitude to the coachmen on the carriages she was a possible nursegirl to the policeman she was a speck on the lakefront lawn                                       something of this mood was with her still when she went in to dinner with mary mary ushered the way beaming with joy rose never looked more beautiful nor more imperious the boston man was properly astonished the jew salesman smiled till his chubby face seemed not able to contain his gladness mr taylor a gaunt young man alone seemed unmoved the morose teacher gave a sigh of sad envy  rose said little during the meal she cordially hated mr reed at once his boston accent annoyed her and his brutal sarcasm upon the west aroused a new anger in her she had never listened to such talk before it didnt seem possible anybody could disparage the west  civilization stops he said during the meal after you leave the hudson riveh  some folks manners stop after they leave the hudson river if they ever had any mary replied and the jew cackled joyously  he defended chicago it is the greatest place to do business in the world im a new yorker by birth but chicago suits me i like its hustle  thats the point it thinks of nothing but hustle said the boston man i was speaking of higher things it lacks the art atmosphere of boston and cambridge  it has all the atmosphere i need said the jew  to rose all this was new it had not occurred to her to differentiate the cities sharply from one another chicago to her was a great city a splendid example of enterprise and it was to be her city the pride of the west to the country mind a city is a great city when it acquires a million people like the young jew rose had not missed any atmosphere the tall young man voiced her opinion when he said  this finicky criticism dont count you might just as well talk about the lack of gondolas and old palaces in boston conditions here are unexampled its a new town and i think a splendid place to live of course you can find fault anywhere  rose looked at him with interest such precision and unhesitancy of speech she had not heard since leaving college  mary glowed with gratified admiration the jew was delighted although he did not quite follow the implied rebuke miss fletcher merely said  if mr reed dont like chicago he is privileged to go back to boston i dont think chicago would experience any shock if he did  mr reed wilted a little but he was not crushed  the trouble with you people is you dont know anything about any other city you come in here from oshkosh and kalamazoo and okookono  hit him on the back called mary hes choking  oconomowoc calmly interpreted miss fletcher  reed recoveredand a lot more outlandish places  how about squantum and skowhegan and passamaquoddy laughed mary  reed collapsedo well those are old familiar  the others shouted with laughter  o yes everything old and new england goes you are too provincial old boy you want to broaden out ive seen a lot of fellows like you come here snapping and snarling at chicago and end up by being wild promoters the jew was at the bat and the table applauded every hit  rose did not share in the talkshe had so little knowledge of citiesbut it served to make mr taylor a strong figure in her eyes he was tall and bigboned and unsmiling he studied her with absentminded interest and she felt no irritation or embarrassment for his eyes were clean and thoughtful he looked at her as if she called up memories of some one he had loved in another world and she somehow grew a little sad under his gaze  as they sat in her room after dinner mary asked  how do you like our crowd  i cant tell yet i dont like that boston man i never could bear the sound of ah  hes a chump but they aint all like that i have met two or three decent boston fellows down in the office dont think they are all muffs  of course not  now take my boss for example hes fine hes big enough so you dont mind his airs but what do you think of mr taylor  rose looked thoughtful and mary hastened to say  aint he fine she hoped to forestall criticism  yes i think hes fine he makes me think of professor jenks  ahugh so he does me say rose im going to tell you something dont you ever tell will you  why noof course not  hope to die  hope to die hands crossed  well  well  i came here to board because he was here  why mary compton  aint it awful of course no one knows it but you id just die if he knew it i used to be afraid that hed find out but he cant because you see he never saw me till i came here and he thinks it is just accident hes so simple about such things anyway and hes always dreaming of something away off o hes wonderful hes been all over the mountains he adores john muiryou know that man professor ellis told us about well hes lived just that way weeks and weeks in the wildest mountains and its just glorious to hear him tell about it  rose was astonished at mary generally so selfcontained she talked as if she had volumes to tell and but short minutes to tell them in her cheeks glowed and her eyes grew deep and dark  hes here reading law but he dont need to work hes got a share in a big mine out there somewhere which he discovered himself he just thought hed try civilization awhile he said and so he came to chicago he kind o pokes around the law school its in our buildingthats where i saw him first in the elevator just as an excuse he hates the law he told me so he comes in to see me sometimes of course i leave the door open she smiled but it dont make any difference to him hes just the same here as he is anywherei mean he knows how to treat a woman the schoolmaam said she thought it was terrible to have a man come into your roomthe same room you sleep inbut i told her it depended on the man that settled her for oweni mean mr taylordont like her  rose listened in silence to this torrent of words from mary her mind was naturally fictive and she divined the immense world suggested by the girls incoherent sentences the mysterious had come to her friendthe one man of all the world apparentlya striking personality quite suited to mary with her practical ways and love of fun it confirmed her in her conviction that a girl must adventure into the city to win a place and a husband  she rose and put her arms about her friends neck  im so glad mary  o goodness dont congratulate me hes never said a wordand maybe he wont i cant understand himanyway its great fun  a slow step crossed the hall and a rap at the door nearly took away marys breath for a moment she could not reply then mr taylors voice was heard  i beg your pardon he was turning away when mary sprang up and opened the door  o mr taylor is it you  yesi didnt know but you and your friend would like to go out somewhere  would you rose  not tonight thank you but you go dont keep in on my account  mary struggled a moment then she smiled with tender archness  very well thank you mr taylor ill be ready soon after he had gone she said  perhaps hell propose  rose glowed sympathetically i hope he will                                       the next day rose went down town alone the wind had veered to the south the dust blew and the whole terrifying panorama of life in the streets seemed some way blurred together and forms of men and animals were like figures in tapestry the grind and clang and clatter and hiss and howl of the traffic was all about her  she came upon the river just as the bridge was being opened down toward the lake which had to her all the wonder and expanse of the sea boats lay thickly steamers from deep water long narrow and black excursion boats gleaming white and trimmed with shining brass lay beside the wharves and lowlying tugs sturdy rowdyish little things passed by floating like ducks and pulling like bulldogs guiding great twomasted sailing boats and long low grimy steamers with high decks at the ends the river ran below graygreen covered with floating refuse mountainous buildings stood on either side of the waterway  the draw as it began to move made a noise precisely like an old fashioned threshing machinea rising howl which went to her heart like a familiar voice her eyes for a moment released hold upon the scene before her and took a slant far over the town to the coulé farm and the days when the threshing machine howled and rattled in the yard came back and she was rushing to get dinner ready for the crew  when the bridge returned to its place she walked slowly across studying each vista to the west other bridges swarming with people arched the streamon each side was equal mystery these wonderful great boats and their grim brave sailors she had read about but had never seen they came from far up the great tumultuous lake and they were going to anchor somewhere in that wild tangle of masts and chimneys and towering big buildings to the west they looked as if they might go to the ends of the earth at the stern of an outgoing boat four sailors were pulling at a rope the leader singing a wild thrilling song in time to the action  so it wasthe wonderful and the terrifying appealed to her mind first in all the city she saw the huge and the fierce she perceived only contrasts she saw the ragged newsboy and the towering policeman she saw the ragpickers the street vermin with a shudder of pity and horror and she saw also the gorgeous show windows of the great stores she saw the beautiful new gowns and hats and she saw also the curious dress of swart italian girls scavenging with baskets on their arms their faces were old and grimy their voices sounded like the chattered colloquies of monkeys in the circus  it all seemed a battlefield there was no hint of repose or home in it all people were just staying here like herself trying to get work trying to make a living trying to make a name they had left their homes as she had and though she conceived of them as having a foothold she could not imagine them having reached security the homelife of the city had not revealed itself to her  she made her way about the first few blocks below water street looking for dr herricks address it was ten oclock and the streets were in a frenzy of exchange the sidewalks were brooks the streets rivers of life which curled into doors and swirled around mountainous buildings  it was almost pathetic to see how helpless she seemed in the midst of these alien sounds it took away from her the calm almost scornful selfreliance which characterized her in familiar surroundings her senses were as acute as a hares and sluiced in upon her a bewildering flood of sights and sounds she did not appear childish but she seemed slow and stupid which of course she was not she thought and thought till she grew sick with thought she struggled to digest all that came to her but it was like trampling sand she apparently gained nothing by her toil  the streets led away into thunderous tunnels beyond which some other strange hell of sound and stir imaginatively lay the brutal voices of drivers of cabs and drays assaulted her the clang of gongs drew her attention now here now there and her anxiety to understand each sound and to appear calm added to her confusion  she heard crashes and yells that were of murder and sudden death it was the crash of a falling bundle of sheet iron but she knew not that she looked around thinking to see some savage battle scene  she saw women with painted faces and bleached hair whom she took to be those mysterious and appalling women who sell themselves to men they were in fact simpleminded shop girls or vulgar little housewives with sad lack of taste  every street she crossed she studied looking both up and down it in the effort to see some end of its mystery they all vanished in lurid desolate distance save toward the lake out there she knew the water lay serene and blue  this walk was to her like entrance into war it thrilled and engaged her at every turn she was in the center of human life to win here was to win all she cared to have  it was a relief to pass into the rotunda of the splendid building in which dr herricks office was outside the war sounded and around her men hastened she entered the elevator as one in a dream the man hustled her through the door without ceremony and clanged the door as if it were a prison gate they soared to the ninth floor like a balloon suddenly liberated and the attendant fairly pushed her out  heres your floorherrick to the left  rose was humiliated and indignant but submitted the hallway along which she moved was marble and specklessly clean on each side doors of glass with letters in black told of the occupations of the tenants  she came at length to the halfopen door of dr herricks office and timidly entered a young girl came forward courteously  would you like to see the doctor she asked in a soft voice  yes please i have a letter to her from dr thatcher of madison  o well i will take it right in be seated please  this seemed good treatment and the soft voice of the girl was very grateful after the hoarse warcries of the street rose looked around the little room with growing composure and delight it was such a dainty little waiting room and argued something attractive in dr herrick  come right in the girl said on returning the doctor is attending to her mail but she will see you for a few moments  rose entered the second and larger room and faced a small graceful woman of keen alert gaze she appeared to be about thirtyfive years of age she shook hands briskly but not warmly  her hand was small and firm and her tone quick and decisive howdyoudo sit down i had a note from dr thatcher the other day saying i might expect you  rose took a chair while the doctor studied her sitting meanwhile with small graceful head leaning on one palm her elbow on the corner of her desk no womans eyes ever searched rose like those of this little woman and she rebelled against it inwardly as dr herrick curtly asked  well now what can i do for you dr thatcher thought i could do something for you  rose was too dazed to reply this small resolute brusque woman was a worlds wonder to her she looked down and stammered  i dont knowithought maybe you could help me to find out what i could do  the doctor studied her for an instant longer she saw a large apparently inexperienced girl a little sullen and a little embarrassedprobably stupid  dont you know what you want to do  nothat is i want to write confessed rose  write my dear girl every addlepate wants to write have you friends in the city  one a classmate  man  no a girl  why did you leave home  rose began to grow angry because i couldnt live the life of a cow or a cabbage i wanted to see the city  the doctor arose come here a moment rose obeyed and stood beside her at the window and they looked out across a stretch of roofs heaped and humped into mountainous masses blurred and blent and made appalling by smoke and plumes of steam a scene as desolate as a burntout volcanoa jumble of hot bricks jagged eavespouts gasvomiting chimneys spiked railings glass skylights and lofty spires a hideous and horrible stretch of stone and mortar cracked and seamed into streets it had no limits and it palpitated under the hot september sun boundless and savage at the bottom of the crevasses men and women speckled the pavement like minute larvæ  is that what you came here to see asked the doctor  rose drew a deep breath and faced her  yes and im not afraid of it its mighty it is grander than i expected it to begrand and terrible but its where things are done  isabel herrick studied her a little closer  youd leave your country home for this  rose turned upon her and towered above her her eyes flashed and her abundant eyebrows drew down in a dark scowl  would you be content to spend your life day and night summer and winter in dutchers coolly  pardon me said dr herrick cuttingly the problem is not the same i have not the sameithe question  yes you who are born in the city and who come up to see us on the farms for a couple of weeks in juneyou take it on yourselves to advise us to stay there you who succeed are always ready to discourage us when we come to try our fortunes i can succeed just as well as you and ill make you bow your head to me before five years are gone  rose was magnificent masterful she was flaming hot with wrath this little woman had gone too far  dr herrick turned abruptly  i guess ive made a mistake sit down again she said in softer tones  rose was not yet done she kept her lofty pose  yes you certainly have i am not afraid of this city i can take care of myself i wouldnt be under obligations to you now for the world i want you to know im not a beggar asking a dollar from you im not a schoolgirl either i know what i can do and you dont i wouldnt have troubled you only for dr thatcher she moved toward the door gloriously angry too angry to say goodday  the doctors cold little face lighted up she smiled the most radiant smile and it made her look all at once like a girl  my deari am crushed i am an ant at your feet come here now you great splendid creature and let me hug you this minute  rose kept on to the door where she turned  i dont think i ought to trouble you further she said coldly  the doctor advanced come now i beg your pardon im knocked out i took you for one of those romantic country girls who come to the cityhelpless as babes come back  rose came near going on if she had it would have lost her a good friend she felt that and so when the doctor put an arm around her to lead her back to the desk she yielded but she was still palpitating with the heat of her wrath  my dear you fairly scared me i never was so taken by surprise in my life tell me all about yourself tell me how you came to come where you areand all about it  rose told hernot all of courseshe told her of her college work of her father of the coulé of her parting from her father  o yes the doctor interrupted thats the way we go onwe new men and women the ways of our fathers are not ours its tragedy either way you put it go on  at last she had the story told with marvelous unconscious power direct personal full of appeal she looked at rose with reflective eyes for a little space  well now well take time to consider meanwhile bring me something of yours ill show it to a friend of mine an editor here and if it pleases him well know what to do meanwhile come and see me and ill introduce you to some nice people chicago is full of nice people if you only come at them come and see me tomorrow cant you o you great splendid creature i wish i had your inches she glowed with admiration  come sunday at six and dine with me yielding to a sudden impulse come early and let me talk to you  rose promised and then went out into the waiting room  etta dear this is miss dutcher this is my sister i want you to know each other the little girl tiptoed up and took roses hand with a little inarticulate murmur  there was a patient waiting but dr herrick ignored her and conducted rose to the door  goodbye dear im glad you came youve given me a good shaking up remember six sharp  she looked after rose with a wonderful glow in her heart  the girl is a geniusa jewel in the rough she thought she must be guided heavens how she towered  when she stepped into the street rose felt taller and stronger and the street was less appalling she raised her eyes to the faces of the men she met her eyes had begun their new search the men streamed by in hundreds impressive in mass but comparatively uninteresting singly  it was a sad comment upon her changing conceptions of life that she did not look at the poorly dressed men the workmen she put them aside as out of the question not consciously for the search at this stage was still unconscious involuntary like that of a bird seeking a mate moved by a law which knows neither individuals nor time  she saw also the splendor of the shop windows she had a distinct love for beautiful fabrics as works of art but she cared less for dress than one would suppose to see her pass lingeringly before great luminous cataracts of drapery she was quietly dressed and gracefully dressed beyond this she had never cared to go but she constructed wonderful homes and owners out of the glimpses of these windows and from the passing of graceful young girls clothed like duchesses and painted some of them like women of the under world  it all grew oppressive and disheartening to her at last and she boarded a state street car the only car she knew and took her way up home all the people in the car looked at her as if she had intruded into a private drawing room  she was evidently from the country for though it was in the day of quaintness she wore her hair plain it was also the middle period of the curious and inexplicable little swagger which all dulyinformed girls assumed but rose walked on her strong elastic feet with a powerful swing which was worth going miles to see it was due to her unconscious imitation of the proud carriage of william de lisle she loved that forward swing of the thigh with the flex of the side which accompanied it it was her ideal of motion that free action of knee waist and neck which she felt rather than saw in the great athlete  she made a goodly figure to look at and it was no especial wonder that the people in the car faced her her forehead was prominent and her eyes were sombre it was impossible for the casual observer to define why she made so marked an impression upon him it was because she was so fresh and strong and unaffected and unconscious  pure men did not smile at her as they might at a pretty girl they looked at her with wide quiet eyes and she knew they meant to be perfectly respectful there was one man looking at her like that when she looked up to pay the conductor there was a deep sorrowful look in his eyes and his face too was sad  she did not understand his mood but was moved by it when she looked at him again he dropped his eyes to his paper he was a large man of thirty or more and had a rugged serious face she remembered it long afterwards  at lunch she found no one but mr taylor he loomed up at the further end of the table his gaunt grave face and broad shoulders towering up like a farmers she studied him closely now that she knew more about him he had a big wide plain face with gentle gray eyes his beard was trimmed round and made him look older than he was he was a man into whose eyes women could look unafraid and unabashed he greeted rose with a smile  im very glad youve come i was afraid i should eat lunch alone with your permission ill move down to your end of the table  rose was very glad to have him take a seat near and they were friends at once they naturally fell upon mary as a topic mr taylor spoke of her quietly  marys a fine girl he said i dont like to see her work i dont like to see any woman do work like that i dont claim any right to say what women shall do or not do but i imagine they wouldnt go into shops if they were not in a way forced into it  rose defended the right of a girl to earn her own living he hastened to explain further  of course a woman should be free and independent but is she free when pressure forces her into typewriting or working in a sweatshop  rose turned his thoughts at last by asking about the west he expanded like flame at the thought  ah the old equatorial wind is blowing today and my hair crackles with electricity he smiled as he ran his hands through his hair on such days i long for my pony again sometimes when i cant stand it any longer i take a train to some little station and go out and lie flat down on the grass on my back so that i cant see anything but sky then i can almost imagine myself back again where the lone old peaks bulge against the sky do you know john muir and joaquin miller  rose shook her head his eyes glowed with enthusiasm  there are two men who know the wilderness your thoreau ive read but he dont interest me the way these rocky mountain fellows do your eastern fellows dont really know a wildernesstheyre sort o back pasture explorers john isnt a bit theatrical hes been there he doesnt take a train of guides to explore a glacier he sticks a crust of bread in his belt along with a tin cup and goes alone ive been with john in the sierras and once he came over into my range  rose defended emerson and thoreau as if she were the easterner this colorado hunter considered her as she talked he fixed great absentminded eyes upon her and absorbed every line of her face every curve of her lipsevery changing wave of color  i dont care for the wilderness as you do what is a bird compared to a man anyway i like people i want to be where dramas are being played men make the world bears dont she ended hotly  he slowly withdrew his gaze  i guess youre right he smiled a wise smile if the wilderness had been everything in the world i wouldnt be here a woman is more than a flower a woman would make my mountains a paradise  you have no right to ask a woman to go there with younot to stay she added quickly  his smile passed  youre right again unless i could find a woman who loves the wilderness as i do  that is out of the question she replied no woman loves the wildernessas a home all women love cities and streets and children she had a young persons readiness to generalize and pitilessly flung these hopeless truisms at him he arose apparently made sadder by them he sighed  but civilization carries such terrible suffering with it  rose went to her room and looked at her other letters of introduction should she present them what would be the use the scene with dr herrick had not been pleasant true it had apparently brought her a friend but it was a rigorous experience and she hardly felt it worth while at the moment to go through another such scene to win another such friend  she fell to looking over her manuscripts they were on lined paper stitched together at the top they were imitative of course and leaned toward the elizabethan drama and toward tennyson and mrs browning so far as verseform went there were also essays which she had written at college which inquired mournfully who will take the place of the fallen giants bryant longfellow emerson she had eloquent studies of hugo and valiant defences of dickens she reflected in her writing naturally all the conventional positions in literature she stood upon the graves of the dead as if she feared they might be desecrated  she was a pupil and as a pupil she had considered literature as something necessarily afar off in england or france in boston and cambridge though she had come to think chicago might be a place suitable for a humble beginning but that it might be the subject of literature had not occurred to her she had never known a person who had written a book professor ellis and the president had written scientific treatises but not being a fool she knew there was a difference between getting an article into a country weekly and getting into a big daily to say nothing of the great magazines she wished for advice being out in the world now something must be done with her writings  these essays were good and thoughtful they represented study and toil but they did not represent her real self her real emotions any more than her reading represented her real liking her emotions big vital contemporaneous had no part in this formal and colorless pedantry of this she was still ignorant however  she was sorting her poems over and dreaming about them when mary came home  o you dear ive been thinking about you all day did you see your woman doctor  yes  did you like her  well i dont knowyes i think i do i didnt at first  where else did you go  nowhere i came home to lunch  eat alone mary was taking off her things and was more than usually fragmentary  no mr taylor was there mary faced her  now see here rose dutcher do you want to break my heart into smithereens if you do you go on lunching with owen taylor  rose laughed at her tone of simulated sorrow and dismay  he moved down to my end of the table too  mary plumped into a chair and stared  well that finishes me im coming home to lunch after this if you prove a terrater ill have your back hair rose dutcher  i couldnt help it he didnt want to shout at me across the table  marys voice softened  what did you talk about  he talked about you  did he what did he say  he said you were a good girl and you are  is that all  what more could you ask  he might ave praised me beauty then she laughed and rushed at rose and hugged her for some reason not expressed  isnt he just grand  im going out to dinner sunday night  where woman doctors  yes i met her sister too  o youll soon be getting so swell you wont notice us well anyhow youll leave me owen                                       in the mood in which she went to sleep that night there was no premonition of conquest the tide of her life sank low it was impossible for her to succeedshe a little country girl of five feet nine she looked at her bulk as it showed under the quilts how small a thing she was to be set over against the mighty city  and yet napoleon was less than she and patti and edwin booth were not so large the life of a great actor like edwin booth a singer like patti interested her deeply she wondered that they could do things like other people they were so public so admired so lifted into the whitehot glare of success  she brought her mind back to the point they succeeded small beings though they were they faced the millions of the earth and became the masters the kings and queens of art  by what necromancy did they do this if it was born in them then there was hope for her if they reached it by toil then surely there was hope for her     chapter xvii  her first dinner out   rose went to see the parts of the city which no true chicagoan ever visits that is to say she spent sunday in the park admiring with pathetic fortitude the sward the curving drives and the bridges and the statues in company with the lowly and nameless multitudeshe even crowded in to see the animals  she had intended to get back to church conformable to marys programme which was to start in st james and go in rotation to all the great churches and hear the choirs but it happened that on this first sunday there was a fine west wind and the threemasters were setting sail to the north close inshore and when rose found she could sit on the park benches and see those mighty birds sail by she was content to do that and nothing more  she had no cheap easy and damnable comparisons the passage of each purplesailed lumber freighter was a poem to her they floated noiselessly effortlessly on a beautiful sea of color they drove like butterflies in dreams their motive power indiscernible  she sat with her chin in her palm her big eyes like beautiful windows letting in the sunshine and the grace of ships and clouds without effort fixed in an ecstasy of reverie around her streamed floods of the citys newly acquired residents clerks bookkeepers typewriters shopgirls butchers boys salesmen all fresh from the small towns and from the farms of the west as the ships passed she gave her attention to these peoplerecognized in them many familiar types there was the smart young man son of the tavernkeeper in cyene there was the blundering big wag ed smith of molasses gap assistant shipping clerk in smith  rydals hardware store now there were types like mary hearty loudvoiced cheery wholesome whom the city could never rob of their native twang there were tom and grace and elsa and bert and all the rest of the bright restless spirits of the country towns and wideawake school districts come to try their fortunes in the great city like herself  they wore bargains in readymade clothing pretty generally but it was uptodate and they were all clean as a new dime they laughed shouted jokes scuffled and pushed the girls quite in the good country way they made quaint and sometimes insolent remarks about the park and its adornments assuming blasé airs as old residents and pointing out to the later arrivals the various attractions  there came by other groups as alien as the foregoing were familiar darkskinned queer bowlegged bewhiskered little men followed by their wives and children all sallow and crooked  they were all foreigners great droves whole neighborhoods drifted along chattering unintelligible languages incomprehensible to the country girl as the chinese whether they were italians or jews or bohemians she could not tell but she could see the marks of hunger and hard work on their pallid faces these were no doubt the people who moved about under the murk of that deadly region through which she had been borne by her train that first night  she went home from this first visit to the park oppressed and overborne with the multitude of her new impressions she felt quite as she did upon her return from the art institute to which she had hastened early in the first week so much that was artificially beautiful tired her and irritated her like eating a meal of honey and sponge cake her head ached with the formal curves of the drives with the unchanging fixedness of the statues just as the unnatural murky tones of the landscapes in frames gave her vague discomfort  in the few days between her meeting with isabel and her dinner she saw the wheat exchange which interested her mightily like battle she went again to the art institute she visited other parks she went to the top of the masonic temple and did many other things which the native highclass chicagoan prides himself on never doing happily she apprehended not the enormity of her offence on the contrary she was seeing life and this feeling compensated her when she did not otherwise enjoy a sight it was a duty and she felt grateful to the unknown city officials for the chance to see these things even if it nearly broke her neck and tired her out to see them she looked forward to her dinner with great interest she had thought a great deal about dr herrick and had come to the conclusion that she was not much to blame i suppose she thought i was a poor helpless ninny coming to ask her for a job she said to mary  well she couldnt have had much gumption mary loyally replied  mary came home from a walk with mr taylor on purpose to help rose fix up and get off but found her quite dressed and watching the clock  well you are a prompt one stand up now and let me see if youre all right  rose obediently stood and was twirled about in various lights  thats fine that grey dress is such a fit and scarlet goes well with it o you sweet thing howre you going to get home  walk of course  shall i send owen over for you  they both laughed at her tone  o what a selfsacrificing friend rose exclaimed i guess i can walk home alone im not afraid of the dark  o it aint that it would be sweller to have some one come after you  well you and owen both come  well ill see if i feel safe by ninethirty ill send him but if youre not back here by ten oclock ill be after ye this made them both laugh again  where is this address  rose gave her the card  why this is away up in the swell part my aint you comin on mary clucked with her tongue youll be calling on the lake drive soon  rose looked neat and altogether well composed in her simple grey dress and soberhued bonnet and gloves she wasnt in the very latest fall fashion of course but she was not noticeably out of vogue she felt quite at ease as she walked up the street  this ease began to desert her as the houses grew larger and the doorplates more ornate what if dr herrick lived in one of these houses they were not of course palatial like those houses on the lake front but they looked too grand for any of her friends to live in them her fear of getting tangled in social intricacies grew keener as she walked up the steps to a large creamcolored brick building the mystery of flats was to be faced the entrance was tiled and flecklessly clean on the right were three bells one above the other over the second one she saw dr herricks name she pulled the bell and waited for developments  suddenly a hollow voice hoarse and breathy pushed from the wall  kim roight up she turned to the inner door which opened mysteriously and a small boy in buttons motioned her to the elevator she began to comprehend and felt grateful to the small boy for his considerate gravity  at the landing the door was opened by etta the pretty little sister  she said howdoyoudo in her soft timid little voice and let rose into an exquisite little bedroom off the hall and asked her to lay off her hat she stood in awe of rose who seemed very large and stern to her  rose felt a little nervous about what was to come after but contrived to keep outwardly calm while following her gentle guide out into the hall and forward into a small reception room isabel arose and greeted her with a smile of delight  ah here you are do you know i began to fear you were mythicalthat id dreamed you warren this is miss dutcher miss dutcher mr mason a slow large man stepped forward and looked her in the face with penetrating eyes he was a little taller than she was and his face had a weary look he was blond as a norwegian and his voice was very beautiful  i am very glad youre not a myth he said and his face lost its tired look for a moment  this is my nephew mr paul herrick a slim young man came up to shake hands he was plainly a college man and rose comprehended him at once  isabels voice changed and a little flush came to her face as she put her hand on the shoulder of a tall blackbearded man standing quietly in the shadow  this is dr sanborn my husbandwhoistobe  if nothing happens he smiled as he shook hands  if she doesnt conclude to take me instead remarked mason  rose had perception enough at command to feel the powerful personalities grouped about her she sat near dr sanborn with whom she was at ease at once he was so awkward and so kindly he took off his glasses and polished them carefully as if anxious to see her better  isabel tells me you gave her a little lecture the other day im glad of it we city folks need it once in a while we get to thinking that country folks are necessarily fools and stupids by reason of our farcecomedies and our socalled comic weeklies  were not so bad as that said rose  of course not nobody could be so bad as that  isabel sat down near mason i tell you warren that girl has a future before her  no doubt it couldnt well be behind her  dont be flippant see that head but it aint thatshe has power i feel it she made me feel it i want you to see some of her writing and see what can be done for her  mason looked bored writes does she  of course she writes see that head i say  i see the head and its a handsome head ill concede that so is sanborns but he cant write a prescription without a printed form  o well if you are in the mood to be irreverent  masons face lighted up there you can write anyone who is capable of a touch like thatin the presence of gods men should be meek at the same time i would hasten to warn you the doctor is becoming marvelously interested in this girl with a future he has faced her he is actually touching her knee with his forefinger  isabel laughed he always does that when he argues anything it wont do any harm  it mightnt do you any harm but that innocent country girl  she can take care of herself you should have heard her put me down in my chair i want you to take her in to dinner  imadam etta is my choice after the hostess of course im a little shy of these girls who write  well you take me in and ill let paul take rose but i want her to sit by you i invited you of all the men of my vast acquaintance because i hoped your trained and fictive eye would see and appreciate her  my trained and fictive eye is regarding her but maybe she is like an impressionist painting better seen at a little distance i confess she is attractive at this focus but o if her mind  you need not worry about her mind shes a genius well i guess professor roberts is not coming suppose we go in  arent we rather formal tonight  well yes but dr sanborn had no dinner in the middle of the day so i transferred ours  im glad you did for im hungry too  and so it happened rose found herself seated beside the big blond man whose face seemed so weary and so old paul sat on her left and they chatted easily on college affairs he was from ann arbor he told her  rose looked with wonder at dr herrick she was quite another woman entirely unprofessional her face was warm with color and she wore an exquisite dress simple as a uniform yet falling into graceful soft folds about her feet her brown hair was drawn about her pretty head in wavy masses her eyes sparkled with the pleasure and pride of being hostess to such company altogether she looked scarcely older than rose the table was set with tall candles with colored shades and the simple little dinner was exquisitely served at the same time it all seemed artificial and unhomelike to rose the home which had no cellar and no yard was to her false transitory and unwholesome no matter how lovely the walls might be air seemed lacking and the free flow of electricity it was like staying in a hotel  mason turned to her after a little talk with etta  and so you have joined the stream of fortuneseekers setting always to the city do you feel yourself to be a part of a predestinated movement  i did not when i startedi do now  thats right this is the napoleon of cities a city of colossal vices and colossal virtues it is now devouring one day it will begin to send back its best arterial blood into the nation my metaphor is a bit questionable but that is due to my two minds concerning this saladi alternately curse and bow down in wonder before this city its future is appalling to think of in 1920 it will be the mightiest center of the english speaking racethank you ill not take any more dressingi envy you young people who come now when the worst of the fight against material greed is nearly over we who have given twenty years of our livesi beg your pardon i dont know why i should moralize for your benefiti meant to say i hope you have not come to chicago to make your living  why yesi hope tobut my father gives me a little to live on till i find something to do  thats good then sit down and watch the city it doesnt matter how humble your living placesit above the citys tumult observe it laugh at it but dont fight itdont mix in the grind keep it in your brain dont let it get into your blood  rose looked at him in wonder his voice was so quiet and his words so vibrant with meaning  i never felt so drawn to a woman in my life isabel said to her betrothed i dont pretend to understand it i just love her this minute  with due qualifications i can agree with you my dear she is very promising indeed  she has the power that compels i wish shed get hold of mason isabel smiled wisely you see mason is really listening to her now and poor etta is left alone i wish professor roberts were here hes such good fun for her before the evenings out every man in the house will be around that wisconsin girl and i dont blame em a bit  a little later the maid announced professor roberts  ah bring him right in mary  a cheery voice was heard in the hallway  dont rise ill find a place somewhere i am delinquent i know whats thisa roast  now dont you pretend to be starving just to please me this sunday evening dinner was given for me especially said sanborn  hungry of course im hungry ive come all the way from fiftysecond street  professor roberts was a middleaged man with a chin whisker he had a small elegant figure and his eyes were humorous  everybody took on new life the moment he came in  the fact is i got bridged he explained after being introduced to rose  all from living on the south side said paul  i knowi know however somebody must live on the south side and so i stay to keep up the general average  how modest and kind of you  professor belongs to the university settlementdown near the indiana line explained paul to rose  anybodyd think to hear you north siders talk that fiftysecond street was at the uttermost parts of the earth  it is  well we dont have weekly burglaries on our side  we no longer sing lily dale and the sankey hymns up here  all this banter was amusing to rose it opened to her the inner social landmarks of the city she didnt know before that there was a west side and a north side to the city  professor roberts bubbled over with fun he was curiously like some of the men rose had known at bluff siding his chin whiskers his mirthful eyes and his hearty laughter were familiar as a dandelion what could he be professor of she thoughtand asked her neighbor  paul told her hes professor of geology and paleontology and knows besides a tremendous lot about bugs and animals he made a trip up into the yukon country last year he was gone eighteen months with no one but a couple of indian guides hes a big fellow for all hes so jolly and everyday in his manners  the talk that went on was a revelation to the country girl the three men addressed themselves to isabel and every conceivable subject received some sort of mention roberts joked incessantly and dr sanborn held him a good second while mason said the most enigmatical things in his smooth melodious bass his face lost its heavy look under the eyes and his smile was very attractivethough he never laughed  rose sat with the other young people absorbed in the touch and go brilliancy and fun of the talk it was wonderful to rose that one little woman could sit so masterful and at ease before three such keen conversationalists as these men seemed to her  after dinner they took on a quieter tone mason asked the privilege of ruminating over his coffee and cigar  ruminate yes but dont make it an excuse for going to sleep said isabel you must wake up at any rate and tell us a story before the evening is over  she got roberts started on his recent trip to see the indian snake dance at walpi and they listened breathlessly till he rounded up safely halfanhour later then dr sanborn was called upon  come doctor we must have your song  his song exclaimed roberts  one song asked mason  one song alone is all he knows and the only way he acquired that was by damnable iteration it was a cheerful lay sung by his nurse in the hospital during a spell of brain fever explained isabel  is this thing unavoidable asked mason in illy concealed apprehension  thus we earn our dinner replied roberts to what length this love of food will carry a man  well lets have the agony over at once  the doctor lifted his tall frame to the perpendicular as if pulled by a string and marching to the piano waited for etta to play the chords his face was expressionless but his eyes laughed  his voice shook the floor with the doleful cadences of a distressing ballad about a man who murdered his wife because she was untrew and was afterwards haunted by a figger in white with pityous eyes and cries he eventually died of remorse and the ballad ended by warning all men to refrain from hasty judgments upon their wives  amen so say we all professor roberts heartily agreed a lively discussion was precipitated by mason who said the man must be judged by the facts before him at the time the deed was done not afterwards ive no doubt there are wives whose murder would be justifiable homicide  isabel interrupted it at last by saying that will do that is quite enough you are on the road to vituperation  miss dutcher you will sing for us wont you  o i dont sing rose turned upon her in terror  really and truly  really and truly  then you play  i have no accomplishments at all all the music i can make is a whistle and a jewsharp i assure you  this set roberts off ah la belle siffleuse we will hear you whistle dr sanborn miss dutcher can whistle  rose shrank back o i cant whistle before company i learned on the farm i was alone so much  they fell upon her in entreaties and at last she half promised  if you wont look at me  turn down the gas shouted roberts  they made the room dim there was a little silence and then into the room crept a keen little sweet piping sound it broadened out into a clear fluting and entered upon an old dance tune as she went on she put more and more go into it till roberts burst out with a longdrawn nasal cry sashay all and rose broke down into a laugh everybody shouted bravo  roberts exulted o but id like to see an oldfashioned country dance again give us another oldfashioned tune  i dont know that i do them right said rose i hear the fiddlers playing them  more more cried roberts i like those old things mason here pretends not to know them but hes danced them many a time  rose whistled more of the old tunes haste to the wedding honest john polly perkins and at last reached some fantastic furious tunes which she had caught from the norwegian fiddlers  then she stopped and they turned up the light she looked a little ashamed of her performance and isabel seemed to understand it so she said  now that is only fooling and im going to ask miss dutcher to read some of her verses to us dr thatcher writes me that she does verses excellently well this sobered the company at once as it well might and rose was in despair  o no dont ask me to do that please  this is your chance rise to it insisted isabel  if you will ill sing my song again for you sanborn said  at last rose gave up resistance her heart beat so terribly hard she felt smothered but she recited a blank verse poem it was an echo of tennyson of course not exactly enoch arden but reminiscent of it but the not too critical taste of dr sanborn and prof roberts accepted it with applause  mason stole a sly look at isabel who did not give up she asked for one more and rose read a second selection a spasmodic equally artificial graft a supposedly deeply emotional lyric an echo of mrs browning with a third line which went plumping to the deeps of passion after a rhyme it had power in it and a sort of sincerity in the reading which carried even isabel awaybesides that her magnificent figure was a poem in itself  what a voice you have she said as she seized her by the hands you read beautifullyand you write well too  rose noticed that mr mason the large man said nothing at all in the midst of the talk the maid approached isabel  some one has called for miss dutcher every one shook hands with her cordially they received her as an equal that was evident  isabel went in with rose to help her put on her things  my dear youve pleased them all and ive just fallen in love with you im going to have you at the womans club you must come and see me come often wont you  i shall be glad to rose said simply but her face was flushed and her eyes shining with joy  owen was outside in the hall alone  didnt mary come too  no she concluded it would look awkward if she came and stood outside the door  they walked along side by side taylor considered it an affectation to offer a strong young woman his arm except at critical passages of the street  did you have a good time  o splendid she said the joy of her social success upon her it was lovely i never met such fine people everything was so full of fun and they were intellectual too dr herrick is wonderful mr mason too  what mr mason  warren mason i think they call him  is that so warren mason is considered one of the finest newspaper men in the city all the fellows look up to him  im glad i met him o now i see dr herrick invited him there to hear me read i made a failure im afraid  she thought so more and more as the rose color of her little triumph grew gray she ended by tossing to and fro on her bed raging to think how foolishly she had acted the long poem was bad she saw it now it was involved and twisted and dull she saw masons face darken again and it seemed now it wore a look of disgust  and the whistling good heavens was there no limit to her folly her childishness  so she writhed and groaned her hopes all pathetically trampled and dustcovered now everybody would hear of her idiocy she had been so determined to do something worth while and she had read her worst lines and whistledwhistled like a cowboy  the houses of the lake shore seemed like impenetrable castles in the deep of her despair and masons words about the city grew each moment deeper in meaning                                       after rose left dr herrick came back into the room radiant  there what do you think of her am i crazy or not i claim to have discovered a genius  my dear seems to me thatcher has a prior claim  well anyhow she is a genius dont you think so warren  she can whistle  o dont be so enigmatical it is out of place shes got power you cant deny that  time enough to say what she can do when she finds out what pollyrot she is writing now the whistling interested me he added malevolently  isabels face darkened a little  i understand this is one of your prank nights but i shall not allow it to affect me you cannot sneer down that beautiful girl  im not sneering her down i am merely indicating where she needs help she is a glorious creature physically and shes keen mentallymorally no doubt shes well instructedafter the manner of country girlsbut esthetically shes in a sorrowful way taste is our weak point in america and in the rural regionswell there isnt any taste above that for shortcake dollar chromos and the new york repository  hes started hes off said roberts now i like the girls verses they are full of dignity and fervor it seems to me  full of fever you mean you specialists in nerve diseases and spotted bugs wouldnt know a crass imitation of tennyson if you had it in a glass vial its such poor creatures as you who keep these young writers imitating successes the girl has a fine roll of voice and a splendid curve of bust and that made the stuff she read poetryto impressionable persons  oh oh oh chorused the young people  roberts you are a sensualist sanborn interposed gravely  mason imperturbably proceeded  the girl has power of some sort i rather suspect it to be dramatic but thats mimetic and of a low order anyway her primary distinction with me consists in something quite other than these the girl has character and thats saying a good deal about a woman especially a girl she has departed widely from the conventional type without losing essential womanliness  ah now we are coming at it they all exclaimed as they drew around him with exaggerated expressions of interest  the girl is darkly individual and very attractive because of it but you make of her a social success as i can see isabel is planning to do and get her to wearing lownecked dresses and impoverishing her people and youll take all the charm out of her  i dont believe it said isabel  it hasnt hurt dr herrick put in roberts i must say id like to see the girl in a lownecked dresshe waved his hand to hold them in check now hold on i know that sounds bad but i mean it all right  oh no doubt they laughed at his embarrassment  mason interposed roberts long stay among the wallapi and tlinkit wigwams has perverted his naturally moral nature  roberts shook his hands in deprecation but made no further protest  sanborn said its a serious thing to advise a girl like that what do you intend to do isabel is a social success the thing the girl needs  it wont do her any harm to meet nice peopleof course she ought not to go out too much if shes going to write  you amuse me mason began again in his measured way first because you assume that the girl can go where she pleases  she can too if shes got the quality we think she has chicago society isnt the new york four hundred were all workers here  workers and thieves mason went on but if the girl has the quality i think she has she will map out her own career and follow it irresistibly the question that interests me is thishow did the girl get here why didnt she stay on the farm like susan and sally and ed and joe how did she get through college without marrying harry or tommy these are the vital questions  i dont know replied isabel i thought of those things but of course i couldnt ask her on first acquaintance  mason lifted his eyebrows ah you drew the line at love and marriage most women  isabel resented this  im not most womenim not even a type dont lecture me please  i beg your pardon isabel youre quite right his tone was sincere and restored peace i always except you in any generalization  this is the most significant thing of all isabel said finally the girl has set us talking of her as if she were a personage instead of a girl from a wisconsin valley  thats true mason admitted shes of the countless unknown hundreds of the brightest minds from the country streaming into the city side by side with the most vicious and licentious loafers of the towns it leaves the country dull but moral the end is not yet in the end the dull and moral people survey the ruined walls of the bright and vicious  and the dull and the moral are prolific sanborn put in  precisely and they can eat and sleep which gives them long life and vast stomachs  roberts sprang up i propose to escape while i can mason is wound up for all night there was a little bustle of parting and eventually sanborn and mason walked off together  its no time to go to sleep come to my room and smoke a pipe suggested mason im in a mood to talk if youre in a mood to listen  sanborn was a modest fellow who admired his friend i am always ready to listen to you he said  probably that is your amiable weakness mason dryly responded     chapter xviii  mason talks on marriage   men are not easily intimate they confide in each other rather seldom of love and marriage coarse men speak with sneers and obscene jests of these deep themes serious men speak in hints with apologetic smiles as if they were betraying a weakness seldom going to any length of statement they express their meaning in broken sentencesin indirect statements  sanborn had known mason for some years they were both from the country mason from a small interior town in illinois sanborn from indiana mason was an older man than sanborn and generally presumed upon it also upon sanborns reticence  they rode up the elevator in the berkeley flats in silence and in silence they removed their coats and filled their pipes and took seats before the fire mason was accustomed to say he supported two rooms and an open grate fire and he regretted it was not cold enough to have the grate lighted for that evening  they sat some minutes in smoke mason sitting low in his chair with face in repose looked old and tired and sanborn was moved to say  mason im going to ask you a plump question why dont you get married youre getting old  ive tried to  what tried to  exactly  that is incredible  it is the fact replied the older man placidly  sanborn did not believe it he knew mason to be somewhat seclusive in his life but he also knew the high place he held in the eyes of several women  mason went on finally in his best manner as sanborn called it  for ten years ive been trying to marry and ive been conscientious and thorough in my heart too  sanborn was violently interested he drew a long breath of smoke  what seems to be the matter  dont hurry me for one thing i suppose ive gone too far in my knowledge of women ive gone beyond the capability of being bamboozled i see too much of the ropes and props that do sustain the pasteboard rosetree  that is flat blasphemy put in sanborn i know more about women than you do and  i dont mean to say that women deceive in a base wayoften they are not intentionally deceptive but hereditarilytransmitted necessarily defensive wiles lead them to turn their best side toward men before i was thirty i could still call upon a young woman without observing she received me in a room shadowed to conceal her crowsfeet the prearranged position of the chairs and color of the lampshade did not trouble me  he seemed to pause over some specific case and once i believed a girl wore a patch on her chin to conceal a sore now i know she does it to locate a dimple i know perfectly well what any young woman would do if i called upon her tomorrow she would take a seat so that the softest shadows would fall over her face if she had good teeth she would smile often if her teeth were poor she would be grave if her arms were fair her sleeves would be loose if they were thin shed wear ruffles if she had a fine bosom her dress would be open a little at the neck  o look here mason sanborn interrupted i cant listen to such calumny without protest  i dont mean to say that all this would be conscious as a matter of fact it is innocent and unintentional a woman does not deliberately say i have a dimple therefore i will smile she inherited the dimples and the smile from a long line of coquettes women are painfully alike from generation to generation its all moonshine and misty sky about their infinite variety  suppose i grant thatwhos to blame mind you i dont grant itbut suppose i do for argument  you are a lover and a fortunate man you have in isabel a woman of character mark you these wiles and seductions on the part of women were forced upon them i admit that they have been forced to use them in defense for a million years had they been our physical superiors unquestionably the lying graces would have been ours at the same time it doesnt help me i cant trust such pastmasters in deceit albeit they deceive me to my good  are we not deceptive also it seems to me the same indictment would hold regarding men  undoubtedlybut we are not now under indictment you asked me a questioni am answering it this silenced sanborn effectually mason refilled his pipe and then resumed  again i cant seem to retain a vital interest in any given casethat is to say an exclusive interest  that is a relic of polygamy sanborn said i imagine we all have moments when we feel that old instinct tumbling around in our blood  i meet a woman today who seems to possess that glamour which the romantic poets and highfalutin novelists tell us the woman of our choice must have i go home exultingat last i am to reach the mystic happiness marriage is supposed to bring but tomorrow i meet her and the glamour is faded i go again and again every spark of electric aureole vanishes we get to be good friends maybenothing more  perhaps a friendship like that is the best plane for a marriage isabel and i have never pretended to any schoolboy or schoolgirl sentiment  mason replied in such wise sanborn did not know whether to think him bitterly in earnest or only lightly derisive  that would overturn all the sentiment and lovelore of a thousand years it would make every poet from sappho down to swinburne a pretender or a madman such ideas are supreme treason to all the inspired idiots of poetry no glamour we must have  sanborn smiled broadly but mason did not see him  so i say marry young or marry on the impulse or youll come at last to my condition when no head wears an aureole  i wonder what started you off on this trail mason  mason pushed on resolutely  i have become interested and analytical in the matter i follow up each case and catalogue it away this failure due to a distressing giggle that to an empty skull this to a bad complexion that to a too ready sentiment if i could marry while the glamour lasts i admit i have met many women whose first appeal filled me with hope if i might contrive to marry then it might be done once for all that of course is impossible because no woman i am forced to admit would discover any seductive glamour in a taffycolored blond like me my glamour comes out upon intimate acquaintance  perhaps the glamour needed could be developed on closer acquaintance with women who seem plain at first sight  possibly but i cant go about developing glamour in strange plain women they might not understand my motives  sanborn laughed dismally  then the case seems to me hopeless  precisely the case seems hopeless after ten years careful study of the matter i have come to the conclusion that i was born to something besides matrimony cases of glamour get less and less common now and i foresee the time when the most beautiful creature in the world will possess no glamour  sanborn imaginatively entered into this gloomy mood nothing will then remain but death  exactly peaceful old age and decay but there are deeper deeps to this marriage question as i warn you now on the eve of your venture i find in myself a growing inability to conceive of one woman in the light of an exclusive ideal an ideal of more interest than all the world of women i am troubled by the possible woman  i dont quite conceive  i mean the woman who might quite possibly appeal to me in a more powerful and beautiful way than the one i have i am not prepared as i approach the point to say i will love and cherish till death in the unknown deeps of life there are other women more alluring more beautiful still so i must refuse to make a promise which i am not sure i can keep  isabel and i have agreed to leave that out of our ceremony said sanborn also the clause which demands obedience from her  i am watching you if your experiment succeeds and i can find a woman as fine and sensible and selfreliantbut there again my confounded altruism comes in i think also of the woman ought i to break into the orderly progress of her life i cant afford to throw myself away i cant afford to place a barrier between me and the possible woman and per contra neither can the woman afford to make a mistake it bears harder upon women than it does upon men when the glorious possible woman comes along i want to be free so the woman might reasonably want to be free when the ideal man comes along  if you really love these considerations would not count  mason waved a silencing palm  that will do ive heard those wise words before i am ready to be submerged in such excluding emotions  mason said sanborn one of two things i must believe either that you have fallen in love with that superb country girl tonight or youve been giving me a chapter from your new novel  mason looked around with a mystic gleam in his eyes  well which is it     chapter xix  rose sits in the blaze of a thousand eyes   life quickened for the coulé girl she accommodated herself to the pace of the daily papers with instant facility she studied the amusement columns and read the book reviews and frequented the beautiful reading room of the newberry library she went to all the matinees taking gallery tickets of course ever mindful of her slender resourcesstudying as truly as intently as if she were still at college  she had told her father that three hundred dollars would carry her through till june and she was determined it should do so she had not begun to think of any work to do beyond her writing her mind was still in unresthere lifes problem was seemingly more difficult of solution than ever  she took hold upon the city with the power of a fresh mind capable of enormous feeling and digesting she seemed to be in the world at last plunged in it enveloped by it and she came to delight in the roar and tumult of it all as if it were the sound of winds and waters and each day she entered upon a little wider circle of adventure once the first confusion was past the movement and faces of the crowds were of endless interest to her she walked down into the city every day returning to her little nook in the noisy flat building as the young eagle to its eerie above the lashing treetops she was sitting above the tumult as mr mason had advised her to do  she came soon to know that the west side of state street was tabooed by wealthy shoppers who bought only on the east side that wabash avenue was yet more select and that no one who owned a carriage ever traded in the bargain stores she did all her shopping there because it was cheaper but deep in her heart she felt no kinship with the cross hurrying pushing perspiring crowds in the bargain stores her place was among the graceful leisurely beautifully attired groups of people on the east side of state street she was not troubled at this stage of her development by any idea of being faithful to the people of her own material condition and origin she had always loved the graces and cleanlinesses of life and her father she knew to be a man of innate refinement the idea of caste of arbitrary classes of people had only come to her newly or obscurely through newspapers or novels she did not like dirty people nor surly people nor boorish people in fact she did not class people at all they were individuals with her yet she was allured by the conditions of life on the lake shore drive because the people lived such quiet clean and joyous lives apparently with time to think and be kind  she met few people outside of the little circle at the boarding house and an occasional visiting friend of miss fletcher or mr taylor owen she saw much of and he pleased her greatly he was a man she could have married under some circumstances he had means a plenty he was an unusual character cleansouled almost elemental in his simple sincerity but she considered him committed to mary and besides mason had become a deterring cause though she hardly realized that  through all the days which followed that evening at dr herricks she saw his face with growing distinctness it was not a genial face but it was one to remember a face of power the line of the lips the halfaverted chin marked masons attitude to be one of disgust or weariness he was the most powerful man she had ever known a man of critical insight and for that reason especially she had sought in her last reading to please him she had failed and so she was afraid to see him again when isabel said to her  mason is a man you should know he can do a great deal for you in the city rose replied in her blunt fashion  i dont want him to do anything for me  o yes you do hes really a kindhearted man he puts on a manner which scares people sometimes but hes a man of the highest character hes the greatest thinker i ever meto im not disloyal to dr sanborn hes the best man i ever met there was a story in that tender inflection so you must let me send in something to warren and let him advise you  rose finally consented but it seemed to her like laying an only child upon the rack she had come almost to fear certainly to dread that strange imperturbable man his abidingplace and his office were alike so far removed from any manner of living she had knowledge of he concealed his own likes and dislikes so effectually that not even isabel as she confessed could learn them  a few days after putting her packet of poems into isabels hands rose received a note from her asking her to come over and see herthat she had an invitation for her  we are invited you and dr sanborn and i to sit in a box at the symphony concert saturday night with mr and mrs harvey mrs harvey is one of my dearest friends and ive talked about you so much she is eager to see you  rose took the matter very quietly she was mightily pleased but she was not accustomed to gushing her thanks besides she had recovered her equilibrium  isabel was a little surprised at her coolness but was keen enough to see that she did not mean to be ungrateful  i thought perhaps youd like to advise about dress she said the boxes are very brilliant but youll look well in anything you wont need a bonnet your hair is so pretty and that little grey dress will do with a little change  you know im a farmers daughter rose explained i cant afford new dresses in order to go to the opera  i understand my dear i have my own limitations in that way i keep one or two nice gowns and the rest of the time i wear a uniform i told mrs harvey you were poor like myself and that wed need to be the background for her and she said shed trust me  what mrs harvey had said was this my dear isabel youve got judgment and if you say the girls worth knowing i want to know her and if you say the girl will be presentable id like to have her come the boys are both in new york anyway and weve got three unoccupied seats  now you come over to dinner with me saturday come at five i want you to help me dress doctor will be over and well have a nice time before the carriage comes  rose was much more elated than she cared to show once as she sat in the gallery of the theatre and looked at the boxes she had shut her teeth in a vow ill sit there where you do one of these days and now it had come in a few weeks instead of yearslike a fairy gift she told mary nothing about her invitation for several days she dreaded her outcry which was inescapable  oh isnt that fine how you do get aheadwhat will you wear  i havent a bewildering choice rose said i thought id wear my grey dress  oh this is a wonderful chance for you cant you afford a new dress  no im afraid not there isnt time now anyway ill keep close to the wall fortunately i have a new cloak that will do  well that grey dress is lovelywhen its on you  rose hated the bother about the dress  i wish i could wear a dress suit like a man she said to isabel when they were in the midst of the final stress of it  so do i but we cant theres a law against it i believe now im going to dress your hair for you that is im going to superintend it and ettas deft little fingers shall do the work  after dinner isabel ordered things cleared and said to sanborn  doctor you go and smoke while we put on our frills  sanborn acquiesced readily enough  very wellif you find me gone when you come forth dont worry ive gone ahead with my friend yerkes your carriage will be full anyhow  all right she went over and gave him a hug youre a good obedient boythats what you are  he spoke with his chin over her wrist addressing rose  the study of chemicals and nerve tissues has not left us utterly desolate you perceive  when they were in their dressing room rose asked what the doctor meant by that speech  isabel laughed and colored a little  oh he meant that a study of bones and muscles and diseased bodies had not made us prosaic andand old i think it has made me still more in love with healthy human fleshbut never mind that now we must hurry  rose looked at isabel in silent worship as she stood before her ready for the carriage her ordinarily cold little face glowed with color and her eyes were full of mirthful gleams like a childs it seemed impossible that she had written a treatise on nervous diseases and was ranked among the best alienists in the city  etta made no secret of her adoration she fairly bowed down before her sister and before rose also she was so little and so commonplace before these beings of light  down at the carriage it was too dark to see any one distinctly but rose liked the cordial hearty voice of mrs harvey mr harveys hand was small and firm mrs harveys plump and warm mr harvey spoke only once or twice during the ride  as the carriage rumbled and rolled southward at a swift pace rose kept watch out of the window the street had not lost a particle of its power over her  as they plunged deeper into the city and the roll of other carriages thickened around them the importance of this event grew upon rose she was bewildered when they alighted but concealed it by impassivity as usual the carriages stood in long rows waiting to unload others were rolling swiftly away doors slammed voices called all right a mighty stream of people was entering the vast arched entrance with rustle of garments and low murmur of laughing comment rose caught the flash of beautiful eyes and the elusive gleam of jewels on every side as the ladies bowed to their acquaintances  everything was massive and spacious and enduring the entrance way was magnificent and rose followed mr harvey as if in a dream they took a mysterious short cut somewhere and came out into a narrow balcony which was divided into stalls through arched openings rose caught glimpses of the mighty hall immense as a mountain cave and radiant as a flower  as they moved along mrs harvey turned to isabel  shell do dont worry  at their box mr harvey paused and said with a pleasant smile  here we are  dr sanborn met them and there was a bustle getting wraps laid away  you sit here my dear said mrs harvey she was a plump plain pleasantvoiced person and put rose at ease at once she gave rose the outside seat and before she realized it the coulé girl was seated in plain view of a thousand people under a soft but penetrating light  she shrank like some nocturnal insect suddenly brought into sunlight she turned white and then the blood flamed to her face and neck she sprang up  o mrs harvey i cant sit here she gasped out  you mustthat is the place for you said mrs harvey do you suppose an old housewife like me would occupy a front seat with such a beauty in the background not a bit of it the public welfare demands that you sit there she smiled into the scared girls face with kindly humor  isabel leaned over and said sit there youre magnificent  rose sank back into her seat and stared straight ahead she felt as if something hot and withering were blowing on that side of her face which was exposed to the audience she wished she had not allowed the neck of her dress to be widened an inch she vowed never again to get into such a trap  mr harvey talked to her from behind her chair he was very kindly and thoughtful and said just enough to let her feel his presence and not enough to weary her  gradually the beauty and grandeur of the scene robbed her of her absurd selfconsciousness she did not need to be told that this was the heart and brain of chicago this was the chicago she had dreamed about a perfumed rustling rose from below her around her the boxes filled with women in gowns of pink and rose and blue and faint green human flowers they were dewed with diamonds all about was the movement of orderly leisurely happytoned and dignified men and women all was health pleasure sanity kindliness wealth here displayed its wondrous charm its peace its poetry  her romantic conception of these people had done them an injustice she had clothed them with the attributes of the men and women of english society novels and new york imitations of these novels this mr harvey did not know but he helped her to rectify her mistaken estimate of the people around her by saying  we business men cant get out to the friday rehearsals but saturday night finds us ready to enjoy an evening of art  he looked very handsome in his dress suit and his face was very pleasant to see yet isabel had told her that not only was he a hardworking business man but a man of wide interests a great railway director in fact  i suppose you know many of the people here she said at last  oh yes he replied i know most of them chicago is large but some way we still keep track of people here  as he talked she got courage to raise her eyes to the roof soaring far up above glowing with color balcony after balcony circled at the back and rose thought with a little flush that perhaps owen and mary were sitting up in one of those balconies and could see her in the box  the hall was buff and lightblue to her eyes and the procession of figures over the arch the immense stage the ceiling the lights all were of great beauty and interest  but the people the beautiful dresses the dainty bonnets the flow of perfumed drapery the movement of strong clean supple limbsthese were the most glorious sights of all she had no room for envy in her heart she was very happy for she seemed to have reached a share in ultimate magnificence  she longed for gowns and bonnets like these but there was no bitterness in her longing  she herself was a beautiful picture as she sat there from her bust proud and maternal rose her strong smooth neck and young graceful reflective head if the head had been thrown back she would have seemed arrogant with that reflective forward droop she produced upon the gazer an effect both sweet and sad in the proud bust was prophecy of matronly beauty and also of the freshness of youth  mason seated below among a group of musical critics looked at her with brooding eyes at that moment she seemed to be the woman he had long sought certainly the glamour was around her then she sat above him and her brown hair and rich coloring stood out from the drapery like a painting a chill came over him as he thought of the letter he had sent to her that very morning it was brutal he could see it now he might have put the criticism in softer phrases  isabel leaned over and spoke to rose and then rose began searching for him he was amazed to feel a thrill of excitement as he saw that strong dark face turned toward him and when his eyes met hers he started a little as if a ray of light had fallen suddenly upon him she colored a little he thought and bowed where did the girl acquire that regal indifferent inclination of the head it was like a princess dropping a favor to a faithful subject but it pleased him the girl has imagination he said she claims her own  then he meditated what an absurdity why should i fix upon that girl when here all about me are other women more beautiful and rich and accomplished besides that confounded farmers girl has a raft of stupid and vulgar relatives no doubt and her refinement is a mere appearance  he solaced himself with a general reflection  furthermore why should any man select any woman when they are all dots and dashes in a web of human life anyhow their differences are about like the imperceptible differences of a flock of wrens why not go out and marry the first one that offers and so end it all  the mystery of human genius came also to rose as mr harvey pointed out to her the citys most noted men and women they were mere dabs of colorsober color for the most partupon this flood of humankind she was to mason probably only a neutral spot in the glorious band of color which swept in a graceful curve back from the footlights it was wonderful also to think that these smiling men were the millionaire directors of vast intereststhey seemed without a care in the world  at last the stage chairs were all filled by a crowd of twanging booming sawing squeaking instrumentalists then the leader a large man of military erectness came down to the leaders desk and bowed amidst thunderous applause then rapping sharply on his desk he brought orderly silence out of the tumult and the concert began  the music did not mean much to rose during the first halfhour for the splendor of the whole spectacle dominated the appeal of the instruments such music and such audiences were possible only in the largest cities and that consideration moved her deeply it seemed too good to be true that she sat here securely ready to enjoy all that came it had come to her too almost without effort almost without deserving she felt  but there came at last a number on the programme which dimmed the splendor of the spectacle the voice of wagner came to her for the first time and shook her and thrilled her and lifted her into wonderful regions where the green trees dripped golden moss and the grasses were jeweled in very truth wistful young voices rose above the lazy lap of waves sad with love and burdened with beauty which destroyed like a deeppurple cloud death came slowly resistlessly closing down on those who sang clasped in each others arms  they lay dead at last and up through the purple cloud their spirits soared like gold and silver flame woven together and the harsh thunder of the gray sea died to a sullen boom                                       when she rose to her feet the girl from the coulé staggered and the brilliant moving murmuring house blurred into fluid color like a wheel of roses  the real world was gone the world of imagined things lay all about her she felt the power to reach out her hand to take fame and fortune  in that one reeling instant the life of the little coulé the lonely gentle old father and the days of her youthall her pastwere pushed into immeasurable distance the pulling of weeds in the corn the driving of cattle to pasture were as the doings of ants in a dirtheap  a vast pity for herself sprang up in her brain she wanted to do some gigantic thing which should enrich the human race she felt the power to do this too and there was a wonderful look on her face as she turned to isabel she seemed to be listening to some inner sound throbbing away into silence and then her comprehension of things at hand came back to her and isabel was speaking to her  heres mr mason coming to speak to us interrupted mr harvey  she turned to watch him as he came along the aisle behind the boxes her head still throbbed with the dying pulsations of the music everybody seemed to know and greet him with cordial readiness of hand he came along easily his handsome blonde face showing little more expression at meeting her than the others yet when he saw her rapt and flushed face he was touched  i came to see how miss dutcher was enjoying the evening  rose felt a sudden disgust with her name it sounded vulgarly of the world of weeds and cattle  in some way she found herself a few moments later walking out through the iron gate into the throng of promenaders back of the seats it was the most splendid moment of her life she forgot her fear of mason in the excitement of the moment she walked with hands clenched tightly and head lifted the look on her face and the burning color in her face made scores of people turn to look at her  mason perceived but misinterpreted her excitement he mistook her entire selfforgetfulness for a sort of vain personal exaltation or rapture of social success  she saw only dimly the mighty pillars the massive arches lit by stars of flame she felt the carpet under her feet only as a grateful thing which hushed the sound of feet  they made one circuit with the promenaders mason bowing right and left and talking disjointedly upon indifferent subjects he felt the tormenting interest of his friends in rose and drew her out of the crowd  let us stand here and see them go by he said you liked the music did you  his commonplace question fell upon her like the scream of a peacock amid songs of thrushes it showed her in a flash of reasoning of which he could not know that it was possible to be ennuied with glorious harmonies her mind asked shall i too sometimes wish to talk commonplaces in the midst of such glories  o it was beyond words she said and then mason was silent for a little space he divined her mood at last but he had something to say which should be said before she returned to her box  he began at once  let me say miss dutcher that while the main criticism of your work which i made in my note this morning must hold still i feel the phraseology could be much more amiable the fact is i was irritated over other matters and that irritation undesignedly crept into my note to you  i havent received it she said looking directly at him for the first time  well then dont read it i will tell you what i think you ought to do  o dont talk of it she said and her voice was tense with feeling all i have written is tonight trash i can see that it was all somebody elses thought dont lets talk of that now  he looked down at her face luminous quivering with excitementand understood  i forgot he said gently that this was your first concert at the auditorium it is beautiful and splendid even to an habitué like me i like to come here and forget that work or care exists in the world i shall enjoy it all the more deeply now by reason of your enthusiasm  in the wide space back of the seats a great throng of young people were promenading to the left round and round the massive pillars in leisurely rustling swing the men mainly in dress suits the ladies in soft luminous colors the heavy carpet beneath their feet gave out no sound and only the throb of laughter the murmur of speech and the soft whisper of drapery was to be heard  it was all glorious beyond words to the imaginative girl it flooded her with color beauty youth poetry music every gleaming neck or flashing eye every lithe mans body every lovers deferential droop of head every womans worshipful upturned glance came to her with power to arouse and transform the like of this she had not dreamed of seeing  nobody had told her of this chicago nobody could tell her of it indeed for no one else saw it as she did when mason spoke again his voice was very low and gentle he began to comprehend the soul of the girl  ive no business to advise you ive come to the conclusion that advice well followed is ruinous genius seldom takes advice and nobody else is worth advising i took advice and went into a newspaper office twenty years ago ive been trying ever since to rectify my mistake i would be a literary if i were not forced to be a newspaper man just when my powers are freshest i want to write of today i want to deal with the city and its life but i am forced to advise people upon the tariff i come home at night worn out and the work i do then is only a poor starveling now see this audience tonight there are themes for you see these lovers walking before and behind us he may be a clerk in a bank she the bankers daughter that man harvey in whose box you sit tonight was a farmers boy and his wife the daughter of a methodist preacher in a crossroads town how did they get where they are rich influential kindly polished in manner what an epic  are you advising me now she asked with a smile  her penetration delighted him  yes i am saying now in another way the things i wrote i hope miss dutcher you will burn that packet without reading i would not write it at all now  they were facing each other a little out of the stream of people she looked into his face with a bright smile though her eyes were timorous  do you mean manuscript and all  his face was kind but he answered firmly  yes burn it all will you do it  if you mean it  i mean it youre too strong and young and creative to imitate anybody burn it and all like it start anew tonight  his voice compelled her to a swift resolution  i will do it  he held out his hand with a sudden gesture and she took it his eyes and the clasp of his hand made her shudder and grow cold with some swift ominous foreknowledge of distant toil and sorrow and joy  the lights were dimmed mysteriously and mason said  they are ready to begin again we had better return  he led her back to the box and mrs harvey flashed a significant look upon him and said in a theatrical aside  aha at last  isabel said  come and see us tomorrow at sixa powwow  the music which came after could not hold roses attention how could it in the face of the tremendous changes which were in progress in her brain what had she done to an almost perfect stranger she had promised to burn all the work of her pen thus far  and an hour before she had almost hated certainly she had feared that man while the music throbbed and wailed and clashed she sat with blood throbbing in her ears and at her throat longing to cry out to sing and to weep she had said little of late to any one but she had finally settled upon one ambitionto write to be a great poetess after vicissitudes and false enthusiasm she had come back to the first great ambition which she had confessed to thatcher years before in the little coulé schoolhouse and now at the bidding of a stranger she had made a promise to burn her work and start again  but had not the music and the splendid spectacle before her almost determined her before he had spoken  then she came back to the wondrous gentleness which was in his voice to the amazing change in his eyes the man who had held her hand was not the worn cynical man she had feared he was younger and handsomer too she shuddered again with some powerful emotion at the thought of his calm compelling downthrusting glance into her eyes his mind appeared to her to have a shoreless sweep  the music rose to a pounding blaring climax and the audience applauding began to rise to go home breaking into streams and pools and whirling masses of color  well my dear how have you enjoyed the evening asked mrs harvey cordially  very much indeed i never can thank you enough  it has been a pleasure to feel your enthusiasm it makes us all young again ive asked dr herrick to bring you to see us i hope you will come  the hearty clasp of her hand moved the motherless girl deeply and her voice trembled with emotion as she replied  it will be a great pleasure to me mrs harvey  mrs harvey clutched her in her arms and kissed her  you splendid girl i wish you were mine she said and thereafter rose felt no fear in her presence  i dont care whether shes a genius or not mrs harvey said to isabel as they walked out to the carriage shes a good girl and i like her and ill help her you figure out anything i can properly do and ill do it i dont know another girl who could have carried off that cheap little dress the way she did she made it look like a work of art shes a wonder think of her coming from a wisconsin farm  isabel rejoiced  i knew youd like her she leaned over and said in a low voice id like elbert to see her  mrs harvey turned a quick eye upon her  well if you arent a matchmaker  as they came out in the throng it seemed as if everybody knew the harveys and isabel out in the street the cabs had gathered like huge beetles standing in patient rows in the gaslight  the bellowing of numbers the slam of carriage doors the grind of wheels the shouts of drivers made a pandemonium to rose but mr harvey with the same gentle smile on his face presented his ticket to the gigantic negro who roared enormously  ninetytwo ninetytwo  here we are mr harvey called finally and handed the women in with the same unhurried action and the homeward ride began there was little chance for talk though mrs harvey did talk  rose sat in silence this had been another great period of growth she could still feel the heat and turmoil in her brain it was as if upon a seedbed of quickshooting plants a bright warm light had been turned resulting in instant magical activity at her door they put her down and once more she thanked them  its nothing at all my dear we hope to do more for you said mrs harvey i want you to come to dinner soon youll come  with pleasure rose responded quite as a man might have done     chapter xx  rose sets face toward the open road   when rose reached her room she found the packet of poems lying on her desk it had come in the afternoon mail  she sat down by the toilet table with a burning flush on her face a world seemed some way to lie between her present self and the writer of those imitative verses she wished to see yet feared to see what he had written and taking up the packet she fingered the string while she meditated she had not absolutely promised not to read the letter though she had pledged herself to burn the poems  her life was so suddenly filled with new emotions and impulses that she was bewildered by them the music the audienceroom the splendid assemblage and some compelling power in masonall of these or he alone had changed her point of view it was a little thing to the great city a little thing to him probably but to her it was like unto the war of life and death  what indeed was the use of being an echo of passion a copy she had always hated conformity she hated to dress like other girls why should she be without individuality in her verse the very part where as mason had intimated she should be most herself  she had the chance to succeed the people seemed ready to listen to her if she had something to say and she had something to saywhy not say it  she arose tense and white with resolution and opened the stove door and dropped the packet in and closed the door and held it as if she feared the packet might explode in her face or cry out at her in her poems she would have had the heroine fling it in the grate and snatch it out again but having no grate the stove must serve and there could be no snatching at the packet no remorseful kisses of the charred body it was gone in a dull roar  she sat down and waited till the flame died out and then drew up to her desk and wrote swiftly for an hour she grew sleepy at last as the tumult of her brain grew quieter just before she went to sleep all her lovers came before her carl in the strawberryscented glade william de lisle shining of limb courtesying under the lifting canvas roof dr thatcher as he looked that afternoon in the schoolroom then forest darnlee with the physical beauty of william de lisle but vain and careless then professor ellis seated at his desk in the chalkladen air or perched on the ladder beneath the great telescope a man who lived in abstract regions far from sense and sound then tom harris lithe graceful always smilingtom who had the songs of birds the smell of flowers the gleam of sunsetwater leagued with himwho almost conquered but who passed on like a dapple of purple shadow over the lake  and now she faced two others for she could see that owen was turning to her from mary and he had great charm he was one of the cleanestsouled men she had ever known he had also a strange touch of paganism of mystery as of free spaces and savage unstained wildernesses and he could give her a home and he would allow her freedom he would be her subject not her master  then there was masonof him what she did not know he was outside her knowledge of men she could neither read his face nor understand his voice he scared her with a look or a phrase sometimes he looked old and cynical but tonight how tenderly and sympathetically he had spoken how considerately silent he had been  when she awoke mary was standing looking down at her  if youre going to have any breakfast rose youd better be stirring its nine oclock and everythings ready to clear away what kind of time did you have  rose resented her question but forced herself to answer  beautiful  i saw you in the box owen and i were in the second balcony you were just scrumptious i wanted to throw a kiss at you she fell upon rose and squeezed her quilt and all in her long arms my stars i wish i was lovely and a poet  she had nothing but joy over her idols good fortune and it made rose feel guilty to think how resentful and secretive she had become there was coming into her friendship with mary a feeling which prevented further confidencea feeling that mary was not a suitable confidant and could not understand the subtleties of her position in which rose was quite correct  with mary procedure was always plain sailing either she was in love and wanted to marry or she wasnt her ideals changed comparatively little and were healthily commonplace her friendships were quick warm and stable she was the country girl in the city and would be so until death if she felt disposed she chewed gum or ate an apple on the street like a boy and she walked on the lake shore sunday evening with owen unconscious and uncaring of the servantgirls and their lovers seated on every bench  so rose had grown away from her friend she felt it dimly the first week she felt it vividly on the morning after the concert and it troubled her her life was too subtle too complicated and too problematic for honest frecklefaced broadcheeked mary to analyze  then too there was the question of owen soon mary must see how he set face toward her but she felt quite equal to answering him when owen came to speak because his appeal to her was not in the slightest degree sensuous as tom harris had been  she spent the day in deep thought writing some lines which came to her and writing a letter home she filled it full of love and praise for pappa john as if in remorse for growing so far away from him  that done she fell back upon her group of friends upon the concert upon thought of that wonderful promenade with mason  the world of art seemed so secure and reposeful so filled with splendor of human endeavor she drew her breath in a mighty inspiration and resolved to be a part of it art had always seemed to her so far off something european and now she seemed to be in immediate contact with it and soared into exultation for a day falling soon into dreary doubt  her literary ideals were so hopelessly confused she had lost the desire to write as she had been writing and there seemed nothing left for her to do she had so few convictions and so little experience the door had closed upon her old forms of action and yet the way mason had pointed out to her was dark and utterly bewildering she felt great things moving around her themes deeds that were enormous but not defined she could not quite lay hold upon them  she went down the street to dr herricks house feeling that she was committing herself to something she knew that isabel had taken her case in hand and that she was to meet other young men there she could not resent it for the zeal of her newfound friend was manifestly from the heartit could not be otherwise of what advantage to dr herrick could it be to take her upa poor country girl  in fact she was puzzled by this overpowering kindness there was so little apparent reason for it all she could not of course understand the keen delight of introducing a powerful and fresh young mind to the wonders of the city she had not grown weary of sets and circles and of meeting the same commonplace people again and again as mrs harvey had isabels position was different but she had an equal delight more subtle and lasting in seeing the genius as she believed of the girl win its way and besides the girl herself pleased her mightily  isabel herricks life was one of deep earnestness and high aims she was the daughter of a physician in an interior city she had worked her way up from the bottom in the usual american fashion by plucky efforts constantly directed to one end and was the head of the house of herrick which consisted of her young sister a brother at college and her aged mother now an invalid  she had been one of the first three girls to enter the medical school and she had been their shield and fortress in the storm which followed their entrance into the dissecting room the battle was short but decisive her little head was lifted and her face white as she said  meni wont say gentlemenim here for business and im here to stay if youre afraid of competition from a woman youd better get out of the profession  in the dead silence which followed a lank country fellow stepped out and raised his voice  shes right and im ready to stand by her and ill see shes let alone  others shouted of course shes right by which it appeared the disturbance was of the few and not the mass of students a fact which isabel inferred she spoke a grateful word to the lanky student and dr sanborn found his wife right there  there was little for isabel to learn of the sordid and vicious side of men she knew them for what they were polygamous by instinct insatiable as animals and yet she had been treated on the whole with courteousoften too courteouskindness her dainty color and her petite figure won overgallant footway everywhere though she often said  gentlemen i have studied my part i know what i am doing and i ask only a fair field and no favors  thatcher and sanborn had been her close companions in the stern hard course they set themselves each had said with vast resolution to the other im not to be left behind and each had sworn to take no mediocre position thatcher had made apparently the least mark in the world but he was writing a monograph which was expected to give important facts to the medical profession he had written to sanborn several times you have the advantage of association with the little corporal  they called her little corporal among themselves her sternly sweet face had a suggestion of napoleon in it and then she ordered them about so naturally and led them so inevitably in everything she undertook  it was into the hands of the little corporal that rose had fallen and all isabels enthusiasm was roused in her behalf her own little sister was a sweet placid little thing who had inherited the body and spirit as well of her mother while isabel had inherited the mind of her father in the body of her mother  something of this thatcher had told rose part of it isabel had told and it made only one definite impression on rosethis that a woman could succeed if she set her teeth hard and did not waste time  she found isabel already surrounded by company she made every other sunday evening an informal at home and certain wellknown artists and professional people dropped in to talk awhile or to sit at her generous table it was a good place to be and rose had perception enough to feel that  o you dear child im glad to see you theres some one here youll be glad to see  rose flushed a little thinking of mason  its an old frienddr thatcher  rose clapped her hands o is he im so glad its almost like seeing the folks  ive asked elbert harvey and mr mason also i didnt want you to think i had no friends but doctors it must seem to you as if the world is made up of doctors but it isnt  thatcher greeted rose quietly but with a pressure of the hand which made up for his impassivity of countenance he trembled a little as he sat down and watched her greeting sanborn and mason  fear and admiration were both present in her heart as mason took her hand  she forced herself to look into his face and started to find his eyes so terribly penetrating  i burned the packet she said with a constrained smile  his eyes grew softer and a little humorous  did you indeed without opening it  yes  heroic girl  am i not she said over her shoulder as isabel dragged her toward a tall smoothfaced young fellow who stood talking with etta  elbert this is miss dutcherrose young mr harvey son of our hostess at the concert  young harvey seemed much taken back as he faced rose and shook hands in current angular fashion his mind formulated these opinions  shes a stunner caroline was dead right by caroline he meant his mother  rose placed him at once he was another college man paul and etta joined them and they made a fine group they were soon as free as schoolmates laughing telling stories and fighting over the east and the west  rose stoutly defended the western colleges they had their place she said  so they have elbert said but let them keep it  their place is at the head and thats where well put them soon she said  elbert told a story about hazing a western boy at yale he grew excited and sprang up to dramatize it he stood on one foot and screwed up his face while the rest shrieked with laughter all except rose who thought it unjust  mason looked on from his low chair with a revealing touch of envious sadness he had gone past that lifepast the land of youth and lovepast the islands of mirth and minstrelsy he was facing a cold gray sea with only here and there a grim granite reef gnawing the water into foam  it made him long to be part of that again therefore he valued rose more at that moment than ever before the girl has imagination she has variety she is not a simple personality at the concert she was exalted rapt her eyes deep tonight she is a schoolgirl then it was wagnernow it is college horseplay  isabel came up to sit a moment by him  isnt she fine i think i surprised young harvey i thought id like to have her meet himhes such a fine fellow she should meet someone else beside us old fogies  mason winced a little  well now thats pleasant do you call me an old fogy  she laughed  o were not old in years but were old in experience the bloom of the grape is lost  but the grape is ripe and we still have that the bloomwhat is it a nest for bacteria  but it is so beautiful with the bloom on she said wistfully id take it again bacteria and all see those young people the meeting of their eyes is great as fame and the touchthe accidental touch of their hands or shoulders like a return of lost ships i am thirtythree years of age and ive missed that somewhere  mason lifted his eyebrows  do you mean to say that the touch of sanborns hand does not hasten your blood  i doand yet i love him as much as i shall ever love anybodynow  mason studied her and then chanted softly      another came in the days that were golden     one that was fair in the days of the olden           time long ago  youve never told me about that  she smiled no but i will some timeperhaps  she led the way out to supper with dr thatcher and the rest followed without quite breaking off conversation a merry witty procession  rose was conscious of a readjustment of values dr thatcher had less weight in the presence of these people but masonmason easily dominated the table without effort indeed he was singularly silent but there was something in the poise of his head in the glance of his eyes which showed power and insight into life  the young folks led by young harvey took possession of the table and laughter rippled from silence to silence like a mountain stream young harvey aided at the chafingdish with the air of an adept and isabel was almost as lighthearted in laughter as he  thatcher and mason seemed to sit apart from it and so it was mason found opportunity to say  you knew our young friend of the coulédiscovered her in fact  yes as much as any one could discover her its a little early to talk of her as if she had achieved fame  dr herrick thinks shes on the instant of going up higher and so were all hanging to her skirts in hopes of getting a rise  thatcher didnt like masons tone  rose is a hard worker if she rises any higher it will be by the same methods which put her through college he spoke with a little air of proprietorship  mason felt the rebuff but he was seeking information about rose therefore he ignored it  shes an only child i believe  yes her father is a hardworking welltodo farmer in a little coolly in wisconsin  its the same old story i suppose he doesnt realize that hes lost his daughter to the city of chicago we gain at his expense  masons mind had something feminine about it and he saw as never before how attractive to a girl a fine young fellow like harvey could be being rich he was lifted above worry his activity was merely wholesome exercise and his flesh was clean and velvety as a girls he was strong too as it was the fashion of college men of his day to be he had never known want or care in his beautiful life he was moreover a clean boy money had not spoiled his sterling nature it was no wonder that roses eyes grew wide and dark as they rested on him they were physically a beautiful pair and their union seemed the most inevitable thing in the world  isabel leaned over to say  arent they enjoying themselves i wish mrs harvey could see them  after they had returned to the sitting room a couple of young artists came in with john coburg masons roommate on the star he was a smoothfaced fellow of extrasolemn visage relieved by twinkling black eyes the artists were keen alertlooking fellows with nothing to indicate their profession save their pointed beards one of them being lately from paris turned his moustaches up devilishly the other had fallen away from his idols sufficiently to wear his moustaches turned down and an extra width to his beard  rose was glad mr davidson twisted his mustache there was so little else about him to indicate his high calling  their coming turned the current of talk upon matters of art which made rose feel perfectly certain she was getting at the heart of chicago artistic life  mr davidson inveighed against america and chicago especially for its lack of art atmosphere  if youve got the creative power you can make your own art atmosphere his companion hotly said you always start up on that thing evidently it was a source of violent argument between them  the trouble is you fellows who paint want to make a living too easy mason remarked  you ought to stay and do pioneer work among us said isabel  i dont consider it worth while so far as i am concerned i prefer paris  youre not very patriotic  there is no patriotism in art  thats the regular parisian jabber returned his friend i talked all that myself what you need is a touch of poverty id like to see your people drop you in a small town where you had to make your living for a little while  all the hard conditions of chicago are changing isabel interposed with peaceful intent all that was true a few years ago is not true now the materialism you war against no longer dominates us we are giving a little time to art and literature  davidson twisted his mustache point it isnt noticeable yeto theres a little band of fellows starving here like rats in a garretbut what general recognition of art have you  what could you expect  well you might buy pictures  we doold masters and salon pictures said mills with a relenting acknowledgment of the citys weakness  thats it exactly said davidson youve no judgment here you are obliged to take your judgment from somebody else  so the talk proceeded to rose it was illuminating and epochmaking she read in it the citys developing thought paris and the rocky mountains met here with chicago and the most modern types of men and women  meanwhile mason found opportunity to say to thatcher who seemed a little ill at ease  these little informal sunday suppers and freeforalls are increasing in number and they are signs of civilization of course a few of the women still go to church in the morning but that will wear off except at newbonnet time  thatcher did not reply he thought mason a little flippant  rose sought opportunity to talk about mrs thatcher and josephine  theyre quite well  i wish i could see them both  we should be glad to welcome you back to madison any time but i hardly expect to see you except on a vacation possibly youre a city dweller already i can see that he seemed sadder than she had ever known him and his look troubled her a little  at ten oclock she rose to go and young harvey sprang up  are you going if you are i hope youll give me the pleasuremy carriage  thank you very much she answered quickly ive a friend coming for me thatcher rose as if to go with her but sat down again with a level line of resolution on his lips  mason and harvey both wondered a little about that friend mason took a certain delight in young harveys defeat and analyzed his pulse to find out why he was delighted we should mob that friend he said to sanborn he is an impertinence at this time  rose felt isabels arm around her as she entered the cloakroom  isnt he fine  who  mr harvey  oyesso are the artists rose began to wonder if isabel were not a matchmaker as well as a promoter of genius  isabel had a suspicion of roses thought and she laughingly said  dont think im so terrible i do like to bring the right people together i see so many people wrongly mated but i dont meani only want you to know nice people youre to do your own choosing she said with sudden gravity no one can choose for you there are some things i want to talk about when i can venture it  mason and sanborn were the last to go and when isabel returned from the door where she had speeded the last guest she dropped into a chair and sighed  its splendid good fun but it does tire me so talk to me now while i rest  sanborn talk mason commanded  sanborn drew a chair near isabel and put his arm about her she leaned her head on his shoulder  mason rose in mock confusion  i beg your pardon i should have gone before  isabel smiled dont go were not disturbed  i was considering myself  o you were  such things shock me but if i may smoke i may be able  of course smoke and tell me what you think of rose isnt it strange how that girl gets on shes one of the women born to win her way without effort it isnt true to say it is physical thats only part of itits temperament  mason got his cigar well alight before he said  she has the prime virtueimagination  is that a womans prime virtue  to me it is of course there are other domestic and conjugal virtues which are commonly ranked higher but they are really subordinate sappho and helen and mary of the scots were not beautiful nor virtuous as such terms go they had imagination and imagination gave them variety and variety means endless charm it is decidedly impossible to keep up your interest in a woman who is the same yesterday today and tomorrowwhose orbit can be predicted whose radiance is without the shadow of turning  should he be stopped isabel asked of sanborn  i shouldnt like the job sanborn replied when he strikes that line of soliloquy hes out of my control                                       rose found owen waiting in the hall and she accepted his escort with the frankness of a sister  have you waited long  no i was just going to ring the bell when i heard your voice  they walked on in silence at last he asked  did you have a good time  splendid she answered  we missed you he said  rose felt something tender in his voice and remained silent  i heard from my partners today he went on after a little theyre feeling mighty good struck another vein that promises better than the one we have i ought to go out but i he paused abruptly did you ever see the rockies in late fall o theyre mighty mighty as the sky i wish youdi wish we could make up a party some time and go out id take a car  she faced the situation  ill tell you what would be nice when you and mary take your wedding trip ill go along to take care of you both  owen fairly staggered under the import of that speech and could find nothing to say for some time  did you have a good time tonight he asked again  splendid i always do when i go to isabels thereafter they walked in silence  rose fell to thinking of young harvey in the days which followed there was allurement in his presence quite different from that of any other she could not remember anything he had said only he had made her laugh and his eyes were frank and boyish she felt his grace and the charm that comes from security of position and freedom from care  he brought up to her mind by force of contrast her father with his eyes dimmed with harsh winds and dust and glowing sun he was now spending long dull days wandering about the house and barn going to bed early in order to rise with the sun to begin the same grind of duties the day following young harveys life was the opposite from this  he admired her she felt that as distinctly as if he had spoken to her he wanted to be near her he had asked her to help him with the chafingdish that night and to pour the beer while he stirred the gluey mass of cheese all the little things by which a young man expresses his admiration he had used almost artlessly certainly boyishly  there was nothing there but a vista of pleasures certain relief from toil and worry what a marvelous thing to be suddenly relieved from all fear of hunger and every harassing thought about the future and it was not a question of an old man of wealth or a man of repulsive appearance it was a question of taking a bright handsome cleansouled man together with his money she felt the power to put out her hand and claim him as her own  she liked him too he amused her and interested her she admired his splendid flesh and his clear laughing eyes it seemed the easiest thing in the worldto an outsider she felt that isabel was working hard to have her see young harvey at his best and she felt too that mrs harvey was taking unusual interest in her and in her secret heart she knew she could marry into that fine family but  liking was not love she did not shiver when he clasped her hand as she did when mason greeted her she feared mason when he came by her judgment blurred and her eyes fell she couldnt tell what his traits were and she didnt know whether he was a good man or not she hungered to see him to hear his voice beyond that she hardly dared consciously go  his attitude toward her she could not understand sometimes he seemed anxious to please her sometimes he seemed equally determined that she should understand how inconsequential she was in his lifeand always he dominated her  she did not once think it might be indecision in his mind after the usual stupidity of loves victims she thought his changes of manner due in some way to her she had acted foolishly or she was looking so badly he was ashamed of her  in this condition of mind it may be imagined she did not do much studying or writing she went to the library regularly but she could not concentrate her thoughts upon her book she grew surly and changeable with mary who no longer dared to talk unguardedly with her  marys eyes were not glass marbles she could see things with them and she said gleefully to owen one night  shes in love thats what is the matter with her i dont mind it shell be all right after a while shes short as piecrust with me but i know how it is myself shes in love with some highflyer shes met at dr herricks house  then she wondered why owen made no reply     chapter xxi  mason talks again   not seeing mason for some days sanborn took a walk one night and turned up about nine oclock at his rooms he found him sitting before his open grate fire smoking meditatively  hello sanborn glad you came over he did not rise but sanborn was untroubled by that  got another chapter turned off  possibly fill up and draw up  sanborn obediently filled a pipe and drew up a chair  you look tired  i am i have written a column editorial on the labor question one on the chinese treaty a special article on irrigation for the sunday issue not counting odd paragraphs on silver anarchy and other little chores of my daily grind  thats not as bad as poulticing people  bad theres nothing any worse and my novelistic friends are always saying why dont you turn in and finish up your novel what can an intellectual prostitute do  get out of the business one would suppose  well now that brings me to the point in the midst of all my other worriments i am debating whether to marry a rich girl and escape work or a poor girl and work harder or to give the whole matter of marriage up forever  these are actual cases not hypothetical this time  mason turned a slow eye upon him  i have no need to fly to hypothetical cases he said dryly in the first place my heroif you incline tonight to that theory of the casemy hero is equally interested in two young women this is contrary to the story books but then only an occasional novelist tells the truth im to be that one  he seemed to be going off upon some other line of thought and sanborn hauled him back by asking a pertinent question  you mean to say both of these young ladies have that glamour  o not at all they did have but it has faded in both cases as in all previous cases yet more seems to have remained or else i am getting a little less exacting in the case of the sculptressshes the poor girl of courseshes a genius the first time i saw her she read a paper on the modern in sculpture it was good too she was dressed beautifully in cheesecloth for all i knowi only know she put to shame her sculptured copies of hope and ariadne the glamour was around her like rosecolored flame it was about her still when i stepped up to her she was tall and strong as a young lioness her clean sweet eyes were level with mine and she made me ashamed of every mean thing i had uttered in my whole life  well well exclaimed sanborn  she was flattered and exalted to think the editor was pleased with her essay and the rest was easy i went to call on her a day or two later  and the glamourthe glamour  mason shook his head faint she was in her study and the hard cold light was merciless she was handsome even then but her face had a pinched look and there was a heavy droop to her lips the color so beautiful that night when flushed with excitement had faded from her cheeks and gathered in some unfortunate way about her eyes and nose she was a fine woman butthe glamour was gone  what an eye for symptoms you should have been a physician sanborn put in  at the same time she grew upon me shes an artist she has the creative handno doubt of that she has dreams beautiful dreams of art she glows and dilates and sings with the joy of it she could bring into my life something of the dreams i myself had as a youth shes going to make a name for herself without question  why thats glorious warren old man shes just the wife for you and she really inclines toward you  she does then his selfcrucifying humor came in thats really her most questionable virtue however if love can laugh at locksmiths i suppose he can laugh at a bald head but this is only one phase of the matter like all spectators you are informed of only one side of the banner lets look at the other  i manage to live here and support this fire which is my only extravagance i keep the establishment going and a little more ill anticipate the usual arguments suppose for a little while it would not increase expenses it would not do to bring a woman here it would not be right when children cameand i should hope for childrenthey should have a home in the suburbs i dont believe in raising children in a flat that would mean an establishment which would take every cent i could hook on to and it would mean that the whole glittering fabric would be built upon my own personal palm  but she might earn somethingyou say shes a genius  she is thats the reason shell never make money holding the view i do i could not require her to toil i do not believe marriage confers any authority on the husbandyou understand my position there  perfectlyand agree with it to a limited extent of course  going back thereforei do not believe i can assume the risk involved im not capable of twenty years work at my present rate id break down some fine day and then my little home upheld upon my atlas palm would tumble no i cant take the risk im getting too foxy i havent the bounce i once had besides her career is to be considered i dont believe i can afford to let her marry me  thats mighty kind of you sanborn dryly remarked  thank you i think it is an error of judgment on her part she is younger and as her adviser i think i must interfere and save her from the power of a vivid imagination and abounding vitality you see there are a great many considerations involved  real love i must repeat would not consider  i wish you wouldnt repeat it it does you an injustice the animal passion of youth would not consider with youth it is marrymarry even if within the year you are picked up by the patrol wagon a vagrant in the streets the love of my time is not so heedless nor so selfish it extends to the question of the other party to the transaction  i suppose that should be so but as a physician i doubt it my observations do not run that way age grows like a child again thoroughly selfish  then there is the question of the possible woman mason resumed and his tone was cynically humorous again i cant give her up there she stands in a radiant mist always just before me like the rainbow of our childhood i cant promise any woman to love her till death i dont know as it would be safe to promise it even to the woman with glamour another might come with a subtler glory and a better fitting glamour and then  what then  it would all be up with the first woman he said with a gravity of tone of which the words gave no hint  im afraid some one has already come to make pale the beauty of the sculptress what about the other the rich girl you set over against the sculptress at the beginning mind you i believe the whole situation is fictitious but ill humor you in it  well aureliawell call her aureliabrings up a farreaching train of reflections and if youve got a patient waiting youd better come again  im the only patient waiting  mason ignored the lame old pun and proceeded  aurelia lives in springfield you know the kind of home the wealthy politician builds in a western towncombination of jail and courthouse i attended a reception there last winter and saw aurelia for the first time she was as beautiful as an acrobat  i dont want to interrupt mason but i notice all your heroines are beautiful  they must be my taste will not permit me to tolerate unsymmetrical heroines i started in as an architect and ive done a little paddling in clay and my heroines must be harmonious of structureglamour comes only with beauty to me  largely physical then  certainly i believe in the physical the healthy wholesome physical in the splendor of the tigers wooing is no disease  well well she was beautiful as an acrobat  mason looked sour one more interruption and the rest of my hearttragedy will remain forever alien to your ear  sanborn seemed alarmed  my lips are glued to my pipe  mason musedcomposed sanborn thought  she looked as if she had been moulded into her gown the parisian robe and the hair piled high were fastundeniably theatric but her little face was sweet and girlish almost childish well she had glamour largely physical as you say but like the heroes of e p roes novels i aspired to awaken her soul she was pleased with me apparently i called soon after the receptioni always follow up each case of glamour i knew she was rich but i did not realize she commanded such an establishment  it was enormous her mother was a faded little hen of a woman who had been a very humble person in youth and who continued a very humble person in middlelife the courthouse in which she was forced to live continually overawed her but the girl used it entertained in it as if she had a string of palacedwelling ancestors straggling clear back to charlemagne  thats the american idea the power of adaptation our women have it better developed than  she was a gracious and charming hostess and i admit the sight of her in command of such an establishment was impressive i thought how easily a tired editor could be absorbed into that institution and be at resta kind of life hospital so to say she was interested in methat was certain  now mason i must protest you know how high isabel and i both hold you but we never quite considered you in the light of a ladies man your springfield girl must have had dozens of brilliant and handsome young men about her  mason smoked in silence waiting till sanborns buzz ceased  well she came to the city last month and ive been to see her a number of times the last time i saw her she proposed to me  sanborn stared with fallen jaw gaping while mason continued in easy flow  and i have the matter under consideration i saw the coming storm in her eyes last night as we sat together at the piano she turned suddenly and faced me very tense and very white  mr mason why cant youi meanwhat do you think of me  i couldnt tell her that night what i thought of her for she had seemed more minutely commonplace than ever she had trotted round her little wellworn circle of graces and accomplishments even to playing her favorite selection on the piano i equivocated i professed it was not very easy to say what i thought of her and added  i think youre a fine wholesome girl as she is of course  but you dont think im beautiful that was a womans question wasnt it yes i said in reply i think you are very attractive nature has been lavish with you  then she flamed red and stammered a little  then why dont you like me  i do i said  you know what i mean she hurried on to sayi want you to like me better than any other woman  thats impossible i replied it was pitiful to see her sitting there like a beggar in the midst of all her splendor i like you very much i think youre very sweet and kind and girlish  she seemed to react from her boldness her eyes filled with tears i know you think im terrible to say these things  no i feel that i do not deserve such trust on your part then she defended me yes you do i couldnt have spoken to any one else so youre so kind and gentle  did she say that of you  she said that  i wish i could reach that phase of your character sighed sanborn what did you say in reply  mason apparently showed deep feeling at last  i told her that i was like the average man i was taking credit to myself for not devouring her like a wolf she didnt listen to that what can i do to make you like me she asked she leaned toward me her chin in her palm thinking and suffering as her sweet little soul had never suffered before im too simple she said with a flash of startling insight i dont know enough i feel that cant i study and change that  youre changing that now i replied  she grew radiant for a moment  o you do like me a little  as he went on masons tone grew sweet and solemn it had singular power of suggestion it developed more of his nature than he knew his real gravity and tenderness and purity  there you have it he ended he struck the ashes out of his pipe and rose  i could marry her but it wouldnt make her happy it would make her suffer it is not a light thing to decide it is a very grave thing as in the case of the sculptress i thought it an error of judgment on her part and on my own it would be criminal  thats a fine bit of fiction said sanborn youre too rough on yourself for you could do the girl a deal of good by marrying her  possibly in the case of the sculptress the problem is different she is moving past me like a queensplendid supple a smile of conscious power on her lips the light of success in her eyes its a terrible temptation i admit this power to stretch out my hand and stay her it makes my blood leap but my sense of justice will not allow of it i shall let her pass on beautiful and rapt  to marry some confounded pinhead who will make her a domestic animal and degrade her into my wife gents  possibly however my responsibility ends where i say goodbye  dont shirkdont shirk  mason turned on him his voice lost a little of its coldness  is a man to have no credit for letting such a glorious creature pass him unharmed and free  why yes certainly but the world of art will not satisfy that girl shes sure to marryshe must marryand she is entitled to more consideration youve got to look ahead to the time when she regrets the lack of husband and children  ah but its a frightful thing sanborn to arrest that girl to make her a wife and mother to watch her grow distorted stiffened heavy with childbearing i prefer to see her pass me in order that i may remember her lithe radiant moving like music and light  thats fine mason i honor you for that spirit said sanborn deeply moved but you must remember i am about to be married to a beautiful woman myself a woman who knows both sexes knows their vices and passions she tells me and it fits in with what i know myself that the womans nature moves on from this beautiful state youve described so well into the pain and responsibility of marriage not merely willingly but eagerly half the girls joy which we men see in her face is the smile of anticipated motherhoodit must be so isabel as you know is no sentimentalist shes a woman you can talk these things to freely i cant state it as she did but the substance of it was this if the girl knew she was to be always young and childish her youth and beauty would be of no value to herthat it is the untried pain and pleasures of other years and conditions which make the beauty so radiant now  all of which merely means she makes the best of an irresistible and tragic impulse a force which she does not originate and cannot control therefore i say it is a sorrowful business to hew down a temple or tear a lily in pieces  the two men were silent again they had reached fundamentals in their talk sanborn considered the whole matter an allegory which mason was using to veil his design to win rose if possible he knew the ease of masons invention as well as his power to present a case dramatically and while he was moved by the expression of his friends noble thought he could not think that there was any exact truth contained in the story  mason resumed a moment later  there are certain other material minor and prosaic considerations which must be kept in mind suppose i announce my engagement to miss aurelia the newspapers would have a pleasant paragraph or two some people would say what a very appropriate match others would say very knowingly well mason has feathered his nest the newspaper boys who really wish me well would say good for mason now he can take time to finish that great american novel hes had on hand so long a few shrewd fellows would say well that ends mason hes naturally lazy and with a wife and home like that hell never do another stroke of work masons like coleridge in one thing he dreams great things but never writes them hes out of the race  theres something in that sanborn admitted  i know there is mason replied without offense now well suppose i scrape a little money together for immediate use the old railway baron is kind he tolerates me for the daughters sake i come in contact with the relatives already i have had a touch of them a girl like that is not like a pebble on the seashore shes a thread in a web of cloth a silken thread in a breadth of shoddy maybe you cant marry her and have her to yourself you come into new relations with her people as her fiancé they cannot be escaped they swarm around you they question your motives and they comment on your person hes getting bent and bald hes lazy what did she ever see in him they vulgarize everything they touch they are as tiresome as the squeal of a pump but there you are you must meet them the old gentleman is a man who deals in millions reliable and conscientious he talks to you about his business till you say business be damned he thereafter meets you in heavy silence the mother is a timid soul with an exaggerated idea of your importance as an editor the aunts and uncles variously sniff and tremble before you  meanwhile your wife has talked all she knows and all she says thereafter has a familiar sound she delights in stories with many repetitions in them her little brain travels from the pantry to the table from the tea table to the childrens bath tub its widest circuit is the millinery store and the bargain counter she gets fat thats another distressing phase of my trouble let me say i seem to be gifted with a prophetic eye in the midst of my transports  think of you in a transport  i am able to see just how each one will change how this pretty plumpness will get fat how this delicate slimness will get bony i see how this beautiful alert face will get beakish in other words i am troubled about the future when i should be involved only in the ecstasy of the present in this latest case i see excessive plumpness and chatter in ten years i see myself bored to death with her within ten months she is at her best now in striving to win me she is like a female bird her plumage is at its best she will grow dowdy when the incentive is gone  there are other considerations aurelia too has exaggerated notions of my power to earn money she may expect me to maintain an expensive establishment i cant ask anything of the political pirate her father i can only put my income into the treasury if my power to earn money decreases as it may then i become an object of contempt on the part of the old savage who considers money the measure of ability suppose at last i come to the point of borrowing money of going to the old man humbly twisting my hat in my hand my dear sir aurelia and the childrenpah  he uttered a sound of disgust and anger and fell silent  sanborn mused i wonder if the lovers of any other age had any such scruples about marriage i guess youre right about aurelia but i dont believe you are about the sculptress i think she would make you happy  mason mused a moment and then went on  well now as to thatmarry her and we plunge inside of two years into a squalid struggle for bread and coal and a roof i elect myself at once into the ranks of drayhorses and as i said before i chain a genius to the neckyoke with me that is also out of the question  sanborn sought his hat  well mason this has been a season of plain speaking id feel pretty bad over it if i thought it was real when you get the whole thing typewritten i should like to read it to isabel and rose  masons face did not change but he failed to look at his friend he said quietly  isabel wouldnt read it the girl might possibly find something in it of value good night youve listened like a martyr  dont fail to write that out while its fresh in your mind good night said sanborn  his last glance as he closed the door fell upon a lonely figure lying in a low chair before the fire and he pitied him mason seemed the great irresolute which isabel believed him to be helpless to do patient to suffer     chapter xxii  social questions   the social world seemed about to open to the coulé girl at mrs harveys she called and behold her house was but one street removed from the lake shore drive on which she had stood that september day it was a home of comfort rather than of wealth not at all ostentatious and yet its elegance troubled rose not a little  she knew values by instinct and she knew there was nothing shoddy and nothing carelessly purchased in the room the harveys were envied by some of their wealthier neighbors for the harmoniousness of their house they contrived to make their furniture distinguish itself from a downtown stockwhich requires taste in selection and arrangement as well  rose heard voices above and soon mrs harvey and isabel came down together rose was glad of her friends presenceit made it easier for her  after hearty greetings from mrs harvey they all sat down and mrs harvey said  im glad you came over weisabel and ifeel that we should do something for you socially i would like to have you come over some wednesday and pour tea for me its just my afternoon at home and friends drop in and chatter a little while perhaps youd enjoy it  o youre very kind rose said dimly divining that this was a valuable privilege but i really couldnt do it iim not up to that  o yes you are youd look like a painting by boldini up against that tapestry with your hair brought low the way you wore it concert night  isabel put in a word it isnt anything to scare you rose its hardly more formal than at college only there wont be any men it will introduce you to some nice girls and well make it as easy for you as we can  o yes indeed you can sit at the table with isabel  o it isnt that rose said looking down i havent anything suitable to wear she went on quickly as if to put an end to the whole matter im a farmers girl living on five hundred dollars a year and i cant afford fifty dollar dresses i havent found out any way to earn money and i cant ask my father to buy me clothes to wear at teas you all are very kind to me but i must tell you that its all out of my reach  the other women looked at each other while rose hurried through this mrs harvey was prepared at the close  there now my dear dont let that trouble you any simple little gown will do  its out of the question mrs harvey until i can buy my own dresses i cant ask my father to buy anything more than is strictly necessary  there was a note in her voice which seemed to settle the matter  isabel said perhaps you have something made up that will do wont you let me see what you have certainly the dress you wore at the concert became you well  if you have anything that could be altered mrs harvey said i have a dressmaker in the house now she could easily do what you need shes looking over my wardrobe  rose shook her head and the tears came to her eyes  youre very very kind but it wouldnt do any good suppose i got a dress suitable for this afternoon it wouldnt help much its impossible id better keep in the background where i belong  she stubbornly held to this position and mrs harvey reluctantly gave up her plans to do something for her socially  rose had come to see how impossible it was for her to take part in the society world which isabel and mrs harvey made possible to her the winter was thickening with balls and parties the society columns of the sunday papers were full of events past and events to come sometimes she wished she might see that life at other times she cared little one day when calling upon isabel she said suddenly  do you know how my father earned the money which i spend for board he gets up in the morning before any one else to feed the cattle and work in the garden and take care of the horses he wears old faded clothes and his hands are hard and crooked and tremble when he raises his tea  she stopped and broke into a moano it makes my heart ache to think of him alone up there if you can help me to earn a living i will bless you what can i do i thought i was right but mr mason made me feel all wrong im discouraged now why was i born  isabel waited until her storm of emotion passed then she said  dont be discouraged yet and dont be in haste to succeed you are only beginning to think about your place in the economy of things you are costing your father but little now and he does not grudge it besides all this is a part of your education wait a year and then we will see what you had better do to earn a living  they were in her library and rose sat with her hat on ready to go back to her boarding house isabel went on after a time spent in thought  now the social question is not so hopeless as you think there are plenty of select fine places for you to go without a swagger gown of course there is a very small circle here in chicago which tries to be ultrafashionable but its rather difficult because chicago men have something else to do and wont be dragooned into studying ward mcallister youll find the people here mostly good sensible people like the harveys wholl enjoy you in any nice quiet dress you can meet them informally at dinner or at their little sunday evening in so dont you take any more trouble about it she ended and you neednt pay me for the lecture either  rose answered her with smiles  i wish i could feeli wish i didnt care a cent about it but i do i dont like to feel shut out of any place i feel the equal of any one i was brought up that way and i dont like to be on the outside of anything thats a dreadful thing to say i suppose but thats the way i feel  im not going to quarrel with you about the depth of your depravity but i assure you there is no circle in chicago worth knowing which will shut you out because you are a poor girl thank heaven we have not reached to that point yet and now about your writing i believe in you i liked those verses though i may not be an acute criticmr mason says im a conservative and hes probably right he says you should write as you talk he told me you had remarkable power in suggesting images to the mind but in your verse the images were all secondhand he believes youll come to your own themes and style soon  i hope so her answer was rather spiritless in tone  theres another thing rose youre going to have suitors here in chicago and fine ones too may i talk with you about that  rose flushed deeply and her eyes fell she was a little incoherent  why yesi dont see any reasonthere isnt any need of secrecy  isabel studied her from a little distance  rose tell me how is it that you didnt marry young as so many poor girls do  rose considered a moment  i hardly know myself  you had lovers always  yes always  and you had fancies too  o yes as all girls do i suppose  why didnt you marry one of these  well for one reason they didnt please me well enoughi mean long enough they grew tiresome after awhile and then i was ambitious i wanted to get out into the world i couldnt marry some one who would bind me down to the cookstove all my life and then i had my ideals of what a man should beand some way the boys didnt interest me after awhile  i think i understand that youre going to marry some time of course  rose looked down why yes i suppose somost girls do  dont think im impertinent will you but is there anyare you bound to any one  rose lifted her face  no i am as free as any woman  im glad of that rose i was afraid you might be halfengaged to some one in the college or back in the valley it makes it very fine and simple if you can enter your wider life here free you are sure to marry and you ought to marry well  rose replied a little disgustedly  i hate to think of marrying for a home and i hate to think of marrying as a profession writers accuse us of thinking of nothing else and i get sick and tired of the whole thing i wish i was just a plain animal or had no sex at all sometimes i think it is a curse to be a woman she ended fierce and sullen  isabel shrank a little  o dont be too hard on me rose i didnt mean to anger you  im not angry the things i want to say i cant seem to say it isnt your fault or mine its just fate i hate to think of marrying well  i think i understand isabel said a little appalled at the storm she had raised i havent been troubled by that question because i have a profession and have something to think about besides marriage and still we must think about it enough to prepare for it the world must have its wives and mothers you are to be a wife and mother you are fitted for it by nature men see thatthat is the reason you are never without suitors all i was going to say dear was this you are worthy the finest and truest man for you have a great career i feel sure of itand sobut no ill not lecture you another minute youre a stronger woman than i ever was and i feel you can take care of yourself  thats just it i dont feel sure of that yet i feel dependent upon my father and i ought not to be im out of school im twentythree years of age and i want to do something i must do somethingand i dont want to marry as aas abecause i am a failure  nobody wants you to do that rose but you didnt mean that exactly you mean you didnt want to come to any man dependent i dont think you will youll find out your best holt as the men say and youll succeed  rose looked at her in silence a moment  im going to confess something she finally said with a little laugh i hate to keep house i hate to sew and i cant marry a man who wants me to do the way other women do i must be intended for something else than a housewife because i never do a bit of cooking or sewing without groaning i like to paint fences and paper walls but im not in the least domestic  isabel was amused at the serious tone in which rose spoke  there is one primal event which can change all that ive seen it transform a score of women it will make you domestic and will turn sewing into a delight  what do you mean asked rose though more than half guessing  i mean motherhood  the girl shrank and sat silent as if a doom had been pronounced upon her  that is what marriage must mean to you and to me isabel said and her face had an exultant light in it i love my professioni am ambitious in it but i could bear to give it all up a hundred times over rather than my hope of being a mother  the girl was awed almost into whispering  does it mean thatwill it take away your power as a physician  no thats the best of it these days if a woman has brains and a good man for a husband it broadens her powers i feel that dr sanborn and i will be better physicians by being father and mother o those are great words rose let me tell you they are broader than poet or painter deeper than wife or husband ive wanted to say these things to you rose youve escaped reckless marriage someway now let me warn you against an ambitious marriage  she broke off suddenly no ill stop youve taken care of yourself so far it would be strange if you couldnt now she turned quickly and went to rose i love you she said we are spiritual sisters i felt that the day you crushed me i like women who do not cry i want you to forgive me for lecturing you and i want you to go on following the lead of your mysterious guide i dont know what it is or rather who he is  she stopped suddenly and seating herself on the arm of roses chair smiled  i believe it is a man somewhere come now confesswho is he  quick as light the form and face of william de lisle came into roses thought and she said  hes a circus rider  isabel unclasped roses arm and faced her  a circus rider  rose colored hotly and looked away  icant tell you about ityoud laugh andwell i dont care to explain  isabel looked at her with comical gravity  do you know what youve done coolly girl you know the common opinion of womans curiosity i dont believe a woman is a bit more curious than a man only a woman is curious about things he isnt im suffering agonies this minute you know im an alienist ive studied mad people so much i know just what sends them off youve started me if you dont explain at once she went to the door and called etta dont disturb me no matter who comes  now tell me about it she said as she sat down beside rose and studied her with avid eyes  why its nothing rose began i never spoke to him and he never even saw me and i never saw him but once  and yet he influenced your whole life  rose mused a moment  yes i can see it nowi never realized it beforehe has helped me all my life  she told of her first sight of him of her long ride home of her thoughts of him reserving something of course and her voice grew husky with remembered emotion she uttered more than she knew she showed the keen little woman at her side the more imaginative side of her nature it became evident to isabel that the beautiful poise of the head and supple swing of the girls body was in part due to the suggestion of the mans perfect grace his idealized face had made the commonplace apparenthad led her lifted her  why its all a poem she exclaimed at the end its magnificent and you thought id laugh she looked reproachful i think its incredibly beautiful what was his name we may meet him some time  rose drew back and grew hot with a blush  oh noi dont want to see him now im afraid he wouldnt seem the same to me now  isabel considered youre right he never really existed he was a product of your own clean sweet imagination but let me tell you she made a swift feminine turn to the trivial youll marry a tall lathy man or a short dumpy man thats the way things go really ill need to keep doctor and mason out of the house     chapter xxiii  a storm and a helmsman   in quiet wise her winter wore on in a month or two the home feeling began to make itself felt and the city grew less appalling though hardly less oppressive there were moments when it seemed the most splendid presence in the worldat sunset when the river was crowded with shipping and the great buildings loomed up blue as woodsmoke almost translucent when the brick walls grew winecolored when the river was flooded with radiance from the western sun and the great steamers lay like birds wearied and dreaming after a long journey  sometimes too at night when she came out of the concert hall and saw the glittering twin tiaras of burning gold which the great northern towers held against the blueblack starless sky two hundred feet above the pavement or when in the early evening she approached the mountainous temple luminous and sparkling with electric lights lifting a lighted dome as airy as a bubble three hundred feet into the pale sapphire of the cloudless skythe city grew lofty  the gross the confused in line the prosy in color disappeared at such moments and the city always vast took on grace and charm and softened to magnificence became epic expressing in prophecy that which it must attain to expressed the swift coming in of art and poetry in the lives of the western worldbuilders  she grew with it all it deepened her conception of life but she could not write of it for the reason that it was too near and too multiple in its appeal upon her she strove daily to arrange it in her mind to put it into form and this striving wore upon her severely she lost some of her superb color and physical elasticity because of it and became each week a little less distinctive exteriorly which was a decided loss mason told isabel  she isnt losing anything very real isabel said shes just as unaccountable as ever she goes out much less than you imagine i take her out and send her all i can to keep her from getting morbid why dont you come oftener and help me  selfprotection said mason  are you afraid of a country girl  o noafraid of myself  how much do you mean of that warren  all of it  she wrinkled her brow in disgust of his concealing candor  o you are impossible in that mood  as the winter deepened rose narrowed the circle of conquest she no longer thought of conquering the world it came to be the question of winning the approbation of one human soul that is she wished to win the approbation of the world in order that warren mason might smile and say well done  she did not reach this state of mind smoothly and easily on the contrary she had moments when she rebelled at the thought of any mans opinion being the greatest good in the world to her she rebelled at the implied inferiority of her position in relation to him and also at the physical bondage implied in the morning when she was strong in the midst of some social success when people swarmed about her and men bent deferentially then she held herself like a soldier on a tower defying capture  but at night when the lights were all out when she felt her essential loneliness and weakness and needwhen the world seemed cold and cruel and selfish then it seemed as if the sweetest thing in the universe would be to have him open his arms and say come  there would be rest there and repose his judgment his keen wit his penetrating powerful influence made him seem a giant to her a giant who disdained effort and gave out an appearance of indifference and lassitude she had known physical giants in her neighborhood who spoke in soft drawl and slouched lazily in action but who were invincible when aroused  she imagined she perceived in mason a mental giant who assumed irresolution and weakness for reasons of his own he was always off duty when she saw him and bent more upon rest than a display of power once or twice she saw him roused and it thrilled her that measured lazy roll of voice changed to a quick stern snarl the brows lowered and the big plump face took on battle lines it was like a seemingly shallow pool suddenly disclosed to be of soundless depths by a wind of passion  the lake had been the refuge of the distracted and restless girl she went to it often in the autumn days for it rested her from the noise of grinding wheels and screams and yells its smooth rise and fall its sparkle of whitecaps its sailing gulls filled her with delicious pleasure it soothed her and it roused her also it gave her time to think  the street disturbed her left her purposeless and powerless but out there where the ships floated like shadows and shadows shifted like flame and the wind was keen and sweetthere she could get her mental breath again she watched it change to wintry desolation till it grew empty of vessels and was lonely as the arctic sea and always it was grand and thoughtinspiring  she went out one day in march when the home longing was upon her and when it seemed that the city would be her death she was tired of her food tired of mary tired of her room her forehead was knotted tensely with pain of life and love  she cried out with sudden joy for she had never seen the lake more beautiful near the shore a great mass of churned and heaving ice and snow lay like a robe of shaggy fur beyond this the deep water spread a vivid peagreen broken by wide irregular strips of dark purple in the open water by the wall a spatter of steelblue lay like the petals of some strange flower scattered upon the green  great splendid clouds developed marvelously like the clouds of june making the girls heart swell with memories of summer they were white as wool these mountainous clouds and bottomed in violet and as they passed the snowfields they sent down pinkpurple misty shadows which trailed away in splendor toward the green which flamed in bewildering beauty beyond the girl sat like one in a dream while the wind blew the green and purple of the outer sea into fantastic flitting forms which dazzled her eyes like the stream of mingled banners  each form seemed more beautiful than the preceding one each combination had such unearthly radiance her heart ached with exquisite sorrow to see it vanish the girl felt that spring was coming on the wing of the southern wind and the desire to utter her passion grew almost into pain  it had other moods this mighty spread of water it could be angry dangerous sometimes it rolled sullenly and convoluted in oily surges beneath its coverlid of snow like a bed of monstrous serpents sometimes the leaden sky shut down over it and from the desolate northeast a snowstorm rushed hissing and howling sometimes it slumbered for days quiet as a sleeping boa then awoke and was a presence and a voice in the night fit to make the hardiest tremble  rose saw it when it was roused but she had yet to see it in a frenzy the knowledge of its worst came to her early in may just before her return to the coulé  the day broke with the wind in the northeast rose lying in her bed could hear the roar of the lake never before had its voice penetrated so far she sprang up and dressed eager to see it in such a mood mary responded sleepily to her call saying the lake would be there after breakfast  rose did not regret her eagerness though it was piercingly cold and raw the sea was already terrific its spread of tawny yellow showed how it had reached down and laid hold on the sand of its bed there were oily splotches of plumcolor scattered over it where the wind blew it smooth and it reached to the wild east sky cold desolate destructive  it had a fierce breathing snarl like a monster at meat it leaped against the seawall like a rabid tiger its sleek and spotted hide rolling every surge sent a triangular sheet of foam twentyfive feet above the wall yellow and white and shadowed with dull blue and the wind caught it as it rose and its crest burst into great clouds of spray which sailed across the streets and dashed along the walk like rain making the roadway like a river while the main body of each upleaping wave falling back astride the wall crashed like the fall of glass and the next wave met it with a growl of thunderous rage striking it with concave palm with a sound like a cannons exploding roar  out of the appalling obscurity to the north frightened ships scudded at intervals with bare masts bending like firetrimmed pines they hastened like homing pigeons which do not look behind the helmsmen stood grimly at their wheels with eyes on the harbor ahead  the girl felt it all as no one native to the sea can possibly do it seemed as if the bounds of the flood had been overcome and that it was about to hurl itself upon the land the slender trees standing deep in the swash of water bowed like women in pain the wall was half hidden and the flood and the land seemed mingled in battle  rose walked along the shore too much excited to go back to her breakfast at noon she ate lunch hurriedly and returned to the shore there were hundreds of people coming and going along the drive young girls shrieking with glee as the sailing clouds of spray fell upon them rose felt angry to think they could be so silly in face of such dreadful power  she came upon mason dressed in a thick mackintosh coat taking notes rapidly in a little book he did not look up and she passed him wishing to speak yet afraid to speak near him a young man was sketching  mason stood like a rock in his long closefitting raincoat while she was blown nearly off her feet by the blast she came back against the wind feeling her souls internal storm rising it seemed quite like a proposal of marriage to go up and speak to himyet she could not forego the pleasure  he did not see her until she came into his lee then he smiled extending his hand she spoke first  may i take shelter here  his eyes lightened with a sudden tender humor  free anchorage he said and drew her by the hand closer to his shoulder it was a beautiful moment to her and a dangerous one to him he took refuge in outside matters  how does that strike your inland eyes he pointed to the north  its awful its like the anger of god she spoke into his bowed ear  please dont think im reporting it he explained im only making a few notes about it for an editorial on the need of harbors each moment the fury increased the waves deepened the commotion sank down amid the sands of the deeper inshore water and it boiled like milk splendid colors grew into it near at hand the winds tore at the tops of the waves and wove them into tawny banners which blurred the air like blown sand on the horizon the waves leaped in savage ranks clutching at the sky like insane seamonsters frantic futile  ive seen the atlantic twice during a gale shouted the artist to a companion but i never saw anything more awful than this these waves are quicker and higher i dont see how a vessel could live in it if caught broadside  its the worst i ever saw here  im going down to the south side would you like to go mason asked of rose  i would indeed she replied  back from the lake shore the wind was less powerful but more uncertain it came in gusts which nearly upturned the street cars men and women scudded from shelter to shelter like beleaguered citizens avoiding cannon shots  what makes our lake so terrible said mason in the car is the fact that it has a smooth shoreno indentations no harbors there is only one harbor here at chicago behind the breakwater and every vessel in midlake must come here those flying ships are seeking safety here like birds the harbor will be full of disabled vessels  as they left the car a roaring gust swept around a twentystory building with such power rose would have been taken off her feet had not mason put his arm about her shoulders  youre at a disadvantage he said with skirts he knew she prided herself on her strength and he took no credit to himself for standing where she fell  it was precisely as if they were alone together the storm seemed to wall them in and his manner was more intimate than ever before it was in very truth the first time they had been out together and also it was the only time he had assumed any physical care of her he had never asserted his greater muscular power and mastery of material things and she was amazed to see that his lethargy was only a mood he could be alert and agile at need it made his cynicism appear to be a mood also at least it made her heart wondrously light to think so  they came upon the lake shore again near the auditorium the refuge behind the breakwater was full of boats straining at anchor rolling pitching crashing together close about the edge of the breakwater ships were rounding hurriedly and two broken vessels lay against the shore threshing up and down in the awful grasp of the breakers far down toward the south the water dashed against the spiles shooting fifty feet above the wall sailing like smoke deluging the street and lashing against the row of buildings across the way  masons keen eye took in the situation  every vessel that breaks anchor is doomed nothing can keep them from going on shore doubtless those two schooners lost anchorthat one there is dragging anchor he said suddenly she is shifting position and see that hulk  rose for a moment could not see it she lay flat on her side a twomaster her sails flapping and floating on the waves her anchor still held but she had listed her cargo careened and so lay helpless  there are men on it cried some one three mendont you see them the water goes over them every time  sure enough i wonder if they are going to let them drown here in the harbor  rose grew numb with horror on the rounded side of the floating hulk three men were clinging looking like pegs of tops they could only be seen at intervals for the water broke clear over their heads it was only when one of them began to move to and fro that the mighty crowd became certainly aware of life still clinging to the hull  it was an awful thing to stand helplessly by and see those brave men battle but no lifeboat or tug could live out there in the station men wept and imprecated in their despairtwice they tried to go to the rescue of the beleaguered men but could not reach them  suddenly a flare of yellow spread out on the wave a cry arose  shes breaking up  rose seized masons arm in a frenzy of horror  o god cant somebody help them  theyre out of reach said mason solemnly and then the throng was silent  they are building a raft shouted a man with a glass speaking at intervals for the information of all one man is tying a rope to planks  he is helping the other men  he has his little raft nearly ready  they are crawling toward him  o see them exclaimed rose o the brave men there they are gonethe vessel has broken up  on the wave nothing now lived but a yellow spread of lumber the glass revealed no living thing  mason turned to rose with a grave and tender look  you have seen human beings engulfed like flies  no no there they are shouted a hundred voices as if in answer to masons thought  thereafter the whole great city seemed to be watching those specks of human life drifting toward almost certain death upon the breakwater of the south shore for miles the beach was clustered black with people they stood there it seemed for hours watching the slow approach of that tiny raft again and again the waves swept over it and each time that indomitable man rose from the flood and was seen to pull his companions aboard  other vessels drifted upon the rocks other steamers rolled heavily around the long breakwater but nothing now distracted the gaze of the multitude from this appalling and amazing struggle against death nothing no once and only once did the onlookers shift their intent gaze and that was when a vessel passed the breakwater and went sailing toward the south through the fleet of anchored straining agonized ships at first no one paid much attention to this latecomer till mason lifted his voice  by heaven the man is sailing  it was true steady swift undeviating the vessel headed through the fleet she did not drift nor wander nor hesitate she sailed as if the helmsman with set teeth were saying  by god if i must die on the rocks ill go to my death the captain of my vessel  and so with wheel in his hand and epic oaths in his mouth he sailed directly into the long row of spiles over which the waves ran like hellhounds where half a score of wrecks lay already churning into fragments in the awful tumult  the sailing vessel seemed not to waver nor seek nor dodgeseemed rather to choose the most deadly battleplace of waves and wall  god but thats magnificent of him mason said to himself  rose held her breath her face white and set with horror  o must he die  there is no hope for him she will strike in a momentshe strikesshe is gone  the vessel entered the grey confusion of the breakers and struck the piles like a battering ram the waves buried her from sight then the recoil flung her back for the first time she swung broadside to the storm the work of the helmsman was over she reeledresisted an instant then submitted to her fate crumbled against the pitiless wall like paper and thereafter was lost to sight  this dramatic and terrible scene had held the attention of the onlookersonce more they searched for the tiny raft it was nearing the lake wall at another furious point of contact an innumerable crowd spread like a black robe over the shore waiting to see the tiny float strike  a hush fell over every voice each soul was solemn as if facing the maker of the world out on the point just where the doomed sailors seemed like to strike there was a little commotion a tiny figure was seen perched on one of the spiles each wave as it towered above him seemed ready to sweep him away but each time he bowed his head and seemed to sweep through the gray wall he was a negro and he held a rope in his hands  as they comprehended his danger the crowd cheered him but in the thunder of the surf no human voice could avail the bold negro could not cry out he could only motion but the brave man on the raft saw his purposehe was alone with the shipwrecked ones  in they came lifted and hurled by a prodigious swell they struck the wall just beneath the negro and disappeared beneath the waves  all seemed over and some of the spectators fell weeping others turned away  suddenly the indomitable commander of the raft rose then his companions and then it was perceived that he had bound them all to the raft  the negro flung his rope and one man caught at it but it was swept out of reach on a backward leaping billow again they came in their white strained set faces and wild eyes turned to the intrepid rescuer again they struck and this time the negro caught and held one of the sailors held him while the foam fell away and the succeeding wave swept him over the spiles to safety again the resolute man flung his noose and caught the second sailor whose rope was cut by the leader the captain who was last to be saved  as the negro came back dragging his third man over the wall a mighty cry went up a strange faint multitudinous cry and the negro was swallowed up in the multitude                                       mason turned to rose and spoke sometimes men seem to be worth while  rose was still clinging to his arm as they walked away mason did not speak again for some time  we have suffered in vain he said at last and you are cold and stiffened with long standing let me put you in a cab and  oh no thank you the walk will do me good  perhaps you are right ill go with you to the car and then i must go to my desk for six hours of hard work put this behind you he said tenderly it does no good to suffer over the inevitable forget those men  i cant i shall never forget them while i live it was awful she shuddered but when she looked into his face she nearly cried out in astonishment at the light in his eyes  it had its grandeur they went to their death like men they have taught me a lesson hitherto i have driftedhenceforth i sail he bent to her with a mystical smile  she drew away in a sort of awe as if she looked unworthily upon a sacred place he misunderstood her action and said dont be afraid i have something to say to you but not here perhaps ill write it when do you go  on saturday  i will write you soon good bye  she watched him as he moved away into the crowd with powerful erect bodythe deskmans droop almost gone out of his shoulders what did he mean  she was standing waiting for a chance to board a car when elbert harvey came pushing along against the wind fresh and strong and glowing with color like a girl  o ive been looking for you rose he said i was at your house they said you were over on the lake front and sosee here youre all wet and cold im going to get a carriage  he would not be gainsaid and she was really glad to escape the crowd in the car he said im going to take you home to get warm  she allowed herself to be driven to the door before she realized what it might be taken to mean but it was then too late to insist on being driven home it would do no harm to see mrs harvey for a momentand then she was so tired too tired to resist  mrs harvey met her in the hall smiling and scolding  why you reckless girl have you been down town elbert where did you get her  i found her on the street waiting for a state street carshivering too  why youre all wet come up to my room and change your shoes  the warm air and the glow of the beautiful rooms seemed to narcotize her and rose allowed herself to be led away like a sleepy child it was delicious to be so attended mrs harvey took her to her own room a room as big and comfortable and homely as herself and there she put rose down before the grateful fire and rang for her maid  annette remove mademoiselles shoes and give her some slippers  the deft girl removed roses wraps then her shoes while mrs harvey knelt by her side and felt of her stocking soles  theyre wet just as i expected she said joyfully take them off  o no theyll dry in a minute  take them off annette commanded mrs harvey o what lovely feet and ankles she said and so betrayed her not too subtle design to rose  rose was passive now and yielded to the manipulations of the two women they all had a gale of fun over the difference between mrs harveys stockings and her own and then they brought out a fantastic pair of slippers and a beautiful wrap which mrs harvey insisted upon putting about her  at about this time elbert knocked on the door  cant i come in and share the fun caroline  in a moment she replied and finished tucking the robe about rose now you may  elbert came in radiant unabashed smiling almost grinning his delight he had changed his dress to a neat and exquisitely fitting dark suit and he looked very handsome indeed his cheeks were like peaches with much the same sort of fuzz over them  he took a place near the fire where he could see rose and he signaled to his mother at the earliest chance that she was stunning  rose lay back in the chair with the robe drawn about her looking the grande dame from her crown of hair to the tasseled toes of her slippers she might almost have been colombe on the eve of her birthday  it was delicious and she had not heart or resolution at the moment to throw off this homage she knew that mrs harvey was misreading her acquiescence and that every moment she submitted to her care and motherly direction involved her enmeshed her but it was so delicious to be a princess and an heiressfor an hour  the whole situation was intensified when mr harveys soft tenor voice called  where is everybody  come up here we are theres somebody here youll want to see  mr harvey came in smiling looking as calm and contained as if he were just risen from sleep he was almost as exquisitely dressed as his son  well well this is a pleasure he cordially exclaimed whats the meaning of the wrap not sick  elbert picked her up on the street wet and shivering waiting for a car and brought her home  quite right were always glad to see you did you give her a little cordial caroline in case of cold  rose protested im not sick mr harvey only tired ive been out all the day watching the dreadful storm i saw those ships go on the rocks o it was dreadful  did you see the three men on the raft asked elbert  rose shuddered how far away she was from that cold gray tumult of water of what manner of men were they who could battle so for hours in the freezing sleet  well now we wont talk about the storm any more mrs harvey interposed it does no good and rose has had too much of it already besides its almost dinner time mr harvey go dress  there was not a thread ruffled on mr harveys person but he dutifully withdrew he had had a busy day and had transacted business which affected whole states by its influence yet he was quiet cordial exquisite  what does this mean my dear he asked of mrs harvey who followed him out  it may mean a great deal willis she said all i know is elbert brought her home his eyes shining with delight  not to be wondered at mr harvey replied im only afraid of actresses he added a little incoherently but his wife understood him  elbert was not lacking in adroitness he did not presume on his position during his mothers absence he remained standing in the same position  how do you like coddling now you see what i get when i dare to sneeze caroline will coddle any one into regular sickness if you let her  i was chilled but i am not sick in the least  youd better straighten up and shout at her when she comes in or shell be for sending your dinner up to you and i dont want that  o i must go home now  not till after dinner  im notdressed for dinner  theres nobody here but ourselves you must stay  every one seemed determined to press her into a false position and there was so little chance to throw the influence off  she rose out of her cloak and when mrs harvey came back she was standing before the fire with elbertwhich seemed also to be significant  caroline dont coddle rose any more shes all right  mrs harvey accepted this command because it argued a sense of proprietorship on her sons part  they continued this intimate talk during the dinner elbert took her down and placed her near him there were a couple of elderly ladies sisters of mr harvey who sat also at table in a shadowy way and rose divined in a flash of imaginative intelligence how they subordinated themselves because they were dependent would i grow like that as i grew old was her thought  at the table she felt it her duty to rouse herself to talk and she took part in the jolly patter between elbert and his mother their camaraderie was very charmingso charming one almost forgot the irreverence expressed by his use of caroline  after dinner mrs emma seymour gallup whom rose had met two or three times but who always demanded a new introduction came whisking in on her way to some party she had everything in decidedly the latest crimp her sleeves did not fit her hips seemed enormous her bonnet seemed split on the middle of her head and was symmetrically decked with bows of ribbon and glitter and glimmer her real proportions were only to be divined at the waist all else was fibrecloth and conjecture  her eyes were bright and her face cold and imperious she had once before chilled rose with a cold nod and insulting shift of shoulder she was plainly surprised to see rose in the bosom of this family and she seized the only plausible explanation with instant readiness and smiled a beautiful smile and rose could not help seeing that she had a very charming face after all  ah how do you do miss dutcher i am very glad to see you again  thank you rose replied simply  youre quite wellbut then i know youre well mrs gallup went on assuming still greater knowledge of her  did you see the storm wasnt it dreadful i saw it all quite securely from mrs frosts window how cosy you all look i wish i could stay but i just dropped in to ask you to take a seat in my box on saturday night bring miss dutchermr gallup will be delighted to meet her  all that she said and more that she implied enmeshed rose like folds of an invisible intangible net  mrs harvey calmly accepted but rose exclaimed o youre very kind but i am going home on saturday morning  how sad i should have liked to have you come  after she was gone rose sprang to her feet i must go now she said and there was a note in her voice which mrs harvey knew meant inflexible decision  as they went upstairs rose was filled with dread of some further complication but mrs harvey only said  i love you my child i wish you were going to stay here always  she left the way open for confidences but rose was in a panic to get away and kept rigid silence  in the carriage she contrived to convey to elbert her desire to be left alone and so he kept back the words of love which were bubbling in his good frank soul he was saddened by it but not made hopeless it would have been a beautiful close to a dramatic day could he have kissed her lips and presented her to his mother as his promised wifebut it was impossible for even his volatile nature to break into her somber almost sullen silence and when he said good night rose with tender sweetness she replied curtly good night and fled  she hurried past mary to her own room and lay for hours on her bed without undressing listening to the howl of the wind the grind of cars and the distant boom of the breakers there was a storm in her heart also  she thought of that lovely and gentle home of the power wealth would give her of the journeys into the world of trips to europe to the ocean to boston and new york and london it could give her a life of ease of power of grace and charm o how beautiful it all was but  to win it she had to cut off her old father he never could fit in with these people she thought of his meeting with the harveys with a shudder then too she would need to give up her own striving toward independence for it was plain these people would not hear to her continued effort even if they consented she would be meshed in a thousand other duties  and then she thought of mason toiling at his desk down there in the heart of the terrible town and the look on his face grew less and less imperious and more wistful and pleading this day she had caught a new meaning from his eyesit was as if he needed her it seemed absurd and she blushed to think it but so it seemed that last look on his face was the look of a lonely man  his words came to her again and again hitherto i have driftedhenceforth i will sail  and she pushed away the splendid picture of a life of ease and reached out for comradeship with a man of toil of dreams and hidden powers     chapter xxiv  mason takes a vacation   as mason walked away from the lake that terrible day it seemed as if he had ceased to drift the spirit of that grim helmsman appeared to have entered into him life was short and pleasures few for fifteen years he had planned important things to do but had never done themfeeling all the time the power to write latent within him yet lacking stimulus from the very first this girl had roused him unaccountably her sympathy her imaginative faculty as well as her beauty had come to seem the qualities which he most needed  could he have gone to his own fireside at once the determining letter would have been written that night but the routine of the office the chaff of his companions took away his heroic mood and when he entered a car at twelve oclock he slouched in his seat like a tired man and the muscles of his face fell slack and he looked like a hopeless man  after rose went home he seemed to sanborn to be more impassible than ever as for mason himself it seemed as if some saving incentive had gone out of his lifesome redeeming grace he had grown into the habit of dropping in at isabels once a week and isabel had taken care that rose should be often there on the same evening and so without giving much thought to it he had come to accept these evenings as the compensating pleasures of his sombre life  it was such a delight to come up out of the vicious pitiless grind of his newspaper day and sit there before the fire with the face of a radiant girl to smile upon him her voice with its curiously penetrating yet musical quality stirred him to new thoughts and often he went home at ten or eleven and wrote with a feeling of exultant power upon his book after she went home he wrote no more he smoked and pondered when he called upon isabel and sanborn he continued to smoke and to ponder  he had not abandoned his allegory in talking with sanborn and sanborn and isabel together could not get at his real feeling for rose  sanborn asked one day plumply  mason why dont you marry the coolly girl and begin to live  it would be taking a mean advantage of her shes going to be famous one of these days and then i should be in the way  nonsense  besides she probably would not marry me and if she would i dont think i could keep up the pose  what pose  of husband  is that a pose sanborn smiled  it would be for me mason said rather shortly he was thinking once more of the letter he had promised to write to rose but which he had never found himself capable of finishing  he put it in his pocket when he went up in july to spend a week at the herrick cottage at oconomowoc isabel and sanborn were married just before leaving the city  sanborn said he had the judge come in to give him legal power to compel isabel to do his cooking for him and isabel replied that her main reason was to secure a legal claim on sanborns practice  the wedding had been very quiet society reporters who did not see it called it an unique affair but mason who did see it said it was a very simple process so simple it seemed one ought to be able to go through it oneself to which sanborn replied quite right try it  they had a little cottage on the bank of the lake and sanborn came up on saturdays with the rest of the madly busy men who rest over sunday and overwork the rest of the week mason had been with them a week and though he gave no sign he was nearing a crisis in his life he had gone to the point of finishing his letter to roseit was lying at that moment in his valise waiting to be postedbut it was a long way from being over with it was a tremendous moment for him as he approached the deciding moment the deed grew improbable impossible it was a very beautiful life there on the lake with nothing to do but smoke and dream but one evening he had the impulse to ask isabels advice and after dinner he courteously invited her to sail with him  there was some joking by sanborn about the impropriety of such a thing on isabels part and many offers to man the boat which mason said sprang from jealousy i consider i am doing you people a kindness in not letting you bore each other into black hatred it ended in the two friends drifting away over the lake while sanborn called after them threats of war if they were not at the wharf at ninesharp  they talked commonplaces for a time while the sky flushed and faded and the lake gradually cleared of its fisher boats slowly the colors grew tender and a subtle impalpable mist rose from the water through which the boat drifted before an imperceptible breeze  the two sailors lay at ease mason at the rudder the sail stood up light and airy and soundless as a butterflys wing it pointed at the sparse stars as if with warning finger  the hour and the place were favorable to confidences as the dusk deepened a boatload of young people put off into the lake singing some wailing sweet song they were far enough away to be unobtrusively impersonal a plover was faintly calling from the sedgy shore on the other side  one should be forever young said mason broodingly  isabel said once i heard a cow low and a robin laugh while a cricket chirped in the grass why should they have moved me so  mason mused a moment the cow was maternity pleading for its suckling the robins laugh suggested a thousand springtimes and the cricket prophesied the coming of frost and age love and loss are in the wail of yonder song the loneliness of age in yonder piping bird and the infinite and allabsorbing menstruum of death in the growing dusk  and the light of mans optimism in the piercing out of the stars  it may be so he replied uncertainly  they drifted on in silence there was a faint ripple at the prow and that was all at last mason roused himself to say his word  all these intangible essences and powers are no apparent reason why i should do so foolish a thingbut they have influenced me today i wrote to our coolly girli hope to say my coolly girl  isabel caught her breath  warren did you im very glad if i could reach you id shake your hand  i dont rejoice this thing which boys and girls find easy i find each year more difficult quite equal to the revolution of the earthperhaps the girl will save me from myself  shell save you for yourself and youll be happy  it is impossible to say he said sombrely i have warned her fairly once i should not have warned the woman of my choice am i gaining in humanity or losing please lower your head i am going to tack  the boat swung about like a sleeping gull and the sail slowly filled and the ripple at the prow began again  after a little mason went on in a calm even voice  the world to me is not well governed and i hesitate about marriage for it has the effect in most cases of perpetuating the human species which is not as yet a noble business i am torn by two minds i dont appear to be torn by even one mind but i am i am convinced that rose has imagination which is in my eyes the chief thing in a wife it enables her to idealize methere was a touch of his usual humor in thatand fills me with alleged desire to possess her but it is sad business for her isabel when i think of her i am of the stature of a thief crouching for concealment  the two in the boat were no longer young they had never been lovers but they seemed to understand each other like man and wife  i am old in knowledge of the worldmy life has ground away any charm i might have once possessed for her sake i hope she will refuse  she perceived he was at the end of his confidence and she began speaking i promised you a story once she began and im going to tell it now and then well return to rose  she spoke in a low voice with a little catching of the breath peculiar to her when deeply moved it made her voice pulse out like the flow of heavy wine she faced him in the shadow but he knew she was not looking at him at all just how she began he didnt quite hearperhaps she was a little incoherent  o those days when i was seventeen she went on everything was magical every moonlit night thrilled me with its possibilities i remember how the boys used to serenade me and theni was a mediæval maiden at my barred window and they were disguised knights seeking me in strange lands by their songs  you know what i mean i tingled with the immense joy of it they sang there in the moonlight and i tiptoed to the window and peeped out and listened and listened with pictures and pictures tumbling in and out of my head  of course it was only the inherited feminine rising up in me as you would saybut it was beautiful it just glorified that village street making it the narrow way in a spanish city  there was silence again mason softly said bend your head once more  when the boat swung around and the faint moon and the lights of the town shifted isabel went on  one of the boys who came on those midnight serenadings became my heroremember i was only seventeen and he was twenty we used to meet on the streetand oh how it shook me my heart fluttered so i could not speak and at first i had to run past him after a time i got composed enough to speak to him  her voice choked with remembered passion but after a little pause she went on  all this i know as well as you is absurd  it is very beautiful he said go on  he was tall and straight i remember with brown hair he was a workman of some kind i know he used to show me his powerful hands and say he had tried to get the grime from them they were splendid heroic hands to me i would have kissed them if i dared it was all incredible folly but i thought i was loving beneath my station for i was a little grandee in the town it pleased me to think i was stoopingdefying the laws of my house he never tried to see me at homehe was good and cleani can see that now for i remember just how his frank clear eyes looked at me he didnt talk much he seemed content to just look at me  well that went on for weeks he used to follow me to church as the boys do in country towns but i used to go to different places just to see if he would find out and be there to meet me at the door he never offered to speak to me or take my arm but he stood to see me go by do you know if i go into a country church today that scent of wilted flowers and linen and mingled perfumes almost makes me weep  i understand  her voice was lower when she resumed  well then the dreadful the incredible happened he did not meet me any more and just when i was wild with rage and humiliation came the news of his illnessand then i suffered o god how i suffered i couldnt inquire about himi couldnt see him i had kept my secret so well that no one dreamed of my loving him so the girls thought that he followed me and that i despised him and when they jested about him i had to reply while my heart was being torn out of me i spent hours in my room writhing walking up and down cursing in a girls way myself and godi was insane with it all  she drew a long breath but it did not relieve her her voice was as tense as before when she spoke again the helmsman leaned to listen for he could hardly hear  then one day he diedo that awful day i sat in my room with the curtains down i couldnt endure the sunlight i pretended to be sick i was numb with agony and yet i could do nothing i couldnt even send a rose to lay on his coffin i couldnt even speak his name i could only lie there like a prisoner gagged and on the rackto suffersuffer  the shadow of the sail covered the woman like a mantle it was as if the man listening had turned away his face from her sacred passion she was more composed when she spoke again  well it wore itself out after a time i got hungry and ate once more though i did not suppose i ever should i came down to the family a week later a puzzle to them they never thought to connect my illness with the death of an obscure machinist and then in the same way i crept gradually back into societyback into the busy life of a popular young girl but there was one place where no one ever entered i never told any one of this before i tried to tell dr sanborn about it once but i felt he might not understand i tell you becausebecause you can understand and because you may be influenced by it and understand your wife when she comes to you these days come to many women at seventeen and though we cant spare them out of our lives it doesnt mean disloyalty to our present ideals i think you understand  very well indeed he said i have such memories myself  then i resolved to be a physician i felt that he would not have died if he had been treated properly the connection was obscure but powerful enough to consecrate me to the healing profession then i met dr sanborn i love him and i couldnt live without him but there is that figure back thereto have him and all that he means go out of my life would take part of my heart away her voice had appeal in it  you understand me it was all clean and innocent but it was my first passion and i cant spare it rose may have such a memory it has nothing to do with today with her present ideals it is not disloyaltyit is  the love of love said mason i thank you for your trust in me rose is what she is not what she has been and then in perfect stillness the boat swung around and drifted toward the shore where a ruby lantern was swinging isabel turned and her voice was tremulous with earnestness  warren rose loves younot as she loved when a girl but as a woman loves i think i understand your hesitancyand i say you are wrong you need her and you will do her good you will develop her  she will suffer through me  that is a part of development  the boat was nearing the wharf and sanborns hearty voice came from the shore  see here isnt it pretty late for a pair of rheumatic old folks to be out sailing its 930 oclock  the breeze failed us isabel answered as mason took her hand to help her ashore  and the night was so beautiful said mason before she loosed his hand isabel shook it hard and now mason understood he mailed the letter that night and rose held his future in her hand     chapter xxv  rose receives a letter   rose went directly from that storm to the repose and apparent peace of the country and it helped her to make a great discovery she found every familiar thing had taken on a peculiar valuea literary and artistic value it was all so reposeful so secure a red barn set against a graygreen wooded hillside was no longer commonplace how pretty she thought i never noticed that before  a little girl wrapped in a shawl was watching cattle in the field a dog sat near his back to the misty drizzle rose saw it and put herself in the place of that child chilled and blue of hand with unfallen tears upon her cheeks  a crow flying by with ringing rough cry made her blood leap some cattle streamed up a lane and over a hill their legs moving invisibly gave them a gliding motion like a vast centipede some mysterious charm seemed imparted to everything she saw and as the familiar lines of the hills began to loom against the sky she became intolerably eager to see her father and the farm she hoped it would be a sunny day but it was raining heavily when she got out at the station  he was there the dear sweet old face smiling almost tearful he had an umbrella and couldnt return her hug but he put his arm about her and hurried her to the carriage and in a few moments they were spattering up the familiar road  instantly it seemed as if she had never been away she was a little girl again the horses shook their heads impatient at the rain the pools in the road were green as liquid emerald and were dimpled by the pelting drops the wheels flung segments of mud into the air but the horses drove ahead sullenly almost desperately unmindful of the splash and splatter of mud and water  rose took keen delight in it all she had been shut away from nature so long it seemed good to get back into even the stern mood of a may storm the great reeling masses of gray cloud delighted her and the ringing cry of frogs seemed delicious orchestration everything was fresh clean almost harsh how arid and artificial the city life seemed in the freshness of green fields  it was a pleasure to return to the barnyard to get back into the kitchen where her aunt was phlegmatically working away at suppergetting she wiped her hands on her apron and said howdedo as if rose were a neighbor just dropping in for a call  the life all seemed heroically dull but the coolness repose and sanity of nature was elemental as if she had risen into the rainy sky or sunk into the waters of the ocean it was deathly still at times and dark dark and illimitable and freshly sweet the night shut down over the valley  she went to sleep with the soft roar of the falling rain near her window and the faint puffing in of the breeze brought to her the delicious smell of the rainwashed leaves the acrid pungent odor of poplars the sweet smell of maples the fragrance of rich loamshe knew them all  by force of contrast she thought of mason and his life in the city the roar of traffic the thunder of great presses the nights at the opera or the theater all had enormous weight and value to her but how remote it all was in the country the city seemed unreal in the city the country seemed impossible  she awoke at the cry of a jay in the maples and then as she listened she heard a mourningdove sob from the distance robins were laughing merrily an oriole whistled once and flew away and hark yes a thrush was singing sitting high in some treetop she knew  the rain was over the valley was flooded with sunshine o so beautifulflooded with light like the love of god she sprang up with joyous energy lifes problem was not without solution if she could liveboth city and country too  she felt her joy of the country doubled by her winter in the citythis day was made marvelous by that storm on the lake  rhymes grew in her mind upon subjects hitherto untouched by her literary perception things she had known all her life familiar plants flowers trees etc seemed touched all at once by supernatural radiance  the clouds on the hills the buzz of bees in the clover the sabre swing of poplar trees against the sky moved her to song and she wrote daily with marvelous ease she flung herself prone on the bank by the spring and strove to mix and be one with the wind and the trees she thought of her childish crooning over carl that day his head lay in her lap and its significance came to her and voiced itself in music  she traced out every path where her feet had trod as a child and the infinite significance and terror and high beauty of life and death came upon her she seemed to summon up and analyze all her past as if she were about to end one life and begin another these wonderful moods and memories in some unaccountable way coordinated themselves in lines of verse and the restless vigorous heart of the girl felt the splendid peace which comes when the artist finds at last that art which is verily his  the body of her verse grew and she longed for masons opinion upon it and yet she feared to send it it seemed so different from other verse at times she felt its passionate and imaginative quality and made up selections to send him but ended always by putting them away again  she had his picture in her room and sometimes she sat down to write with his sadly inscrutable face before her she could see in it as she studied it here in her home the lines of varied and restless thought which make up the face of a man who largely comprehends american civilization in the light of experience  that face represented to her the highest type of manhood and something more it was refined and infinitely subtle compared with the simple almost oxlike faces of the men about her it was sad too as her fathers face in repose was sad but the sadness was different there was patient resigned sadness in her fathers eyes and lips in masons bitter rebellious perhaps despairing sadness and something else tooyouth taking hold on the hopelessness of the whole world  and yet she knew how sweetly those lips could smile and she had felt the gentleness and purity hid in those eyes he looked at her as no other man looked without boldness without uncertainty clean manly and just and still there were those cynical lines about the lips not deep but still perceptible  she thought less of his fine erect bearing and yet she liked to see him walking down the street he had physical power and dignity but his face and eyes were etched in minutest detail upon her brain the life companionship of such a man came to seem more and more impossible for her to attain to the common little details of her life seemed to lower her she fell back into inelegant habits and careless speech and every time she realized it it put mason far off and far above her her verse lost its brilliancy its buoyancy and became dark and bitter at times  every night she wondered if she might not hear from him he had promised to write and he had hinted at something very important she knew that she had no definite claim upon him and yet her last letter had contained one question not of any importance only as it gave him a chance to reply if he felt like it  then the question came what of my winter in the city what has it done for me is not life as insoluble as eversuccess as far away as ever  could she live here in the country any easier because of her stay there did it not in fact make life harder  it was in thinking about these things and masons letter which did not come that her newfound rapture in nature began to cool down she began to spend more time in her room thinking of him and wondering what his attitude toward her really was  she had moments at last when his face seemed cynically smiling at her what did he care for an awkward country girl like her he pitied her that was all he wanted to help her and had tried and finding her dull had given her up and forgotten her he knew scores of beautiful women actresses artists millionaires daughters it was absurd to suppose that a girl from the coolly could be of any special interest to him and to win his love that was impossible  she had not the personal vanity which makes so many pretty and brainless women think themselves irresistible to any man and a fair return for any mans name and fame her flesh she made little of in the question  she hoped each week for a reply and in her letters to isabel asked for news about all friends meaning one especially  isabel wrote saying they had invited mr mason up to stay a few days at their cottage and that elbert harvey had asked after her and couldnt she come down  by the middle of july she had begun to pass days without writing at all  when the letter from mason came her father brought it to her with a smile guess this is a loveletter its a big one  she took it in her hand feeling a keen swift premonition of its importance it was indeed a heavy letteralmost a packet  she went to her room with it and took a seat by the window quite deliberately but her hands shook as she opened the envelope her senses seemed some way to acquire unnatural keenness like a scared animals she heard every voice about the barnyard and she felt the wind on her cheek like a live thing beating its slow wings the letter began simply       dear miss dutcher       i must begin by asking pardon for not writing before but as a      matter of fact i have not found this letter easy to compose it      represents a turning point in my life and contains an      important decision and i have never been less sure of my      judgment than now       this letter may be considered an offer of marriage it is well      to say that now and then all the things which come after will      be given their proper weight let me state the debit side of      the account first and if you feel that it is too heavy you can      put the letter down and write me a very short answer and the      matter will be ended       first i say to you whoso weds me weds sorrow i do not      promise to make you happy though i hope my influence will not      be always untoward i cannot promise any of the things husbands      are supposed to bring i cannot promise a home my own living      is precarious dependent upon my daily grind of newspaper work      for though i hope to achieve a success with my novel great      successes with novels do not mean much money i do not feel      either that i shall ever be free from money cares luxury and i      are to continue strangers       i cannot promise to conform to your ways nor to bend to your      wishes though i will try to do so i cannot promise to assume      cordial relations with your relatives nor accept your      friendships as binding upon me       i cannot promise to be faithful to you until death but i      shall be faithful so long as i fill the relation of husband to      you i shall not lead a double life or conceal from you any      change in my regard toward you if at any time i find a woman      whom i feel i should live with rather than with you i shall      tell you of her with perfect frankness i think i shall find      you allsufficient but i do not know men and women change      grow weary of things of bonds of duties it may be that i      shall become and continue the most devoted of husbands but i      cannot promise it long years of association develop      intolerable traits in men and women very often       on the other hand let me say i exact nothing from you i do      not require you to cook for me nor keep house for me you are      mistress of yourself to come and go as you please without      question and without accounting to me you are at liberty to      cease your association with me at any time and consider      yourself perfectly free to leave me whenever any other man      comes with power to make you happier than i       i want you as comrade and lover not as subject or servant or      unwilling wife i do not claim any rights over you at all you      can bear me children or not just as you please you are a      human soul like myself and i shall expect you to be as free      and as sovereign as i to follow any profession or to do any      work which pleases you it is but just to say that i have never      been a man of loose habits no woman has any claim upon me for      deed or word i have thought at various times that i could      marry this woman or that woman but i have never before made a      proposition of marriage to any woman       i have written you in good set terms what you may expect of      me i am not a demonstrative man by nature and my training      from childhood has made me saving of words of endearment my      love for you must be taken largely for granted after it is once      stated for i regard the word love as a jewel not to be      carelessly tossed from hand to hand       doubtlessly i shall make a dull companionthat i cannot judge      for myself  the letter concluded with this characteristic touch she seemed to hear his voice as she read it       i have written frankly because i believed it would prejudice      you in my favor had i believed otherwise doubtless i should      have written in terms of flattery and deceit for of such is      man when seeking woman in marriage       if you return the affirmative answer i shall be very happy to      come up and spend the rest of my vacation at your fathers      homeprovided it is agreeable to you  rose sat rigidly still in her chair her hands in her lap holding the letter  it had come again this question of marriage and this time it appealed to her whole natureto her intellectual part as well as to her material self uttered this time by a voice which had no tremor in it  how strange it all was how different from the other proposals she had received apparently cold and legal yet under the lines she felt something deep and manly and passionate because she was only a coulé girl and he was a man of the great intellectual world a man who molded public opinion by the power of his editorial pen he was greater than that in his presence you felt him to be a man of national reputation living quietly under an assumed name  there rose a great pride in her heart he had selected her from among the women of the world he loved her so much he had written her this strange letter which plead for her under its rigid order of words she held the letter to her lips as if to get its secret meaning so and then she dropped it as if it were a husk no matter what it said she felt the spirit of the man  she wrote a few lines and sealed them quickly then she fell into thought upon the terms of his letter she hardly comprehended the significance of the minor statements so filled was she with the one great fact he wished her to be his wife she was poor unknown and yet he had chosen her  there was something sad in the letter toolike his face it was inscrutable intricate but she believed noble in intention the freedom of action which he claimed for himself did not trouble her for she felt his love beneath it his word comrade pleased her too it seemed to be wholesome and sweet and promised intellectual companionship never before possible to her  o to be the wife of such a man to have his daily help and presence it was wonderful it could not be true yet there lay the letter in her lap and there the firm calm even signature she rose to her feet and her heart dilated with pride and her head was that of a newly crowned princess oh the great splendid world out there  she took up her letter suddenly and went downstairs and out into the yard in search of her father he was sitting by the bees with dreamy eyes he spent a great deal of his time there  father i want you to hitch kitty to the buggy for me  why of course where are you goin rose  im going to the siding to post a letter o pappa john she cried suddenly putting her arms round him im going to be married  john did not instantly comprehend her passion he was slower to move but he said  why rosie when who to  to a man in chicago mr warren mason a great editor im just writing to him to come  john began to feel the solemnity of the thought  does he live in chicago  yes she understood his thought but well come and see you summers just the same pappa john  well ill take the letter down  no i must take it myself she said smilingly holding the letter behind her like a child  there was something fine in carrying the letter to the office herself it seemed to hasten it the horse was spirited and carried her at a steady swift trot up hill and down and the railway track was soon in sight  suddenly an idea seized her why not telegraph her answer they might suspect him to be her lover but what did she care now she penned this message  come up tomorrow if you can please rose  but afterward as she approached the office she shrank from handing it in it seemed to her too plainly a love message she mailed her letter and fell to calculating when it would reach him he could not possibly come till the second day whereas if she telegraphed he might arrive in the morning this thought strengthened her resolution going over to the window she placed the message firmly before the operator who knew her and admired her deeply  please send that at once mr bingham  the operator smiled and bowed and when he read the message he looked up at her keenly but did not smile  any answer he asked  no probably not she replied will it go right out  immediately  as she turned away to ride home her soul took wing a marvelous elevation and peace came upon her it was done life held more than promise now it contained certainties her chosen one of israel was coming     chapter xxvi  mason as a lover   the telegram came to mason as he sat on the porch of the herrick cottage he read it and his eyes smiled but his feeling was not one of amusement the significance of that impulsive message struck deep and his blood responded to it as if it were an embrace  it settled all doubt in his mind concerning her she was as free and selfreliant as he thought her and the severe terms of his proposal had not repelled her and yet that she loved him in a right human and very passionate way did not seem to him possible  he had also other misgivings he wished he had delineated more fully in his letter the negative side of his character she is young and beautiful he thought and will want to see life she will value social affairsi am done with them she will want words of tender protestation flattery perhaps which i cannot give  my habits are fixed i like my silent pipe at night after dinner i shall undoubtedly get more and more disinclined to social duties as time goes on  in ten years i shall be fortyeight years old an old man when she is just in her splendid june season she will find the difference between our ages wider than now she will be a wife i can free her when she asks it but i cannot give her back her sweet superb girlhood i can give her perception and comprehension of the world and of life but i cannot make her young again i may die after a few years leaving her a mother with a hazardous future then she will be doubly cursed  again this marriage may ruin and interrupt her career with some women marriage especially maternity seems to take away their power as artists and to turn them into cooks and nurses meritorious vocations of course but  all night long he alternately mused and dozed upon the problem he roused up at early daylight with a feeling of doom upon him he had made a mistake he was not fitted to be a husbandhe was a poor thing at best who had not had energy enough to get out of a groove nor to demand adequate pay for grinding in his groove he lacked push and had dreamed away the best years of his life at least such parts of the years as he had saved from the merciless drive of his paper he was pulp squeezed dry  he groaned and a curse came upon his lips and his forehead knit into a tangle of deep lines his paper had used him it had sucked the blood of his heart the creative energy of his brain had gone into the impersonal columns of the editorial pageto what end to the end that the evening star publishing company should be rated high in bradstreet had any human being been made better by anything he had written in those columns politics good god he had sold his soul his blood the grace of his limbs the suppleness of his joints the bloom of his enthusiasms to put this or that damned party into power  and now when a beautiful young woman singing her way to fame had sent for him he must go to her cynical thinhaired stiff in joints bent in shoulders and reeking with the smell of office life and worst of all worked out his novel not yet written and his enthusiasm turned to indifference and despair  the problem of the age that morning made him savage he looked out of the window at the farmhouses gleaming in the early light at the smoke curling up into the still air at the men going to milk the cows  the damn fools he said in his heart they dont know enough to vegetate any more than i had sense to know i was becoming a machine rot and rot so we go like leaves to the muckheap the porter rushed in and shook him  almos to bluff siding sah  this put a little resolution into his blood and he dressed rapidly with little thought on anything else once or twice he looked out at the misty blue hills cool and fresh with recent rains as the porter came to get his grip a few minutes later mason wondered how he should meet her with a handshake or a kiss how would she meet him  as the train slowed down he saw her at the platform she sat in a carriage waiting for him he had one flashing thought there sits my wife it startled him the tremendous significance of that phrase made his brain dizzy for a moment  she was dressed trimly he noticed as he came toward her and she held her horse firmlyhe liked her for that it showed selfmastery as for him he felt more uncertainty of footing than ever before in his life and tried to throw off the stoop in his shoulders  as he came forward she flushed but her steady eyes met his unwaveringly he looked into their clear obscurity of depth wherein were purity and unworldly womanly ways  she held out her hand firm and strong and he took it in his outwardly it was merely a friendly greeting yet something subtler than light came from her to him he did not speak for an instant then he said  this is good of you i did not expect this great pleasure  her voice trembled as she said  i wanted to be the first to greet you and besides papa wouldnt know you  he smiled for the first time  thats true but its very earlyquite in the small hours  oh thats nothing im a farmers girl you know but put your valise in we must be off  how strong and supple she looked and how becoming her silk waist and straw hat she could drive too some way she seemed quite another sort of person here in her own land and in her own carriage she was so much more composed she has imagination he repeated to himself  they turned into the road before he spoke again  so this is your coolly  no this is our valley the coolly is over there where you see that cloud shadow sliding down  he looked about slowly at the hills and fields  its very fine much finer than oconomowoc and geneva  we like it  papa and i  they were both talking around the bush as the saying goes but he finally said  i was very glad to receive your telegram am i to take it as an affirmative answer  she said with effort  i wanted you to see how poor and humble we all are beforebefore i  he studied her profile her lips quivered and a tear glistened through the veil  on my part he said i regretted that i did not further set forth my general cussedness and undesirabilityhow well you drive he said by way of relieving the stress of the moment  he took command now and there were no more tender allusions he sniffed the smell of the grass and the wayside trees and remarked upon the cattle and inquired the names of several birds whose notes reached across the field  do you know im no wild lover of the country and i dont admire the country people unreservedly there are exceptions of coursebut my experience with them has not been such as to make them heroic sufferers as the new school of fiction sets em forth they are squalid enough and poor enough heaven knows but it is the squalor of piracythey do as well as i should under the same circumstances no doubt  rose looked at him narrowly as if to find his real thought he stopped abruptly at her glance  i beg your pardon for boring you but these disagreeable phases of my character should be known to you im full of whims and notions youll find  she looked away and a moment later said there is our farm that house in the grove is ours  cattle i hate so i hope your father will not expect me to be interested in stock  this was the first time he had mentioned her father and it moved her unaccountably it would be so dreadful if he should not understand her father his perverse attitude toward her and toward the country had brought her from exalted singleness of emotion down to a complexity of questionings and forebodings  as they whirled in the yard mason saw a new house of the ambitious porkpie order standing in a fairly wellkept sward with a background of barns corncribs pigsties and beehives a welltodo farmstead of the more fortunate sort and the thought that the man coming out of the barn to meet them was to be his fatherinlaw struck him like a gust of barnyard air really could it be that he had made this decision  as the man came nearer he appeared a strongarmed gentlefaced farmer of sixty his eyes were timid almost appealing his throat was brown and wrinkled as leather his chin beard was a faded yellowgrey and his hands were nobbed and crooked in the fingers he peered at mason through dimmed eyes  father said rose and her voice trembled a little this is mr mason  john dutcher put up his hand heartily  how do you do sir his timid smile touched mason but there was something else in the man which made him return the handclasp  i am glad to see you mr dutcher he said and his tone was so genuine it brought a gush of tears to the daughters eyes her lover understood her father after all  wont you light out sir continued john with elaborate hospitality  well yes i think i will said mason and roses spirits shook off their cowls  suddenly she heard every bird singing the thrush in the poplar top the catbirds in the willows the robin on the lawn the sun flooded the world with magical splendor it was morning in the world and morning in her life and her lover was walking up the path by her side  it was splendid beyond belief to show him to his room to bring him water and towels and to say from the doorway with a smile  breakfast is ready  the picture that she made lingered pleasantly on masons interior eye she was so supple of form and so radiant of color and so palpitant with timid joy  she sat alone at the table when he came out she explained as she showed him his seat father and my aunt had breakfast long ago  mrs diehl brought the coffee in and bowed awkwardly to mason the whole thing seemed like a scene in a play to him it was charming all the same to sit alone at the table with such a girl it was just the least bit exciting his hands shook a little he noticed  as he took his cup of coffee from her he said whimsically  i expect to wake up soon  does it seem like a dream to you too  well it isnt my everyday life i must confess  to her he seemed handsomer and more refined than in the city he seemed simpler too though he was still complex enough to keep her wondering the slope of his shoulders and the poise of his head were splendid to her it could not be possible that he was here to see her to be served by her to spend the days with her to be her husband if she should say so  and yet she retained her dignity she did not grow silly nor hysterical as a lesser woman might have done she was tremulous with happiness and wonder but she sat before him mistress of her hands and voice her very laughter pleased him if she had giggledheavens if she had giggled  john also went busily apparently calmly about his work mason was pleased at that it showed astonishing reserve in the man  again that keen sweet feeling of companionshipwifehoodcame to rose as they walked out side by side into the parlor he had come to her that was the marvelous thing she was doing wifely things for him it was all more intimate more splendid than she thought  they sat down in the best room and faced each other it was their most potential moment breakfast was eaten and the day was before them and an understanding was necessary  now i cant allow you to be hasty mason said ill tell you what i think you had better do defer your answer until two weeks from today when i shall return to the city that will give us time to talk the matter over and it will give you time to repent  a little shadow fell over her and the sunlight was not quite so brilliant the incomprehensible nature of the man came to her again and he seemed old old as a granite crag beyond song beyond love beyond hope  then he smiled well now im ready to go see the world any caves any rocking boulders any water tower  she took up the cue for gaiety no but i might take you to see the cemetery that is an appropriate sunday walk all the young people walk there  the cemetery im a believer in crematories ill tell you what well do after youve hung out the washboiler to dry well go down under the trees and ill listen to some of your verse now that is a tremendous concession on my part i hope you value it to the full  i do indeed  you do good well put the matter in movement at once  the dew is still on the grass she said warningly  so it is i thank you for remembering my growing infirmities well lets go out and see the pigs as i told you i hate cattle and swine they act out so frankly the secret vices of manbut never mind ill go out and have it out with your father  the moment he began in that tone she was helpless  they moved out into the barnyard but john was not in sight  i guess hes with his bees rose said he likes to sit out there and watch them when he is resting  they peered over the fence and their eyes took in a picture they will never forget while they live john dutcher sat before his bees in the bloom of the clover his head bowed in his hands he was crying for his lost daughter  there came a gripping pain in the girls throat the hot tears rushed to her eyes and she cried in a voice of remorseful agony  fatherpappa john  he lifted his head and looked at her his eyes dim with tears his lips quivering  the girl rushed through the gate and mason turned and walked away like a man discovered thieving from an altar     conclusion  the wind in the treetops   mason freshened magically under her sweet and selfcontained companionship she did not coddle him nor bore him by attentions but seemed to do the right thing instinctively she assumed command over him in certain waysthat is she insisted on his taking long walks and drives with herthough he sturdily refused to climb hills bring me to them gradually he said for i am from egypt  one sunday afternoon he consented to try an easy one and they started outshe in radiant laughing exultation he in pretended dark foreboding of the outcome  she led the way with swift steady swing of skirts her smiling face a challenge to him when he fell too far behind he never ceased to admire her powerful decisive movement and her radiant color though he said nothing about it to her  she stopped at a spring which came silently to light beneath an overhanging sandstone there was no dipper and rose with a new daring dropped on her knees and dipped some of the cool sweet water in her palm  do you thirst sir guy  he kneeled beside her with a comical groan and drank from her hand  thanks a sweeter draught from fairer hand was never quaffed  rose was highly elated at the success of her trick she dipped another palm full he shook his head  with your permission ill use my hat brim  ill show you how to do it she said she rose and leaped the little stream and flung herself down full length on the ground and resting her palms on two flat stones she drank from the pool like an indian  there she cried triumphantly thats the way to drink all my life ive done this way at this springwhen there wasnt anyone to see  mason felt a wild charm in this most other women would have tumbled to pieces doing such a thing while she sprang up a little flushed but with no other sign of exertion  there was something primeval elemental in being thus led by a beautiful woman through coverts of ferns and hazel every shadow seemed to wash away some stain or scar of the citys strife he grew younger  i almost like this sort of thing he said  they came at last to the smooth slope of the peak where grass stood tall in bunches on a gravelly soil and wild flowers of unusual kinds grew as they mounted now the landscape broke over the tree tops and the valleys curved away into silent blue mist  on every side low wooded ridges lay with farms spread like rugs halfway up their deep green clearings on the further slope a pasture came nearly to the summit and the tinkle of a bell among the bushes sounded a pastoral note a field of timothy farther on to the left glowed with a beautiful pinkpurple bloom  isnt it beautiful asked rose  mason dropped full length on the grass before replying  yes it is lovelyperfectly pastoral worthy a poem  ive written three right on this spot she said a little shyly  he seemed interested  have you havent one with you  no  always go armed now heres a golden opportunity gone to waste  she smiled shyly  i can repeat one though  can you better yet recite one  she sat down near him but not too near and began in a soft hesitant voice to repeat a poem which was full of feminine sadness and wistfulness as she went on mason turned his face toward her and her eyes fell and her voice faltered  thats glorious he said go on  the wind swept up the slope and through the leaning white bodies of the birches with a sadness like the poem the wild barley bowed and streamed in the wind like an old mans beard the poem struck deep into secret moods incommunicable in wordsand music came to carry the words the girls eyes were sweet and serious and the lovely lines of her lips shifted and wavered  mason suddenly reached out and took the girls right hand her voice died out and her eyes met his he drew her hand toward him and laid his lips upon it  youre a poet he said you have found your voice and ii love you because you are a poet and because you are a beautiful woman  the touch of his bearded lips upon her hand was the event of her life and the whole world reshaped itself his praise of her poem her victory over him as a critic was great but his final words drowned in fierce light the flame of her arts enthusiasm  once more a mans voice came to her filled with entreaty and command but in this case she had no reservations it was well it was inevitable and it was glorious to set her face toward wifehood and fame with such a man as companion friend and lover  a couple of weeks later mason came down from his room with a grim look on his face he stepped out on the porch and stood there feeling the change in the air the summer was over  rose came out and he put his arm about her  hark he commanded do you hear the wind in the treetops it brings me the roar of the city this morning i hear the grind of cars the roar of mills the throb of presses the city calls me and i must go my vacation is over i must say goodby tonight  its very beautiful up here now she said a little wistfully the sumac is beginning to turn and the hills are like jewels  oh yes it is beautiful he said smiling a little but down there life is infinite novelty ceaseless change as you love the country so i love the city it is a greater pleasure to me to meet men than trees and concerts are more than winds in the pines artist souls poets people who do and think are there and so i must go  when shall i go she asked  when you please he said i have no commands you are perfectly free to do as you like i need you always now  then i will go tonight she said firmly  he turned his eyes upon her in a look she never forgot  my dearest girl do you realize what you are doing do you realize that you are entering upon a problematical line of actionthat you are inviting pain and sorrow and care that you are leaving girlhood and leisure behindthat you are entering gates that never swing outward do you know thisonce more and finally do you realize all this  she stood before him stronger than he he felt it she knew him at last since that touch of his lips to her arm since that look in his eyesand she said i realize it all and i choose it
