trips neither of which was in the bear tooth forest during the years 1909 and 1910 its main claim on the readers interest will lie no doubt in the character of berea mcfarlane but i find myself reliving with keen pleasure the splendid drama of wind and cloud and swaying forest which made the expeditions memorable  the golden trail is an actuality for me the camp on the lake was mine the rain the snow i met the prying camprobbers the grouse the muskrats the beaver were my companions but berrie was with me only in imagination she is a fiction born of a momentary powerful handclasp of a western ranchers daughter the story of wayland norcross is fiction also but the mcfarlane ranch the mill and the lonely rangerstations are closely drawn pictures of realities although the stage of my comedy is colorado i have not held to any one locality the scene is composite  it was my intention originally to write a much longer and more important book concerning supervisor mcfarlane but berrie took the story into her own strong hands and made of it something so intimate and so idyllic that i could not bring the more prosaic element into it it remained personal and youthful in spite of my plans a divergence for which perhaps most of my readers will be grateful  as for its title i had little to do with its selection my daughter mary isabel aged ten selected it from among a halfdozen others and for luck i let it stand although it sounds somewhat like that of a paperbound german romance for the subtitle my publishers are responsible  finally i warn the reader that this is merely the very slender story of a young western girl who being desired of three strong men bestows her love on a tourist whose weakness is at once her allurement and her care the administration problem the sociologic theme which was to have made the novel worth while got lost in some way on the low trail and never caught up with the lovers im sorrybut so it was  chicago january 1914    the foresters daughter       the foresters daughter  i  the happy girl   the stage line which ran from williams to bear tooth one of the most authentic then to be found in all the west possessed at least one genuine concord coach so faded so saddened so cracked and so splintered that its passengers entered it under protest and alighted from it with thanksgiving and yet it must have been built by honorable men for in 190 it still made the run of one hundred and twenty miles twice each week without loss of wheel or even so much as moulting a scrap of paint  and yet whatever it may have been in its youth it was in its age no longer a gay dash of color in the landscape on the contrary it fitted into the dustbrown and sagegreen plain as defensively as a beetle in a dusty path nevertheless it was an indispensable part of a very moving picture as it crept creaking and groaning or it may be it was the suffering passenger creaking and groaning along the hillside  after leaving the grande river the road winds up a pretty high divide before plunging down into ute park as they call all that region lying between the continental range on the east and the bear tooth plateau on the west it was a big spread of land and very far from an eastern mans conception of a park from dome peak it seems a plain but in fact when clouds shut off the high summits to the west this valley becomes a veritable mountain land a tumbled lonely country over which an occasional horseman crawls a minute but persistent insect it is to be exact a succession of ridges and ravines sculptured in some faroff postglacial time by floods of water covered now rather sparsely with pinons cedars and aspens a dry forbidding but majestic landscape  in late august the hills become iridescent opaline with the translucent yellow of the aspen the coral and crimson of the fireweed the bloodred of huckleberry beds and the royal purple of the asters while flowing round all as solvent and neutral setting lies the graygreen of the everpresent and everenduring sagebrush on the loftier heights these colors are arranged in most intricate and cunning patterns with nothing hard nothing flaring in the prospect all is harmonious and restful it is moreover silent silent as a dream world and so flooded with light that the senses ache with the stress of it  through this gorgeous land of mist of stillness and of death a few years ago a pale young man seated beside the driver rode one summer day in a voiceless rapture which made bill mccoy weary  if youd had as much of this as i have youd talk of something else he growled after a half dozen attempts at conversation bill wasnt much to look at but he was a good driver and the stranger respected him for it  eventually this simpleminded horseman became curious about the slim young fellow sitting beside him  what you doing out here anyhowfishing or just rebuilding a lung  rebuilding two lungs answered the tourist  well this climate will just about put lungs into a coffeecan retorted bill with official loyalty to his country  to his discerning eye the tourist now became a lunger where do you live when youre to home  connecticut  i knew it  how did you know it the youth seemed really interested to know  i drove another fellow up here last fall that dealt out the same kind of brogue you do  this amused the tourist you think i have a brogue do you  i dont think iti know it bill replied shortly  he was prevented at the moment from pursuing this line of inquiry by the discovery of a couple of horsemen racing from a distant ranch toward the road it was plain even to the stranger that they intended to intercept the stage and bill plied the lash with sudden vigor  ill give em a chase said he grimly  the other appeared a little alarmed what are theybandits  bandits sneered bill your eyesight is piercing thems girls  the traveler apologized my eyes arent very good he said hurriedly  he was however quite justified in his mistake for both riders wore widerimmed sombreros and rode astride at a furious pace bandanas fluttering skirts streaming and one was calling in shrill command oh bill  as they neared the gate the driver drew up with a word of surprise why howdy girls howdy he said with an assumption of innocence were you wishin fer to speak to me  oh shut up commanded one of the girls a roundfaced freckled romp you know perfectly well that berrie is going home todaywe told you all about it yesterday  sure thing exclaimed bill id forgot all about it  like nothin exclaimed the maid youve been countin the hours till you got herei know you  meanwhile her companion had slipped from her horse well goodby molly wish i could stay longer  goodby run down again  i will you come up  the young passenger sprang to the ground and politely said may i help you in  bill stared the girl smiled and her companion called be careful berrie dont hurt yourself the wagon might pitch  the youth perceiving that he had made another mistake stammered an apology  the girl perceived his embarrassment and sweetly accepted his hand i am much obliged all the same  bill shook with malicious laughter out in this country girls are warranted to jump clean over a measly little hack like this he explained  the girl took a seat in the back corner of the dusty vehicle and bill opened conversation with her by asking what kind of a time she had been having in the east  fine said she  did ye get as far back as my old town  what town is that bill  oh come off you know im from omaha  no i only got as far as south bend  the picture which the girl had made as she dashed up to the pasture gate her hatrim blown away from her brown face and sparkling eyes united with the kindliness in her voice as she accepted his gallant aid entered a deep impression on the tourists mind but he did not turn his head to look at herperhaps he feared bills elbow quite as much as his guffawbut he listened closely and by listening learned that she had been east for several weeks and also that she was known and favorably known all along the line for whenever they met a team or passed a ranch some one called out hello berrie in cordial salute and the men old and young were especially pleased to see her  illustration the girl behind him was a wondrous part of this wild and unaccountable country  meanwhile the stage rose and fell over the gigantic swells like a tiny boat on a monster sea while the sun blazed ever more fervently from the splendid sky and the hills glowed with everincreasing tumult of color through this land of color of repose of romance the young traveler rode drinking deep of the germless air feeling that the girl behind him was a wondrous part of this wild and unaccountable country  he had no chance to study her face again till the coach rolled down the hill to yancys where they were to take dinner and change horses  yancys ranchhouse stood on the bank of a fine stream which purledin keen defiance of the hot sunover a gravel bed so near to the mountain snows that their coolness still lingered in the ripples the house a long low log hut was fenced with antlers of the elk adorned with morningglory vines and shaded by lofty cottonwoodtrees and its green grassplatafter the sunsmit hills of the long mornings ridewas very grateful to the eastern mans eyes  with intent to show bill that he did not greatly fear his smiles the youth sprang down and offered a hand to assist his charming fellowpassenger to alight and she with kindly understanding again accepted his aidto bills chagrinand they walked up the path side by side  this is all very new and wonderful to me the young man said in explanation but i suppose its quite commonplace to youand bill  oh noits home  you were born here  no i was born in the east but ive lived here ever since i was three years old  by east you mean kansas  no missouri she laughed back at him  she was taller than most women and gave out an air of fine unconscious health which made her good to see although her face was too broad to be pretty she smiled easily and her teeth were white and even her hand he noticed was as strong as steel and brown as leather her neck rose from her shoulders like that of an acrobat and she walked with the sense of security which comes from selfreliant strength  she was met at the door by old lady yancy who pumped her hand up and down exclaiming my stars im glad to see ye back pears like the country is just naturally goin to the dogs without you the dance last saturday was a frost so i hear no snap to the fiddlin no gimp to the jiggin it shorely was pitiful  yancy himself tall grizzled succinct shook her hand in his turn mas right girl the country needs ye im scared every time ye go away fer fear some feller will snap ye up  she laughed no danger well how are ye all anyway she asked  all well ceptin me said the little old woman im just about able to pick at my vittles  she does her share o the work and half the cooks besides volunteered yancy  i know her retorted berrie as she laid off her hat its me for a dip gee but its dusty on the road  the young touristhe signed w w norcross in yancys registerwatched her closely and listened to every word she spoke with an intensity of interest which led mrs yancy to say privately  pears like that young lunger aint goin to forgit you if he can help it  what makes you think hes a lunger  dont haf to think one look at him is enough  thereafter a softer lightthe light of pityshone in the eyes of the girl poor fellow he does look kind o peaked but this climate will bring him up to the scratch she added with optimistic faith in her beloved hills  a moment later the downcoming stage pulled in loaded to the sidelines and everybody on it seemed to know berea mcfarlane it was hello here and hello there and how are ye between with smacks from the women and open cries of pass it around on the part of the men till norcross marveled at the display  she seems a great favorite he observed to yancy  whoberrie shes the whole works up at bear tooth good thing she dont want to go to congressshed lay jim worthy on the shelf  bereas popularity was not so remarkable as her manner of receiving it she took it all as a sort of jokea good kindly joke she shook hands with her male admirers and smacked the cheeks of her female friends with an air of modest deprecation oh you dont mean it was one of her phrases she enjoyed this display of affection but it seemed not to touch her deeply and her impartial humorous acceptance of the courtship of the men was equally charming though this was due according to remark to the claims of some rancher up the line  she continued to be the theme of conversation at the dinnertable and yet remained unembarrassed and gave back quite as good as she received  if i was cliff declared one lanky admirer id be shot if i let you out of my sight it aint safe  she smiled broadly i dont feel scared  oh youre all right its the other fellerlike methat gets hurt  dont worry youre old enough and tough enough to turn a steeljacketed bullet  this raised a laugh and mrs yancy who was waiting on the table put in a word ill board ye free berrie if youll jest naturally turn up here regular at mealtime you do take the fellers appetites its the only time i make a cent  to the eastern man this was all very unrestrained and deeply diverting the people seemed to know all about one another notwithstanding the fact that they came from ranches scattered up and down the stage line twenty thirty miles apartto be neighbors in this country means to be anywhere within a sixtymile rideand they gossiped of the countryside as minutely as the residents of a village in wisconsin discuss their kind news was scarce  the northbound coach got away first and as the girl came out to take her place norcross said wont you have my seat with the driver  she dropped her voice humorously no thank you i cant stand for bills clack  norcross understood she didnt relish the notion of being so close to the frankly amorous driver who neglected no opportunity to be personal therefore he helped her to her seat inside and resumed his place in front  bill now broadly communicative minutely detailed his tastes in food horses liquors and saddles in a long monologue which would have been tiresome to any one but an imaginative young eastern student bill had a vast knowledge of the west but a distressing habit of repetition he was selfconscious too for the reason that he was really talking for the benefit of the girl sitting in critical silence behind him who though he frequently turned to her for confirmation of some of the more startling of his statements refused to be drawn into controversy  in this informing way some ten miles were traversed the road climbing ever higher and the mountains to right and left increasing in grandeur each hour till of a sudden and in a deep valley on the bank of another swift stream they came upon a squalid saloon and a minute postoffice this was the town of moskow  bill lumbering down over the wheel took a bag of mail from the boot and dragged it into the cabin the girl rose stretched herself and said this stagin is slow business im cramped im going to walk on ahead  may i go with you asked norcross  sure thing come along  as they crossed the little pole bridge which spanned the flood the tourist exclaimed what exquisite water its like melted opals  comes right down from the snow she answered impressed by the poetry of his simile  he would gladly have lingered listening to the song of the water but as she passed on he followed the opposite hill was sharp and the road stony but as they reached the top the young easterner called out see the savins  before them stood a grove of cedars old gray and drear as weirdly impressive as the cacti in a mexican desert torn by winds scarred by lightnings deeply rooted tenacious as tradition unlovely as egyptian mummies fantastic dwarfed and blackened these unaccountable creatures clung to the ledges the dead mingled horribly with the living and when the wind arosethe wind that was robustly cheerful on the high hillsthese hags cried out with low moans of infinite despair it was as if they pleaded for water or for deliverance from a life that was a kind of death  the pale young man shuddered what a ghostly place he exclaimed in a low voice it seems the burialplace of a vanished race  something in his face some note in his voice profoundly moved the girl for the first time her face showed something other than childish good nature and a sense of humor i dont like these trees myself she answered they look too much like poor old squaws  for a few moments the man and the maid studied the forest of immemorial gaunt and withered treesbright impermanent youth confronting timedefaced and windtorn age then the girl spoke lets get out of here i shall cry if we dont  in a few moments the dolorous voices were left behind and the cheerful light of the plain reasserted itself norcross looking back down upon the cedars which at a distance resembled a tufted bronzegreen carpet musingly asked what do you suppose planted those trees there  the girl was deeply impressed by the novelty of this query i never thought to ask i reckon they just grew  no theres a reason for all these plantings he insisted  we dont worry ourselves much about such things out here she replied with charming humor we dont even worry about the weather we just take things as they come  they walked on talking with new intimacy where is your home he asked  a few miles out of bear tooth youre from the east bill saysthe far east we call it  from new haven ive just finished at yale have you ever been to new york  oh good lord no she answered as though he had named the ends of the earth my mother came from the southshe was born in kentuckythat accounts for my name and my father is a missourian lets see yale is in the state of connecticut isnt it  connecticut is no longer a state it is only a suburb of new york city  is that so my geography calls it the nutmeg state  your geography is behind the times new york has absorbed all of connecticut and part of jersey  well its all the same to us out here your whole country looks like the small end of a slice of pie to us  have you ever been in a city  oh yes i go to denver once in a while and i saw st louis once but i was only a yearling and dont remember much about it what are you doing out here if its a fair question  he looked away at the mountains i got rather used up last spring and my doctor said id better come out here for a while and build up im going up to meekers mill do you know where that is  i know every stovepipe in this park she answered joe meeker is kind o related to meuncle by marriage he lives about fifteen miles over the hill from bear tooth  this fact seemed to bring them still closer together im glad of that he said pointedly perhaps i shall be permitted to see you now and again im going to be lonesome for a while im afraid  dont you believe it joe meekers boys will keep you interested she assured him  the stage overtook them at this point and bill surlily remarked if youd been alone young feller id a give you a chase his resentment of the outsiders growing favor with the girl was ludicrously evident  as they rose into the higher levels the aspen shook its yellowish leaves in the breeze and the purple foothills gained in majesty great new peaks came into view on the right and the lofty cliffs of the bear tooth range loomed in naked grandeur high above the bluegreen of the pines which clothed their sloping eastern sides  at intervals the road passed small log ranches crouching low on the banks of creeks but aside from theseand the sparse animal life around themno sign of settlement could be seen the valley lay as it had lain for thousands of years repeating its forests as the meadows of the lower levels send forth their annual grasses norcross said to himself i have circled the track of progress and have reentered the border america where the stagecoach is still the one stirring thing beneath the sun  at last the driver with a note of exultation called out grab a root everybody its all the way downhill and time to feed  and so as the dusk came over the mighty spread of the hills to the east and the peaks to the west darkened from violet to purpleblack the stage rumbled and rattled and rushed down the winding road through thickening signs of civilization and just at nightfall rolled into the little town of bear tooth which is the eastern gateway of the ute plateau  norcross had given a great deal of thought to the young girl behind him and thought had deepened her charm her frankness her humor her superb physical strength and her calm selfreliance appealed to him and the more dangerously because he was so well aware of his own weakness and loneliness and as the stage drew up before the hotel he fervently said i hope i shall see you again  before she could reply a mans voice called hello there and a tall fellow stepped up to her with confident mien  norcross awkwardly shrank away this was her cowboy lover of course it was impossible that so attractive a girl should be unattached and the knowledge produced in him a faint but very definite pang of envy and regret  the happy girl even in the excitement of meeting her lover did not forget the stranger she gave him her hand in parting and again he thrilled to its amazing power it was small but it was like a steel clamp stop in on your way to meekers she said as a kindly man would have done you pass our gate my father is joseph mcfarlane the forest supervisor good night  good night he returned with sincere liking  who is that norcross heard her companion ask  she replied in a low voice but he overheard her answer a poor lunger bound for meekersand kingdom come im afraid he seems a nice young feller too  they always wait till the last minute remarked the rancher with indifferent tone     ii  a ride in the rain   there are two colorados within the boundaries of the state of that name distinct almost irreconcilable one is a plain smooth dry monotonous gently declining to the east a land of sagebrush wheatfields and alfalfa meadowsa rather commonplace region now given over to humdrum folk intent on digging a living from the soil but the other is an army of peaks a region of storms a spread of dark and tangled forests in the one shallow rivers trickle on their sandy way to the gulf of mexico from the other the waters rush uniting to make the mighty stream whose siltladen floods are slowly filling the gulf of california  if you stand on one of the great naked crests which form the dividing wall the rampart of the plains you can see the colorado of tradition to the west still rolling in wave after wave of stupendous altitudes each range cutting into the sky with a purple sawtooth edge the landscape seems to contain nothing but rocks and towering crags a treasurehouse for those who mine but this is illusive between these purple heights charming valleys wind and meadows lie in which rich grasses grow and cattle feed  on certain slopeswhere the devastating miners have not yet played their relentless gamedark forests rise to the high bold summits of the chiefest mountains and it is to guard these timbered tracts growing each year more valuable that the government has established its forest service to protect and develop the wealthproducing power of the watersheds  chief among the wooded areas of this mighty inland empire of crag and stream is the bear tooth forest containing nearly eight hundred thousand acres of rock and trees whose seat of administration is bear tooth springs the small town in which our young traveler found himself  he carefully explained to the landlord of the cottage hotel that he had never been in this valley before and that he was filled with astonishment and delight of the scenery  scenery yes too much scenery what we want is settlers retorted the landlord who was shabby and sour and rather contemptuous for the reason that he considered norcross a poor consumptive and a fool to bootone of those chaps who wait till they are nearly dead then come out here expecting to live on climate  the hotel was hardly larger than the log shanty of a railwaygrading camp but the meat was edible and just outside the door roared bear creek which came down directly from dome mountain and the young easterner went to sleep beneath its singing that night he should have dreamed of the happy mountain girl but he did not on the contrary he imagined himself back at college in the midst of innumerable freshmen yelling bill mccoy bill mccoy  he woke a little bewildered by his strange surroundings and when he became aware of the cheap bed the flimsy washstand the ugly wallpaper and thought how far he was from home and friends he not only sighed he shivered the room was chill the pitcher of water cold almost to the freezingpoint and his joints were stiff and painful from his ride what folly to come so far into the wilderness at this time  as he crawled from his bed and looked from the window he was still further disheartened in the foreground stood a half dozen frame buildings graceless and cheap without tree or shrub to give shadow or charm of lineall was bare bleak sere but under his window the stream was singing its glorious mountain song and away to the west rose the aspiring peaks from which it came romance brooded in that shadow and on the lower foothills the frosttouched foliage glowed like a mosaic of jewels  dressing hurriedly he went down to the small barroom whose litter of dufflebags guns saddles and camp utensils gave evidence of the presence of many hunters and fishermen the slovenly landlord was poring over a newspaper while a discouraged halfgrown youth was sludging the floor with a mop but a cheerful clamor from an open door at the back of the hall told that breakfast was on  venturing over the threshold norcross found himself seated at table with some five or six men in corduroy jackets and laced boots who were in fact merchants and professional men from denver and pueblo out for fish and such game as the law allowed and all in holiday mood they joked the waitergirls and joshed one another in noisy goodfellowship ignoring the slim youth in english ridingsuit who came in with an air of mingled melancholy and timidity and took a seat at the lower corner of the long table  the landlady tall thin worried and inquisitive was new englandnorcross recognized her type even before she came to him with a question on her lips so youre from the east are you  ive been at school there  well im glad to see you my folks came from york state i dont often get any one from the real east come out to fish i spose  yes he replied thinking this the easiest way out  well theys plenty of fishingand theys plenty of air not much of anything else  as he looked about the room the tourists eye was attracted by four young fellows seated at a small table to his right they wore rough shirts of an olivegreen shade and their faces were windscorched but their voices held a pleasant tone and something in the manner of the landlady toward them made them noticeable norcross asked her who they were  theyre forestry boys  forestry boys  yes the supervisors office is here and these are his help  this information added to norcrosss interest and cheered him a little he knew something of the forest service and had been told that many of the rangers were college men he resolved to make their acquaintance if im to stay here they will help me endure the exile he said  after breakfast he went forth to find the postoffice expecting a letter of instructions from meeker he found nothing of the sort and this quite disconcerted him  the stage is gone the postmistress told him and you cant get up till day after tomorrow you might reach meeker by using the government phone however  where will i find the government phone  down in the supervisors office theyre very accommodating theyll let you use it if you tell them who you want to reach  it was impossible to miss the forestry building for the reason that a handsome flag fluttered above it the door being open norcross perceived from the threshold a young clerk at work on a typewriter while in a corner close by the window another and older man was working intently on a map  is this the office of the forest supervisor asked the youth  the man at the machine looked up and pleasantly answered it is but the supervisor is not in yet is there anything i can do for you  it may be you can i am on my way to meekers mill for a little outing perhaps you could tell me where meekers mill is and how i can best get there  the man at the map meditated its not far some eighteen or twenty miles but its over a pretty rough trail  what kind of a place is it  very charming youll like it real mountain country  this officer was a plainfeatured man of about thirtyfive with keen and clear eyes his voice though strongly nasal possessed a note of manly sincerity as he studied his visitor he smiled  you look brandnewhavent had time to seasoncheck have you  no im a stranger in a strange land  out for your health  yes my name is norcross im just getting over a severe illness and im up here to lay around and fish and recuperateif i can  you canyou will you cant help it the other assured him join one of our surveying crews for a week and ill mellow that suit of yours and make a real mountaineer of you i see you wear a sigma chi pin what was your school  i am a son of eli last years class  the other man displayed his fob im ten classes ahead of you my name is nash im what they call an expert im up here doing some estimating and surveying for a big ditch theyre putting in i was rather in hopes you had come to join our ranks we sons of eli are holding the conservation fort these days and we need help  my knowledge of your work is rather vague admitted norcross my father is in the lumber business but his point of view isnt exactly yours  he slays em does he  he did he helped devastate michigan  after me the deluge i know the kind why not make yourself a sort of vicarious atonement  norcross smiled i had not thought of that it would help some wouldnt it  it certainly would theres no great money in the work but its about the most enlightened of all the governmental bureaus  norcross was strongly drawn to this forester whose tone was that of a highly trained specialist i rode up on the stage yesterday with miss berrie mcfarlane  the supervisors daughter  she seemed a fine western type  shes not a type shes an individual she hasnt her like anywhere ive gone she cuts a wide swath up here being an only child shes both son and daughter to mcfarlane she knows more about forestry than her father in fact half the time he depends on her judgment  norcross was interested but did not want to take up valuable time he said will you let me use your telephone to meekers  very sorry but our line is out of order youll have to wait a day or soor use the mails youre too late for todays stage but its only a short ride across come outside and ill show you  norcross followed him to the walk and stood in silence while his guide indicated the pass over the range it all looked very formidable to the eastern youth thunderous clouds hung low upon the peaks and the great crags to left and right of the notch were stern and barren i think ill wait for the stage he said with candid weakness i couldnt make that trip alone  youll have to take many such a ride over that range in the nightif you join the service nash warningly replied  as they were standing there a girl came galloping up to the hitchingpost and slid from her horse it was berea mcfarlane good morning emery she called to the surveyor good morning she nodded at norcross how do you find yourself this morning  homesick he replied smilingly  why so  im disappointed in the town  whats the matter with the town  its so commonplace i expected it to bewell different its just like any other plains town  berrie looked round at the forlorn shops the irregular sidewalks the grassless yards it isnt very pretty thats a fact but you can always forget it by just looking up at the high country when you going up to the mill  i dont know i havent had any word from meeker and i cant reach him by telephone  i know the line is shortcircuited somewhere but theyve sent a man out he may close it any minute  wheres the supervisor asked nash  hes gone over to moores cutting how are you getting on with those plats  very well ill have em all in shape by saturday  come in and make yourself at home said the girl to norcross youll find the papers two or three days old she smiled we never know about anything here till other people have forgotten it  norcross followed her into the office curious to know more about her she was so changed from his previous conception of her that he was puzzled she had the directness and the brevity of phrase of a business man as she opened letters and discussed their contents with the men  truly she is different thought norcross and yet she lost something by reason of the display of her proficiency as a clerk i wish she would leave business to some one else he inwardly grumbled as he rose to go  she looked up from her desk come in again later we may be able to reach the mill  he thanked her and went back to his hotel where he overhauled his outfit and wrote some letters his disgust of the town was lessened by the presence of that handsome girl and the hope that he might see her at luncheon made him impatient of the clock  she did not appear in the diningroom and when norcross inquired of nash whether she took her meals at the hotel or not the expert replied no she goes home the ranch is only a few miles down the valley occasionally we invite her but she dont think much of the cooking  one of the young surveyors put in a word i shouldnt think she would id ride ten miles any time to eat one of mrs mcfarlanes dinners  yes agreed nash with a reflective look in his eyes shes a mighty fine girl and i join the boys in wishing her better luck than marrying cliff belden  is it settled that way asked norcross  yes the supervisor warned us all but even he never has any good words for belden hes a surly cuss and violently opposed to the service his brother is one of the proprietors of the meeker mill and they have all tried to bulldoze landon our ranger over there by the way youll like landon hes a harvard man and a good ranger his shack is only a halfmile from meekers house its a pretty wellknown fact that alec belden is part proprietor of a saloon over there that worries the supervisor worse than anything cliff swears hes not connected with it but hes more or less sympathetic with the crowd  norcross already deeply interested in the present and future of a girl whom he had met for the first time only the day before was quite ready to give up his trip to meeker after the men went back to work he wandered about the town for an hour or two and then dropped in at the office to inquire if the telephone line had been repaired  no its still dead  did miss mcfarlane return  no she said she had work to do at home this is ironingday i believe  she plays all the parts dont she  she sure does and she plays one part as well as another she can rope and tie a steer or bake a cake as well as play the piano  dont tell me she plays the piano  nash laughed she does but its one of those you operate with your feet  im relieved to hear that she seems almost weirdly gifted as it is after a moment he broke in with what can a man do in this town  work nothing else  what do you do for amusement  once in a while there is a dance in the hall over the drugstore and on sunday you can listen to a wretched sermon in the log church the rest of the time you work or loaf in the saloonsor read old nature has done her part here but man ever been in the tyrol  yes  well some day the people of the plains will have sense enough to use these mountains these streams the way they do over there  it required only a few hours for norcross to size up the valley and its people aside from nash and his associates and one or two families connected with the mill to the north the villagers were poor thriftless and uninteresting they were lacking in the picturesque quality of ranchers and miners and had not yet the grace of towndwellers they were indeed depressingly nondescript  early on the second morning he went to the postofficewhich was also the telephone stationto get a letter or message from meeker he found neither but as he was standing in the door undecided about taking the stage berea came into town riding a fine bay pony and leading a blazeface buckskin behind her  her face shone cordially as she called out well how do you stack up this morning  tiptop he answered in an attempt to match her cheery greeting  do you like our town better  not a bit but the hills are magnificent  anybody turned up from the mill  no i havent heard a word from there the telephone is still out of commission  they cant locate the break uncle joe sent word by the stagedriver asking us to keep an eye out for you and send you over ive come to take you over myself  thats mighty good of you but its a good deal to ask  i want to see uncle joe on business anyhow and youll like the ride better than the journey by stage  leaving the horses standing with their bridlereins hanging on the ground she led the way to the office  when father comes in tell him where ive gone and send mr norcrosss packs by the first wagon is your outfit ready she asked  not quite i can get it ready soon  he hurried away in pleasant excitement and in twenty minutes was at the door ready to ride  youd better take my bay said berea old paintface there is a little notional  norcross approached his mount with a caution which indicated that he had at least been instructed in rangehorse psychology and as he gathered his reins together to mount berrie remarked  i hope youre saddlewise  i had a few lessons in a ridingschool he replied modestly  young downing approached the girl with a lowvoiced protest you oughtnt to ride old paint he nearly pitched the supervisor the other day  im not worried she said and swung to her saddle  the ugly beast made off in a tearing sidewise rush but she smilingly called back all set and norcross followed her in high admiration  eventually she brought her bronco to subjection and they trotted off together along the wagonroad quite comfortably by this time the youth had forgotten his depression his homesickness of the morning the valley was again enchanted ground its vistas led to lofty heights the air was regenerative and though a part of this elation was due no doubt to the power of his singularly attractive guide he laid it discreetly to the climate  after shacking along between some rather sorry fields of grain for a mile or two berea swung into a sidetrail i want you to meet my mother she said  the grassy road led to a long onestory halflog halfslab house which stood on the bank of a small swift willowbordered stream  this is our ranch she explained all the meadow in sight belongs to us  the young easterner looked about in astonishment not a tree bigger than his thumb gave shade the gate of the cattle corral stood but a few feet from the kitchen door and rusty beefbones bleaching skulls and scraps of sundried hides littered the ground or hung upon the fence exteriorly the low cabin made a drab depressing picture but as he alightedupon bereas invitationand entered the house he was met by a sweetfaced brownhaired little woman in a neat gown whose bearing was not in the least awkward or embarrassed  this is mr norcross the tourist i told you about explained berrie  mrs mcfarlane extended her small hand with friendly impulse im very glad to meet you sir are you going to spend some time at the mill  i dont know i have a letter to mr meeker from a friend of mine who hunted with him last yeara mr sutler  mr sutler oh we know him very well wont you sit down  the interior of the house was not only well kept but presented many evidences of refinement a mechanical piano stood against the log wall and books and magazines dogeared with use littered the table and norcross feeling the force of nashs halfexpressed criticism of his superior listened intently to mrs mcfarlanes apologies for the condition of the farmyard  well said berea sharply if were to reach uncle joes for dinner wed better be scratching the hills and to her mother she added ill pull in about dark  the mother offered no objection to her daughters plan and the young people rode off together directly toward the high peaks to the east  im going by way of the cutoff berrie explained and norcross content and unafraid nodded in acquiescence here is the line she called a few minutes later pointing at a sign nailed to a tree at the foot of the first wooded hill  the notice printed in black ink on a white square of cloth proclaimed this to be the boundary of the bear tooth national forest and pleaded with all men to be watchful of fires its tone was not at all that of a strong government it was deprecatory  the trail hardly more than a wood road grew wilder and lonelier as they climbed cattle fed on the hillsides in scattered bands like elk here and there a small cabin stood on the bank of a stream but for the most part the trail mounted the high slopes in perfect solitude  the girl talked easily and leisurely reading the brands of the ranchers revealing the number of cattle they owned quite as a young farmer would have done she seemed not to be embarrassed in the slightest degree by the fact that she was guiding a strange man over a lonely road and gave no outward sign of special interest in him till she suddenly turned to ask what kind of a slickeri mean a raincoatdid you bring  he looked blank i dont believe i brought any ive a leather shootingjacket however  she shrugged her shoulders and looked up at the sky were in for a storm youd ought o have a slicker no fancy raincoat but a real oldfashioned cowpunchers oilskin they make a business of shedding rain leathers no good neither is canvas ive tried em all  she rode on for a few minutes in silence as if disgusted with his folly but she was really worrying about him poor chap she said to herself he cant stand a chill i ought to have thought of his slicker myself hes helpless as a baby  they were climbing fast now winding upward along the bank of a stream and the sky had grown suddenly gray and the woodland path was dark and chill the mountains were not less beautiful but they were decidedly less amiable and the youth shivered casting an apprehensive eye at the thickening clouds  berea perceived something of his dismay and drawing rein dismounted behind her saddle was a tightly rolled bundle which being untied and shaken out proved to be a horsemans rainproof oilskin coat put this on she commanded  oh no he protested i cant take your coat  yes you can you must dont you worry about me im used to weather put this on over your jacket and all youll need it rain wont hurt me but it will just about finish you  the worst of this lay in its truth and norcross lost all his pride of sex for the moment a wetting would not dim this girls splendid color nor reduce her vitality one degree while to him it might be a deathwarrant you could throw me over my own horse he admitted in a kind of bitter admiration and slipped the coat on shivering with cold as he did so  you think me a poor excuse of a trailer dont you he said ruefully as the thunder began to roll  youve got to be all made over new she replied tolerantly stay here a year and youll be able to stand anything  remounting she again led the way with cheery cry the rain came dashing down in fitful misty streams but she merely pulled the rim of her sombrero closer over her eyes and rode steadily on while he followed plunged in gloom as cold and gray as the storm the splitting crashes of thunder echoed from the high peaks like the voices of siegeguns and the lightning stabbed here and there as though blindly seeking some hidden foe long veils of falling water twisted and trailed through the valleys with swishing roar  these mountain showers dont last long the girl called back her face shining like a rose well get the sun in a few minutes  and so it turned out in less than an hour they rode into the warm light again and in spite of himself norcross returned her smile though he said i feel like a selfish fool you are soaked  hardly wet through she reassured him my jacket and skirt turn water pretty well ill be dry in a jiffy it does a body good to be wet once in a while  the shame of his action remained but a closer friendship was established and as he took off the coat and handed it back to her he again apologized i feel like a pig i dont see how i came to do it the thunder and the chill scared me thats the truth of it you hypnotized me into taking it how wet you are he exclaimed remorsefully youll surely take cold  i never take cold she returned im used to all kinds of weather dont you bother about me  topping a low divide the youth caught a glimpse of the range to the southeast which took his breath isnt that superb he exclaimed its like the shining roof of the world  yes thats the continental divide she confirmed casually but the lyrical note which he struck again reached her heart the men she knew had so few words for the beautiful in life she wondered whether this mans illness had given him this refinement or whether it was native to his kind im glad he took my coat was her thought  she pushed on down the slope riding hard but it was nearly two oclock when they drew up at meekers house which was a long low stone structure built along the north side of the road the place was distinguished not merely by its masonry but also by its picket fence which had once been whitewashed farmwagons of various degrees of decay stood by the gate and in the barnyard plows and harrowsdeeply buried by the weedswere rusting forlornly away a little farther up the stream the tall pipe of a sawmill rose above the firs  a pack of dogs of all sizes and signs came clamoring to the fence followed by a big slovenly dressed redbearded man of sixty or thereabouts  hello uncle joe called the girl in offhand boyish fashion how are you today  howdy girl answered meeker gravely what brings you up here this time  she laughed heres a boarder who wants to learn how to raise cattle  meekers face lightened i reckon youre mr norcross im glad to see ye light off and make yourself to home turn your horses into the corral the boys will feed em  am i in america norcross asked himself as he followed the slouchy old rancher into the unkempt yard this certainly is a long way from new haven  without ceremony meeker led his guests directly into the diningroom a long and rather narrow room wherein a woman and six or seven roughly dressed young men were sitting at a rudely appointed table  earth and seas exclaimed mrs meeker heres berrie and ill bet thats sutlers friend our boarder  thats what mother admitted her husband berrie brought him up  youd ought o gone for him yourself you big lump she retorted  mrs meeker who was as big as her husband greeted norcross warmly and made a place for him beside her own chair  highst along there boys and give the company a chance she commanded sharply our dinners turrible late today  the boysthey were in reality fullgrown cubs of eighteen or twentydid as they were bid with much noise chaffing berrie with blunt humor the table was covered with a red oilcloth and set with heavy blueandwhite china the forks were twotined steelpronged and not very polished and the food was of the simplest sort but the girl seemed at home thereas she did everywhereand was soon deep in a discussion of the price of beef and whether it was advisable to ship now or wait a month  meeker read sutlers letter which norcross had handed him and after deliberation remarked all right well do the best we can for you mr norcross but we havent any fancy accommodations  he dont expect any replied berrie what he needs is a little roughing it  theres plinty of that to be had said one of the herders who sat below the salt is the soft life im nadin  pats strong on soft jobs said another and berea joined the laugh which followed this pointless joke she appeared to be one of them and it troubled norcross a little she had so little the sex feeling and demanded so few of the rights and privileges of a girl the men all admired her that was evident almost too evident and one or two of the older men felt the charm of her young womanhood too deeply even to meet her eyes but of this norcross was happily ignorant already in these two days he had acquired a distinct sense of proprietorship in her a feeling which made him jealous of her good name  meeker it turned out was an englishman by way of canada and this was his second american wife his first had been a sister to mrs mcfarlane he was a man of much readingof the periodical sortand the big sittingroom was littered with magazines both english and american and his talk abounded in radical and rather foolish utterances norcross considered it the most disorderly home he had ever seen and yet it was not without a certain dignity the rooms were large and amply provided with furniture of a very mixed and gaudy sort and the table was spread with abundance  one of the lads frank meeker a dark intense youth of about twenty was bereas full cousin the others were merely hired hands but they all eyed the newcomer with disfavor the fact that berrie had brought him and that she seemed interested in him added to the effect of the smart ridingsuit which he wore id like to roll him in the creek muttered one of them to his neighbor  this dislike berrie perceivedin some degreeand to frank she privately said now you fellows have got to treat mr norcross right hes been very sick  frank maliciously grinned oh well treat him right we wont do a thing to him  now frank she warned if you try any of your tricks on him youll hear from me  why all this worry on your part he asked keenly how long since you found him  we rode up on the stage day before yesterday and he seemed so kind o blue and lonesome i couldnt help trying to chirk him up  how will cliff take all this chirking business  cliff aint my guardianyet she laughingly responded mr norcross is a college man and not used to our ways  mister norcrosswhats his front name  wayland  he snorted wayland if he gets past us without being called pasty hes in luck hes a lunger if there ever was one  the girl was shrewd enough to see that the more she sought to soften the wind to her eastern tenderfoot the more surely he was to be shorn so she gave over her effort in that direction and turned to the old folks to mrs meeker she privately said mr norcross aint used to rough ways and hes not very rugged you ought o kind o favor him for a while  the girl herself did not understand the vital and almost painful interest which this young man had roused in her he was both child and poet to her and as she watched him trying to make friends with the men her indignation rose against their clownish offishness she understood fully that his neat speech his eastern accent together with his tailorcut clothing and the delicacy of his table manners would surely mark him for slaughter among the cowhands and the wish to shield him made her face graver than anybody had ever seen it  i dont feel right in leaving you here she said at last but i must be ridin and while meeker ordered her horse brought out she walked to the gate with norcross at her side  im tremendously obliged to you he said and his voice was vibrant you have been most kind how can i repay you  oh thats all right she replied in true western fashion i wanted to see the folks up here anyhow this is no jaunt at all for me and looking at her powerful figure and feeling the traplike grip of her cinch hand he knew she spoke the truth  frank had saddled his own horse and was planning to ride over the hill with her but to this she objected im going to leave pete here for mr norcross to ride she said and theres no need of your going  franks face soured and with instant perception of the effect her refusal might have on the fortunes of the stranger she reconsidered  oh come along i reckon you want to get shut of some mean job  and so she rode away leaving her ward to adjust himself to his new and strange surroundings as best he could and with her going the whole valley darkened for the convalescent     iii  wayland receives a warning   distance is no barrier to gossip it amazed young norcross to observe how minutely the ranchers of the valley followed one anothers most intimate domestic affairs not merely was each man in full possession of the color and number of every calf in his neighbors herd it seemed that nothing could happen in the most remote cabin and remain concealed any event which broke the monotony of their life loomed large and in all matters of courtship curiosity was something more than keen it was remorseless  living miles apart and riding the roads but seldom these lonely gossips tore to tatters every scrap of rumor no citizen came or went without being studied characterized accounted for and every woman was scrutinized as closely as a stray horse and if there was within her the slightest wayward impulse some lawless centaur came to know it to exult over it to make test of it her every word her minutest expression of a natural coquetry was enlarged upon as a sign of weakness of yielding every personable female was the focus of a natural desire intensified by lonely brooding on the part of the men  it was soon apparent to the eastern observer that the entire male population for thirty miles around not only knew mcfarlanes girl but that every unmarried manand some who were both husbands and fatherskept a deeply interested eye upon her daily motion and certain shameless ones openly boasted among their fellows of their intention to win her favor while the shy ones reveled in secret exultation over every chance meeting with her she was the topic of every lumbercamp and the shining lure of every dance to which the ranch hands often rode over long and lonely trails  part of this intense interest was due naturally to the scarcity of desirable women but a larger part was called out by bereas frank freedom of manner her ready camaraderie was taken for carelessness and the candid grip of her hand was often misunderstood and yet most of the men respected her and some feared her after her avowed choice of clifford belden they all kept aloof for he was hottempered and formidably swift to avenge an insult  at the end of a week norcross found himself restless and discontented with the meekers he was tired of fishing tired of the old mans endless arguments and tired of the obscene cowhands the men around the mill did not interest him and their saturday night spree at the saloon disgusted him the one person who piqued his curiosity was landon the ranger who was stationed not far away and who could be seen occasionally riding by on a handsome black horse there was something in his bearing in his neat and serviceable drab uniform which attracted the convalescent and on sunday morning he decided to venture a call although frank meeker had said the ranger was a grouch  his cabin a neat log structure stood just above the road on a huge natural terrace of grassy boulders and the flag which fluttered from a tall staff before it could be seen for several milesthe bright sign of federal control the symbol of law and order just as the saloon and the mill were signs of lawless vice and destructive greed around the door flowers bloomed and kittens played while at the door of the dive broken bottles swarms of flies and heaps of refuse menaced every corner and the mill immured itself in its own debris like a foul beast  it was strangely moving to come upon this flowerlike place and this garden in the wilderness a spring which crept from the high wall back of the station as these ranger headquarters are called gave its delicious water into several winding ditches trickled musically down the other side of the terrace in little lifegiving cascades and so finally reunited in a single current fell away into the creek it was plain that loving care and much of it had been given to this tiny system of irrigation  the cabins interior pleased wayland almost as much as the garden it was built of pine logs neatly matched and hewed on one side there were but two roomsone which served as sleepingchamber and office and one which was at once kitchen and diningroom in the larger room a quaint fireplace with a flat arch a bunk a table supporting a typewriter and several shelves full of books made up the furnishing on the walls hung a rifle a revolver in its belt a couple of uniforms and a yellow oilskin raincoat  the ranger spurred and belted with his cuffs turned back was pounding the typewriter when wayland appeared at the open door but he rose with grave courtesy come in he said and his voice had a pleasant inflection  im interrupting  nothing serious just a letter theres no hurry im always glad of an excuse to rest from this job he was at once keenly interested in his visitor for he perceived in him the gentleman and of course the alien  wayland with something of the feeling of a civilian reporting to an officer explained his presence in the neighborhood  ive heard of you responded the ranger and ive been hoping youd look in on me the supervisors daughter has just written me to look after you she said you were not very well  again wayland protested that he was not a consumptive only a student who needed mountain air but he added it is very kind of miss mcfarlane to think of me  oh she thinks of everybody the young fellow declared shes one of the most unselfish creatures in the world  something in the music of this speech and something in the look of the rangers eyes caused wayland to wonder if here were not still another of berries subjects he became certain of it as the young officer went on with pleasing frankness and it was not long before he had conveyed to wayland his cause for sadness shes engaged to a man that is not her equal in a certain sense no man is her equal but belden is a pretty hard type and i believe although i cant prove it that he is part owner of the saloon over there  how does that saloon happen to be here  its on patented landa socalled placer claimexperts have reported against it mcfarlane has protested against it but nothing is done the mill is also on deeded land and together they are a plague spot im their enemy and they know it and theyve threatened to burn me out of course they wont do that but theyre ready to play any kind of trick on me  i can well believe that for i am getting my share of practical jokes at meekers  theyre not a bad lot over thereonly just rowdy i suppose theyre initiating you said landon  i didnt come out here to be a cowboy responded norcross but frank meeker seems to be anxious to show me all the good old cowboy courtesies on monday he slipped a burr under my horses saddle and i came near to having my neck broken then he or some one else concealed a frog in my bed and fouled my hairbrushes in fact i go to sleep each night in expectation of some new attack but the air and the riding are doing me a great deal of good and so i stay  come and bunk with me urged landon ill be glad to have you i get terribly lonesome here sometimes although im supposed to have the best station in the forest bring your outfit and stay as long as you like  this offer touched norcross deeply thats very kind of you but i guess ill stick it out i hate to let those hoodlums drive me out  all right but come and see me often i get so blue some days i wonder whats the use of it all theres one fatal condition about this ranger businessits a solitary job it cuts out marriage for most of us many of the stations are fifteen or twenty miles from a postoffice then too the lines of promotion are few i guess ill have to get out although i like the work come in any time and take a snack with me  thereafter wayland spent nearly every day with the ranger either in his cabin or riding the trail and during these hours confidence grew until at last landon confessed that his unrest arose from his rejection by berrie  she was not to blame shes so kind and free with every one i thought i had a chance i was conceited enough to feel sorry for the other fellows and now i cant even feel sorry for myself im just dazed and hanging to the ropes she was mighty gentle about ityou know how sunny her face iswell she just got grave and kind o faintvoiced and saidoh you know what she said she let me know there was another man i didnt ask her who and when i found out i lost my grip entirely at first i thought id resign and get out of the country but i couldnt do iti cant yet the chance of seeing herof hearing from her once in a whileshe never writes except on business for her father butyoull laughi cant see her signature without a tremor he smiled but his eyes were desperately sad i ought to resign because i cant do my work as well as i ought to as i ride the trail im thinking of her i sit here half the night writing imaginary letters to her and when i see her and she takes my hand in hersyou know what a hand she hasmy mind goes blank oh im crazy i admit it i didnt know such a thing could happen to me but it has  i suppose its being alone so much wayland started to argue but the other would not have it so  no its the girl herself shes not only beautiful in body shes all sweetness and sincerity in mind there isnt a petty thing about her and her happy smiledo you know i have times when i resent that smile how can she be so happy without me thats crazy too but i think it sometimes then i think of the time when she will not smilewhen that brute belden will begin to treat her as he does his sistersthen i get murderous  as wayland listened to this outpouring he wondered at the intensity of the foresters passion he marveled too at berries choice for there was something fine and high in landons worship a college man with a mining engineers training he should go high in the service he made the mistake of being too precipitate as a lover concluded wayland his forthright courtship repelled her  meanwhile his own troubles increased franks dislike had grown to an impish vindictiveness and if the old man meeker had any knowledge of his sons deviltries he gave no sign mrs meeker however openly reproved the scamp  you ought to be ashamed of worrying a sick man she protested indignantly  he aint so sick as all that and besides he needs the starch taken out of him was the boys pitiless answer  i dont know why i stay wayland wrote to berea im disgusted with the men up heretheyre all tiresome except landonbut i hate to slink away and besides the country is glorious id like to come down and see you this week may i do so please send word that i may  she did not reply and wondering whether she had received his letter or not he mounted his horse one beautiful morning and rode away up the trail with a sense of elation of eager joy with intent to call upon her at the ranch as he went by  hardly had he vanished among the pines when clifford belden rode in from his ranch on hat creek and called at meekers for his mail  frank meeker was in the office and as he both feared and disliked this big contemptuous young cattleman he set to work to make him jealous  you want to watch this onelung boarder of ours he warned with a grin hes been writing to berrie and hes just gone down to see her his highfalutin ways and his fine white hands have put her on the slant  belden fixed a pair of cold grayblue eyes on his tormentor and said you be careful of your tongue or ill put you on the slant  im her own cousin retorted frank i reckon i can say what i please about her i dont want that dude easterner to cut you out she guided him over here and gave him her slicker to keep him dry and i can see shes terribly taken with him shes headstrong as a mule once she gets started and if she takes a notion to norcross its all up with you  im not worrying retorted belden  youd better be i was down there the other day and it peared like she couldnt talk of anything else but mister norcross mister norcross till i was sick of his name  an hour later belden left the mill and set off up the trail behind norcross his face fallen into stern lines frank writhed in delight there goes cliff hot under the collar chasing norcross if he finds out that berrie is interested in him hell just about wring that dudes neck  meanwhile wayland was riding through the pass with lightening heart his thought dwelling on the girl at the end of his journey aside from landon and nash she was the one soul in all this mountain world in whom he took the slightest interest her pity still hurt him but he hoped to show her such change of color such gain in horsemanship that she could no longer consider him an invalid his mind kept so closely to these interior matters that he hardly saw the path but his horse led him safely back with precise knowledge and eager haste  as he reached the mcfarlane ranch it seemed deserted of men but a faint column of smoke rising from the roof of the kitchen gave evidence of a cook and at his knock berrie came to the door with a boyish word of frank surprise and pleasure she was dressed in a blueandwhite calico gown with the collar turned in and the sleeves rolled up but she seemed quite unembarrassed and her pleasure in his coming quite repaid him for his long and tiresome ride  ive been wondering about you she said im mighty glad to see you how do you stand it  you got my letter  i didand i was going to write and tell you to come down but ive had some special work to do at the office  she took the horses rein from him and together they started toward the stables as she stepped over and around the old hoofs and meatboneswhich littered the waywithout comment wayland again wondered at her apparent failure to realize the disgusting disorder of the yard why dont she urge the men to clean it up he thought  this action of stabling the horsesa perfectly innocent and natural one for herled one of the hands a coarseminded sneak to watch them from a corral i wonder how cliff would like that he evilly remarked  berea was frankly pleased to see wayland and spoke of the improvement which had taken place in him youre looking fine she said as they were returning to the house but how do you get on with the boys  not very well he admitted they seem to have it in for me its a constant fight  how about frank  hes the worst of them all he never speaks to me that he doesnt insult me i dont know why ive tried my best to get into his good graces but i cant your uncle i like and mrs meeker is very kind but all the others seem to be sworn enemies i dont think i could stand it if it werent for landon i spend a good deal of time with him  her face grew grave i reckon you got started wrong she said at last theyll like you better when you get browned up and your clothes get dirtyyoure a little too fancy for them just now  but you see he said im not trying for their admiration i havent the slightest ambition to shine as a cowpuncher and if those fellows are fair samples i dont want anybody to mistake me for one  dont let that get around she smilingly replied theyd run you out if they knew you despised them  ive come down here to confer with you he declared as they reached the door i dont believe i want any more of their company whats the use as you say ive started wrong with them and i dont see any prospect of getting right and besides i like the rangers better landon thinks i might work into the service i wonder if i could it would give me something to do  she considered a moment well think about that come into the kitchen im cook today mothers gone to town  the kitchen was clean and ample and the delicious odor of newmade bread filled it with cheer as the girl resumed her apron wayland settled into a chair with a sigh of content i like this he said aloud theres nothing cowgirl about you now youre the anglosaxon housewife you might be a michigan or connecticut girl at this moment  her cheeks were ruddy with the heat and her eyes intent on her work but she caught enough of his meaning to be pleased with it oh i have to take a hand at the pots and pans now and then i cant give all my time to the service but id like to  he boldly announced his errand i wish youd take me to board im sure your cooking would build up my shattered system a good deal quicker than your aunts  she laughed but shook her head you ought to be on the hills riding hard every day what you need is the high country and the air of the pines  im not feeling any lack of scenery or pinetree air he retorted im perfectly satisfied right here civilized bread and the sight of you will do me more good than boiled beans and camp bread i hate to say it but the meeker menu runs largely to beef moreover just seeing you would help my recovery  she became selfconscious at this and he hastened to add  not that im really sick mrs meeker like yourself persists in treating me as if i were im feeling fineperfectly well only im not as rugged as i want to be  she had read that victims of the white plague always talk in this cheerful way about themselves and she worked on without replying and this gave him an excellent opportunity to study her closely she was taller than most women and lithely powerful there was nothing delicate about hernothing spirituelleon the contrary she was markedly fullveined cheerful and humorous and yet she had responded several times to an allusive phrase with surprising quickness she did so now as he remarked somebody i think it was lowell has said nature is all very well for a vacation but a poor substitute for the society of good men and women its beautiful up at the mill but i want some one to enjoy it with and there is no one to turn to except landon and hes rather sad and selfabsorbedyou know why if i were herein the valleyyou and i could ride together now and then and you could show me all the trails why not let me come here and board im going to ask your mother if i may not do so  quite naturally he grew more and more personal he told her of his father the busy director of a lumber company and of his mother sickly and inert  she ought never to have married he said with darkened brow not one of her children has even a decent constitution im the most robust of them all and i must seem a pretty poor lot to you however i wasnt always like this and if that young devil frank meeker hadnt tormented me out of my sleep i would have shown you still greater improvement dont you see that it is your duty to let me stay here where i can build up on your cooking  she turned this aside mother dont think much of my cooking she says i can handle a brandiniron a heap better than i can a rollinpin  you certainly can ride he replied with admiring accent i shall never forget the picture you made that first time i saw you racing to intercept the stage do you know how fine you are physically youre a wonder she uttered some protest but he went on when i think of my mother and sisters in comparison with you they seem like caricatures of women i know i oughtnt to say such things of my mothershe really is an exceptional personbut a woman should be something more than mind my sisters could no more do what you do than a lame duck can lead a ballet i suppose it is because i have had to live with a lot of ailing women all my life that i feel as i do toward you i worship your health and strength i really do your care of me on that trip was very sweetand yet it stung  i didnt mean to hurt you  i know you didnt and im not complaining im only wishing i could come here and be bossed by you until i could hold my own against any weather you make me feel just as i used to do when i went to a circus and watched the athletes men and women file past me in the sawdust they seemed like demigods as i sit here now i have a fierce desire to be as well as strong as full of life as you are i hate being thin and timid you have the physical perfection that queens ought to have  her face was flushed with inward heat as she listened to his strange words which sprang she feared from the heart of a man hopelessly ill but she again protested its all right to be able to throw a rope and ride a mean horse but you have got something elsesomething i can never get learning is a thousand times finer than muscle  learning does not compensate for nineinch shoulders and spindle legs he answered but im going to get well knowing you has given me renewed desire to be a man im going to ride and rough it and sleep out of doors till i can follow you anywhere youll be proud of me before the month is out but im going to cut the meeker outfit i wont subject myself to their vulgarities another day why should i its false pride in me to hang on up there any longer  of course you can come here she said mother will be glad to have you although our ranch isnt a bit pretty perhaps father will send you out with one of the rangers as a fireguard ill ask him tonight  i wish you would i like these foresters what ive seen of them i wouldnt mind serving under a man like landon hes fine  upon this pleasant conference cliff belden unexpectedly burst pushing the door open with a slam he confronted berrie with dark and angry face  why cliff where did you come from she asked rising in some confusion i didnt hear you ride up  apparently not he sneeringly answered i reckon you were too much occupied  she tried to laugh away his black mood thats right i was im chief cook today come in and sit down mothers gone to town and im playing her part she explained ignoring his sullen displeasure cliff this is mr norcross who is visiting uncle joe mr norcross shake hands with mr belden she made this introduction with some awkwardness for her lovers failure to even say howdy informed her that his jealous heart was aflame and she went on quickly mr norcross dropped in on his way to the postoffice and im collecting a snack for him  recognizing beldens claims upon the girl wayland rose i must be going its a long ride over the hill  come again soon urged berrie father wants to see you  thank you i will look in very shortly he replied and went out with such dignity as he could command feeling however very much like a dog that has been kicked over the threshold  closing the door behind him belden turned upon the girl whats that consumptive dogie doing here he peared to be very much at home with youtoo dern much at home  she was prepared for his displeasure but not for words like these she answered quietly he just dropped in on his way to town and hes not a dogie she resented his tone as well as his words  ive heard about you taking him over to meekers and lending him your only slicker he went on but i didnt expect to find him sittin here like he owned you and the place youre taking altogether too much pains with him cant he put his own horse out do you have to go to the stable with him you never did have any sense about your actions with men youve all along been too free of your reputation and now im going to take care of it for you i wont have you nursin this runt any longer  she perceived now the full measure of his base rage and her face grew pale and set youre making a perfect fool of yourself cliff she said with portentous calmness  am i he asked  you sure are and youll see it yourself by and by youve no call to get wireedged about mr norcross hes not very strong hes just getting well of a long sickness i knew a chill would finish him thats why i gave him my slicker it didnt hurt me and maybe it saved his life id do it again if necessary  since when did you start a hospital for eastern tenderfeet he sneered then his tone changed to one of downright command you want to cut this all out i tell you i wont have any more of it the boys up at the mill are all talkin about your interest in this little whelp and im getting the brandingiron from every one i meet sam saw you go into the barn with that dude and that would have been all over the country tomorrow if i hadnt told him id sew his mouth up if he said a word about it of course i dont think you mean anything by this coddlin  oh thank you she interrupted with flaming quick indignant fury thats mighty nice of you i went to the barn to show mr norcross where to stall his horse i didnt know sam was here  he sneered no i bet you didnt  she fired at this come now spit it out something nasty is in your mind go on what have i done what makes you so hot  he began to weaken i dont accuse you of anything ibut i  yes you doin your heart you distrust meyou just as much as said so  he was losing his high air of command never mind what i said berrie i  she was blazing now but i do mindi mind a whole loti didnt think it of you she added as she realized his cheapness his coarseness i didnt suppose you could even think such things of me i dont like it she repeated and her tone hardened and i guess youd better pull out of herefor good if youve no more faith in me than that i want you to go and never come back  you dont mean that  yes i do youve shown this yellow streak before and im tired of it this is the limit im done with you  she stood between tears and benumbing anger now and he was scared dont say that berrie he pleaded trying to put his arm about her  keep away from me she dashed his hands aside i hate you i never want to see you again she ran into her own room and slammed the door behind her  belden stood for a long time with his back against the wall the heat of his resentment utterly gone an empty aching place in his heart he called her twice but she made no answer and so at last he mounted his horse and rode away     iv  the supervisor of the forest   young norcross much as he admired berrie was not seeking to exchange her favor for her lovers enmity and he rode away with an uneasy feeling of having innocently made trouble for himself as well as for a fine truehearted girl what a good friendly talk we were having he said regretfully and to think she is to marry that big scowling brute how could she turn landon down for a savage like that  he was just leaving the outer gate when belden came clattering up and reined his horse across the path and called out see here you young skunk youre a poor whitelivered tenderfoot and i cant bust you as i would a fullgrown man but i reckon you better not ride this trail any more  why not inquired wayland  belden glared because i tell you so your sympathyhunting game has just about run into the ground youve worked this baby dodge about long enough youre not so almighty sick as you put up to be and youd better hunt some other cure for lonesomeness or ill just about cave your chest in  all this was shockingly plain talk for a slender young scholar to listen to but norcross remained calm i think youre unnecessarily excited he remarked i have no desire to make trouble im considering miss berea who is too fine to be worried by us  his tone was conciliating and the cowman in spite of himself responded to it thats why i advise you to go she was all right till you came colorados a big place and there are plenty other fine ranges for men of your complaintwhy not try routt county this is certain you cant stay in the same valley with my girl i serve notice of that  youre making a prodigious ass of yourself observed wayland with calm contempt  you think sodo you well ill make a jackrabbit out of you if i find you on this ranch again youve worked on my girl in some way till shes jest about quit me i dont see how you did it you measly little pup but you surely have turned her against me his rage burst into flame as he thought of her last words if you were so much as half a man id break you in two pieces right now but youre not youre nothing but a deadonthehoof lunger and theres nothing to do but run you out so take this as your final notice you straddle a horse and head east and keep aridin and if i catch you with my girl again ill deal you a whole hatful of miserynow thats right  thereupon with a final glance of hate in his face he whirled his horse and galloped away leaving norcross dumb with resentment intermingled with wonder  truly the west is a dramatic country here i am involved in a lovers wrath and under sentence of banishment all within a month well i suppose theres nothing to do but carry out beldens orders hes the boss he said as he rode on i wonder just what happened after i left something stormy evidently she must have given him a sharp rebuff or he wouldnt have been so furious with me perhaps she even broke her engagement with him i sincerely hope she did shes too good for him thats the truth  and so from point to point he progressed till with fine indignation he reached a resolution to stay and meet whatever came i certainly would be a timorous animal if i let myself be scared into flight by that big bonehead he said at last i have as much right here as he has and the law must protect me it cant be that this country is entirely barbaric  nevertheless he felt very weak and very much depressed as he rode up the street of the little town and dismounted at the hotel the sidewalks were littered with loafing cowboys and lumberjacks and some of them quite openly ridiculed his ridingbreeches and his thin legs others merely grinned but in their grins lay something more insulting than words to them i am a poor thing he admitted but as he lifted his eyes to the mighty semicircular wall of the bear tooth range over which the daily storm was playing he forgot his small worries what gorgeous pageantry what lifegiving air if only civilized men and women possessed this glorious valley what a place it would be he exclaimed and in the heat of his indignant contempt he would have swept the valley clean  as his eyes caught the flutter of the flag on its staff above the forest service building his heart went out to the men who unselfishly wrought beneath that symbol of federal unity for the good of the future that is civilized he said that is prophetic and alighted at the door in a glow of confidence  nash who was alone in the office looked up from his work come in he called heartily come in and report  thank you id like to do so and may i use your desk i have a letter to write  make yourself at home take any desk you like the men are all out on duty  youre very kind replied wayland gratefully there was something reassuring in this greeting and in the many signs of skill and scientific reading which the place displayed it was like a bit of washington in the midst of a careless slovenly lawless mountain town and norcross took his seat and wrote his letter with a sense of proprietorship  im getting up an enthusiasm for the service just from hearing alec belden rave against it he said a few minutes later as he looked up from his letter  nash grinned how did you like meeker  hes a good man but he has his peculiarities belden is your real enemy he is blue with malignityso are most of the cowmen i met up there i wish i could do something for the service im a thoroughly uptodate analytical chemist and a passable mining engineer and my doctor says that for a year at least i must work in the open air is there anything in this forest service for a weakling like me  nash considered the supervisor might put you on as a temporary guard ill speak to him if you like  i wish you would tell him to forget the pay im not in need of money but i do require some incentivesomething to dosomething to give me direction it bores me stiff to fish and im sick of loafing if mcfarlane can employ me i shall be happy the country is glorious but i cant live on scenery  i think we can employ you but youll have to go on as fireguard or something like that for the first year you see the work is getting to be more and more technical each year as a matter of facthere he lowered his voice a littlemcfarlane is one of the old guard and will have to give way he dont know a thing about forestry and is too old to learn his girl knows more about it than he does she helps him out on office work too  wayland wondered a little at the freedom of expression on the part of nash but said if he runs his office as he runs his ranch he surely is condemned to go  theres where the girl comes in she keeps the boys in the office lined up and maintains things in pretty fair shape she knows the old man is in danger of losing his job and shes doing her best to hold him to it shes like a son to him and he relies on her judgment when a close decision comes up but its only a matter of time when he and all he represents must drift by this is a big movement were mixed with  i begin to feel that thats why id like to take it up its the only thing out here that interests meand ive got to do something i cant loaf  well you get berrie to take up your case and youre all right she has the say about who goes on the force in this forest  it was late in the afternoon before wayland started back to meekers with intent to repack his belongings and leave the ranch for good he had decided not to call at mcfarlanes a decision which came not so much from fear of clifford belden as from a desire to shield berea from further trouble but as he was passing the gate the girl rose from behind a clump of willows and called to him oh mr norcross wait a moment  he drew rein and slipping from his horse approached her what is it miss berrie he asked with wondering politeness  she confronted him with gravity its too late for you to cross the ridge itll be dark long before you reach the cutoff youd better not try to make it  i think i can find my way he answered touched by her consideration im not so helpless as i was when i came  just the same you mustnt go on she insisted father told me to ask you to come in and stay all night he wants to meet you i was afraid you might ride by after what happened today and so i came up here to head you off she took his horse by the rein and flashed a smiling glance up at him come now do as the supervisor tells you  wait a moment he pleaded on second thought i dont believe its a good thing for me to go home with you it will only make further trouble forfor us both  she was almost as direct as belden had been i know what you mean i saw cliff follow you he jumped you didnt he  he overtook meyes  what did he say  he hesitated he was pretty hot and said things hell be sorry for when he cools off  he told you not to come here any moreadvised you to hit the outgoing traildidnt he  he flushed with returning shame of it all but quietly answered yes he said something about riding east  are you going to do it  not today but i guess id better keep away from here  she looked at him steadily why  because youve been very kind to me and i wouldnt for the world do anything to hurt or embarrass you  dont you mind about me she responded bluntly what happened this morning wasnt your fault nor mine cliff made a mighty coarse play something hell have to pay for he knows that right now hell be back in a day or two begging my pardon and he wont get it dont you worry about me not for a minutei can take care of myselfi grew up that way and dont you be chased out of the country by anybody come father will be looking for you  with a feeling that he was involving both the girl and himself in still darker storms the young fellow yielded to her command and together they walked along the weedbordered path while she continued  this isnt the first time cliff has started in to discipline me but its obliged to be the last hes the kind that think they own a girl just as soon as they get her to wear an engagement ring but cliff dont own me i told him i wouldnt stand for his coarse ways and i wont  wayland tried to bring her back to humor youre a kind of new woman  she turned a stern look on him you bet i am i was raised a free citizen no man can make a slave of me i thought he understood that but it seems he didnt hes all right in many waysone of the best riders in the countrybut hes pretty tolerable domineeringive always known thatstill i never expected him to talk to me like he did today it certainly was raw she broke off abruptly you mustnt let frank meeker get the best of you either she advised hes a mean little weasel if he gets started ill bet he put cliff up to this business  do you think so  yes he just as good as told me hed do it i know frank hes my own cousin and someways i like him but hes the limit when he gets going you see he wanted to get even with cliff and took that way of doing it ill ride up there and give him a little good advice some saturday  he was no longer amused by her blunt speech and her dark look saddened him she seemed so unlike the happy girl he met that first day and the change in her subtended a big rough and pitiless world of men against which she was forced to contend all her life  mrs mcfarlane greeted norcross with cordial word and earnest handclasp im glad to see you looking so well she said with charming sincerity  im browner anyway he answered and turned to meet mcfarlane a short blackbearded man with fine dark eyes and shapely handshands that had never done anything more toilsome than to lift a bridle rein or to clutch the handle of a gun he was the horseman in all his training and though he owned hundreds of acres of land he had never so much as held a plow or plied a spade his manner was that of the cowboss the lord of great herds the claimant of empires of government grassland poor as his house looked he was in reality rich narrowminded in respect to his own interests he was well in advance of his neighbors on matters relating to the general welfare a curious mixture of greed and generosity as most men are and though he had been made supervisor at a time when political pull still crippled the service he was loyal to the flag im mighty glad to see you he heartily began we dont often get a man from the sealevel and when we do we squeeze him dry  his voice low languid and soft was most insinuating and for hours he kept his guest talking of the east and its industries and prejudices and berrie and her mother listened with deep admiration for the youngster had seen a good deal of the old world and was unusually well read on historical lines of inquiry he talked well too inspired by his attentive audience  berries eyes wide and eager were fixed upon him unwaveringly he felt her wonder her admiration and was inspired to do his best something in her absorbed attention led him to speak of things so personal that he wondered at himself for uttering them  ive been dilettante all my life was one of his confessions ive traveled ive studied in a tepid sort of fashion i went through college without any idea of doing anything with what i got i had a sort of pride in keeping up with my fellows and i had no idea of preparing for any work in the world then came my breakdown and my doctor ordered me out here i came intending to fish and loaf around but i cant do that ive got to do something or go back home i expected to have a chum of mine with me but his father was injured in an automobile accident so he went into the office to help out  as he talked the girl discovered new graces new allurements in him his smile so subtly selfderisive and his voice so flexible and so quietly eloquent completed her subjugation she had no further care concerning cliffordindeed she had forgotten himfor the time at least the other part of herthe highly civilized latent power drawn from her motherwas in action she lost her air of command her sense of chieftainship and sat humbly at the feet of this shining visitor from the east  at last mrs mcfarlane rose and berea reluctantly like a child loath to miss a fairy story held out her hand to say good night and the young man saw on her face that look of adoration which marks the birth of sudden love but his voice was frank and his glance kindly as he said  here ive done all the talking when i wanted you to tell me all sorts of things  i cant tell you anything  oh yes you can and besides i want you to intercede for me with your father and get me into the service but well talk about that tomorrow good night  after the women left the room norcross said  i really am in earnest about entering the forest service landon filled me with enthusiasm about it never mind the pay im not in immediate need of money but i do need an interest in life  mcfarlane stared at him with kindly perplexity i dont know exactly what you can do but ill work you in somehow you ought to work under a man like settle one that could put you through a training in the rudiments of the game ill see what can be done  thank you for that half promise said wayland and he went to his bed happier than at any moment since leaving home  berrie on her part did not analyze her feeling for wayland she only knew that he was as different from the men she knew as a hawk from a sagehen and that he appealed to her in a higher way than any other had done his talk filled her with visions of great cities and with thoughts of books for though she was profoundly loyal to her mountain valley she held other more secret admirations she was in fact compounded of two opposing tendencies her quiet little mother longingin secretfor the placid refined life of her native kentucky town had dowered her daughter with some part of her desire she had always hated the slovenly wasteful and purposeless life of the cattlerancher and though she still patiently bore with her husbands shortcomings she covertly hoped that berea might find some other and more civilized lover than clifford belden she understood her daughter too well to attempt to dictate her action she merely said to her as they were alone for a few moments i dont wonder your father is interested in mr norcross hes very intelligentand very considerate  too considerate said berrie shortly he makes other men seem like bears or pigs  mrs mcfarlane said no more but she knew that cliff was for the time among the bears     v  the golden pathway   young norcross soon became vitally engaged with the problems which confronted mcfarlane and his possible enrolment as a guard filled him with a sense of proprietorship in the forest which made him quite content with bear tooth he set to work at once to acquire a better knowledge of the extent and boundaries of the reservation it was indeed a noble possession containing nearly eight hundred thousand acres of woodland and reaching to the summits of the snowlined peaks to the east south and west it appealed to him with silent majesty it drew upon his patriotism remembering how the timber of his own state had been slashed and burned he began to feel a sense of personal responsibility he had but to ride into it a few miles in order to appreciate in some degree its grandeur considered merely as the source of a hundred swift streams whose waters enriched the valleys lying below  he bought a horse of his ownalthough berrie insisted upon his retaining peteand sent for a saddle of the army type and from sheer desire to keep entirely clear of the cowboy equipment procured puttees like those worn by cavalry officers and when he presented himself completely uniformed he looked not unlike a slender young lieutenant of the cavalry on field duty and in berries eyes was wondrous alluring  he took quarters at the hotel but spent a larger part of each day in berries companya fact which was duly reported to clifford belden hardly a day passed without his taking at least one meal at the supervisors home  as he met the rangers one by one he perceived by their outfits as well as by their speech that they were sharply divided upon old lines and new the experts the men of college training were quite ready to be known as uncle sams men they held a pride in their duties a respect for their superiors and an understanding of the governmental policy which gave them dignity and a quiet authority they were less policemen than trusted agents of a federal department nevertheless there was much to admire in the older men who possessed a selfreliance a knowledge of nature and a certain rough grace which made them interesting companions and rendered them effective teachers of camping and trailing and while they were secretly a little contemptuous of the schoolboys they were all quite ready to ask for expert aid when knotty problems arose it was no longer a question of grazing it was a question of lumbering and reforestration  nash who took an almost brotherly interest in his apprentice warningly said you want to go well clothed and well shod youll have to meet all kinds of weather every man in the service i dont care what his technical job is should be schooled in taking care of himself in the forest and on the trail i often meet surveyors and civil engineersexpertswho are helpless as children in camp and when i want them to go into the hills and do field work they are almost useless the oldstyle ranger has his virtues settle is just the kind of instructor you young fellows need  berrie also had keen eyes for his outfit and his training and under her direction he learned to pack a horse set a tent build a fire in the rain and other duties  you want to remember that you carry your bed and board with you she said and you must be prepared to camp anywhere and at any time  the girls skill in these particulars was marvelous to him and added to the admiration he already felt for her her hand was as deft as sure as the best of them and her knowledge of cayuse psychology more profound than any of the men excepting her father  one day toward the end of his second week in the village the supervisor said well now if youre ready to experiment ill send you over to settle the ranger on the horseshoe hes a little lame on his penhand side and you may be able to help him out maybe ill ride over there with you i want to line out some timber sales on the west side of ptarmigan  this commission delighted norcross greatly im ready sir this moment he answered saluting soldierwise  that night as he sat in the saddlelittered boothaunted front room of nashs little shack his host said quaintly dont think you are inheriting a soft snap son the rangers job was a mans job in the old days when it was a mere matter of patrolling but its worse and more of it today a ranger must be ready and willing to build bridges fight fire scale logs chop a hole through a windfall use a pick in a ditch build his own house cook launder and do any other old trick that comes along but youll know more about all this at the end of ten days than i can tell you in a year  im eager for duty replied wayland  the next morning as he rode down to the office to meet the supervisor he was surprised and delighted to find berea there im riding too she announced delightedly ive never been over that new trail and father has agreed to let me go along then she added earnestly i think its fine youre going in for the service but its hard work and you must be careful till youre hardened to it its a long way to a doctor from settles station  he was annoyed as well as touched by her warning for it proclaimed that he was still far from looking the brave forester he felt himself to be he replied im not going to try anything wild but i do intend to master the trailers craft  ill teach you how to camp if youll let me she continued ive been on lots of surveys with father and i always take my share of the work i threw that hitch alone she nodded toward the packhorse whose neat load gave evidence of her skill i told father this was to be a real camping expedition and as the grouse season is on well live on the country can you fish  just about that he laughed good thing you didnt ask me if i could catch fish he was recovering his spirits it will be great fun to have you as instructor in camp science i seem to be in for all kinds of good luck  they both grew uneasy as time passed for fear something or some one would intervene to prevent this trip which grew in interest each moment but at last the supervisor came out and mounted his horse the packponies fell in behind berrie followed and the student of woodcraft brought up to rear  i hope it wont rain the girl called back at him at least not till we get over the divide its a fine ride up the hill and the foliage is at its best  it seemed to him the most glorious morning of his life a few large white clouds were drifting like snowladen warvessels from west to east silent and solemn and on the highest peaks a gray vapor was lightly clinging the nearby hills still transcendently beautiful with the flaming gold of the aspen burned against the dark green of the farther forest and far beyond the deep purple of the shadowed slopes rose to smoky blue and tawny yellow it was a season an hour to create raptures in a poet so radiant so widereaching so tumultuous was the landscape nothing sad nothing discouraging showed itself the wind was brisk the air cool and clear and jewellike small frostpainted vines and ripened shrubberies blazed upward from the ground as he rode the youth silently repeated beautiful beautiful  for several miles they rode upward through golden forests of aspens on either hand rose thick walls of snowwhite boles and in the mystic glow of their gilded leaves the face of the girl shone with unearthly beauty it was as if the very air had become auriferous magic coins dangled from the branches filmy shadows fell over her hair and down her strong young arms like priceless lace gold gold everywhere gold gold and fire  twice she stopped to gaze into waylands face to say with hushed intensity isnt it wonderful dont you wish it would last forever  her words were poor ineffectual but her look her breathless voice made up for their lack of originality once she said i never saw it so lovely before it is an enchanted land with no suspicion that the larger part of her ecstasy arose from the presence of her young and sympathetic companion he too responded to the beauty of the day of the golden forest as one who had taken new hold on life after long illness  meanwhile the supervisor was calmly leading the way upward vaguely conscious of the magical air and mystic landscape in which his young folk floated as if on wings thinking busily of the improvements which were still necessary in the trail and weighing with care the clouds which still lingered upon the tallest summits as if debating whether to go or to stay he had never been an imaginative soul and now that age had somewhat dimmed his eyes and blunted his senses he was placidly content with his path the rapture of the lover the song of the poet had long since abandoned his heart and yet he was not completely oblivious to him it was a nice day but a weather breeder  i wonder if i shall ever ride through this mountain world as unmoved as he seems to be norcross asked himself after some jarring prosaic remark from his chief i am glad berrie responds to it  at last they left these lower wondrous forest aisles and entered the unbroken cloak of firs whose dark and silent deeps had a stern beauty all their own but the young people looked back upon the glowing world below with wistful hearts back and forth across a long downsweeping ridge they wove their toilsome way toward the clouds which grew each hour more formidable awesome with their weight ponderous as continents in their majesty of movement the horses began to labor with roaring breath and wayland dismounting to lighten his ponys burden was dismayed to discover how thin the air had become even to walk unburdened gave him a smothering pain in his breast  better stay on called the girl my rule is to ride the hill going up and walk it going down down hill is harder on a horse than going up  nevertheless he persisted in clambering up some of the steepest parts of the trail and was increasingly dismayed by the endless upward reaches of the foothills a dozen times he thought we must be nearly at the top and then other and far higher ridges suddenly developed occasionally the supervisor was forced to unsling an ax and chop his way through a fallen tree and each time the student hurried to the spot ready to aid but was quite useless he admired the ease and skill with which the older man put his shining blade through the largest bole and wondered if he could ever learn to do as well  one of the first essentials of a rangers training is to learn to swing an ax remarked mcfarlane and you never want to be without a real tool i wont stand for a hatchet ranger  berrie called attention to the marks on the trees this is the government signa long blaze with two notches above it you can trust these trails they lead somewhere  as you ride a trail study how to improve it added the supervisor sheathing his ax they can all be improved  wayland was sure of this a few steps farther on when the supervisors horse went down in a small boghole and berries pony escaped only by the most desperate plunging the girl laughed but wayland was appalled and stood transfixed watching mcfarlane as he calmly extricated himself from the saddle of the fallen horse and chirped for him to rise  you act as if this were a regular part of the journey wayland said to berrie  its all in the days work she replied but i despise a bog worse than anything else on the trail ill show you how to go round this one thereupon she slid from her horse and came tiptoeing back along the edge of the mudhole  mcfarlane cut a stake and plunged it vertically in the mud that means no bottom he explained we must cut a new trail  wayland was dismounting when berrie said stay on now put your horse right through where those rocks are its hard bottom there  he felt like a child but he did as she bid and so came safely through while mcfarlane set to work to blaze a new route which should avoid the slough which was already a bottomless horror to the city man  this mishap delayed them nearly half an hour and the air grew dark and chill as they stood there and the amateur ranger began to understand how serious a lone night journey might sometimes be what would i do if when riding in the dark my horse should go down like that and pin me in the mud he asked himself eternal watchfulness is certainly one of the foresters first principles  the sky was overshadowed now and a thin drizzle of rain filled the air the novice hastened to throw his raincoat over his shoulders but mcfarlane rode steadily on clad only in his shirtsleeves unmindful of the wet berrie however approved waylands caution thats right keep dry she called back dont pay attention to father hed rather get soaked any day than unroll his slicker you mustnt take him for model yet awhile  he no longer resented her sweet solicitude although he considered himself unentitled to it and he rejoiced under the shelter of his fine new coat he began to perceive that one could be defended against a storm  after passing two depressing marshes they came to a hillside so steep so slippery so dark so forbidding that one of the packhorses balked shook his head and reared furiously as if to say i cant do it and i wont try and wayland sympathized with him the forest was gloomy and cold and apparently endless  after coaxing him for a time with admirable gentleness the supervisor at berries suggestion shifted part of the load to her own saddlehorse and they went on  wayland though incapable of commentso great was the demand upon his lungswas not too tired to admire the power and resolution of the girl who seemed not to suffer any special inconvenience from the rarefied air the dryness of his open mouth the throbbing of his troubled pulse the roaring of his breath brought to him with increasing dismay the fact that he had overlooked another phase of the rangers job i couldnt chop a hole through one of these windfalls in a week he admitted as mcfarlanes blade again liberated them from a fallen tree to do office work at six thousand feet is quite different from swinging an ax up here at timberline he said to the girl i guess my chest is too narrow for high altitudes  oh youll get used to it she replied cheerily i always feel it a little at first but i really think its good for a body kind o stretches the lungs nevertheless she eyed him with furtive anxiety  he was beginning to be hungry alsohe had eaten a very early breakfastand he fell to wondering just where and when they were to camp but he endured in silence so long as berrie makes no complaint my mouth is shut he told himself surely i can stand it if she can and so struggled on  up and up the pathway looped crossing minute little boggy meadows on whose bottomless ooze the grass shook like a blanket descending steep ravines and climbing back to dark and muddy slopes the forest was dripping green and silent now a mysterious menacing jungle all the warmth and magic of the golden forest below was lost as though it belonged to another and sunnier world nothing could be seen of the high snowflecked peaks which had allured them from the valley all about them drifted the clouds and yet through the mist the flushed face of the girl glowed like a dewwet rose and the imperturbable supervisor jogged his remorseless unhesitating way toward the dense ascending night  im glad im not riding this pass alone wayland said as they paused again for breath  so am i she answered but her thought was not his she was happy at the prospect of teaching him how to camp  at last they reached the ragged edge of timberline and there rolling away under the mist lay the bare grassy upwardclimbing naked neck of the great peak the wind had grown keener moment by moment and when they left the stormtwisted pines below its breath had a wintry nip the rain had ceased to fall but the clouds still hung densely to the loftiest summits it was a sinister yet beautiful worlda world as silent as a dream and through the short thick grass the slender trail ran like a timid serpent the hour seemed to have neither daytime nor season all was obscure mysterious engulfing and hostile had he been alone the youth would have been appalled by the prospect  now were on the divide called berea and as she spoke they seemed to enter upon a boundless alpine plain of velvetrusset grass this is the bear tooth plateau low monuments of loose rock stood on small ledges as though to mark the course and in the hollows dark ponds of icy water lay half surrounded by masses of compact snow  this is a stormy place in winter mcfarlane explained these piles of stone are mighty valuable in a blizzard ive crossed this divide in august in snow so thick i could not see a rod  half an hour later they began to descend windtwisted stormbleached dwarf pines were first to show then the firs then the bluegreen spruces and then the sheltering deeps of the undespoiled forest opened and the roar of a splendid stream was heard but still the supervisor kept his resolute way making no promises as to dinner though his daughter called wed better go into camp at beaver lake i hope youre not starved she called to wayland  but i am he replied so frankly that she never knew how faint he really was his knees were trembling with weakness and he stumbled dangerously as he trod the loose rocks in the path  they were all afoot now descending swiftly and the horses ramped down the trail with expectant haste so that in less than an hour from timberline they were back into the sunshine of the lower valley and at three oclock or thereabouts they came out upon the bank of an exquisite lake and with a cheery shout mcfarlane called out here we are out of the wilderness then to wayland well boy how did you stand it  just middling replied wayland reticent from weariness and with joy of their campingplace the lake dark as topaz and smooth as steel lay in a frame of golden willowsas a jewel is filigreed with goldand above it the cliffs rose three thousand feet in sheer majesty their upper slopes glowing with autumnal grasses a swift stream roared down a low ledge and fell into the pond near their feet grassy pineshadowed knolls afforded pasture for the horses and two giant firs at the edge of a little glade made a natural shelter for their tent  with businesslike certitude berrie unsaddled her horse turned him loose and lent a skilful hand at removing the panniers from the packanimals while wayland willing but a little uncertain stood awkwardly about under her instruction he collected dead branches of a standing fir and from these and a few cones kindled a blaze while the supervisor hobbled the horses and set the tent  if the work of a forester were all like this it wouldnt be so bad he remarked wanly i think i know several fellows who would be glad to do it without a cent of pay  wait till you get to heaving a pick she retorted or scaling lumber in a rain or building a corduroy bridge  i dont want to think of anything so dreadful i want to enjoy this moment i never was hungrier or happier in my life  do ye good interjected mcfarlane who had paused to straighten up the coffeepot most people dont know what hunger means theres nothing finer in the world than good oldfashioned hunger provided youve got something to throw into yourself when you come into camp this is a great place for fish i think ill see if i cant jerk a few out  better wait till night said his daughter mr norcross is starving and so am i plain bacon will do me  the coffee came to a boil the skillet gave off a wondrous savor and when the corn and beans began to sizzle the trailers sat down to their feast in hearty content with one of the panniers for a table and the firtree for roof this is one of the most perfectly appointed diningrooms in the world exclaimed the alien  the girl met his look with a tender smile im glad you like it for perhaps well stay a week  it looks stormy the supervisor announced after a glance at the crests id like to see a soaking rainit would end all our worry about fires the countrys very dry on this side the range and your duty for the present will be to help tony patrol  while he talked on telling the youth how to beat out a small blaze and how to head off a large one wayland listened but heard his instructions only as he sensed the brook as an accompaniment to bereas voice for as she busied herself clearing away the dishes and putting the camp to rights she sang  youre to have the tent said her father and we two huskies will sleep under the shade of this big fir if youre ever caught out he remarked to wayland hunt for one of these balsam firs theres always a dry spot under them see here and he showed him the sheltered circle beneath the tree you can always get twigs for kindling from their inner branches he added or you can hew into one of these dead trees and get some pitchy splinters theres material for everything you want if you know where to find it shelter food fire are all here for us as they were for the indians a ranger who needs a roof all the time is not worth his bacon  so one by one the principles of camping were taught by the kindly old rancher but the hints which the girl gave were quite as valuable for wayland was eager to show her that he could be and intended to be a forester of the first class or perish in the attempt  mcfarlane went farther and talked freely of the forest and what it meant to the government were all green at the work he said and we old chaps are only holding the fort against the thieves till you youngsters learn how to make the best use of the domain  i can see that it takes more than technical training to enable a man to be supervisor of a forest conceded wayland  mcfarlane was pleased with this remark thats true too its a big responsibility when i first came on it was mainly patrolling but now with a half dozen sawmills and these june eleventh homesteads and the new ways of marking timber and the grazing and freeuse permits the office work has doubled and this is only the beginning wait till colorado has two millions of people and all these lower valleys are clamoring for water then youll see a new party spring upright here in our state  berrie was glowing with happiness lets stay here till the end of the week she suggested ive always wanted to camp on this lake and now im here i want time to enjoy it  well stay a day or two said her father but i must get over to that ditch survey which is being made at the head of poplar and then moore is coming over to look at some timber on porcupine  the young people cut willow rods and went angling at the outlet of the lake with prodigious success the water rippled with trout and in half an hour they had all they could use for supper and breakfast and behold even as they were returning with their spoil they met a covey of grouse strolling leisurely down to the lakes edge isnt it a wonderful place exclaimed the happy girl i wish we could stay a month  its like being on the swiss family robinsons island i never was more content he said fervently i wouldnt mind staying here all winter  i would she laughed the snow falls four feet deep up here its likely theres snow on the divide this minute and camping in the snow isnt so funny some people got snowed in over at deep lake last year and nearly all their horses starved before they could get them out this is a fierce old place in wintertime  i cant imagine it he said indicating the glowing amphitheater which inclosed the lake see how warmly the sun falls into that high basin its all as beautiful as the tyrol  the air at the moment was golden october and the dark clouds which lay to the east seemed the wings of a departing rather than an approaching storm and even as they looked a rainbow sprang into being arching the lake as if in assurance of peace and plenty and the young people as they turned to face it stood so close together that each felt the glow of the others shoulder the beauty of the scene seemed to bring them together in body as in spirit and they fell silent  mcfarlane seemed quite unconscious of any necromancy at work upon his daughter he smoked his pipe made notes in his fieldbook directing an occasional remark toward his apprentice enjoying in his tranquil middleage way the beauty and serenity of the hour  this is the kind of thing that makes up for a hard days ride he said jocosely  as the sunset came on the young people again loitered down to the waters edge and there seated side by side on a rocky knoll watched the phantom gold lift from the willows and climb slowly to the cliffs above while the water deepened in shadow and busy muskrats marked its glossy surface with long silvery lines mischievous campbirds peered at the couple from the branches of the pines uttering satirical comment while squirrels frankly insolent dropped cones upon their heads and barked in saucy glee  wayland forgot all the outside world forgot that he was studying to be a forest ranger and was alive only to the fact that in this most bewitching place in this most entrancing hour he had the companionship of a girl whose eyes sought his with every new phase of the silent and wonderful scene which shifted swiftly before their eyes like a noiseless yet prodigious drama the blood in his thin body warmed he forgot his fatigue his weakness he was the poet and the forest lover and this the heart of the range  lightly the golden glory rose till only the highest peaks retained its flame then it leapt to the clouds behind the peaks and gorgeously lit their somber sulphurous masses the edges of the pool grew black as night the voice of the stream grew stern and a cold wind began to fall from the heights sliding like an invisible but palpable icy cataract  at last the girl rose it is getting dark i must go back and get supper  we dont need any supper he protested  father does and youll be hungry before morning she retorted with sure knowledge of men  he turned from the scene reluctantly but once at the campfire cheerfully gave his best efforts to the work in hand seconding berries skill as best he could  the trout deliciously crisp and some potatoes and battercakes made a meal that tempted even his faint appetite and when the dishes were washed and the towels hung out to dry deep night possessed even the high summit of stately ptarmigan  mcfarlane then said ill just take a little turn to see that the horses are all right and then i think wed better close in for the night  when they were alone in the light of the fire wayland turned to berrie im glad youre here it must be awesome to camp alone in a wilderness and yet i suppose i must learn to do it  yes the ranger often has to camp alone ride alone and work alone for weeks at a time she assured him a good trailer dont mind a night trip any more than he does a day trip or if he does he never admits it rain snow darkness is all the same to him most of the boys are fifteen to forty miles from the postoffice  he smiled ruefully i begin to have new doubts about this ranger business its a little more vigorous than i thought it was suppose a fellow breaks a leg on one of those high trails  he mustnt she hastened to say he cant afford really to take reckless chances but then father wont expect as much of you as he does of the oldstagers youll have plenty of time to get used to it  i may be like the old mans cow and the green shavings just as im getting used to it ill die  she didnt laugh at this you mustnt be rash dont jump into any hard jobs for the present let the other fellow do it  but thats not very manly if i go into the work i ought to be able to take my share of any task that turns up  youd better go slow she argued wait till you get hardened to it you need something over your shoulders now she added and rose and laid a blanket over him youre tired youll take a chill if youre not careful  youre very considerate he said looking up at her gratefully but it makes me feel like a child to think i need such care if honestly trying if going up against these hills and winds with spartan courage will do me good im for it im resolved to show to you and your good father that i can learn to ride and pack and cut trail and do all the rest of ittheres some honor in qualifying as a forester and im going to do it  of course there isnt much in it for you the pay even of a full ranger isnt much after you count out his outlay for horses and saddles and their feed and his own feed it dont leave so very much of his ninety dollars a month  im not thinking of that he retorted if you had once seen a doctor shake his head over you as i have youd think just being here in this glorious spot as i am tonight would be compensation enough its a joy to be in the world and a delight to have you for my teacher  she was silent under the pleasure of his praise and he went on i know im better and im perfectly certain i can regain my strength the very odor of these pines and the power of these winds will bring it back to me see me now and think how i looked when i came here six weeks ago  she looked at him with fond agreement you are better when i saw you first i surely thought you were  i know what you thoughtand forget it please think of me as one who has touched mother earth again and is on the way to being made a giant you cant imagine how marvelous how lifegiving all this is to me it is poetry it is prophecy it is fulfilment i am fully alive again  mcfarlane upon his return gave some advice relating to the care of horses all this stock which is accustomed to a barn or a pasture will quit you he warned watch your broncos put them on the outward side of your camp when you bed down and pitch your tent near the trail then you will hear the brutes if they start back some men tie their stock all up but i usually picket my saddlehorse and hobble the rest  it was a delightful hour for schooling and wayland would have been content to sit there till morning listening but the air bit and at last the supervisor asked have you made your bed if you have turn in i shall get you out early tomorrow as he saw the bed he added i see youve laid out a bed of boughs that shows how eastern you are we dont do that out here its too cold in this climate and its too much work you want to hug the groundif its dry  the weary youth went to his couch with a sense of timorous elation for he had never before slept beneath the open sky over him the giant firtall as a steepledropped protecting shadow and looking up he could see the firelight flickering on the widespread branches his bed seemed to promise all the dreams and restful drowse which the books on outdoor life had described and close by in her tiny little canvas house he could hear the girl in lowvoiced conversation with her sire all conditions seemed right for slumber and yet slumber refused to come  after the supervisor had rolled himself in the blanket long after all sounds had ceased in the tent there still remained for the youth a score of manifold excitations to wakefulness down on the lake the muskrats and beavers were at their work nocturnal birds uttered uncanny disturbing cries some animal with stealthy crackling tread was ranging the hillside and the roar of the little fall so far from lulling him to sleepas he had imagined it wouldstimulated his imagination till he could discern in it the beat of scurrying wings and the patter of pernicious padded feet if i am appalled by the wilderness now what would it seem to me were i alone he whispered  then too his bed of boughs discovered unforeseen humps and knobs and by the time he had adjusted himself to their discomfort it became evident that his blankets were both too thin and too short and the gelid air sweeping down from the high places submerged him as if with a flood of icy water in vain he turned and twisted within his robes no sooner were his shoulders covered and comfortable than his hipbones began to ache later on the blood of his feet congealed and in the effort to wrap them more closely he uncovered his neck and shoulders the frost became a wolf the night an oppressor i must have a different outfit he decided and then thinking that this was but early autumn he added what will it be a month later he began to doubt his ability to measure up to the heroic standard of a forest patrol  the firelight flickered low and a prowling animal daringly sniffed about the camp pawing at the castaway fragments of the evening meal the youth was rigid with fear is it a bear shall i call the supervisor he asked himself  he felt sadly unprotected and wished mcfarlane nearer at hand it may be a lion but probably it is only a coyote or a porcupine he concluded and lay still for what seemed like hours waiting for the beast to gorge himself and go away  he longed for morning with intense desire and watched an amazingly luminous star which hung above the eastern cliff hoping to see it pale and die in dawn light but it did not and the wind bit even sharper his legs ached almost to the crampingpoint and his hipbones protruded like knots on a log i didnt know i had doorknobs on my hips he remarked with painful humor and looking down at his feet he saw that a thick rime was gathering on his blanket this sleeping out at night isnt what the books crack it up to be he groaned again drawing his feet up to the middle of his bed to warm them shall i resign tomorrow no ill stay with it but ill have more clothing ill have blankets six inches thick heaps of blanketsthe fleecy kindill have an airmattress his mind luxuriated in these details till he fell into an uneasy drowse     vi  stormbound   wayland was awakened by the mellow voice of his chief calling all out all out daylight down the creek breathing a prayer of thankfulness the boy sat up and looked about him the long night is over at last and i am alive he said and congratulated himself  he drew on his shoes and stiff and shivering stood about in helpless misery while mcfarlane kicked the scattered charred logs together and fanned the embers into a blaze with his hat it was heartening to see the flames leap up flinging wide their gorgeous banners of heat and light and in their glow the tenderfoot ranger rapidly recovered his courage though his teeth still chattered and the forest was dark  how did you sleep asked the supervisor  first rateat least during the latter part of the night wayland briskly lied  thats good i was afraid that adirondack bed of yours might let the white wolf in  my blankets did seem a trifle thin confessed norcross  it dont pay to sleep cold the supervisor went on a man wants to wake up refreshed not tired out with fighting the night wind and frost i always carry a good bed  it was instructive to see how quietly and methodically the old mountaineer went about his task of getting the breakfast first he cut and laid a couple of eightinch logs on either side of the fire so that the wind drew through them properly then placing his dutchoven cover on the fire he laid the bottom part where the flames touched it next he filled his coffeepot with water and set it on the coals from his pannier he took his dishes and the flour and salt and pepper arranging them all within reach and at last laid some slices of bacon in the skillet  at this stage of the work a smothered cry half yawn half complaint came from the tent oh hum is it morning inquired berrie  morning replied her father its going toward noon you get up or youll have no breakfast  thereupon wayland called can i get you anything miss berrie would you like some warm water  what for interposed mcfarlane before the girl could reply  to bathe in replied the youth  to bathe in if a daughter of mine should ask for warm water to wash with id throw her in the creek  berrie chuckled sometimes i think daddy has no feeling for me i reckon he thinks im a boy  hot water is debilitating and very bad for the complexion retorted her father icecold water is what you need and if you dont get out o there in five minutes ill dowse you with a dipperful  this reminded wayland that he had not yet made his own toilet and seizing soap towel and brushes he hurried away down to the beach where he came face to face with the dawn the splendor of it smote him full in the eyes from the waveless surface of the water a spectral mist was rising a light veil through which the stupendous cliffs loomed three thousand feet in height darkly shadowed dim and far the willows along the western marge burned as if dipped in liquid gold and on the lofty crags the suns coming created keenedged shadows violet as ink truly this forestry business was not so bad after all it had its compensations  back at the campfire he found berrie at work glowing vigorous laughing her comradeship with her father was very charming and at the moment she was rallying him on his method of breadmixing you should rub the lard into the flour she said dont be afraid to get your hands into itafter they are clean you cant mix bread with a spoon  sis i made camp bread for twenty years afore you were born  its a wonder you lived to tell of it she retorted and took the pan away from him thats another thing you must learn she said to wayland you must know how to make bread you cant expect to find bakeshops or ranchers along the way  in the heat of the fire in the charm of the girls presence the young man forgot the discomforts of the night and as they sat at breakfast and the sun rising over the high summits flooded them with warmth and good cheer and the frost melted like magic from the tent the experience had all the satisfying elements of a picnic it seemed that nothing remained to do but mcfarlane said well now you youngsters wash up and pack whilst i reconnoiter the stock and with his saddle and bridle on his shoulder he went away down the trail  under berries direction wayland worked busily putting the camp equipment in proper parcels taking no special thought of time till the tent was down and folded the panniers filled and closed and the fire carefully covered then the girl said i hope the horses havent been stampeded there are bears in this valley and horses are afraid of bears father ought to have been back before this i hope they havent quit us  shall i go and see  no hell bring emif theyre in the land of the living he picketed his saddlehorse so hes not afoot nobody can teach him anything about trailing horses and besides you might get lost youd better keep close to camp  thereupon wayland put aside all responsibility lets see if we can catch some more fish he urged  to this she agreed and together they went again to the outlet of the lakewhere the trout could be seen darting to and fro on the clear dark floodand there cast their flies till they had secured ten goodsized fish  well stop now declared the girl i dont believe in being wasteful  once more at the camp they prepared the fish for the pan the sun suddenly burned hot and the lake was still as brass but great splendid leisurely gleaming clouds were sailing in from the west all centering about chief audobon and the experienced girl looked often at the sky i dont like the feel of the air see that gray cloud spreading out over the summits of the range that means something more than a shower i do hope daddy will overtake the horses before they cross the divide its going to pour up there  what can i do  nothing well stay right here and get dinner for him hell be hungry when he gets back  as they were unpacking the panniers and getting out the dishes thunder broke from the high crags above the lake and the girl called out  quick its going to rain we must reset the tent and get things under cover  once more he was put to shame by the decision the skill and the strength with which she went about reestablishing the camp she led he followed in every action in ten minutes the canvas was up the beds rolled the panniers protected the food stored safely but they were none too soon for the thick gray veil of rain which had clothed the loftiest crags for half an hour swung out over the waterleadengray under its foldsand with a roar which began in the tall pinesa roar which deepened hushed only when the thunder crashed resoundingly from crag to crestthe tempest fell upon the camp and the world of sun and odorous pine vanished almost instantly and a dark threatening and forbidding world took its place  but the young peoplehuddled close together beneath the tentwould have enjoyed the change had it not been for the thought of the supervisor i hope he took his slicker the girl said between the tearing ripping flashes of the lightning its raining hard up there  how quickly it came who would have thought it could rain like this after so beautiful a morning  it storms when it stormsin the mountains she responded with the sententious air of her father you never can tell what the sky is going to do up here it is probably snowing on the high divide looks now as though those cayuses pulled out sometime in the night and have hit the trail for home thats the trouble with stallfed stock theyll quit you any time they feel cold and hungry here comes the hail she shouted as a sharper more spiteful roar sounded far away and approaching now keep from under  what will your father do he called  dont worry about him hes at home any place theres a tree hes probably under a balsam somewhere waiting for this ice to spill out the only point is they may get over the divide and if they do it will be slippery coming back  for the first time the thought that the supervisor might not be able to return entered waylands mind but he said nothing of his fear  the hail soon changed to snow great clinging drowsy soft slowmoving flakes and with their coming the roar died away and the forest became as silent as a grave of bronze nothing moved save the thickfalling feathery frozen vapor and the world was again very beautiful and very mysterious  we must keep the fire going warned the girl it will be hard to start after this soaking  he threw upon the fire all of the wood which lay near and berrie taking the ax went to the big fir and began to chop off the dry branches which hung beneath working almost as effectively as a man wayland insisted on taking a turn with the tool but his efforts were so awkward that she laughed and took it away again youll have to take lessons in swinging an ax she said thats part of the job  gradually the storm lightened the snow changed back into rain and finally to mist but up on the heights the clouds still rolled wildly and through their openings the white drifts bleakly shone  its all in the trip said berrie you have to take the weather as it comes on the trail as the storm lessened she resumed the business of cooking the midday meal and at two oclock they were able to eat in comparative comfort though the unmelted snow still covered the trees and water dripped from the branches  isnt it beautiful exclaimed wayland with glowing boyish face the landscape is like a christmas card in its way its quite as beautiful as that golden forest we rode through  it wouldnt be so beautiful if you had to wallow through ten miles of it she sagely responded daddy will be wet to the skin for i found he didnt take his slicker however the sun may be out before night thats the way the thing goes in the hills  to the youth though the peaks were stormhid the afternoon was joyous berrie was a sweet companion under her supervision he practised at chopping wood and took a hand at cooking at her suggestion he stripped the tarpaulin from her fathers bed and stretched it over a rope before the tent thus providing a commodious kitchen and diningroom under this roof they sat and talked of everything except what they should do if the father did not return and as they talked they grew to even closer understanding  though quite unlearned of books she had something which was much more piquant than anything which theaters and novels could giveshe possessed a marvelous understanding of the natural world in which she lived as the companion of her father on many of his trips she had absorbed from him as well as from the forest a thousand observations of plant and animal life seemingly she had nothing of the womans fear of the wilderness she scarcely acknowledged any awe of it of the bears and other predatory beasts she spoke carelessly  bears are harmless if you let em alone she said and the mountainlion is a great big bluff he wont fight you cant make him fight but the mother lion will shes dangerous when she has cubsmost animals are i was out hunting grouse one day with a little twentytwo rifle when all at once as i looked up along a rocky point i was crossing i saw a mountainlion looking at me first i thought id let drive at him but the chances were against my getting him from there so i climbed up above himor where i thought he wasand while i was looking for him i happened to glance to my right and there he was about fifty feet away looking at me pleasant as you please didnt seem to be mad at allpeared like he was just wondering what id do next i jerked my gun into place but he faded away i crawled around to get behind him and just when i reached the ledge on which he had been standing a few minutes before i saw him just where id been he had traded places with me i began to have that creepy feeling he was so silent and so kind of pleasantlooking i got leery of him it just seemed like as though id dreamed him he didnt seem real  wayland shuddered you foolish girl why didnt you run  i did i began to figure then that this was a mother lion and that her cubs were close by and that she could just as well sneak up and drop on me from above as not so i got down and left her alone it was her popping up now here and now there like a ghost that locoed me i was sure scared  wayland did not enjoy this tale i never heard of such folly did your father learn of that adventure  yes i told him  didnt he forbid your hunting any more  no indeed why should he he just said it probably was a lioness and that it was just as well to let her alone he knows im no chicken  how about your motherdoes she approve of such expeditions  no mother worries more or less when im away but then she knows it dont do any good im taking all kinds of chances every day anyhow  he had to admit that she was better able to care for herself in the wilderness than most meneven western menand though he had not yet witnessed a display of her skill with a rifle he was ready to believe that she could shoot as well as her sire nevertheless he liked her better when engaged in purely feminine duties and he led the talk back to subjects concerning which her speech was less blunt and manlike  he liked her when she was joking for delicious little curves of laughter played about her lips she became very amusing as she told of her visits east and of her embarrassments in the homes of city friends i just have to own up that about all the schooling ive got is from the magazines sometimes i wish i had pulled out for town when i was about fourteen but you see i didnt feel like leaving mother and she didnt feel like letting me goand so i just got what i could at bear tooth she sprang up theres a patch of blue sky lets go see if we cant get a grouse  the snow had nearly all sunk into the ground on their level but it still lay deep on the heights above and the torn masses of vapor still clouded the range father has surely had to go over the divide she said as they walked down the path along the lake shore hell be late getting back and a plate of hot chicken will seem good to him  together they strolled along the edge of the willows the grouse come down to feed about this time she said well put up a covey soon  it seemed to him as though he were reliving the experiences of his ancestorsthe pioneers of michiganas he walked this wilderness with this intrepid huntress whose alert eyes took note of every moving thing she was delightfully unconscious of self of sex of any doubt or fear a lovely dianastrong and true and sweet  within a quarter of a mile they found their birds and she killed four with five shots this is all we need she said and i dont believe in killing for the sake of killing rangers should set good examples in way of game preservation they are deputy gamewardens in most states and good ones too  they stopped for a time on a high bank above the lake while the sunset turned the stormclouds into mountains of brass and iron with sulphurous caves and molten glowing ledges this grandiose picture lasted but a few minutes and then the western gates closed and all was again gray and forbidding open and shut is a sign of wet quoted berrie cheerily  the night rose formidably from the valley while they ate their supper but berrie remained tranquil those horses probably went clean back to the ranch if they did daddy cant possibly get back before eight oclock and he may not get back till tomorrow     vii  the walk in the rain   norcross with his city training was acutely conscious of the delicacy of the situation in his sisters circle a girl left alone in this way with a man would have been very seriously embarrassed but it was evident that berrie took it all joyously innocently their being together was something which had happened in the natural course of weather a condition for which they were in no way responsible therefore she permitted herself to be frankly happy in the charm of their enforced intimacy  she had never known a youth of his quality he was so considerate so refined so quick of understanding and so swift to serve he filled her mind to the exclusion of unimportant matters like the snow which was beginning again indeed her only anxiety concerned his health and as he toiled amid the falling flakes intent upon heaping up wood enough to last out the night she became solicitous  you will be soaked she warningly cried dont stay out any more come to the fire ill bring in the wood  something primeval some strength he did not know he possessed sustained him and he toiled on suppose this snow keeps falling he retorted the supervisor will not be able to get back tonightperhaps not for a couple of nights we will need a lot of fuel  he did not voice the fear of the storm which filled his thought but the girl understood it it wont be very cold she calmly replied it never is during these early blizzards and besides all we need to do is to drop down the trail ten miles and well be entirely out of it  ill feel safer with plenty of wood he argued but soon found it necessary to rest from his labors coming in to camp he seated himself beside her on a roll of blankets and so together they tended the fire and watched the darkness roll over the lake till the shining crystals seemed to drop from a measureless black arch soundless and oppressive the wind died away and the trees stood as if turned into bronze moveless save when a small branch gave way and dropped its rimy burden or a squirrel leaped from one top to another even the voice of the waterfall seemed muffled and remote  im a long way from home and mother wayland said with a smile buti like it  isnt it fun she responded in a way its nicer on account of the storm but you are not dressed right you should have waterproof boots you never can tell when you may be set afoot you should always go prepared for rain and snow and above all have an extra pair of thick stockings your feet are soaked now arent they  they are but your father told me to always dry my boots on my feet otherwise theyd shrink out of shape  thats right too but youd better take em off and wring out your socks or else put on dry ones  you insist on my playing the invalid he complained and that makes me angry when ive been over here a month youll find me a glutton for hardship i shall be a bear a grizzly fearful to contemplate my roar will affright you  she laughed like a child at his ferocity youll have to change a whole lot she said and drew the blanket closer about his shoulders just now your job is to keep warm and dry i hope you wont get lonesome over here  im not going to open a book or read a newspaper im not going to write to a single soul except you ill be obliged to report to you wont i  im not the supervisor  youre the next thing to it he quickly retorted youve been my board of health from the very first i should have fled for home long ago had it not been for you  her eyes fell under his glance youll get pretty tired of things over here its one of the lonesomest stations in the forest  ill get lonesome for you but not for the east this remark or rather the tone in which it was uttered brought another flush of consciousness to the girls face  what time is it now she asked abruptly  he looked at his watch half after eight  if father isnt on this side of the divide now he wont try to cross if hes coming down the slope hell be here in an hour although that trail is a tolerably tough proposition this minute a patch of dead timber on a dark night is sure a nuisance even to a good man he may not make it  shall i fire my gun  what for  as a signal to him  this amused her daddy dont need any hint about directionwhat he needs is a light to see the twist of the trail through those fallen logs  couldnt i rig up a torch and go to meet him  she put her hand on his arm you stay right here she commanded you couldnt follow that trail five minutes  you have a very poor opinion of my skill  no i havent but i know how hard it is to keep direction on a night like this and i dont want you wandering around in the timber father can take care of himself hes probably sitting under a big tree smoking his pipe before his fireor else hes at home he knows were all right and we are we have wood and grub and plenty of blankets and a roof over us you can make your bed under this fly she said looking up at the canvas it beats the old balsam as a roof you mustnt sleep cold again  i think id better sit up and keep the fire going he replied heroically theres a big log out there that im going to bring in to roll up on the windward side  itll be cold and wet early in the morning and i dont like to hunt kindling in the snow she said i always get everything ready the night before i wish you had a better bed it seems selfish of me to have the tent while you are cold  one by oneunder her supervisionhe made preparations for morning he cut some shavings from a dead dry branch of fir and put them under the fly and brought a bucket of water from the creek and then together they dragged up the dead tree  had the young man been other than he was the girls purity candor and selfreliance would have conquered him and when she withdrew to the little tent and let fall the frail barrier between them she was as safe from intrusion as if she had taken refuge behind gates of triple brass nothing in all his life had moved him so deeply as her solicitude her sweet trust in his honor and he sat long in profound meditation any man would be rich in the ownership of her love he admitted that he possessed her pity and her friendship he knew and he began to wonder if he had made a deeper appeal to her than this  can it be that i am really a man to her he thought i who am only a poor weakling whom the rain and snow can appall  then he thought of the effect of this night upon her life what would clifford belden do now to what deeps would his rage descend if he should come to know of it  berrie was serene twice she spoke from her couch to say youd better go to bed daddy cant get here till tomorrow now  ill stay up awhile yet my boots arent entirely dried out  as the flame sank low the cold bit and he built up the halfburned logs so that they blazed again he worked as silently as he could but the girl again spoke with sweet authority havent you gone to bed yet  oh yes ive been asleep i only got up to rebuild the fire  im afraid youre cold  im as comfortable as i deserve its all schooling you know please go to sleep again his teeth were chattering as he spoke but he added im all right  after a silence she said you must not get chilled bring your bed into the tent there is room for you  oh no that isnt necessary im standing it very well  youll be sick she urged in a voice of alarm please drag your bed inside the door what would i do if you should have pneumonia tomorrow you must not take any risk of a fever  the thought of a sheltered spot of something to break the remorseless wind overcame his scruples and he drew his bed inside the tent and rearranged it there  youre half frozen she said your teeth are chattering  it isnt so much the cold he stammered im tired  you poor boy she exclaimed and rose in her bed ill get up and heat some water for you  ill be all right in a few moments he said please go to sleep i shall be snug as a bug in a moment  she watched his shadowy motions from her bed and when at last he had nestled into his blankets she said if you dont lose your chill ill heat a rock and put at your feet  he was ready to cry out in shame of his weakness but he lay silent till he could command his voice then he said that would drive me from the country in disgrace think of what the fellows down below will say when they know of my cold feet  they wont hear of it and besides it is better to carry a hotwater bag than to be laid up with a fever  her anxiety lessened as his voice resumed its pleasant tenor flow dear girl he said no one could have been sweetermore like a guardian angel to me dont place me under any greater obligation go to sleep i am bettermuch better now  she did not speak for a few moments then in a voice that conveyed to him a knowledge that his words of endearment had deeply moved her she softly said good night  he heard her sigh drowsily thereafter once or twice and then she slept and her slumber redoubled in him his sense of guardianship of responsibility lying there in the shelter of her tent the whole situation seemed simple innocent and poetic but looked at from the standpoint of clifford belden it held an accusation  it cannot be helped he said the only thing we can do is to conceal the fact that we spent the night beneath this tent alone  in the belief that the way would clear with the dawn he too fell asleep while the fire sputtered and smudged in the fitful mountain wind  the second dawn came slowly as though crippled by the storm and walled back by the clouds gradually austerely the bleak white peaks began to define themselves above the firs the campbirds called cheerily from the wet branches which overhung the smoldering embers of the fire and so at last day was abroad in the sky  with a dull ache in his bones wayland crept out to the fire and set to work fanning the coals with his hat as he had seen the supervisor do he worked desperately till one of the embers began to angrily sparkle and to smoke then slipping away out of earshot he broke an armful of dry fir branches to heap above the wet charred logs soon these twigs broke into flame and berrie awakened by the crackle of the pine branches called out is it daylight  yes but its a very dark daylight dont leave your warm bed for the dampness and cold out here stay where you are ill get breakfast  how are you this morning did you sleep  fine  im afraid you had a bad night she insisted in a tone which indicated her knowledge of his suffering  camp life has its disadvantages he admitted as he put the coffeepot on the fire but im feeling better now i never fried a bird in my life but im going to try it this morning i have some water heating for your bath he put the soap towel and basin of hot water just inside the tent flap here it is im going to bathe in the lake i must show my hardihood  he heard her protesting as he went off down the bank but his heart was resolute im not dead yet he said grimly an invalid who can spend two such nights as these and still face a cold wind has some vitality in his bones after all  when he returned he found the girl full dressed alert and glowing but she greeted him with a touch of shyness and selfconsciousness new to her and her eyes veiled themselves before his glance  now where do you suppose the supervisor is he asked  i hope hes at home she replied quite seriously id hate to think of him camped in the high country without bedding or tent  oughtnt i to take a turn up the trail and see i feel guilty somehowi must do something  you cant help matters any by hoofing about in the mud no well just hold the fort till he comes thats what hell expect us to do  he submitted once more to the force of her argument and they ate breakfast in such intimacy and good cheer that the nights discomforts and anxieties counted for little as the sun broke through the clouds berrie hung out the bedding in order that its dampness might be warmed away  we may have to camp here again tonight she explained demurely  worse things could happen than that he gallantly answered i wouldnt mind a month of it only i shouldnt want it to rain or snow all the time  poor boy you did suffer didnt you i was afraid you would did you sleep at all she asked tenderly  oh yes after i came inside but of course i was more or less restless expecting your father to ride up and then its all rather exciting business to a novice i could hear all sorts of birds and beasts stepping and fluttering about i was scared in spite of my best resolution  thats funny i never feel that way i slept like a log after i knew you were comfortable you must have a better bed and more blankets its always cold up here  the sunlight was shortlived the clouds settled over the peaks and ragged wisps of gray vapor dropped down the timbered slopes of the prodigious amphitheater in which the lake lay again berrie made everything snug while her young woodsman toiled at bringing logs for the fire  in truth he was more elated than he had been since leaving school for he was not only doing a mans work in the world he was serving a woman in the immemorial way of the hewer of wood and the carrier of water his fatigue and the chill of the morning wore away and he took vast pride in dragging long poles down the hillside forcing berrie to acknowledge that he was astonishingly strong but dont overdo it she warned  at last fully provided for they sat contentedly side by side under the awning and watched the falling rain as it splashed and sizzled on the sturdy fire its a little like being shipwrecked on a desert island isnt it he said as if our boats had drifted away  at noon she again prepared an elaborate meal she served potatoes and grouse hot biscuit with sugar syrup and canned peaches and coffee done to just the right color and aroma he declared it wonderful and they ate with repeated wishes that the supervisor might turn up in time to share their feast but he did not then berrie said firmly now you must take a snooze you look tired  he was in truth not only drowsy but lame and tired therefore he yielded to her suggestion  she covered him with blankets and put him away like a child now you have a good sleep she said tenderly ill call you when daddy comes  with a delicious sense of her protecting care he lay for a few moments listening to the drip of the water on the tent then drifted away into peace and silence  when he woke the ground was again covered with snow and the girl was feeding the fire with wood which her own hands had supplied  hearing him stir she turned and fixed her eyes upon him with clear soft gaze how do you feel by now she asked  quite made over he replied rising alertly  his cheer however was only pretense he was greatly worried something has happened to your father he said his horse has thrown him or he has slipped and fallen his peace and exultation were gone how far is it down to the ranger station  about twelve miles  dont you think wed better close camp and go down there it is now three oclock we can walk it in five hours  she shook her head no i think wed better stay right here its a long hard walk and the trail is muddy  but dear girl he began desperately it wont do for us to camp herealonein this way another night what will cliff say  she flamed red then whitened i dont care what cliff thinksim done with himand no one that i really care about would blame us she was fully aware of his anxiety now it isnt our fault  it will be my fault if i keep you here longer he answered we must reach a telephone and send word out something may have happened to your father  im not worried a bit about him it may be that theres been a big snowfall up above usor else a windstorm the trail may be blocked but dont worry he may have to go round by lost lake pass she pondered a moment i reckon youre right wed better pack up and rack down the trail to the rangers cabin not on my account but on yours im afraid youve taken cold  im all right except im very lame but i am anxious to go on by the way is this ranger settle married  no his station is one of the lonesomest cabins on the forest no woman will stay there  this made wayland ponder nevertheless he decided well go after all the man is a forest officer and you are the supervisors daughter  she made no further protest but busied herself closing the panniers and putting away the camp utensils she seemed to recognize that his judgment was sound  it was after three when they left the tent and started down the trail carrying nothing but a few toilet articles  he stopped at the edge of the clearing should we have left a note for the supervisor  she pointed to their footprints theres all the writing he needs she assured him leading the way at a pace which made him ache she plashed plumply into the first puddle in the path no use dodging em she called over her shoulder and he soon saw that she was right  the trees were dripping the willows heavy with water and the mud ankledeepin placesbut she pushed on steadily and he following in her tracks could only marvel at her strength and sturdy selfreliance the swing of her shoulders the poise of her head and the lithe movement of her waist made his own body seem a poor thing  for two hours they zigzagged down a narrow cañon heavily timbered with fir and sprucea dark stern avenue crossed by roaring streams and filled with frequent boggy meadows whereon the water lay midleg deep  well get out of this very soon she called cheerily  by degrees the gorge widened grew more open more genial aspen thickets of palegold flashed upon their eyes like sunlight and grassy bunches afforded firmer footing but on the slopes their feet slipped and slid painfully still berea kept her stride we must get to the middle fork before dark she stopped to explain for i dont know the trail down there and theres a lot of down timber just above the station now that were cut loose from our camp i feel nervous as long as i have a tent i am all right but now we are in the open i worry how are you standing it she studied him with keen and anxious glance her hand upon his arm  fine as a fiddle he replied assuming a spirit he did not possess but you are marvelous i thought cowgirls couldnt walk  i can do anything when i have to she replied weve got three hours more of it and she warningly exclaimed look back there  they had reached a point from which the range could be seen and behold it was covered deep with a seamless robe of new snow  thats why dad didnt get back last night hes probably wallowing along up there this minute and she set off again with resolute stride waylands pale face and labored breath alarmed her she was filled with love and pity but she pressed forward desperately  as he grew tired waylands boots loaded with mud became fetters and every slope greasy with mire seemed an almost insurmountable barricade he fell several times but made no outcry i will not add to her anxiety he said to himself  at last they came to the valley floor over which a devastating fire had run some years before and which was still covered with fallen trees in desolate confusion here the girl made her first mistake she kept on toward the river although wayland called attention to a trail leading to the right up over the low grassy hills for a mile the path was clear but she soon found herself confronted by an endless maze of blackened treetrunks and at last the path ended abruptly  dismayed and halting she said weve got to go back to that trail which branched off to the right i reckon that was the highland trail which settle made to keep out of the swamp i thought it was a trail from cameron peak but it wasnt back we go  she was suffering keenly now not on her own account but on his for she could see that he was very tired and to climb up that hill again was like punishing him a second time  when she picked up the blazed trail it was so dark that she could scarcely follow it but she felt her way onward turning often to be sure that he was following once she saw him fall and cried out its a shame to make you climb this hill again its all my fault i ought to have known that that lower road led down into the timber  standing close beside him in the darkness knowing that he was weary wet and ill she permitted herself the expression of her love and pity putting her arm about him she drew his cheek against her own saying poor boy your hands are cold as ice she took them in her own warm clasp oh i wish we had never left the camp what does it matter what people say then she broke down and wailed i shall never forgive myself if you her voice failed her  illustration she found herself confronted by an endless maze of blackened treetrunks  he bravely reassured her im not defeated im just tired thats all i can go on  but you are shaking  that is merely a nervous chill im good for another hour its better to keep moving anyhow  she thrust her hand under his coat and laid it over his heart you are tired out she said and there was anguish in her voice your heart is pounding terribly you mustnt do any more climbing and hark theres a wolf  he listened i hear him but we are both armed theres no danger from wild animals  come she said instantly recovering her natural resolution we cant stand here the station cant be far away we must go on     viii  the other girl   the girls voice stirred the benumbed youth into action again and he followed her mechanically his slender stock of physical strength was almost gone but his will remained unbroken at every rough place she came back to him to support him to hearten him and so he crept on through the darkness falling often stumbling against the trees slipping and sliding till at last his guide pitching down a sharp slope came directly upon a wire fence  glory be she called here is a fence and the cabin should be near although i see no light hello tony  no voice replied and keeping waylands hand she felt her way along the fence till it revealed a gate then she turned toward the roaring of the stream which grew louder as they advanced the cabin is near the falls that much i know she assured him then a moment later she joyfully cried out here it is  out of the darkness a blacker sharper shadow rose again she called but no one answered the ranger is away she exclaimed in a voice of indignant alarm i do hope he left the door unlocked  too numb with fatigue and too dazed by the darkness to offer any aid wayland waitedswaying unsteadily on his feetwhile she tried the door it was bolted and with but a moments hesitation she said it looks like a case of breaking and entering ill try a window the windows too were securely fastened after trying them all she came back to where wayland stood tony didnt intend to have anybody pushing in she decided but if the windows will not raise they will smash  a crash of glass followed and with a feeling that it was all part of a dream wayland waited while the girl made way through the broken sash into the dark interior her next utterance was a cry of joy oh but its nice and warm in here i cant open the door youll have to come in the same way i did  he was too weak and too irresolute to respond immediately and reaching out she took him by the arms and dragged him across the sill her strength seemed prodigious a delicious warmth a grateful dryness a sense of shelter enfolded him like a garment the place smelled deliciously of food of fire of tobacco  leading him toward the middle of the room berrie said stand here till i strike a light  as her match flamed up norcross found himself in a roughwalled cabin in which stood a square cookstove a rude table littered with dishes and three stools made of slabs it was all very rude but it had all the value of a palace at the moment  the girls quick eye saw much else she located an oillamp some pinewood and a corner cupboard in a few moments the lamp was lit the stove refilled with fuel and she was stripping waylands wet coat from his back cheerily discoursing as she did so heres one of tonys old jackets put that on while i see if i cant find some dry stockings for you sit right down here by the stove put your feet in the oven ill have a fire in a jiffy there thats right now ill start the coffeepot she soon found the coffee but it was unground wonder where he keeps his coffeemill she rummaged about for a few minutes then gave up the search well no matter heres the coffee and heres a hammer one of the laws of the trail is this if you cant do a thing one way do it another  she poured the coffee beans into an empty tomatocan and began to pound them with the end of the hammer handle laughing at waylands look of wonder and admiration necessity sure is the mother of invention out here how do you feel by now isnt it nice to own a roof and four walls im going to close up that window as soon as i get the coffee started are you warming up  oh yes im all right now he replied but he didnt look it and her own cheer was rather forced he was in the grasp of a nervous chill and she was deeply apprehensive of what the result of his exposure might be it seemed as if the coffee would never come to a boil  i depend on that to brace you up she said  after hanging a blanket over the broken window she set out some cold meat and a half dozen bakingpowder biscuits which she found in the cupboard and as soon as the coffee was ready she poured it for him but she would not let him leave the fire she brought his supper to him and sat beside him while he ate and drank  you must go right to bed she urged as she studied his weary eyes you ought to sleep for twentyfour hours  the hot strong coffee revived him physically and brought back a little of his courage and he said im ashamed to be such a weakling  now hush she commanded its not your fault that you are weak now while i am eating my supper you slip off your wet clothes and creep into tonys bunk and ill fill one of these syrupcans with hot water to put at your feet  it was of no use for him to protest against her further care she insisted and while she ate he meekly carried out her instructions and from the delicious warmth and security of his bed watched her moving about the stove till the shadows of the room became one with the dusky figures of his sleep  a moment later something falling on the floor woke him with a start and looking up he found the sun shining and berrie confronting him with anxious face did i waken you she asked im awfully sorry im trying to be extra quiet i dropped a pan how do you feel this morning  he pondered this question a moment is it tomorrow or the next week  she laughed happily its only the next day just keep where you are till the sun gets a little higher she drew near and put a hand on his brow you dont feel feverish oh i hope this trip hasnt set you back  he laid his hands together and then felt of his pulse i dont seem to have a temperature i just feel lazy limp and lazy but im going to get up if youll just leave the room for a moment  dont try it now wait till you have had your breakfast youll feel stronger then  he yielded again to the force of her will and fell back into a luxurious drowse hearing the stove roar and the bacon sizzle in the pan there was something primitive and broadly poetic in the girls actions through the haze of the kitchen smoke she enlarged till she became the typical frontier wife the goddess of the skillet and the coffeepot the consort of the pioneer equally skilled with the rifle and the rollingpin how many millions of times had this scene been enacted on the long march of the borderman from the susquehanna to the bear tooth range  into his epic vision the pitiful absurdity of his own part in the play broke like a sad discord of course it is not my fault that i am a weakling he argued only it was foolish for me to thrust myself into this stern world if i come safely out of this adventure i will go back to the sheltered places where i belong  at this point came again the disturbing realization that this night of struggle and the ministrations of his brave companion had involved him deeper in a mesh from which honorable escape was almost impossible the rangers cabin so far from being an end of their compromising intimacy had added and was still adding to the weight of evidence against them both the presence of the ranger or the supervisor himself could not now save berea from the gossips  she brought his breakfast to him and sat beside him while he ate chatting the while of their good fortune it is glorious outside and i am sure daddy will get across today and tony is certain to turn up before noon he probably went down to coal city to get his mail  i must get up at once he said in a panic of fear and shame the supervisor must not find me laid out on my back please leave me alone for a moment  she went out closing the door behind her and as he crawled from his bed every muscle in his body seemed to cry out against being moved nevertheless he persisted and at last succeeded in putting on his clothes even his shoesthough he found tying the laces the hardest task of alland he was at the washbasin bathing his face and hands when berrie hurriedly reentered some tourists are coming she announced in an excited tone a party of five or six people a woman among them is just coming down the slope now who do you suppose it can be it would be just our luck if it should turn out to be some one from the mill  he divined at once the reason for her dismay the visit of a woman at this moment would not merely embarrass them both it would torture berrie what is to be done he asked roused to alertness  nothing all we can do is to stand pat and act as if we belonged here  very well he replied moving stiffly toward the door heres where i can be of some service i am an excellent white liar  as our hero crawled out into the brilliant sunshine some part of his courage came back to him though lame in every muscle he was not ill that was the surprising thing his head was clear and his breath full and deep my lungs are all right he said to himself im not going to collapse and he looked round him with a newborn admiration of the wooded hills which rose in somber majesty on either side the roaring stream how different it all looks this morning he said remembering the deep blackness of the night  the beat of hoofs upon the bridge drew his attention to the cavalcade which the keen eyes of the girl had detected as it came over the ridge to the east the party consisted of two men and two women and three packhorses completely outfitted for the trail  one of the women spurring her horse to the front rode serenely up to where wayland stood and called out good morning are you the ranger  no im only the guard the ranger has gone down the trail  he perceived at once that the speaker was an alien like himself for she wore tancolored ridingboots a divided skirt of expensive cloth and a jaunty widerimmed sombrero she looked indeed precisely like the heroine of the prevalent western drama her sleeves rolled to the elbow disclosed shapely brown arms and her neck bare to her bosom was equally sunsmit but she was so roundcheeked so childishly charming that the most critical observer could find no fault with her makeup  one of the men rode up hello norcross what are you doing over here  the youth smiled blandly good morning mr belden im serving my apprenticeship im in the service now  the mischief you are exclaimed the other wheres tony  gone for his mail hell return soon what are you doing over here may i ask  im here as guide to mr moore mr moore this is norcross one of mcfarlanes men mr moore is connected with the tiecamp operations of the railway  moore was a tall thin man with a gray beard and keen blue eyes wheres mcfarlane we were to meet him here didnt he come over with you  we started together but the horses got away and he was obliged to go back after them he also is likely to turn up soon  i am frightfully hungry interrupted the girl cant you hand me out a hunk of bread and meat weve been riding since daylight  berrie suddenly appeared at the door sure thing she called out slide down and come in  moore removed his hat and bowed good morning miss mcfarlane i didnt know you were here you know my daughter siona  berrie nodded coldly ive met her  he indicated the other woman and mrs belden of course you know  mrs belden the fourth member of the party a middleaged rather flabby person just being eased down from her horse turned on berrie with a battery of questions good lord berrie mcfarlane what are you doing over in this forsaken hole wheres your dad and where is tony if cliff had known you was over here hed have come too  berrie retained her selfpossession come in and get some coffee and well straighten things out  apparently mrs belden did not know that cliff and berrie had quarreled for she treated the girl with maternal familiarity she was a goodnatured wellintentioned old sloven but a most renowned tattler and the girl feared her more than she feared any other woman in the valley she had always avoided her but she showed nothing of this dislike at the moment  wayland drew the younger womans attention by saying its plain that you like myself do not belong to these parts miss moore  what makes you think so she brightly queried  your costume is too appropriate havent you noticed that the women who live out here carefully avoid convenient and artistic dress now your outfit is precisely what they should wear and dont  this amused her i know but they all say they have to wear out their sunday gotomeeting clothes whereas i can rag out proper im glad you like my rig  when i look at you he said im back on old broadway at the herald square theater the play is little blossom or the cowgirls revenge the heroine has just come into the miners cabin  oh go long she replied seizing her cue and speaking in character youre stringin me  not on your life your outfit is a peacherino he declared i am glad you rode by  at the moment he was bent on drawing the girls attention from berrie but as she went on he came to like her she said no i dont belong here but i come out every year during vacation with my father i love this country its so big and wide and wild father has built a little bungalow down at the lower mill and we enjoy every day of our stay  youre a smith girl he abruptly asserted  what makes you think so  oh theres something about you smith girls that gives you dead away  gives us away i like that  my phrase was unfortunate i like smith girls he hastened to say and in five minutes they were on the friendliest termstalking of mutual acquaintancesa fact which both puzzled and hurt berea their laughter angered her and whenever she glanced at them and detected siona looking into waylands face with coquettish simper she was embittered she was glad when moore came in and interrupted the dialogue  norcross did not relax though he considered the dangers of crossexamination almost entirely passed in this he was mistaken for no sooner was the keen edge of mrs beldens hunger dulled than her curiosity sharpened  where did you say the supervisor was she repeated  the horses got away and he had to go back after them again responded berrie who found the scrutiny of the other girl deeply disconcerting  when do you expect him back  any minute now she replied and in this she was not deceiving them although she did not intend to volunteer any information which might embarrass either wayland or herself  norcross tried to create a diversion isnt this a charming valley  siona took up the cue isnt it its romantic enough to be the backdrop in a bret harte play i love it  moore turned to wayland i know a norcross a michigan lumberman vicepresident of the association is he by any chance a relative  only a father retorted wayland with a smile but dont hold me responsible for anything he has done we seldom agree  moores manner changed abruptly indeed and what is the son of w w norcross doing out here in the forest service  the change in her fathers tone was not lost upon siona who ceased her banter and studied the young man with deeper interest while mrs belden detecting some restraint in berries tone renewed her questioning where did you camp last night  right here  i dont see how the horses got away theres a pasture here for we rode right through it  berrie was aware that each moment of delay in explaining the situation looked like evasion and deepened the significance of her predicament and yet she could not bring herself to the task of minutely accounting for her time during the last two days  belden came to her relief well well well have to be moving on were going into camp at the mouth of the west fork he said as he rose tell tony and the supervisor that we want to line out that timber at the earliest possible moment  siona who was now distinctly coquetting with wayland held out her hand i hope youll find time to come up and see us i know we have other mutual friends if we had time to get at them  his answer was humorous i am a soldier i am on duty im not at all sure that i shall have a moments leave but i will call if i can possibly do so  they started off at last without having learned in detail anything of the intimate relationship into which the supervisors daughter and young norcross had been thrown and mrs belden was still so much in the dark that she called to berrie im going to send word to cliff that you are over here hell be crazy to come the minute he finds it out  dont do that protested berrie  wayland turned to berrie that would be pleasant he said smilingly  but she did not return his smile on the contrary she remained very grave i wish that old talebearer had kept away shes going to make trouble for us all and that girl isnt she a spectacle i never could bear her  why whats wrong with her she seems a very nice sprightly person  shes a regular play actor i dont like madeup people why does she go around with her sleeves rolled up that way andand her dress open at the throat  oh those are the affectations of the moment she wants to look tough and boisterous thats the fad with all the girls just now its only a harmless piece of foolishness  she could not tell him how deeply she resented his ready tone of camaraderie with the other girl but she was secretly suffering it hurt her to think that he could forget his aches and be so free and easy with a stranger at a moments notice under the influence of that girls smile he seemed to have quite forgotten his exhaustion and his pain it was wonderful how cheerful he had been while she was in sight  in all this berrie did him an injustice he had been keenly conscious during every moment of the time not only of his bodily ills but of berrie and he had kept a brave face in order that he might prevent further questioning on the part of a malicious girl it was his only way of being heroic now that the crisis was passed he was quite as much of a wreck as ever  a new anxiety beset her i hope they wont happen to meet father on the trail  perhaps i should go with them and warn him  oh it doesnt matter she wearily answered old mrs belden will never rest till she finds out just where weve been and just what weve done shes that kind she knows everything that goes on  he understood her fear and yet he was unable to comfort her in the only way she could be comforted that brief encounter with siona moorea girl of his own worldhad made all thought of marriage with berea suddenly absurd without losing in any degree the sense of gratitude he felt for her protecting care and with full acknowledgment of her heroic support of his faltering feet he revolted from putting into words a proposal of marriage i love her he confessed to himself and she is a dear brave girl but i do not love her as a man should love the woman he is to marry  a gray shadow had plainly fallen between them berea sensed the change in his attitude and traced it to the influence of the coquette whose smiling eyes and bared arms had openly challenged admiration it saddened her to think that one so fine as he had seemed could yield even momentary tribute to an open and silly coquette     ix  further perplexities   wayland for his part was not deceived by siona moore he knew her kind and understood her method of attack he liked her pert ways for they brought back his days at college when dozens of just such misses lent grace and humor and romance to the tennis court and to the football field she carried with her the aroma of carefree athletic girlhood flirtation was in her as charming and almost as meaningless as the preening of birds on the bank of a pool in the meadow  speaking aloud he said miss moore travels the trail with all known accessories and ive no doubt she thinks she is a grand campaigner but i am wondering how she would stand such a trip as that you took last night i dont believe she could have done as well as i shes the imitationyoure the real thing  the praise involved in this speech brought back a little of berries humor i reckon those brown boots of hers would have melted she said with quaint smile  he became very grave if it had not been for you dear girl i would be lying up there in the forest this minute nothing but your indomitable spirit kept me moving i shall be deeply hurt if any harm comes to you on account of me  if it hadnt been for me you wouldnt have started on that trip last night it was perfectly useless it would have been better for us both if we had stayed in camp for we wouldnt have met these people  thats true he replied but we didnt know that at the time we acted for the best and we must not blame ourselves no matter what comes of it  they fell silent at this point for each was again conscious of their new relationship she vaguely suffering waited for him to resume the lovers tone while he oppressed by the sense of his own shortcomings and weakness was planning an escape its all nonsense my remaining in the forest im not fitted for it its too severe ill tell mcfarlane so and get out  perceiving his returning weakness and depression berea insisted on his lying down again while she set to work preparing dinner there is no telling when father will get here she said and tony will be hungry when he comes lie down and rest  he obeyed her silently and going to the bunk at once fell asleep how long he slept he could not tell but he was awakened by the voice of the ranger who was standing in the doorway and regarding berrie with a roundeyed stare  he was a tall awkward fellow of about thirtyfive plainly of the frontier type but a man of intelligence at the end of a brief explanation berrie said with an air of authority now youd better ride up the trail and bring our camp outfit down we cant go back that way anyhow  the ranger glanced toward wayland all right miss berrie but perhaps your tenderfoot needs a doctor  wayland rose painfully but resolutely oh no i am not sick im a little lame thats all ill go along with you  no said berrie decisively youre not well enough for that get up your horses tony and by that time ill have some dinner ready  all right miss berrie replied the man and turned away  hardly had he crossed the bridge on his way to the pasture when berrie cried out there comes daddy  wayland joined her at the door and stood beside her watching the supervisor as he came zigzagging down the steep hill to the east with all his horses trailing behind him roped together headtotail  hes had to come round by lost lake she exclaimed hell be tired out and absolutely starved wahoo she shouted in greeting and the supervisor waved his hand  there was something superb in the calm seat of the veteran as he slid down the slope he kept his place in the saddle with the air of the rider to whom hunger fatigue windfalls and snowslides were all a part of the days work and when he reined in before the door and dropped from his horse he put his arm about his daughters neck with quiet word i thought id find you here how is everything  all right daddy but what about you where have you been  clean back to mill park the blamed cayuses kept just ahead of me all the way  poor old dad and on top of that came the snow  yes and a whole hatful i couldnt get back over the high pass had to go round by lost lake and to cap all old baldy took a notion not to lead oh ive had a peach of a time but here i am have you seen moore and his party  yes theyre in camp up the trail he and alec belden and two women are you hungry  he turned a comical glance upon her am i hungry sister i am a wolf norcross take my horses down to the pasture  she hastened to interpose let me do that daddy mr norcross is badly used up you see we started down here late yesterday afternoon it was raining and horribly muddy and i took the wrong trail the darkness caught us and we didnt reach the station till nearly midnight  wayland acknowledged his weakness i guess i made a mistake supervisor im not fitted for this strenuous life  mcfarlane was quick to understand i didnt intend to pitchfork you into the forest life quite so suddenly he said dont give up yet awhile youll harden to it  here comes tony said berrie hell look after the ponies  nevertheless wayland went out believing that berrie wished to be alone with her father for a short time  as he took his seat mcfarlane said you stayed in camp till yesterday afternoon did you  yes we were expecting you every moment  he saw nothing in this to remark upon did it snow at the lake  yes a little it mostly rained  it stormed up on the divide like a january blizzard when did moore and his party arrive  about ten oclock this morning  ill ride right up and see them what about the outfit thats at the lake i reckon  yes i was just sending tony after it but father if you go up to moores camp dont say too much about what has happened dont tell them just when you took the backtrail and just how long wayland and i were in camp  why not  she reddened with confusion becauseyou know what an old gossip mrs belden is i dont want her to know shes an awful talker and our being together up there all that time will give her a chance  a light broke in on the supervisors brain in the midst of his preoccupation as a forester he suddenly became the father his eyes narrowed and his face darkened thats so the old rip could make a whole lot of capital out of your being left in camp that way at the same time i dont believe in dodging the worst thing we could do would be to try to blind the trail was tony here last night when you came  no he was down the valley after his mail  his face darkened again thats another piece of bad luck too how much does the old woman know at present  nothing at all  didnt she crossexamine you  sure she did but wayland sidetracked her of course it only delays things shell know all about it sooner or later shes great at putting two and two together two and two with her always make five  mcfarlane mused cliff will be plumb crazy if she gets his ear first  i dont care anything about cliff daddy i dont care what he thinks or does if he will only let wayland alone  see here daughter you do seem to be terribly interested in this tourist  hes the finest man i ever knew father  he looked at her with tender trusting glance he isnt your kind daughter hes a nice clean boy but hes different he dont belong in our world hes only just stopping here dont forget that  im not forgetting that daddy i know hes different thats why i like him after a pause she added nobody could have been nicer all through these days than he has been he was like a brother  mcfarlane fixed a keen glance upon her has he said anything to you did you come to an understanding  her eyes fell not the way you mean daddy but i think helikes me but do you know who he is hes the son of w w norcross that big michigan lumberman  mcfarlane started how do you know that  mr moore asked him if he was any relation to ww norcross and he said yes a son you should have seen how that moore girl changed her tune the moment he admitted that shed been very free with him up to that time but when she found out he was a rich mans son she became as quiet and innocent as a kitten i hate her shes a deceitful snip  well now daughter that being the case its all the more certain that he dont belong to our world and you mustnt fix your mind on keeping him here  a girl cant help fixing her mind daddy  or changing it he smiled a little you used to like cliff you liked him well enough to promise to marry him  i know i did but i despise him now  poor cliff he isnt so much to blame after all any man is likely to flare out when he finds another fellow cutting in ahead of him why here you are wanting to kill siona moore just for making up to your young tourist  but thats different  he laughed of course it is but the thing weve got to guard against is old lady beldens tongue she and that belden gang have it in for me and all that has kept them from open war has been cliffs relationship to you theyll take a keen delight in making the worst of all this camping business mcfarlane was now very grave i wish your mother was here this minute i guess we had better cut out this timber cruise and go right back  no you mustnt do that that would only make more talk go on with your plans ill stay here with you it wont take you but a couple of days to do the work and wayland needs the rest  but suppose cliff hears of this business between you and norcross and comes galloping over the ridge  well let him he has no claim on me  he rose uneasily its all mighty risky business and its my fault i should never have permitted you to start on this trip  dont you worry about me daddy ill pull through somehow anybody that knows me will understand how little there is inin old lady beldens gab ive had a beautiful trip and i wont let her nor anybody else spoil it for me  mcfarlane was not merely troubled he was distracted he was afraid to meet the beldens he dreaded their questions their innuendoes he had perfect faith in his daughters purity and honesty and he liked and trusted norcross and yet he knew that should belden find it to his advantage to slander these young people and to read into their action the lawlessness of his own youth bereas reputation high as it was would suffer and her mothers heart be rent with anxiety in his growing pain and perplexity he decided to speak frankly to young norcross himself hes a gentleman and knows the way of the world perhaps hell have some suggestion to offer in his heart he hoped to learn that wayland loved his daughter and wished to marry her  wayland was down on the bridge leaning over the rail listening to the song of the water  mcfarlane approached gravely but when he spoke it was in his usual soft monotone mr norcross he began with candid inflection i am very sorry to say it but i wish you and my daughter had never started on this trip  i know what you mean supervisor and i feel as you do about it of course none of us foresaw any such complication as this but now that we are snarled up in it well have to make the best of it no one of us is to blame it was all accidental  the youths frank words and his sympathetic voice disarmed mcfarlane completely even the slight resentment he felt melted away its no use saying if he remarked at length what weve got to meet is seth beldens reportberrie has cut loose from cliff and hes redheaded already when he drops onto this story when he learns that i had to chase back after the horses and that you and berrie were alone together for three days hell have a fine club to swing and hell swing it and alec will help him theyre all waiting a chance to get me and theyre mean enough to get me through my girl  what can i do asked wayland  mcfarlane pondered ill try to head off marm belden and ill have a talk with moore hes a pretty reasonable chap  but you forget theres another talebearer moores daughter is with them  thats so id forgotten her good lord we are in for it theres no use trying to cover anything up  here was the place for norcross to speak up and say never mind im going to ask berrie to be my wife but he couldnt do it something rose in his throat which prevented speech a strange repugnance a kind of sullen resentment at being forced into a declaration kept him silent and mcfarlane disappointed wondering and hurt kept silence also  norcross was the first to speak of course those who know your daughter will not listen for an instant to the story of an unclean old thing like mrs belden  im not so sure about that replied the father gloomily people always listen to such stories and a girl always gets the worst of a situation like this berries been brought up to take care of herself and shes kept clear of criticism so far but with cliff on edge and this old rip snooping around his mind suddenly changed your being the son of a rich man wont help any why didnt you tell me who you were  i didnt think it necessary what difference does it make i have nothing to do with my fathers business his notions of forest speculation are not mine  it would have made a difference with me and it might have made a difference with berrie she mightnt have been so free with you at the start if shed known who you were you looked sick and kind of lonesome and that worked on her sympathy  i was sick and i was lonesome and she has been very sweet and lovely to me and it breaks my heart to think that her kindness and your friendship should bring all this trouble and suspicion upon her lets go up to the moore camp and have it out with them ill make any statement you think best  i reckon the less said about it the better responded the older man im going up to the camp but not to talk about my daughter  how can you help it theyll force the topic  if they do ill force them to let it alone retorted mcfarlane but he went away disappointed and sorrowful the young mans evident avoidance of the subject of marriage hurt him he did not perceive as norcross did that to make an announcement of his daughters engagement at this moment would be taken as a confession of shameful need it is probable that berrie herself would not have seen this further complication  each hour added to waylands sense of helplessness and bitterness i am in a trap i can neither help berrie nor help myself nothing remains for me but flight and flight will also be a confession of guilt  once again and in far more definite terms he perceived the injustice of the world toward women here with berrie as in ages upon ages of other times the maiden must bear the burden of reproach in me it will be considered a joke a romantic episode in her a degrading misdemeanor and yet what can i do  when he reentered the cabin the supervisor had returned from the camp and something in his manner as well as in berries revealed the fact that the situation had not improved  they forced me into a corner mcfarlane said to wayland peevishly i lied out of one night but they know that you were here last night of course they were respectful enough so long as i had an eye on them but their tongues are wagging now  the rest of the evening was spent in talk on the forest and in going over the rangers books for the supervisor continued to plan for waylands stay at this station and the young fellow thought it best not to refuse at the moment  as bedtime drew near settle took a blanket and went to the corral and berrie insisted that her father and wayland occupy the bunk  norcross protested but the supervisor said let her alone shes better able to sleep on the floor than either of us  this was perfectly true but in spite of his bruised and aching body the youth would gladly have taken her place beside the stove it seemed pitifully unjust that she should have this physical hardship in addition to her uneasiness of mind     x  the camp on the pass   berea suffered a restless night the most painful and broken she had known in all her life she acknowledged that siona moore was prettier and that she stood more nearly on waylands plane than herself but the realization of this fact did not bring surrendershe was not of that temper all her life she had been called upon to combat the elements to hold her own amidst rude men and inconsiderate women and she had no intention of yielding her place to a pert coquette no matter what the gossips might say she had seen this girl many times but had refused to visit her house she had held her in contempt now she quite cordially hated her  she shall not have her way with wayland she decided i know what she wantsshe wants him at her side tomorrow but i will not have it so she is trying to get him away from me  the more she dwelt on this the hotter her jealous fever burned the floor on which she lay was full of knots she could not lose herself in sleep tired as she was the planks no longer turned their soft spots to her flesh and she rolled from side to side in torment she would have arisen and dressed only she did not care to disturb the men the night seemed interminable  her plan of action was simple i shall go home the morrow and take wayland with me i will not have him going with that girlthats settled the very thought of his taking sionas hand in greeting angered her beyond reason  she had put cliff belden completely out of her mind and this was characteristic of her she had no divided interests no subtleties no subterfuges forthright hotblooded frank and simple she had centered all her care all her desires on this pale youth whose appeal was at once mystic and maternal but her pity was changing to something deeper for she was convinced that he was gaining in strength that he was in no danger of relapse the hard trip of the day before had seemingly done him no permanent injury on the contrary a few hours rest had almost restored him to his normal self tomorrow he will be able to ride again and this thought reconciled her to her hard bed she did not look beyond the long delicious day which they must spend in returning to the springs  she fell asleep at last and was awakened only by her father tinkering about the stove  she rose alertly signing to the supervisor not to disturb her patient  however norcross also heard the rattle of the poker opened his eyes and regarded berrie with sleepy smile good morning if it is morning he said slowly  she laughed back at him its almost sunup  you dont tell me how could i have overslept like this makes me think of the irishman who upon being awakened to an early breakfast like this ate it then said to his employer an extra thrifty farmer two suppers in wan nightand hurrah for bed again  this amused her greatly its too bad i hope you got some sleep  all there was time for his voice changed i feel like a houndpup to be snoring on a downy couch like this while you were roughing it on the floor how did i come to do it its shameful  dont worry about me how are you feeling this morning  he stretched and yawned fine that is im sore here and there but im feeling wonderfully well do you know i begin to hope that i can finally dominate the wilderness wouldnt it be wonderful if i got so i could ride and walk as you do for instance the fact that im not dead this morning is encouraging he drew on his shoes as he talked while she went about her toilet which was quite as simple as his own she had spent two nights in her day dress with almost no bathing facilities but that didnt trouble her it was a part of the game she washed her face and hands in settles tin basin but drew the line at his rubber comb  there was a distinct charm in seeing her thus adapting herself to the cabin a charm quite as powerful as that which emanated from siona moores dainty and theatrical personality what it was he could not define but the foresters daughter had something primeval about her something close to the soil something which aureoles the old saxon wordswife and home and fireplace seeing her through the savory steam of the bacon she was frying he forgot her marvelous skill as horsewoman and pathfinder and thought of her only as the housewife she belonged here in this cabin she was fitted to this landscape whereas the other woman was alien and dissonant  he moved his arms about and shook his legs with comical effect of trying to see if they were still properly hinged its miraculous im not lame at all no one can accuse me of being a lunger now last nights sleep has made a new man of me ive met the forest and it is mine  she beamed upon him with happy pride im mighty glad to hear you say that i was terribly afraid that long hard walk in the rain had been too much for you i reckon youre all right for the work now  he recalled as she spoke her anguish of pity while they stood in the darkness of the trail and it seemed that he could go no farther and he said soberly it must have seemed to you one while as if i were all in i felt that way myself i was numb from head to heel i couldnt have gone another mile  her face clouded with retrospective pain you mustnt try any more such stuntsnot for a few weeks anyway but get ready for breakfast  he went out into the morning exultantly and ran down to the river to bathe his face and hands allured by its splendid voice the world seemed very bright and beautiful and healthgiving once more  as soon as she was alone with her father berrie said im going home today dad  going home what for  ive had enough of it  he glanced at her bed on the floor i cant say i blame you any this has been a rough trip but well go up and bring down the outfit and then we men can sleep in the tent and let you have the bunkyoull be comfortable tonight  oh i dont mind sleeping on the floor she replied but i want to get back i dont want to meet those women another thing youd better use mr norcross at the springs instead of leaving him here with tony  why so  well he isnt quite well enough to run the risk its a long way from here to a doctor  he pears to be on deck this morning besides i havent anything in the office to offer him  then send him up to meeker landon needs help and hes a better forester than tony anyway  how about cliff he may make trouble  her face darkened cliff will reach him if he wants tono matter where he is and then too landon likes mr norcross and will see that he is not abused  mcfarlane ruminated over her suggestion well knowing that she was planning this change in order that she might have norcross a little nearer a little more accessible  i dont know but youre right landon is almost as good a hustler as tony and a much better forester i thought of sending norcross up there at first but he told me that frank and his gang had it in for him of course hes only nominally in the service but i want him to begin right  berrie went further i want him to ride back with me today  he looked at her with grave inquiry do you think that a wise thing to do wont that make more talk  well start early and ride straight through  youll have to go by lost lake and that means a long hard hike can he stand it  oh yes he rides well its the walking at a high altitude that does him up furthermore cliff may turn up here and i dont want another mixup  mcfarlane was troubled i ought to go back with you but moore is over here to line out a cutting and i must stay on for a couple of days suppose i send tony along  no tony would be a nuisance and would do no good another day on the trail wont add to mrs beldens story if she wants to be mean shes got all the material for it already  in the end she had her way mcfarlane perceiving that she had set her heart on this ride and having perfect faith in her skill and judgment on the trail finally said well if you do so the quicker you start the better with the best of luck you cant pull in before eight oclock and youll have to ride hard to do that  if i find we cant make it ill pull into a ranch but im sure we can  when wayland came in the supervisor inquired do you feel able to ride back over the hill today  entirely so it isnt the riding that uses me up it is the walking and besides as candidate for promotion i must obey ordersespecially orders to march  they breakfasted hurriedly and while mcfarlane and tony were bringing in the horses wayland and berrie set the cabin to rights working thus side by side she recovered her dominion over him and at the same time regained her own cheerful selfconfidence  youre a wonder he exclaimed as he watched her deft adjustment of the dishes and furniture youre ambidextrous  i have to be to hold my job she laughingly replied a feller must play all the parts when hes up here  it was still early morning as they mounted and set off up the trail but moores camp was astir and as mcfarlane turned inmuch against berries willthe lumberman and his daughter both came out to meet them come in and have some breakfast said siona with cordial inclusiveness while her eyes met waylands glance with mocking glee  thank you said mcfarlane we cant stop im going to set my daughter over the divide she has had enough camping and norcross is pretty well battered up so im going to help them across ill be back tonight and well take our turn up the valley tomorrow nash will be here then  berrie did not mind her fathers explanation on the contrary she took a distinct pleasure in letting the other girl know of the long and intimate day she was about to spend with her young lover  siona too adroit to display her disappointment expressed polite regret i hope you wont get stormbound she said showing her white teeth in a meaning smile  if there is any sign of a storm we wont cross declared mcfarlane were going round by the lower pass anyhow if im not here by dark you may know ive stayed to set em down at the mill  there was charm in sionas alert poise and in the neatness of her camp dress her dainty tent with its stools and rugs made the wilderness seem but a park she reminded norcross of the troops of tourists of the tyrol and her tent was of a kind to harmonize with the teahouses on the path to the summit of the matterhorn then too something triumphantly feminine shone in her bright eyes and glowed in her softly rounded cheeks her hand was little and pointed not fitted like berries for tightening a cinch or wielding an ax and as he said goodby he added i hope i shall see you again soon and at the moment he meant it  well return to the springs in a few days she replied come and see us our bungalow is on the other side of the riverand you too she addressed berrie but her tone was so conventionally polite that the ranchgirl burning with jealous heat made no reply  mcfarlane led the way to the lake rapidly and in silence the splendors of the foliage subdued by the rains the grandeur of the peaks the song of the glorious streamall were lost on berrie for she now felt herself to be nothing but a big clumsy coarsehanded tomboy her worn gloves her faded skirt and her mans shoes had been made hateful to her by that smug graceful playacting tourist with the cool keen eyes and smirking lips she pretends to be a kitten but she isnt shes a sly grownup cat she bitterly accused but she could not deny the charm of her personality  wayland was forced to acknowledge that berrie in this dark mood was not the delightful companion she had hitherto been something sweet and confiding had gone out of their relationship and he was too keenwitted not to know what it was he estimated precisely the value of the malicious parting words of siona moore shes a natural tease the kind of woman who loves to torment other and less fortunate women she cares nothing for me of course its just her way of paying off old scores it would seem that berrie has not encouraged her advances in times past  that berrie was suffering and that her jealousy touchingly proved the depth of her love for him brought no elation only perplexity he was not seeking such devotion as a companion on the trail she had been a joyas a jealous sweetheart she was less admirable he realized perfectly that this return journey was of her arrangement not mcfarlanes and while he was not resentful of her care he was in doubt of the outcome it hurried him into a further intimacy which might prove embarrassing  at the camp by the lake the supervisor became sharply commanding now lets throw these packs on lively it will be slippery on the high trail and youll just naturally have to hit leather hard and keep jouncing if you reach the wagonroad before dark but youll make it  make it said berrie of course well make it dont you worry about that for a minute once i get out of the green timber the dark wont worry me well push right through  in packing the camp stuff on the saddles berrie almost as swift and powerful as her father acted with perfect understanding of every task and waylands admiration of her skill increased mightily  she insisted on her fathers turning back we dont need you she said i can find the pass  mcfarlanes faith in his daughter had been tested many times and yet he was a little loath to have her start off on a trail new to her he argued against it briefly but she laughed at his fears i can go anywhere you can she said stand clear with final admonition he stood clear  youll have to keep off the boggy meadows he warned these rains will have softened all those muckholes on the other side theyll be bottomless pits watch out for em goodby if you meet nash hurry him along moore is anxious to run those lines keep in touch with landon and if anybody turns up from the district office say ill be back on friday good luck  same to you so long  berea led the way and norcross fell in behind the packhorses feeling as unimportant as a small boy at the heels of a circus parade his girl captain was so competent so selfreliant and so sure that nothing he could say or do assisted in the slightest degree her leadership was a curiously close reproduction of her fathers unhurried and graceful action her seat in the saddle was as easy as landons and her eyes were alert to every rock and stream in the road she was at home here where the other girl would have been a bewildered child and his words of praise lifted the shadow from her face  the sky was cloudy and a delicious feeling of autumn was in the airautumn that might turn to winter with a passing cloud and the forest was dankly gloomy and grimly silent save from the roaring stream which ran at times foamwhite with speed the high peaks gray and streaked with newfallen snow shone grandly bleakly through the firs the radiant beauty of the road from the springs the golden glow of four days before was utterly gone and yet there was exultation in this ride a distinct pleasure a delight of another sort lay in thus daring the majesty of an unknown windswept pass  wayland called out the air feels like thanksgiving morning doesnt it  it is thanksgiving for me and im going to get a grouse for dinner she replied and in less than an hour the snap of her rifle made good her promise  after leaving the upper lake she turned to the right and followed the course of a swift and splendid stream which came churning through a cheerless mossy swamp of sprucetrees inexperienced as he was wayland knew that this was not a wellmarked trail but his confidence in his guide was too great to permit of any worry over the pass and he amused himself by watching the waterrobins as they flitted from stone to stone in the torrent and in calculating just where he would drop a line for trout if he had time to do so and in recovered serenity enjoyed his ride gradually he put aside his perplexities concerning the future permitting his mind to prefigure nothing but his duties with landon at meekers mill  he was rather glad of the decision to send him there for it promised absorbing sport i shall see how landon and belden work out their problem he said he had no fear of frank meeker now as a forest guard with official duties to perform i can meet that young savage on other and more nearly equal terms he assured himself  the trail grew slippery and in places ran full of water but theres a bottom somewhere berrie confidently declared and pushed ahead with resolute mien it was noon when they rose above timber and entered upon the wide smooth slopes of the pass snow filled the grass here and the wind keen cutting unhindered came out of the desolate west with savage fury but the sun occasionally shone through the clouds with vivid splendor it is december now shouted wayland as he put on his slicker and cowered low to his saddle it will be january soon  we will make it christmas dinner she laughed and her glowing good humor warmed his heart she was entirely her cheerful self again  as they rose the view became magnificent wintry sparkling the great clouds drifting like ancient warships heavy with armament sent down chill showers of hail over the frosted gold of the grassy slopes but when the shadows passed the sunlight descended in silent cataracts deliriously springlike the conies squeaked from the rocky ridges and a brace of eagles circling about a lone crag as if exulting in their sovereign mastery of the air screamed in shrill ecstatic duo the sheer cliffs on their shadowed sides were violently purple everywhere the landscape exhibited crashing contrasts of primary pigments which bit into consciousness like the flare of a martial band  the youth would have lingered in spite of the cold but the girl kept steadily on knowing well that the hardest part of their journey was still before them and he though longing to ride by her side and to enjoy the views with her was forced to remain in the rear in order to hurry the reluctant packanimals forward they had now reached a point twelve thousand feet above the sea and range beyond range to the west and south rose into sight like stupendous waves of a purplegreen sea to the east the park lay level as a floor and carpeted in tawny velvet  it was nearly two oclock when they began to drop down behind the rocky ridges of the eastern slope and soon in the bottom of a warm and sheltered hollow just at timberline berrie drew her horse to a stand and slipped from the saddle well rest here an hour she said and cook our grouse or are you too hungry to wait  i can wait he answered dramatically but it seems as if i had never eaten  well then well save the grouse till tomorrow but ill make some coffee you bring some water while i start a fire  and so while the tired horses cropped the russet grass she boiled some coffee and laid out some bread and meat while he sat by watching her and absorbing the beauty of the scene the charm of the hour it is exactly like a warm afternoon in april he said and here are some of the spring flowers  there now sit by and eat she said with humor and in perfectly restored tranquillity they ate and drank with no thought of critics or of rivals they were alone and content to be so  it was deliciously sweet and restful there in that sunny hollow on the breast of the mountain the wind swept through the worn branches of the dwarfed spruce with immemorial wistfulness but these young souls heard it only as a faroff song side by side on the soft alpine clover they rested and talked looking away at the shining peaks and down over the darkgreen billows of fir beneath them half the forest was under their eyes at the moment and the man said is it not magnificent it makes me proud of my country just think all this glorious spread of hill and valley is under your fathers direction i may say under your direction for i notice he does just about what you tell him to do  youve noticed that she laughed if i were a man id rather be supervisor of this forest than congressman  so would i he agreed nash says you are the supervisor i wonder if your father realizes how efficient you are does he ever sorrow over your not being a boy  her eyes shone with mirth not that i can notice he pears contented  youre a good deal like a son to him i imagine you can do about all that a boy can do anyhowmore than i could ever do does he realize how much you have to do with the management of his forest ive never seen your like i really believe you could carry on the work as well as he  she flushed with pleasure you seem to think im a district forester in disguise  i have eyes miss supervisor and also earswhich leads me to ask why dont you clean out that saloon gang landon is sure theres crooked work going on at that millcertainly that open bar is a disgraceful and corrupting thing  her face clouded weve tried to cut out that saloon but it cant be done you see its on a patented claimthe claim was bogus of course and weve made complaint but the matter is hung up and that gives em a chance to go on  well lets not talk of that its too delicious an hour for any question of business it is a moment for poetry i wish i could write what i feel this moment why dont we camp here and watch the sun go down and the moon rise from our lofty vantageground the coming of dawn would be an epic  we mustnt think of that she protested we must be going  not yet the hour is too perfect it may never come again the wind in the pines the sunshine the conies crying from their rocks the butterflies on the clovermy heart aches with the beauty of it its been a wonderful trip even that staggering walk in the rain had its splendid quality i couldnt see the poetry in it then but i do now these few days have made us comrades havent theycomrades of the trail you have been very considerate of me he took her hand ive never seen such hands they are like steel and yet they are feminine  she drew her hands away im ashamed of my handsthey are so big and rough and dingy  theyre brown of course and callouseda littlebut they are not big and they are beautifully modeled he looked at her speculatively i am wondering how you would look in conventional dress  do you mean she hesitated id look like a gawk in one of those lownecked outfits id never dareand those tight skirts would sure cripple me  oh no they wouldnt youd have to modify your stride a little but youd negotiate it youre equal to anything  youre making fun of me  no im not im in earnest youre the kind of american girl that can go anywhere and do anything my sisters would mortgage their share of the golden streets for your abounding healthand so would i  you are all right now she smiled you dont look or talk as you did  its this sunlight he lifted a spread hand as if to clutch and hold something i feel it soaking into me like some magical oil no more moping and whining for me ive proved that hardship is good for me  dont crow till youre out of the woods its a long ride down the hill and going down is harder on the tenderfoot than going up  im no longer a tenderfoot all i need is another trip like this with you and i shall be a master trailer  all this was very sweet to her and though she knew they should be going she lingered childishly reckless of the sinking sun she played with the wild flowers at her side and listened to his voice in complete content he was right the hour was too beautiful to be shortened although she saw no reason why others equally delightful might not come to them both he was more of the lover than he had ever been before that she knew and in the light of his eyes all that was not girlish and charming melted away she forgot her heavy shoes her rough hands and suntanned face and listened with wondering joy and pride to his words which were of a fineness such as she had never heard spokenonly books contained such unusual and exquisite phrases  a cloud passing across the sun flung down a shadow of portentous chill and darkness she started to her feet with startled recollection of the place and the hour  we must be goingat once she commanded  not yet he pleaded its only a cloud the sun is coming out again i have perfect confidence in your woodcraft why not spend another night on the trail it may be our last trip together  he tempted her strongly so frank and boyish and lovable were his glances and his words but she was vaguely afraid of herself and though the long ride at the moment seemed hard and dull the thought of her mother waiting decided her action  no no she responded firmly weve wasted too much time already we must ride  he looked up at her with challenging glance suppose i refusesuppose i decide to stay here  upon her as he talked a sweet hesitation fell a dream which held more of happiness than she had ever known it is a long hard ride she thought and another night on the trail will not matter and so the moments passed on velvet feet and still she lingered reluctant to break the spell  suddenly into their idyllic drowse of content so sweet so youthful and so pure of heart broke the sound of a horses hurrying clashing steelshod feet and looking up berrie saw a mounted man coming down the mountainside with furious reckless haste  it is cliff she cried out hes on our trail and into her face came a look of alarm her lips paled her eyes widened hes madhes dangerous leave him to me she added in a low tense voice     xi  the deathgrapple   there was something so sinister in the riders disregard of stone and tree and pace something so menacing in the forward thrust of his body that berrie was able to divine his wrath and was smitten into irresolutionall her hardy boyish selfreliance swallowed up in the weakness of the woman she forgot the pistol at her belt and awaited the assault with rigid pose  as belden neared them norcross also perceived that the riders face was distorted with passion and that his glance was not directed upon berrie but upon himself and he braced himself for the attack  leaving his saddle with one flying leap which the cowboy practises at play belden hurled himself upon his rival with the fury of a panther  the slender youth went down before the big rancher as though struck by a catapult and the force of his fall against the stony earth stunned him so that he lay beneath his enemy as helpless as a child  illustration the slender youth went down before the big rancher as though struck by a catapult  belden snarled between his teeth i told you id kill you and i will  but this was not to be berea suddenly recovered her native force with a cry of pain of anger she flung herself on the maddened mans back her hands encircled his neck like a collar of bronze hardened by incessant use of the cinch and the rope her fingers sank into the sinews of his great throat shutting off both blood and breath  let go she commanded with deadly intensity let go or ill choke the life out of you let go i say  he raised a hand to beat her off but she was too strong too desperate to be driven away she was as blind to pain as a mother eagle and bent above him so closely that he could not bring the full weight of his fist to bear with one determined hand still clutching his throat she ran the fingers of her other hand into his hair and twisted his head upward with a power which he could not resist and so looking into his upturned ferocious eyes she repeated with remorseless fury let go i say  his swollen face grew rigid his mouth gaped his tongue protruded and at last releasing his hold on his victim he rose flinging berrie off with a final desperate effort ill kill you too he gasped  up to this moment the girl had felt no fear of herself but now she resorted to other weapons snatching her pistol from its holster she leveled it at his forehead stop she said and something in her voice froze him into calm he was not a fiend he was not a deliberate assassin he was only a jealous despairing insane lover and as he looked into the face he knew so well and realized that nothing but hate and deadly resolution lit the eyes he had so often kissed his heart gave way and dropping his head he said kill me if you want to ive nothing left to live for  there was something unreal appalling in this sudden reversion to weakness and berrie could not credit his remorse give me your gun she said  he surrendered it to her and she threw it aside then turned to wayland who was lying white and still with face upturned to the sky with a moan of anguish she bent above him and called upon his name he did not stir and when she lifted his head to her lap his hair streaming with blood stained her dress she kissed him and called again to him then turned with accusing frenzy to belden youve killed him do you hear youve killed him  the agony the fury of hate in her voice reached the heart of the conquered man he raised his head and stared at her with mingled fear and remorse and so across that limp body these two souls so lately lovers looked into each others eyes as though nothing but words of hate and loathing had ever passed between them the girl saw in him only a savage vengeful bloodthirsty beast the man confronted in her an accusing angel  i didnt mean to kill him he muttered  yes you did you meant it you crushed his life out with your big handsand now im going to kill you for it  a fierce calm had come upon her some faroff ancestral deep of passion called for blood revenge she lifted the weapon with steady hand and pointed it at his heart  his fear passed as his wrath had passed his head drooped his glance wavered shoot he commanded sullenly id sooner die than livenow  his words his tone brought back to her a vision of the man he had seemed when she first met and admired him her hand fell the woman in her reasserted itself a wave of weakness of indecision of passionate grief overwhelmed her oh cliff she moaned why did you do it he was so gentle and sweet  he did not answer his glance wandered to his horse serenely cropping the grass in utter disregard of this tumultuous human drama but the wind less insensate than the brute swept through the grove of dwarfed distorted pines with a desolate sympathetic moan which filled the mans heart with a new and exalted sorrow youre right he said i was crazy i deserve killing  but berrie was now too deep in her own desolation to care what he said or did she kissed the cold lips of the still youth murmuring passionately i dont care to live without youi shall go with you  beldens hand was on her wrist before she could raise her weapon dont for gods sake dont do that he may not be dead  she responded but dully to the suggestion no no hes gone his breath is gone  maybe not let me see  again she bent to the quiet face on which the sunlight fell with mocking splendor it seemed all a dream till she felt once more the stain of his blood upon her hands it was all so incredibly sudden only just now he was exulting over the warmth and beauty of the dayand now  how beautiful he was he seemed asleep the conies crying from their runways suddenly took on poignant pathos they appeared to be grieving with her but the eagles spoke of revenge  a sharp cry a note of joy sprang from her lips he is alive i saw his eyelids quiverquick bring some water  the man leaped to his feet and running down to the pool filled his sombrero with icy water he was as eager now to save his rival as he had been mad to destroy him let me help he pleaded but she would not permit him to touch the body  again while splashing the water upon his face the girl called upon her love to return he hears me she exulted to her enemy he is breathing now he is opening his eyes  the wounded man did indeed open his eyes but his look was a blank uncomprehending stare which plunged her back into despair he dont know me she said with piteous accent she now perceived the source of the blood upon her arm it came from a wound in the boys head which had been dashed upon a stone  the sight of this wound brought back the blaze of accusing anger to her eyes see what you did she said with cold malignity then by sudden shift she bent to the sweet face in her arms and kissed it passionately open your eyes darling you must not die i wont let you die cant you hear me dont you know where you are  he opened his eyes once more quietly and looked up into her face with a faint drowsy smile he could not yet locate himself in space and time but he knew her and was comforted he wondered why he should be looking up into a sunny sky he heard the wind and the sound of a horse cropping grass and the voice of the girl penetratingly sweet as that of a young mother calling her baby back to life and slowly his benumbed brain began to resolve the mystery  belden forgotten ignored as completely as the conies sat with choking throat and smarting eyes for him the world was only dust and ashesa ruin which his own barbaric spirit had brought upon itself  slowly the youths eyes took on expression are we still on the hill he asked  yes dearest she assured him then to belden he knows where he is  wayland again struggled with reality what has happened to me  you fell and hurt your head  he turned slightly and observed the other man looking down at her with dark and tragic glance hello belden he said feebly how came you here then noting berries look he added i remember he tried to kill me he again searched his antagonists face why didnt you finish the job  the girl tried to turn his thought aside its all right now darling he wont make any more trouble dont mind him i dont care for anybody now you are coming back to me  wayland wonderingly regarded the face of the girl and youare you hurt  no im not hurt i am perfectly happy now she turned to belden with quick authoritative command unsaddle the horses and set up the tent we wont be able to leave here tonight  he rose with instant obedience glad of a chance to serve her and soon had the tent pegged to its place and the bedding unrolled together they lifted the wounded youth and laid him upon his blankets beneath the low canvas roof which seemed heavenly helpful to berea  there she said caressingly now you are safe no matter whether it rains or not  he smiled it seems im to have my way after all i hope i shall be able to see the sun rise ive sort of lost my interest in the sunset  now cliff she said as soon as the camp was in order and a fire started i reckon youd better ride on i havent any further use for you  dont say that berrie he pleaded i cant leave you here alone with a sick man let me stay and help  she looked at him for a long time before she replied i shall never be able to look at you again without hating you she said i shall always remember you as you looked when you were killing that boy so youd better ride on and keep ariding im going to forget all this just as soon as i can and it dont help me any to have you around i never want to see you or hear your name again  you dont mean that berrie  yes i do she asserted bitterly i mean just that so saddle up and pull out all i ask of you is to say nothing about what has happened here youd better leave the state if wayland should get worse it might go hard with you  he accepted his banishment all right if you feel that way ill ride but id like to do something for you before i go ill pile up some wood  no ill take care of that and without another word of farewell she turned away and reentered the tent  mounting his horse with painful slowness as though suddenly grown old the reprieved assassin rode away up the mountain his head low his eyes upon the ground     xii  berries vigil   the situation in which berea now found herself would have disheartened most women of mature age but she remained not only composed she was filled with an irrational delight the nurse that is in every woman was aroused in her and she looked forward with joy to a night of vigil confident that wayland was not seriously injured and that he would soon be able to ride she had no fear of the forest or of the night nature held no menace now that her tent was set and her fire alight  wayland without really knowing anything about it suspected that he owed his life to her intervention and this belief deepened the feeling of admiration which he had hitherto felt toward her he listened to her at work around the fire with a deepening sense of his indebtedness to her and when she looked in to ask if she could do anything for him his throat filled with an emotion which rendered his answer difficult  as his mind cleared he became very curious to know precisely what had taken place but he did not feel free to ask her she will tell me if she wishes me to know that she had vanquished belden and sent him on his way was evident although he had not been able to hear what she had said to him at the last what lay between the enemys furious onslaught and the aid he lent in making the camp could only be surmised i wonder if she used her pistol wayland asked himself something like death must have stared him in the face  strange how everything seems to throw me ever deeper into her debt he thought a little later but he did not quite dare put into words the resentment which mingled with his gratitude he hated to be put so constantly into the position of the one protected defended and yet it was his own fault he had put himself among people and conditions where she was the stronger having ventured out of his world into hers he must take the consequences  that she loved him with the complete passion of her powerful and simple nature he knew for her voice had reached through the daze of his semiunconsciousness with thrilling power the touch of her lips to his the close clasp of her strong arms were of ever greater convincing quality and yet he wished the revelation had come in some other way his pride was abraded his manhood seemed somehow lessened it was a disconcerting reversal of the ordinary relations between hero and heroine and he saw no way of reestablishing the normal attitude of the male  entirely unaware of what was passing in the mind of her patient berrie went about her duties with a cheerfulness which astonished the sufferer in the tent she seemed about to hum a song as she set the skillet on the fire but a moment later she called out in a tone of irritation here comes nash  im glad of that answered wayland although he perceived something of her displeasure  nash on his way to join the supervisor raised a friendly greeting as he saw the girl and drew rein i expected to meet you farther down the hill he said tony phoned that you had started where did you leave the supervisor  over at the station waiting for you wheres your outfit  camped down the trail a mile or so i thought id better push through tonight what about norcross isnt he with you  she hesitated an instant hes in the tent he fell and struck his head on a rock and i had to go into camp here  nash was deeply concerned is that so well thats hard luck is he badly hurt  well he had a terrible fall but hes easier now i think hes asleep  may i look in on him  i dont think youd better take the time its a long hard ride from here to the station it will be deep night before you can make it  dont you think the supervisor would want me to camp here tonight and do what i could for you if norcross is badly injured you will need me  she liked nash and she knew he was right and yet she was reluctant to give up the pleasure of her lone vigil hes not in any danger and well be able to ride on in the morning  nash thinking of her as clifford beldens promised wife had no suspicion of her feeling toward norcross therefore he gently urged that to go on was quite out of order i cant think of leaving you here alonecertainly not till i see norcross and find out how badly he is hurt  she yielded i reckon youre right she said ill go see if he is awake  he followed her to the door of the tent apprehending something new and inexplicable in her attitude in the music of her voice as she spoke to the sick man was the lovenote of the mate you may come in she called back and nash stooping entered the small tent  hello old man what you been doing with yourself hitting the high spots  norcross smiled feebly no the hill flew up and bumped me  how did it all happen  i dont exactly know it all came of a sudden i had no share in iti didnt go for to do it  whether you did or not you seem to have made a good job of it  nash examined the wounded man carefully and his skill and strength in handling norcross pleased berrie though she was jealous of the warm friendship which seemed to exist between the men  she had always liked nash but she resented him now especially as he insisted on taking charge of the case but she gave way finally and went back to her pots and pans with pensive countenance  a little later when nash came out to make report she was not very gracious in her manner hes pretty badly hurt he said theres an ugly gash in his scalp and the shock has produced a good deal of pain and confusion in his head but hes going to be all right in a day or two for a man seeking rest and recuperation he certainly has had a tough run of weather  though a seriousminded honorable forester determined to keep sternly in mind that he was in the presence of the daughter of his chief and that she was engaged to marry another nash was after all a man and the witchery of the hour the charm of the girls graceful figure asserted their power over him his eyes grew tender and his voice eloquent in spite of himself his words he could guard but it was hard to keep from his speech the song of the lover the thought that he was to camp in her company to help her about the fire to see her from moment to moment with full liberty to speak to her to meet her glance pleased him it was the most romantic and moving episode in his life and though of a rather dry and analytic temperament he had a sense of poesy  the night black oppressive and silent brought a closer bond of mutual help and understanding between them he built a fire of dry branches close to the tent door and there sat side by side with the girl in the glow of embers so close to the injured youth that they could talk together and as he spoke freely yet modestly of his experiences berrie found him more deeply interesting than she had hitherto believed him to be true he saw things less poetically than wayland but he was finely observant and a man of studious and refined habits  she grew friendlier and asked him about his work and especially about his ambitions and plans for the future they discussed the forest and its enemies and he wondered at her freedom in speaking of the mill and saloon he said of course you know that alec belden is a partner in that business and im toldof course i dont know thisthat clifford belden is also interested  she offered no defense of young belden and this unconcern puzzled him he had expected indignant protest but she merely replied i dont care who owns it it should be rooted out i hate that kind of thing its just another way of robbing those poor tiejacks  clifford should get out of it cant you persuade him to do so  i dont think i can  his relationship to you  he is not related to me  her tone amazed him you know what i mean  of course i do but youre mistaken were not related that way any longer  this silenced him for a few moments then he said im rather glad of that he isnt anything like the man you thought he wasi couldnt say these things beforebut he is as greedy as alec only not so open about it  all this comment which moved the forester so deeply to utter seemed not to interest berea she sat staring at the fire with the calm brow of an indian clifford belden had passed out of her life as completely as he had vanished out of the landscape she felt an immense relief at being rid of him and resented his being brought back even as a subject of conversation  wayland listening fancied he understood her desire and said nothing that might arouse nashs curiosity  nash on his part knowing that she had broken with belden began to understand the tenderness the anxious care of her face and voice as she bent above young norcross as the night deepened and the cold air stung he asked have you plenty of blankets for a bed  oh yes she answered but i dont intend to sleep  oh you must he declared go to bed i will keep the fire going  at last she consented i will make my bed right here at the mouth of the tent close to the fire she said and you can call me if you need me  why not put your bed in the tent its going to be cold up here  i am all right outside she protested  put your bed inside miss berrie we cant let conventions count above timberline i shall rest better if i know you are properly sheltered  and so it happened that for the third time she shared the same roof with her lover but the nurse was uppermost in her now at eleven thousand feet above the seawith a cold drizzle of fine rain in the airone does not consider the course of gossip as carefully as in a village and berrie slept unbrokenly till daylight  nash was the first to arise in the dusk of dawn and berrie awakened by the crackle of his fire soon joined him there is no sweeter sound than the voice of the flame at such a time in such a place it endows the bleak mountainside with comfort makes the ledge a hearthstone it holds the promise of savory meats and fragrant liquor and robs the frosty air of its terrors  wayland hearing their voices called out with feeble humor will some one please turn on the steam in my room  berrie uttered a happy word how do you feel this morning she asked  not precisely like a pugilistwell yes i believe i dolike the fellow who got second money  how is the bump inquired nash thrusting his head inside the door  reduced to the size of a golfball as near as i can judge of it i doubt if i can wear a hat but im feeling fine im going to get up  berrie was greatly relieved im so glad do you feel like riding down the hill  sure thing im hungry and as soon as i am fed im ready to start  berrie joined the surveyor at the fire  if youll round up our horses mr nash ill rustle breakfast and well get going she said  nash enthralled lingered while she twisted her hair into place then went out to bring in the ponies  wayland came out a little uncertainly but looking very well i think i shall discourage my friends from coming to this region for their health he said ruefully if i were a novelist now all this would be grist for my mill  beneath his joking he was profoundly chagrined he had hoped by this time to be as sinewy as alert as nash instead of which here he sat shivering over the fire like a sick girl his head swollen his blood sluggish but this discouragement only increased bereas tendernessa tenderness which melted all his reserve  im not worth all your care he said to her with poignant glance  the sun rose clear and warm and the fire the coffee put new courage into him as well as into the others and while the morning was yet early and the forest chill and damp with rain the surveyor brought up the horses and started packing the outfit  in this berrie again took part doing her half of the work quite as dextrously as nash himself indeed the forester was noticeably confused and not quite up to his usual level of adroit ease  at last both packs were on and as they stood together for a moment nash said this has been a great experienceone i shall remember as long as i live  she stirred uneasily under his frank admiration im mightily obliged to you she replied as heartily as she could command  dont thank me im indebted to you there is so little in my life of such companionship as you and norcross give me  youll find it lonesome over at the station im afraid said she but moore intends to put a crew of tiecutters in over therethat will help some she smiled  im not partial to the society of tiejacks  if you ride hard you may find that moore girl in camp she was there when we left there was a sparkle of mischief in her glance  im not interested in the moore girl he retorted  do you know her  ive seen her at the postoffice once or twice she is not my kind  she gave him her hand well goodby im all right now that wayland can ride  he held her hand an instant i believe ill ride back with you as far as the camp  youd better go on father is waiting for you ill send the men along there was dismissal in her voice and yet she recognized as never before the fine qualities that were his please dont say anything of this to others and tell my father not to worry about us well pull in all right  he helped norcross mount his horse and as he put the lead rope into berries hand he said with much feeling good luck to you i shall remember this night all the rest of my life  i hate to be going to the rear called wayland whose bare bandaged head made him look like a wounded young officer but i guess its better for me to lay off for a week or two and recover my tone  and so they parted the surveyor riding his determined way up the naked mountainside toward the clouds while berrie and her ward plunged at once into the dark and dripping forest below if you can stand the grief she said well go clear through  wayland had his misgivings but did not say so his confidence in his guide was complete she would do her part that was certain several times she was forced to dismount and blaze out a new path in order to avoid some bog but she sternly refused his aid you must not get off she warned stay where you are i can do this work better alone  they were again in that green gloomy and silent zone of the range where giant spruces grow and springs oozing from the rocks trickle over the trail it was very beautiful but menacing by reason of its apparently endless thickets cut by stony ridges it was here she met the two young men downing and travis bringing forward the surveying outfit but she paused only to say push along steadily you are needed on the other side  after leaving the men and with a knowledge that the remaining leagues of the trail were solitary norcross grew fearful the fall of a horse an accident to that brave girl and we would be helpless he thought i wish nash had returned with us once his blood chilled with horror as he watched his guide striking out across the marge of a grassy lake this meadow as he divined was really a carpet of sod floating above a bottomless pool of muck for it shook beneath her horses feet  come on its all right she called back cheerily well soon pick up the other trail  he wondered how she knew for to him each hill was precisely like another each thicket a maze  her caution was all for him she tried each dangerous slough first and thus was able to advise him which way was safest his head throbbed with pain and his knees were weary but he rode on manifesting such cheer as he could resolving not to complain at any cost but his selfrespect ebbed steadily leaving him in bitter silent dejection  at last they came into open ground on a high ridge and were gladdened by the valley outspread below them for it was still radiant with color though not as brilliant as before the rain it had been dimmed but not darkened and yet it seemed that a month had passed since their ecstatic ride upward through the golden forest and wayland said as much while they stood for a moment surveying the majestic park with its wall of guardian peaks  but berrie replied it seems only a few hours to me  from this point the traveling was good and they descended rapidly zigzagging from side to side of a long sweeping ridge by noon they were once more down amid the aspens basking in a world of sad gold leaves and delicious september sunshine  at one oclock on the bank of a clear stream the girl halted i reckon wed better camp awhile you look tired and i am hungry  he gratefully acquiesced in this stop for his knees were trembling with the strain of the stirrups but he would not permit her to ease him down from his saddle turning a wan glance upon her he bitterly asked must i always play the weakling before you i am ashamed of myself ride on and leave me to rot here in the grass im not worth keeping alive  you must not talk like that she gently admonished him youre not to blame  yes i am i should never have ventured into this mans country  im glad you did she answered as if she were comforting a child for if you hadnt i should never have known you  that would have been no lossto you he bitterly responded  she unsaddled one packanimal and spread some blankets on the grass lie down and rest while i boil some coffee she commanded and he obeyed too tired to make pretension toward assisting  lying so feeling the magic of the sun hearing the music of the water and watching the girl he regained a serener mood and when she came back with his food he thanked her for it with a glance before which her eyes fell i dont see why you are so kind to me i really believe you like to do things for me her head drooped to hide her face and he went on why do you care for me tell me  i dont know she murmured then she added with a flash of bravery but i do  what a mystery it all is you turn from a splendid fellow like landon to a skate like me landon worships youyou know thatdont you  i knowhe she ended vaguely distressed  did he ask you to marry him  yes  why didnt you hes just the mate for you hes a man of high character and education she made no answer to this and he went on dear girl im not worth your caretruly im not i resented your engagement to belden for he was a brute but landon is different he thinks the world of you hell go high in the service ive never done anything in the worldi never shall it will be better for you if i gotomorrow  she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek then putting her arm about his neck drew him to her bosom and kissed him passionately you break my heart when you talk like that she protested with tears you mustnt say such gloomy thingsi wont let you give up you shall come right home with me and i will nurse you till you are well it was all my fault if we had only stayed in camp at the lake daddy would have joined us that night and if i had not loitered on the mountain yesterday cliff would not have overtaken us its all my fault  i will not have it go that way he said ive brought you only care and unhappiness thus far im an alienmy ways are not your ways  i can change she answered i hate my ways and i like yours  as they argued she felt no shame and he voiced no resentment she knew his mood she understood his doubt his depression she pleaded as a man might have done ready to prove her love eager to restore his selfrespect while he remained both bitter and sadly contemptuous  a cowhand riding up the trail greeted berrie respectfully but a cynical smile broke out on his lips as he passed on another witnessanother gossip  she did not care she had no further concern of the valleys comment her lifes happiness hung on the drooping eyelashes of this wounded boy and to win him back to cheerful acceptance of life was her only concern  ive never had any motives he confessed ive always done what pleased me at the momentor because it was easier to do as others were doing i went to college that way truth is i never had any surplus vitality and my father never demanded anything of me i havent any motives now a few days ago i was interested in forestry at this time it all seems futile whats the use of my trying to live  part of all this despairing cry arose from weariness and part from a luxurious desire to be comforted for it was sweet to feel her sympathy he even took a morbid pleasure in the distress of her eyes and lips while her rich voice murmured in soothing protest  she on her part was frightened for him and as she thought of the long ride still before them she wrung her hands oh what shall i do what shall i do she moaned  instantly smitten into shame into manlier mood he said dont worry about me please dont i can ride im feeling better you must not weaken please forgive my selfish complaints im done youll never hear it again come let us go on i can ride  if we can reach millers ranch  i can ride to your ranch he declared and rose with such newfound resolution that she stared at him in wonder  he was able to smile ive had my little crying spell ive relieved my heart of its load i didnt mean to agonize you it was only a slump he put his hand to his head i must be a comical figure wonder what that cowboy thought of me  his sudden reversal to cheer was a little alarming to her but at length she perceived that he had in truth mastered his depression and bringing up the horses she saddled them and helped him to mount if you get tired or feel worse tell me and well go into camp she urged as they were about to start  you keep going till i give the sign he replied and his voice was so firm and clear that her own sunny smile came back i dont know what to make of you she said i reckon you must be a poet     xiii  the gossips awake   it was dark when they reached the village but wayland declared his ability to go on although his wounded head was throbbing with fever and he was clinging to the pommel of his saddle so berrie rode on  mrs mcfarlane hearing the horses on the bridge was at the door and received her daughter with wondering question while the stablehands quick to detect an injured man hurried to lift norcross down from his saddle  whats the matter repeated mrs mcfarlane  he fell and struck his head on a stone berea hastily explained take the horses boys mother and i will look out for mr norcross  the men obeyed her and fell back but they were consumed with curiosity and their glances irritated the girl slip the packs at once she insisted  with instant sympathy her mother came to her aid in supporting the wounded weary youth indoors and as he stretched out on the couch in the sittingroom he remarked with a faint ironic smile this beats any bed of balsam boughs  wheres your father asked mrs mcfarlane of her daughter  hes over on the ptarmigan ive a powerful lot to tell you mother but not now we must look after wayland hes nearly done up and so am i  mrs mcfarlane winced a little at her daughters use of norcrosss first name but she said nothing further at the moment although she watched berrie closely while she took off waylands shoes and stockings and rubbed his icy feet get him something hot as quick as you can she commanded and mrs mcfarlane obeyed without a word  gradually the tremor passed out of his limbs and a delicious sense of warmth of safety stole over him and he closed his eyes in the comfort of her presence and care rigorous business this life of the pioneer he said with mocking inflection i think i prefer a place in the lumber trust  dont talk she said then with a rush of tender remorse why didnt you tell me to stop i didnt realize that you were so tired we could have stopped at the springs  i didnt know how tired i was till i got here gee he said boyishly that doorknob at the back of my head is redhot youre good to me he added humbly  she hated to have him resume that tone of selfdepreciation and kneeling to him she kissed his cheek and laid her head beside his youre splendid she insisted nobody could be braver but you should have told me you were exhausted you fooled me with your cheerful answers  he accepted her loving praise her clasping arms as a part of the rescue from the darkness and pain of the long ride careless of what it might bring to him in the future he ate his toast and drank his coffee and permitted the women to lead him to his room and then being alone he crept into his bed and fell instantly asleep  berrie and her mother went back to the sittingroom and mrs mcfarlane closed the door behind them now tell me all about it she said in the tone of one not to be denied  the story went along very smoothly till the girl came to the second night in camp beside the lake there her voice faltered and the reflective look in the mothers eyes deepened as she learned that her daughter had shared her tent with the young man it was the only thing to do mother berrie bravely said it was cold and wet outside and you know he isnt very strong and his teeth were chattering he was so chilled i know it sounds strange down here but up there in the woods in the storm what i did seemed right and natural you know what i mean dont you  yes i understand i dont blame youonlyif others should hear of it  but they wont no one knows of our being alone there except tony and father  are you sure doesnt mrs belden know  i dont think sonot yet  mrs mcfarlanes nervousness grew i wish you hadnt gone on this trip if the beldens find out you were alone with mr norcross theyll make much of it it will give them a chance at your father her mind turned upon another point when did mr norcross get his fall  on the way back here berrie hesitated again i dont like to tell you mother but he didnt fall cliff jumped him and tried to kill him  the mother doubted her ears cliff did how did he happen to meet you  berrie was quick to answer i dont know how he found out we were on the trail i suppose the old lady phoned him anyhow while we were camped for noon yesterdayher face flamed again at thought of that tender beautiful moment when they were resting on the grasswhile we were at our lunch he came tearing down the hill on that big bay horse of his and took a flying jump at wayland as wayland went down he struck his head on a stone i thought he was dead and i was paralyzed for a second then i flew at cliff and just about choked the life out of him id have ended him right there if he hadnt let go  mrs mcfarlane looking upon her daughter in amazement saw on her face the shadow of the deadly rage which had burned in her heart as she clenched young beldens throat  what then what happened then  he let go you bet her smile came back and when he realized what hed donehe thought wayland was deadhe began to weaken then i took my gun and was all for putting an end to him right there when i saw waylands eyelids move after that i didnt care what became of cliff i told him to ride on and keep aridin and i reckon hes clear out of the state by this time if he ever shows up ill put him where hell have all night to be sorry in  when did this take place  yesterday about two of course wayland couldnt ride he was so dizzy and kind o confused and so i went into camp right there at timberline along about sunset nash came riding up from this side and insisted on staying to help meso i let him  mrs mcfarlanes tense attitude relaxed nash is not the kind that tattles im glad he turned up  and this morning i saddled and came down  did nash go on  yes daddy was waiting for him so i sent him along  its all sad business groaned mrs mcfarlane and i can see youre keeping something back how did cliff happen to know just where you were and what started you back without your father  for the first time berrie showed signs of weakness and distress why you see alec belden and mr moore were over there to look at some timber and old marm belden and that moore girl went along i suppose they sent word to cliff and i presume that moore girl put him on our trail leastwise thats the way i figure it out thats the worst of the whole business she admitted this with darkened brow mrs beldens tongue is hung in the middle and loose at both endsand that moore girl is spiteful mean she could not keep the contempt out of her voice she saw us start off and she is sure to follow it up and find out what happened on the way home even if they dont see cliff theyll talk  oh i wish you hadnt gone exclaimed the worried mother  it cant be helped now and it hasnt done me any real harm its all in the days work anyhow ive always gone with daddy before and this trip isnt going to spoil me the boys all know me and they will treat me fair  yes but mr norcross is an outsidera city man they will all think evil of him on that account  i know thats what troubles me no one will know how fine and considerate he was mother ive never known any one like him hes a poet hes taught me to see things i never saw before everything interests himthe birds the clouds the voices in the fire i never was so happy in my life as i was during those first two days and that night in camp before he began to worryit was just wonderful words failed her but her shining face and the forward straining pose of her body enlightened the mother i dont care what people say of me if only they will be just to him theyve got to treat him right she added firmly  did he speak to youare you engaged  her head drooped not really engaged mother but he told me how much he liked meandits all right mother i know it is im not fine enough for him but im going to try to change my ways so he wont be ashamed of me  mrs mcfarlanes face cleared he surely is a fine young fellow and can be trusted to do the right thing well we might as well go to bed we cant settle anything till your father gets home she said  wayland rose next morning free from dizziness and almost free from pain and when he came out of his room his expression was cheerful i feel as if id slept a week and im hungry i dont know why i should be but i am  mrs mcfarlane met him with something very intimate something almost maternal in her look but her words were as few and as restrained as ever he divined that she had been talking with berrie and that a fairly clear understanding of the situation had been reached that this understanding involved him closely he was aware but nothing in his manner acknowledged it  she did not ask any questions believing that sooner or later the whole story must come out the fact that siona moore and mrs belden knew that berrie had started back on thursday with young norcross made it easy for the villagers to discover that she had not reached the ranch till saturday what could joe have been thinking of to allow them to go she said mr nashs presence in the camp must be made known but then there is cliffords assault upon mr norcross can that be kept secret too and so while the young people chatted the troubled mother waited in fear knowing that in a day or two the countryside would be aflame with accusation  in a landscape like this as she well knew nothing moves unobserved the nativeman or womanis able to perceive and name objects scarcely discernible to the eye of the alien a minute speck is discovered on the hillside hello theres jim sanders on his roan says one or here comes kit jenkins with her fleabit gray i wonder whos on the bay alongside of her remarks another and each of these observations is taken quite as a matter of course with a wide and empty field of vision and with trained unspoiled optic nerves the plainsman is marvelously penetrating of glance hence mrs mcfarlane was perfectly certain that not one but several of her neighbors had seen and recognized berrie and young norcross as they came down the hill in a day or two every man would know just where they camped and what had taken place in camp mrs belden would not rest till she had ferreted out every crook and turn of that trail and her speech was quite as coarse as that of any of her male associates  easygoing with regard to many things these citizens were abnormally alive to all matters relating to courtship and popular as she believed berrie to be mrs mcfarlane could not hope that her daughter would be sparedespecially by the beldens who would naturally feel that clifford had been cheated she sighed deeply well nothing can be done till joe returns she repeated  a long days rest a second nights sleep set wayland on his feet he came to breakfast quite gay barring the hickorynut on the back of my head he explained im feeling fine almost ready for another expedition i may make a ranger yet  berrie though equally gay was not so sure of his ability to return to work i reckon youd better go easy till daddy gets back but if you feel like it well ride up to the postoffice this afternoon  i want to start right in to learn to throw that hitch and im going to practise with an ax till i can strike twice in the same place this trip was an eyeopener great man id be in a windfallwouldnt i  he was persuaded to remain very quiet for another day and part of it was spent in conversation with mrs mcfarlanewhom he liked very muchand an hour or more in writing a long letter wherein he announced to his father his intention of going into the forest service ive got to build up a constitution he said and i dont know of a better place to do it in besides im beginning to be interested in the scheme i like the supervisor im living in his house at the present time and im feeling contented and happy so dont worry about me  he was indeed quite comfortable save when he realized that mrs mcfarlane was taking altogether too much for granted in their relationship it was delightful to be so watched over so waited upon so instructed but where is it all leading me he continued to ask himselfand still that wall of reserve troubled and saddened berrie  they expected mcfarlane that night and waited supper for him but he did not come and so they ate without him and afterward wayland helped berrie do up the dishes while the mother bent above her sewing by the kitchen lamp  there was something very sweet and gentle about mrs mcfarlane and the exile took almost as much pleasure in talking with her as with her daughter he led her to tell of her early experiences in the valley and of the strange types of men and women with whom she had crossed the range  some of them are here yet she said in fact the most violent of all the opponents to the service are these old adventurers i dont think they deserve to be called pioneers they never did any work in clearing the land or in building homes some of them who own big herds of cattle still live in dugouts they raged at mr mcfarlane for going into the servicecalled him a traitor old jake proudfoot was especially furious  you should see where old jake lives interrupted berrie he sleeps on the floor in one corner of his cabin and never changes his shirt  hush warned mrs mcfarlane  thats what the men all say daddy declares if they were to scrape jake theyd find at least five layers of shirts his wife left him fifteen years ago couldnt stand his habits and hes got worse ever since naturally he is opposed to the service  of course her mother explained those who oppose the supervisor arent all like jake but it makes me angry to have the papers all quoting jake as one of the leading ranchers of the valley  she could not bring herself to take up the most vital subject of allthe question of her daughters future ill wait till father gets home she decided  on the fourth morning the phone rang and the squawking voice of mrs belden came over the wire i wanted to know if berrie and her feller got home all right  yes they arrived safely  the old woman chuckled last i see of cliff he was hot on their traillooked like he expected to take a hand in that expedition did he overtake em  i dont hear very wellwhere are you  im at the scott ranchwere coming round the horn today  where is the supervisor  he headed across yesterday say cliff was mad as a hornet when he started id like to know what happened  mrs mcfarlane hung up the receiver the old womans nasty chuckle was intolerable but in silencing the phone mrs mcfarlane was perfectly aware that she was not silencing the gossip on the contrary she was certain that the beldens would leave a trail of poisonous comment from the ptarmigan to bear tooth it was all sweet material for them  berrie wanted to know who was speaking and mrs mcfarlane replied mrs belden wanted to know if you got through all right  she said something else something to heat you up persisted the girl who perceived her mothers agitation what did she saysomething about meand cliff  the mother did not answer for wayland entered the room at the moment but berrie knew that traducers were already busy with her affairs i dont care anything about old lady belden she said later but i hate to have that moore girl telling lies about me  as for wayland the nights in the camp by the lake and indeed all the experiences of his trip in the high places were becoming each moment more remote more unreal camp life at timberline did not seem to him subject to ordinary conventional laws of human conduct and the fact that he and berrie had shared the same tent under the stress of cold and snow now seemed so far away as to be only a complication in a splendid mountain drama surely no blame could attach to the frank and generous girl even though the jealous assault of cliff belden should throw the valley into a fever of chatter furthermore i dont believe he will be in haste to speak of his share in the play he added it was too nearly criminal  it was almost noon of the fourth day when the supervisor called up to say that he was at the office and would reach the ranch at six oclock  i wish you would come home at once his wife argued and something in her voice convinced him that he was more needed at home than in the town  all right mother hold the fort an hour and ill be there  mrs mcfarlane met him at the hitchingbar and it required but a glance for him to read in her face a troubled state of mind  this has been a disastrous trip for berrie she said after one of the hands had relieved the supervisor of his horse  in what way  she was a bit impatient mrs belden is filling the valley with the story of berries stay in camp with mr norcross  his face showed a graver line it couldnt be helped the horses had to be followed and that youngster couldnt do itand besides i expected to get back that night nobody but an old snoop like seth belden would think evil of our girl and besides norcross is a man to be trusted  of course he is but the beldens are ready to think evil of any one connected with us and cliffs assault on wayland  he looked up quickly assault did he make trouble  yes he overtook them on the trail and would have killed norcross if berrie hadnt interfered he was crazy with jealousy  nash didnt say anything about any assault  he didnt know it berrie told him that norcross fell from his horse  mcfarlane was deeply stirred i saw cliff leave camp but i didnt think anything of it why should he jump norcross  i suppose mrs belden filled him with distrust of berrie he was already jealous and when he came up with them and found them lunching together he lost his head and rushed at wayland like a wild beast of course he couldnt stand against a big man like cliff and his head struck on a stone and if berrie hadnt throttled the brute he would have murdered the poor boy right there before her eyes  good god i never suspected a word of this i didnt think hed do that  the supervisor was now very grave these domestic matters at once threw his work as forester into the region of vague and unimportant abstractions he began to understand the danger into which berea had fallen and step by step he took up the trails which had brought them all to this pass  he fixed another penetrating look upon her face and his voice was vibrant with anxiety as he said you dont think theres anythingwrong  no nothing wrong but shes profoundly in love with him i never have seen her so wrapped up in any one she thinks of nothing else it scares me to see it for ive studied him closely and i cant believe he feels the same toward her his world is so different from ours i dont know what to do or say i fear she is in for a period of great unhappiness  she was at the beginning of tears and he sought to comfort her dont worry honey shes got too much horse sense to do anything foolish shes grown up i suppose its his being so different from the other boys that catches her weve always been good chumslet me talk with her she mustnt make a mistake  the return of the crew from the corral cut short this conference and when mcfarlane went in berrie greeted him with such frank and joyous expression that all his fears vanished  did you come over the high trail she asked  no i came your way i didnt want to take any chances on getting mired its still raining up there he answered then turned to wayland heres your mail norcross a whole hatful of itand one telegram in the bunch hope it isnt serious  wayland took the bundle of letters and retired to his room glad to escape the persistent stare of the cowhands the despatch was from his father and was curt and specific as a command shall be in denver on the 23d meet me at the palmer house am on my way to california come prepared to join me on the trip  with the letters unopened in his lap he sat in silent thought profoundly troubled by the instant decision which this message demanded of him at first glance nothing was simpler than to pack up and go he was only a tourist in the valley with no intention of staying but there was berea to go meant a violent end of their pleasant romance to think of flight saddened him and yet his better judgment was clearly on the side of going much as i like her much as i admire her i cannot marry her the simplest way is to frankly tell her so and go it seems cowardly but in the end she will be happier  his letters carried him back into his own world one was from will halliday who was going with professor holsman on an exploring trip up the nile you must join us holsman has promised to take you on another classmate wrote to know if he did not want to go into a land deal on the gulf of mexico a girl asked are you to be in new york this winter i am ive decided to go into this suffrage movement and so one by one the threads which bound him to eastern city life respun their filaments after all this colorado outing even though it should last two years would only be a vacationhis real life was in the cities of the east charming as berea was potent as she seemed she was after all a fixed part of the mountain land and not to be taken from it at the moment marriage with her appeared absurd  a knock at his door and the supervisors voice gave him a keen shock come in he called springing to his feet with a thrill of dread of alarm  mcfarlane entered slowly and shut the door behind him his manner was serious and his voice gravely gentle as he said i hope that telegram does not call you away  it is from my father asking me to meet him in denver answered norcross with faltering breath hes on his way to california wont you sit down  the older man took a seat with quiet dignity seems like a mighty fine chance dont it ive always wanted to see the coast when do you plan for to pull out  wayland was not deceived by the supervisors casual tone there was something ominously calm in his manner something which expressed an almost dangerous interest in the subject  i havent decided to go at all im still dazed by the suddenness of it i didnt know my father was planning this trip  i see well before you decide to go id like to have a little talk with you my daughter has told me part of what happened to you on the trail i want to know all of it youre young but youve been out in the world and you know what people can say about you and my girl his voice became level and menacing as he added and i dont intend to have her put in wrong on account of you  norcross was quick to reply nobody will dare accuse her of wrongdoing shes a noble girl no one will dare to criticize her for what she could not prevent  you dont know the beldens my girls character will be on trial in every house in the county tomorrow the belden side of it will appear in the city papers sympathy will be with clifford berrie will be made an issue by my enemies theyll get me through her  good lord exclaimed norcross in sudden realization of the gravity of the case what beasts they are  moores gang will seize upon it and work it hard mcfarlane went on with calm insistence they want to bring the district forester down on me this is a fine chance to badger me they will make a great deal of my putting you on the roll our little camping trip is likely to prove a serious matter to us all  surely you dont consider me at fault  worried as he was the father was just no youre not to blameno one is to blame it all dates back to the horses quitting camp but youve got to stand pat nowfor berries sake  but what can i do im at your service what rôle shall i play tell me what to do and i will do it  mcfarlane was staggered but he answered you can at least stay on the ground and help fight this is no time to stampede  youre right ill stay and ill make any statement you see fit ill do anything that will protect berrie  mcfarlane again looked him squarely in the eyes is there aan agreement between you  nothing formalthat isi mean i admire her and i told her he stopped feeling himself on the verge of the irrevocable shes a splendid girl he went on i like her exceedingly but ive known her only a few weeks  mcfarlane interrupted girls are flighty critters he said sadly i dont know why shes taken to you so terrible strong but she has she dont seem to care what people say so long as they do not blame you but if you should pull out you might just as well cut her heart to pieces his voice broke and it was a long time before he could finish youre not at fault i know that but if you can stay on a little while and make it an ounce or two easier for her and for her mother i wish youd do it  wayland extended his hand impulsively of course ill stay i never really thought of leaving in the grip of mcfarlanes hand was something warm and tender  he rose im terribly obliged he said but we mustnt let her suspect for a minute that weve been discussing her she hates being pitied or helped  she shall not experience a moments uneasiness that i can prevent replied the youth and at the moment he meant it  berrie could not be entirely deceived she read in her fathers face a subtle change of line which she related to something wayland had said did he tell you what was in the telegram has he got to go away she asked anxiously  yes he said it was from his father  what does his father want of him  hes on his way to california and wants wayland to go with him but wayland says hes not going  a pang shot through berries heart he mustnt gohe isnt able to go she exclaimed and her pain her fear came out in her sharpened constricted tone i wont let him gotill hes well  mrs mcfarlane gently interposed hell have to go honey if his father needs him  let his father come here she rose and going to his door decisively knocked may i come in she demanded rather than asked before her mother could protest i must see you  wayland opened the door and she entered leaving her parents facing each other in mute helplessness  mrs mcfarlane turned toward her husband with a face of despair shes ours no longer joe our time of bereavement has come  he took her in his arms there there mother dont cry it cant be helped you cut loose from your parents and came to me in just the same way our daughters a grown woman and must have her own life all we can do is to defend her against the coyotes who are busy with her name  but what of him joe he dont care for her as she does for himcant you see that  hell do the right thing mother he told me he would he knows how much depends on his staying here now and he intends to do it  but in the end joe after this scandal is lived down can hewill hemarry her and if he marries her can they live together and be happy his way of life is so different he cant content himself here and she cant fit in where he belongs it all seems hopeless to me wouldnt it be better for her to suffer for a little while now than to make a mistake that may last a lifetime  mebbe it would mother but the decision is not ours shes too strong for us to control shes of age and if she comes to a full understanding of the situation she can decide the question a whole lot better than either of us  thats true she sighed in some ways shes bigger and stronger than both of us sometimes i wish she were not so selfreliant  well thats the way life is sometimes and i reckon theres nothin left for you an me but to draw closer together and try to fill up the empty place shes going to leave between us     xiv  the summons   when wayland caught the startled look on berries face he knew that she had learned from her father the contents of his telegram and that she would require an explanation  are you going away she asked  yes at least i must go down to denver to see my father i shall be gone only over night  and will you tell him about our trip she pursued with unflinching directness and aboutme  he gave her a chair and took a seat himself before replying yes i shall tell him all about it and about you and your father and mother he shall know how kind youve all been to me  he said this bravely and at the moment he meant it but as his fathers big impassive face and cold keen eyes came back to him his courage sank and in spite of his firm resolution some part of his secret anxiety communicated itself to the girl who asked many questions with intent to find out more particularly what kind of man the elder norcross was  waylands replies did not entirely reassure her he admitted that his father was harsh and domineering in character and that he was ambitious to have his son take up and carry forward his work he was willing enough to have me go to college till he found i was specializing on wrong lines then i had to fight in order to keep my place hes glad im out here for he thinks im regaining my strength but just as soon as im well enough he expects me to go to chicago and take charge of the western office of course i dont want to do that id rather work out some problem in chemistry that interests me but i may have to give in for a time at least  will your mother and sisters be with your father  no indeed you couldnt get any one of them west of the hudson river with a logchain my sisters were both born in michigan but they want to forget itthey pretend they have forgotten it they both have newyorkitis nothing but the plaza will do them now  i suppose they think were all injuns out here  oh no not so bad as that but they wouldnt comprehend anything about you except your muscle that would catch em theyd worship your splendid health just as i do its pitiful the way they both try to put on weight theyre always testing some new food some new tonictheyll do anything except exercise regularly and go to bed at ten oclock  all that he said of his family deepened her dismay their interests were so alien to her own  im afraid to have you go even for a day she admitted with simple honesty which moved him deeply i dont know what i should do if you went away i think of nothing but you now  her face was pitiful and he put his arm about her neck as if she were a child you mustnt do that you must go on with your life just as if id never been think of your fathers jobof the forest and the ranch  i cant do it ive lost interest in the service i never want to go into the high country again and i dont want you to go either its too savage and cruel  that is only a mood he said confidently it is splendid up there i shall certainly go back some time  he could not divine and she could not tell him how poignantly she had sensed the menace of the cold and darkness during his illness for the first time in her life she had realized to the full the unrelenting enmity of the clouds the wind the night and during that interminable ride toward home when she saw him bending lower and lower over his saddlebow her allegiance to the trail her devotion to the stirrup was broken his weariness and pain had changed the universe for her never again would she look upon the range with the eyes of the carefree girl the other the civilized the domestic side of her was now dominant a new desire a bigger aspiration had taken possession of her  little by little he realized this change in her and was touched with the wonder of it he had never had any great selflove either as man or scholar and the thought of this fine selfsufficient womanly soul centering all its interests on him was humbling each moment his responsibility deepened and he heard her voice but dimly as she went on  of course we are not rich but we are not poor and my mothers family is one of the oldest in kentucky she uttered this with a touch of her mothers quiet dignity your father need not despise us  so far as my father is concerned family dont count and neither does money but he confidently expects me to take up his business in chicago and i suppose it is my duty to do so if he finds me looking fit he may order me into the ranks at once  ill go thereill do anything you want me to do she urged you can tell your father that ill help you in the office i can learn im ready to use a typewriteranything  he was silent in the face of her naïve expression of selfsacrificing love and after a moment she added hesitatingly i wish i could meet your father perhaps hed come up here if you asked him to do so  he seized upon the suggestion by george i believe he would i dont want to go to town i just believe ill wire him that im laid up here and cant come then a shade of new trouble came over his face how would the stern methodical old business man regard this slovenly ranch and its primitive ways she felt the question in his face  youre afraid to have him come she said with the same disconcerting penetration which had marked every moment of her interview thus far youre afraid he wouldnt like me  with almost equal frankness he replied no i think hed like you but this town and the people up here would gall him order is a religion with him then hes got a vicious slant against all this conservation businesscalls it tommyrot he and your father might lock horns first crack out of the box but ill risk it ill wire him at once  a knock at the door interrupted him and mrs mcfarlanes voice filled with new excitement called out berrie the district office is on the wire  berrie opened the door and confronted her mother who said mr evingham phones that the afternoon papers contain an account of a fight at coal city between settle and one of alec beldens men and that the district forester is coming down to investigate it  let him come answered berrie defiantly he cant do us any harm what was the row about  i didnt hear much of it your father was at the phone  mcfarlane with the receiver to his ear was saying dont know a thing about it mr evingham settle was at the station when i left i didnt know he was going down to coal city no thats a mistake my daughter was never engaged to alec belden alec belden is the older of the brothers and is married i cant go into that just now if you come down ill explain fully  he hung up the receiver and slowly turned toward his wife and daughter this sure is our day of trouble he said with dejected countenance  what is it all about asked berrie  why it seems that after i left yesterday settle rode down the valley with beldens outfit and they all got to drinking ending in a row and tony beat one of beldens men almost to death the sheriff has gone over to get tony and the beldens declare theyre going to railroad him that means well all be brought into it belden has seized the moment to prefer charges against me for keeping settle in the service and for putting a nonresident on the roll as guard the whelp will dig up everything he can to queer me with the office all that kept him from doing it before was cliffs interest in you  he cant make any of his charges stick declared berrie  of course he cant he knows that but he can bring us all into court you and mr norcross will both be called as witnesses for it seems that tony was defending your name the papers call it a fight for a girl oh its a sweet mess  for the first time berrie betrayed alarm what shall we do i cant go on the stand they cant make me do that can they she turned to wayland now you must go away it is a shame to have you mixed up in such a trial  i shall not run away and leave you and the supervisor to bear all the burden of this fight  he anticipated in imaginationas they all didsome of the consequences of this trial the entire story of the camping trip would be dragged in distorted into a scandal and flashed over the country as a disgraceful episode the country would ring with laughter and coarse jest berries testimony would be a feast for courtroom loafers  theres only one thing to do said mcfarlane after a few moments of thought you and berrie and mrs mcfarlane must get out of here before you are subpoenaed  and leave you to fight it out alone exclaimed his wife i shall do nothing of the kind berrie and mr norcross can go  that wont do retorted mcfarlane quickly that wont do at all you must go with them i can take care of myself i will not have you dragged into this muckhole weve got to think quick and act quick there wont be any delay about their side of the game i dont think theyll do anything today but youve got to fade out of the valley you all get ready and ill have one of the boys hook up the surrey as if for a little drive and you can pull out over the old stageroad to flume and catch the narrowgage morning train for denver youve been wanting for some time to go down the line now heres a good time to start  berrie now argued against running away her blood was up she joined her mother we wont leave you to inherit all this trouble who will look after the ranch who will keep house for you  mcfarlane remained firm ill manage dont worry about me just get out of reach the more i consider this thing the more worrisome it gets suppose cliff should come back to testify  he wont if he does ill have him arrested for trying to kill wayland retorted berrie  and make the whole thing worse no you are all going to cross the range you can start out as if for a little turn round the valley and just naturally keep going it cant do any harm and it may save a nasty time in court  one would think we were a lot of criminals remarked wayland  thats the way youll be treated retorted mcfarlane belden has retained old whitby the foulest old brute in the business and hell bring you all into it if he can  but running away from it will not prevent talk argued his wife  not entirely but talk and testimony are two different things suppose they call daughter to the stand do you want her crossexamined as to what basis there was for this gossip they know something of cliffs being let out and that will inflame them he may be at the mill this minute  i guess youre right said norcross sadly our delightful excursion into the forest has led us into a predicament from which there is only one way of escape and that is flight  back of all this talk this argument there remained still unanswered the most vital most important question shall i speak of marriage at this time would it be a source of comfort to them as well as a joy to her at the moment he was ready to speak for he felt himself to be the direct cause of all their embarrassment but closer thought made it clear that a hasty ceremony would only be considered a cloak to cover something illicit ill leave it to the future he decided  mcfarlane was again called to the telephone landon with characteristic brevity conveyed to him the fact that mrs belden was at home and busily phoning scandalous stories about the country if you dont stop her shes going to poison every ear in the valley ended the ranger  youd think theyd all know my daughter well enough not to believe anything mrs belden says responded mcfarlane bitterly  all the boys are ready to do what tony did but nobody can stop this old fools mouth but you cliff has disappeared and that adds to the excitement  thank the boys for me said mcfarlane and tell them not to fight tell em to keep cool it will all be cleared up soon  as mcfarlane went out to order the horses hooked up wayland followed him as far as the bars im consciencesmitten over this thing supervisor for i am aware that i am the cause of all your trouble  dont let that worry you responded the older man but he spoke with effort it cant be helped it was all unavoidable  the most appalling thing to me is the fact that not even your daughters popularity can neutralize the gossip of a woman like mrs belden my being an outsider counts against berrie and im ready to do anythinganything he repeated earnestly i love your daughter mr mcfarlane and im ready to marry her at once if you think best shes a noble girl and i cannot bear to be the cause of her calumniation  there was mist in the supervisors eyes as he turned them on the young man im right glad to hear you say that my boy he reached out his hand and wayland took it i knew youd say the word when the time came i didnt know how strongly she felt toward you till today i knew she liked you of course for she said so but i didnt know that she had plum set her heart on you i didnt expect her to marry a city man buti like you andwell shes the doctor what suits her suits me dont you be afraid of her not meeting all comers he went on after a pause shes never seen much of city life but shell hold her own anywhere you can gamble on that  she has wonderful adaptability i know answered wayland slowly but i dont like to take her away from herefrom you  if you hadnt come she would have married cliffand what kind of a life would she have led with him demanded mcfarlane i knew cliff was rough but i couldnt convince her that he was cheap i live only for her happiness my boy and though i know you will take her away from me i believe you can make her happy and soi give her over to you as to time and place arrange thatwithher mother he turned and walked away unable to utter another word  waylands throat was aching also and he went back into the house with a sense of responsibility which exalted him into sturdier manhood  berea met him in a pretty gown a dress he had never seen her wear a costume which transformed her into something entirely feminine  she seemed to have put away the selfreliant manner of the trail and in its stead presented the lambent gaze the tremulous lips of the bride as he looked at her thus transfigured his heart cast out its hesitancy and he entered upon his new adventure without further question or regret     xv  a matter of millinery   it was three oclock of a fine clear golden afternoon as they said goodby to mcfarlane and started eastward as if for a little drive berrie held the reins in spite of waylands protestations these bronchos are only about half busted she said they need watching i know them better than you do therefore he submitted well knowing that she was entirely competent and fully informed  mrs mcfarlane while looking back at her husband sadly exclaimed i feel like a coward running away like this  forget it mother commanded her daughter cheerily just imagine were off for a short vacation im for going clear through to chicago so long as we must go lets go whooping fathers better off without us  her voice was gay her eyes shining and wayland saw her as she had been that first day in the coachthe carefree laughing girl the trouble they were fleeing from was less real to her than the happiness toward which she rode  her hand on the reins her foot on the brake brought back her confidence but wayland did not feel so sure of his part in the adventure she seemed so unalterably a part of this life so fitted to this landscape that the thought of transplanting her to the east brought uneasiness and question could such a creature of the open air be content with the walls of a city  for several miles the road ran over the level floor of the valley and she urged the team to full speed i dont want to meet anybody if i can help it once we reach the old stage route the chances of being scouted are few nobody uses that road since the broadgauge reached craggs  mrs mcfarlane could not rid herself of the resentment with which she suffered this enforced departure but she had small opportunity to protest for the wagon bumped and clattered over the stony stretches with a motion which confused as well as silenced her it was all so humiliating so unlike the position which she had imagined herself to have attained in the eyes of her neighbors furthermore she was going away without a trunk with only one small bag for herself and berrierunning away like a criminal from an intangible foe however she was somewhat comforted by the gaiety of the young people before her they were indeed jocund as jaybirds with the resiliency of youth they had accepted the situation and were making the best of it  here comes somebody called berrie pulling her ponies to a walk throw a blanket over that valise she was chuckling as if it were all a good joke its old jake proudfoot i can smell him now hang on im going to pass him on the jump  wayland who was riding with his hat in his hand because he could not make it cover his bump held it up as if to keep the wind from his face and so defeated the roundeyed owllike stare of the inquisitive rancher who brought his team to a full stop in order to peer after them muttering in a stupor of resentment and surprise  hell worry himself sick over us predicted berrie hell wonder where were going and what was under that blanket till the end of summer he is as curious as a fool hen  a few minutes more and they were at the fork in the way and leaving the trail to craggs the girl pulled into the grassgrown lesstraveled trail to the south which entered the timber at this point and began to climb with steady grade letting the reins fall slack she turned to her mother with reassuring words there now were safe we wont meet anybody on this road except possibly a movers outfit were in the forest again she added  for two hours they crawled slowly upward with a roaring stream on one side and the pinecovered slopes on the other jays and campbirds called from the trees waterrobins fluttered from rock to rock in the foaming flood squirrels and minute chipmunks raced across the fallen treetrunks or clattered from great boulders and in the peace and order and beauty of the forest they all recovered a serener outlook on the noisome tumult they were leaving behind them invisible as well as inaudible the serpent of slander lost its terror  once as they paused to rest the horses wayland said it is hard to realize that down in that ethereal valley people like old jake and mrs belden have their dwellingplace  this moved mrs mcfarlane to admit that it might all turn out a blessing in disguise mr mcfarlane may resign and move to denver as ive long wanted him to do  i wish he would exclaimed berrie fervently its time you had a rest daddy will hate to quit under fire but hed better do it  peak by peak the bear tooth range rose behind them while before them the smooth grassy slopes of the pass told that they were nearing timberline the air was chill the sun was hidden by old solidor and the stream had diminished to a silent rill winding among sear grass and yellowed willows the valley behind them was vague with mist the southern boundary of the forest was in sight  at last the topmost looming crags of the continental divide cut the skyline and then in the smooth hollow between two rounded grassy summits berrie halted and they all silently contemplated the two worlds to the west and north lay an endless spread of mountains wave on wave snowlined savage sullen in the dying light while to the east and southeast the foothills faded into the plain whose dim cities insubstantial as flecks in a veil of violet mist were hardly distinguishable without the aid of glasses  to the girl there was something splendid something heroical in that majestic menacing landscape to the west in one of its folds she had begun her life in another she had grown to womanhood and selfconfident power the rough men the coarse ungainly women of that land seemed less hateful now that she was leaving them perhaps forever and a confused memory of the many splendid dawns and purple sunsets she had loved filled her thought  wayland divining some part of what was moving in her mind cheerily remarked yes its a splendid place for a summer vacation but a stern place in wintertime and for a lifelong residence it is not inspiring  mrs mcfarlane agreed with him in this estimate it is terribly lonesome in there at times ive had enough of it im ready for the comforts of civilization  berrie turned in her seat and was about to take up the reins when wayland asserted himself wait a moment heres where my dominion begins heres where you change seats with me i am the driver now  she looked at him with questioning smiling glance can you drive its all the way downhilland steep  if i cant ill ask your aid im old enough to remember the family carriage ive even driven a fourinhand  she surrendered her seat doubtfully and smiled to see him take up the reins as if he were starting a fourhorse coach he proved adequate and careful and she was proud of him as with foot on the brake and the bronchos well in hand he swung down the long looping road to the railway she was pleased too by his care of the weary animals easing them down the steepest slopes and sending them along on the comparatively level spots  their descent was rapid but it was long after dark before they reached flume which lay up the valley to the right it was a poor little decaying miningtown set against the hillside and had but one hotel a sunwarped and sagging pine building just above the station  not much like the profile house said wayland as he drew up to the porch but i see no choice  there isnt any berrie assured him  well now he went on i am in command of this expedition from this on i lead this outfit when it comes to hotels railways and the like o that im head ranger  mrs mcfarlane tired hungry and a little dismayed accepted his control gladly but berrie could not at once slip aside her responsibility tell the hostler  not a word commanded norcross and the girl with a smile submitted to his guidance and thereafter his efficiency his selfpossession his tact delighted her he persuaded the sullen landlady to get them supper he secured the best rooms in the house and arranged for the care of the team and when they were all seated around the dim flyspecked oillamp at the end of the crumby diningroom table he discovered such a gay and confident mien that the women looked at each other in surprise  berrie was correspondingly less masculine in drawing off her buckskin drivinggloves she had put away the cowgirl and was silent a little sad even in the midst of her enjoyment of his dictatorship and when he said if my father reaches denver in time i want you to meet him she looked the dismay she felt  ill do itbut im scared of him  you neednt be ill see him first and draw his fire  mrs mcfarlane interposed we must do a little shopping first we cant meet your father as we are  very well ill go with you if youll let me im a great little shopper i have infallible taste so my sisters say if its a case of buying new hats for instance im the final authority with them this amused berrie but her mother took it seriously  of course im anxious to have my daughter make the best possible impression  very well it is arranged we get in i find about noon well go straight to the biggest shop in town if we work with speed well be able to lunch with my father hell be at the palmer house at one  berrie said nothing either in acceptance or rejection of his plan her mind was concerned with new conceptions new relationships and when in the hall he took her face between his hands and said cheer up all is not lost she put her arms about his neck and laid her cheek against his breast to hide her tears oh wayland im such an idiot in the city im afraid your father will despise me  what he said was not very cogent and not in the least literary but it was reassuring and loverlike and when he turned her over to her mother she was composed though unwontedly grave  she woke to a new life next morninga life of compliance of following of dependence upon the judgment of another she stood in silence while her lover paid the bills bought the tickets and telegraphed their coming to his father she acquiesced when he prevented her mother from telephoning to the ranch she complied when he countermanded her order to have the team sent back at once his judgment ruled and she enjoyed her sudden freedom from responsibility it was novel and it was very sweet to think that she was being cared for as she had cared for and shielded him in the world of the trail  in the little railwaycoach which held a score of passengers she found herself among some eastern travelers who had taken the trip up the valley of the flume in the full belief that they were piercing the heart of the rocky mountains it amused wayland almost as much as it amused berrie when one man said to his wife  well im glad weve seen the rockies  he really believes it exclaimed norcross  after an hours ride wayland tactfully withdrew leaving mother and daughter to discuss clothes undisturbed by his presence  we must look our best honey said mrs mcfarlane we will go right to mme crosby at battles and shell fit us out i wish we had more time but we havent so we must do the best we can  i want wayland to choose my hat and travelingsuit replied berrie  of course but youve got to have a lot of other things besides and they bent to the joyous work of making out a list of goods to be purchased as soon as they reached chicago  wayland came back with a denver paper in his hand and a look of disgust on his face its all in hereat least the outlines of it  berrie took the journal and there read the details of settles assault upon the foreman the fight arose from a remark concerning the forest supervisors daughter ranger settle resented the gossip and fell upon the other man beating him with the butt of his revolver friends of the foreman claim that the ranger is a drunken bully and should have been discharged long ago the supervisor for some mysterious reason retains this man although he is an incompetent it is also claimed that mcfarlane put a man on the roll without examination the supervisor was the protagonist of the play which was plainly political the attack upon him was bitter and unjust and mrs mcfarlane again declared her intention of returning to help him in his fight however wayland again proved to her that her presence would only embarrass the supervisor you would not aid him in the slightest degree nash and landon are with him and will refute all these charges  this newspaper story took the light out of their day and the smile from berries lips and the women entered the city silent and distressed in spite of the efforts of their young guide the nearer the girl came to the ordeal of facing the elder norcross the more she feared the outcome but wayland kept his air of easy confidence and drove them directly to the shopping center believing that under the influence of hats and gloves they would regain their customary cheer  in this he was largely justified they had a delightful hour trying on millinery and coats and gloves the forewoman who knew mrs mcfarlane gladly accepted her commission and while suspecting the tender relationship between the girl and the man she was tactful enough to conceal her suspicion the gentleman is right you carry simple things best she remarked to berrie thus showing her own good judgment smartly tailored gray or blue suits are your style  silent blushing tousled by the hands of her decorators berrie permitted hats to be perched on her head and jackets buttoned and unbuttoned about her shoulders till she felt like a worn clotheshorse wayland beamed with delight but she was far less satisfied than he and when at last selection was made she still had her doubts not of the clothes but of her ability to wear them they seemed so alien to her so restrictive and enslaving  youre an easy fitter said the saleswoman buthere she lowered her voiceyou need a new corset this old one is out of date nobody is wearing hips now  thereupon berrie meekly permitted herself to be led away to a tortureroom wayland waited patiently and when she reappeared all traces of bear tooth forest had vanished in a neat tailored suit and a very chic hat with shoes gloves and stockings to match she was so transformed so charmingly girlish in her selfconscious glory that he was tempted to embrace her in the presence of the saleswoman but he didnt he merely said i see the governors finish lets go to lunch you are stunning  i dont know myself responded berrie the only thing that feels natural is my hand they cinched me so tight i cant eat a thing and my shoes hurt she laughed as she said this for her use of the vernacular was conscious im a fraud your father will spot my brand first shot look at my facered as a saddle  dont let that trouble you this is the time of year when tan is fashionable dont you be afraid of the governor just smile at him give him your grip and hell melt  im the one to melt im beginning now  i know how you feel but youll get used to the conventional boilerplate and all the rest of it we all groan and growl when we come back to it each autumn but its a part of being civilized and we submit  notwithstanding his confident advice wayland led the two silent and inwardly dismayed women into the showy café of the hotel with some degree of personal apprehension concerning the approaching interview with his father of course he did not permit this to appear in the slightest degree on the contrary he gaily ordered a choice lunch and did his best to keep his companions from sinking into deeper depression  it pleased him to observe the admiring glances which were turned upon berrie whose hat became her mightily and leaning over he said in a low voice to mrs mcfarlane who is the lovely young lady opposite wont you introduce me  this rejoiced the mother almost as much as it pleased the daughter and she answered she looks like one of the radburns of lexington but i think shes from louisville  this little play being over he said now while our order is coming ill run out to the desk and see if the governor has come in or not     xvi  the private car   after he went away berrie turned to her mother with a look in which humor and awe were blent am i dreaming mother or am i actually sitting here in the city my head is dizzy with it all then without waiting for an answer she fervently added isnt he fine im the tenderfoot now i hope his father wont despise me  with justifiable pride in her child the mother replied he cant help liking you honey you look exactly like your grandmother at this moment meet mr norcross in her spirit  ill try but i feel like a woodchuck out of his hole  mrs mcfarlane continued im glad we were forced out of the valley you might have been shut in there all your life as i have been with your father  you dont blame father do you  not entirely and yet he always was rather easygoing and you know how untidy the ranch is hes always been kindness and sympathy itself but his lack of order is a cross perhaps now he will resign rent the ranch and move over here i should like to live in the city for a while and id like to travel a little  wouldnt it be fine if you could you could live at this hotel if you wanted to yes youre right you need a rest from the ranch and dishwashing  wayland returned with an increase of tension in his face  hes here ive sent word saying i am lunching in the café with ladies i think hell come round but dont be afraid of him hes a good deal rougher on the outside than he is at heart of course hes a bluff old business man and not at all pretty and hell transfix you with a kind of estimating glare as if you were a tree but hes actually very easy to manage if you know how to handle him now im not going to try to explain everything to him at the beginning im going to introduce him to you in a casual kind of way and give him time to take to you both he forms his likes and dislikes very quickly  what if he dont like us inquired berrie with troubled brow  he cant help it his tone was so positive that her eyes misted with happiness but here comes our food i hope you arent too nervous to eat here is where i shine as provider this is the kind of camp fare i can recommend  berries healthy appetite rose above her apprehension and she ate with the keen enjoyment of a child and her mother said it surely is a treat to get a chance at somebody elses cooking  dont you slander your home fare warned wayland its as good as this only different  he sat where he could watch the door and despite his jocund pose his eyes expressed growing impatience and some anxiety they were all well into their dessert before he called out here he is  mrs mcfarlane could not see the newcomer from where she sat but berrie rose in great excitement as a heavyset fullfaced man with short gray mustache and high smooth brow entered the room he did not smile as he greeted his son and his penetrating glance questioned even before he spoke he seemed to silently ask well whats all this how do you happen to be here who are these women  wayland said mrs mcfarlane this is my father father this is miss berea mcfarlane of bear tooth springs  the elder norcross shook hands with mrs mcfarlane politely coldly but he betrayed surprise as berea took his fingers in her grip at his sons solicitation he accepted a seat opposite berea but refused dessert  wayland explained mrs mcfarlane and her daughter quite saved my life over in the valley their ranch is the best health resort in colorado  your complexion indicates that his father responded dryly you look something the way a man of your age ought to look i neednt ask how youre feeling  you neednt but you may im feeling like a new fiddlebarring a bruise at the back of my head which makes a hard hat a burden i may as well tell you first off that mrs mcfarlane is the wife of the forest supervisor at bear tooth and miss berea is the able assistant of her father we are all rank conservationists  norcross senior examined berrie precisely as if his eyes were a couple of xray tubes and as she flushed under his slow scrutiny he said i was not expecting to find the forest service in such hands  wayland laughed  i hope you didnt mash his fingers berrie  she smiled guiltily im afraid i did i hope i didnt hurt yousometimes i forget  norcross senior was waking up you have a most extraordinary grip what did it piano practice  wayland grinned piano nothe cinch  the what  wayland explained miss mcfarlane was brought up on a ranch she can rope and tie a steer saddle her own horse pack an outfit and all the rest of it  oh kind of cowgirl eh  mrs mcfarlane eager to put berries better part forward explained shes our only child mr norcross and as such has been a constant companion to her father shes not all cowhand shes been to school and she can cook and sew as well  he looked from one to the other neither of you correspond exactly to my notions of a foresters wife and daughter  mrs mcfarlane comes from an old kentucky family father her grandfather helped to found a college down there  waylands anxious desire to create a favorable impression of the women did not escape the lumberman but his face remained quite expressionless as he replied  if the life of a cowhand would give you the vigor this young lady appears to possess im not sure but youd better stick to it  wayland and the two women exchanged glances of relief  why not tell him now they seemed to ask but he said theres a long story to tell before we decide on my career lets finish our lunch how is mother and how are the girls  once in the midst of a lame pursuit of other topics the elder norcross again fixed his eyes on berea saying i wish my girls had your weight and color he paused a moment then resumed with weary infliction mrs norcross has always been delicate and all her childreneven her sontake after her ive maintained a private and very expensive hospital for nearly thirty years  this regretful note in his fathers voice gave wayland confidence his spirits rose  come lets adjourn to the parlor and talk things over at our ease  they all followed him and after showing the mother and daughter to their seats near a window he drew his father into a corner and in rapid undertone related the story of his first meeting with berrie of his trouble with young belden of his camping trip minutely describing the encounter on the mountainside and ended by saying with manly directness i would be up there in the mountains in a box if berrie had not intervened shes a noble girl father and is foolish enough to like me and im going to marry her and try to make her happy  the old lumberman who had listened intently all through this impassioned story displayed no sign of surprise at its closing declaration but his eyes explored his sons soul with calm abstraction send her over to me he said at last marriage is a serious matter i want to talk with heralone  wayland went back to the women with an air of victory he wants to see you berrie hes mellowing dont be afraid of him  she might have resented the fathers lack of gallantry but she did not on the contrary she rose and walked resolutely over to where he sat quite ready to defend herself he did not rise to meet her but she did not count that against him for there was nothing essentially rude in his manner he was merely her elder and inert  sit down he said not unkindly i want to have you tell me about my son he has been telling me all about you now lets have your side of the story  she took a seat and faced him with eyes as steady as his own where shall i begin she bluntly challenged  he wants to marry you now it seems to me that seven weeks is very short acquaintance for a decision like that are you sure you want him  yes sir i am her answer was most decided  his voice was slightly cynical as he went on but you were tolerably sure about that other fellowthat rancher with the fancy namewerent you she flushed at this but waited for him to go on dont you think it possible that your fancy for wayland is also temporary  no sir she bravely declared i never felt toward any one the way i do toward wayland hes different i shall never change toward him  her tone her expression of eyes stopped this line of inquiry he took up another now my dear young lady i am a business man as well as a father and the marriage of my son is a weighty matter he is my main dependence i am hoping to have him take up and carry on my business to be quite candid i didnt expect him to select his wife from a colorado ranch i considered him out of the dangerzone i have always understood that women were scarce in the mountains now dont misunderstand me im not one of those fools who are always trying to marry their sons and daughters into the ranks of the idle rich i dont care a hang about social position and ive got money enough for my son and my sons wife but hes all the boy i have and i dont want him to make a mistake  neither do i she answered simply her eyes suffused with tears if i thought he would be sorry  he interrupted again oh you cant tell that now any marriage is a risk i dont say hes making a mistake in selecting you you may be just the woman he needs only i want to be consulted i want to know more about you he tells me you have taken an active part in the management of the ranch and the forest is that true  ive always worked with my fatheryes sir  you like that kind of life  i dont know much about any other kind yes i like it but ive had enough of it im willing to change  well how about city lifehousekeeping and all that  so long as i am with wayland i shant mind what i do or where i live  at the same time you figure hes going to have a large income i suppose hes told you of his rich father hasnt he  berries tone was a shade resentful of his insinuation he has never said much about his family one way or another he only said you wanted him to go into business in chicago and that he wanted to do something else of course i could see by his ways and the clothes he wore that hed been brought up in what wed call luxury but we never inquired into his affairs  and you didnt care  well not that exactly but money dont count for as much with us in the valley as it does in the east wayland seemed so kind of sick and lonesome and i felt sorry for him the first time i saw him i felt like mothering him and then his way of talking of looking at things was so new and beautiful to me i couldnt help caring for him i had never met any one like him i thought he was a lunger  a what  a consumptive that is i did at first and it bothered me it seemed terrible that any one so fine should be condemned like thatand soi did all i could to help him to make him happy i thought he hadnt long to live everything he said and did was wonderful to me like poetry and music and then when he began to grow stronger and i saw that he was going to get well and cliff went on the rampage and showed the yellow streak and i gave him back his ringi didnt know even then how much wayland meant to me but on our trip over the range i understood he meant everything to me he made cliff seem like a savage and i wanted him to know it im not ashamed of loving him i want to make him happy and if he wishes me to be his wife ill go anywhere he saysonly i think he should stay out here till he gets entirely well  the old mans eyes softened during her plea and at its close a slight smile moved the corners of his mouth youve thought it all out i see your mind is clear and your conscience easy well i like your spirit i guess hes right the decision is up to you but if he takes you and stays in colorado he cant expect me to share the profits of my business with him can he hell have to make his own way he rose and held out his hand however im persuaded hes in good hands  she took his hand not knowing just what to reply he examined her fingers with intent gaze  i didnt know any woman could have such a grip he thoughtfully took her biceps in his left hand you are magnificent then in ironical protest he added good god no i cant have you come into my family youd make caricatures of my wife and daughters are all the girls out in the valley like you  she laughed no most of them pride themselves on not being horsewomen mighty few of em ever ride a horse im a kind of a tomboy to them  im sorry to hear that its the same old story i suppose theyd all like to live in the city and wear lownecked gowns and highheeled shoes no i cant consent to your marriage with my son i must save you from corruption go back to the ranch i can see already signs of your deterioration except for your color and that grip you already look like upper broadway the next thing will be a slit skirt and a diamond garter  she flushed redly conscious of her new corset her silk stockings and her pinching shoes its all on the outside she declared under this toggery im the same old trailer it dont take long to get rid of these things im just playing a part todayfor you  he smiled and dropped her hand no no youve said goodby to the cinch i can see that youre on the road to opera boxes and limousines what is your plan what would you advise wayland to do if you knew i was hard against his marrying you come now i can see youre a clearsighted individual what can he do to earn a living how will you live without my aid have you figured on these things  yes im going to ask my father to buy a ranch near here where mother can have more of the comforts of life and where we can all live together till wayland is able to stand city life again then if you want him to go east i will go with him  they had moved slowly back toward the others and as wayland came to meet them norcross said with dry humor i admire your lady of the cinch hand she seems to be a person of singular good nature and most uncommon shrewd  wayland interrupting caught at his fathers hand and wrung it frenziedly im glad  here here a look of pain covered the fathers face thats the fist she put in the press  they all laughed at his joke and then he gravely resumed i say i admire her but its a shame to ask such a girl to marry an invalid like you furthermore i wont have her taken east shed bleach out and lose that grip in a year i wont have her contaminated by the city he mused deeply while looking at his son would life on a wheatranch accessible to this hotel by motorcar be endurable to you  you mean with berea  if shell go mind you i dont advise her to do it he added interrupting his sons outcry i think shes taking all the chances he turned to mrs mcfarlane im oldfashioned in my notions of marriage mrs mcfarlane i grew up when women were helpmates such as i judge youve been of course its all guesswork to me at the moment but i have an impression that my son has fallen into an unusual run of luck as i understand it youre all out for a pleasure trip now my private car is over in the yards and i suggest you all come along with me to california  governor youre a wonder exclaimed wayland  thatll give us time to get better acquainted and if we all like one another just as well when we get backwell well buy the best farm in the north platte and  its a cinch we get that ranch interrupted wayland with a triumphant glance at berea  dont be so sure of it replied the lumberman a private car like a yacht is a terrible test of friendship but his warning held no terrors for the young lovers they had entered upon certainties  the end
