70788235	the beldonald holbein by henry james   chapter i   mrs munden had not yet been to my studio on so good a pretext as when she first intimated that it would be quite open to meshould i only care as she called it to throw the handkerchiefto paint her beautiful sisterinlaw  i neednt go here more than is essential into the question of mrs munden who would really by the way be a story in herself  she has a manner of her own of putting things and some of those she has put to me  her implication was that lady beldonald hadnt only seen and admired certain examples of my work but had literally been prepossessed in favour of the painters personality  had i been struck with this sketch i might easily have imagined her ladyship was throwing me the handkerchief  she hasnt done my visitor said what she ought  do you mean she has done what she oughtnt  nothing horridah dear no  and something in mrs mundens tone with the way she appeared to muse a moment even suggested to me that what she oughtnt was perhaps what lady beldonald had too much neglected  she hasnt got on  whats the matter with her  well to begin with shes american  but i thought that was the way of ways to get on  its one of them  but its one of the ways of being awfully out of it too  there are so many  so many americans i asked  yes plenty of them mrs munden sighed  so many ways i mean of being one  but if your sisterinlaws way is to be beautiful  oh there are different ways of that too  and she hasnt taken the right way  well my friend returned as if it were rather difficult to express she hasnt done with it  i see i laughed what she oughtnt  mrs munden in a manner corrected me but it was difficult to express my brother at all events was certainly selfish  till he died she was almost never in london they wintered year after year for what he supposed to be his healthwhich it didnt help since he was so much too soon to meet his endin the south of france and in the dullest holes he could pick out and when they came back to england he always kept her in the country  i must say for her that she always behaved beautifully since his death she has been more in london but on a stupidly unsuccessful footing  i dont think she quite understands  she hasnt what i should call a life  it may be of course that she doesnt want one  thats just what i cant exactly find out  i cant make out how much she knows  i can easily make out i returned with hilarity how much you do  well youre very horrid  perhaps shes too old  too old for what i persisted  for anything  of course shes no longer even a little young only preservedoh but preserved like bottled fruit in syrup  i want to help her if only because she gets on my nerves and i really think the way of it would be just the right thing of yours at the academy and on the line  but suppose i threw out she should give on my nerves  oh she will  but isnt that all in the days work and dont great beauties always  you dont i interrupted but i at any rate saw lady beldonald later onthe day came when her kinswoman brought her and then i saw how her life must have its centre in her own idea of her appearance  nothing else about her matteredone knew her all when one knew that  shes indeed in one particular i think sole of her kinda person whom vanity has had the odd effect of keeping positively safe and sound  this passion is supposed surely for the most part to be a principle of perversion and of injury leading astray those who listen to it and landing them sooner or later in this or that complication but it has landed her ladyship nowhere whateverit has kept her from the first moment of full consciousness one feels exactly in the same place  it has protected her from every danger has made her absolutely proper and prim  if shes preserved as mrs munden originally described her to me its her vanity that has beautifully done itputting her years ago in a plateglass case and closing up the receptacle against every breath of air  how shouldnt she be preserved when you might smash your knuckles on this transparency before you could crack it  and she isoh amazingly  preservation is scarce the word for the rare condition of her surface  she looks naturally new as if she took out every night her large lovely varnished eyes and put them in water  the thing was to paint her i perceived in the glass casea most tempting attaching feat render to the full the shining interposing plate and the general showwindow effect  it was agreed though it wasnt quite arranged that she should sit to me  if it wasnt quite arranged this was because as i was made to understand from an early stage the conditions from our start must be such as should exclude all elements of disturbance such in a word as she herself should judge absolutely favourable  and it seemed that these conditions were easily imperilled  suddenly for instance at a moment when i was expecting her to meet an appointmentthe firstthat i had proposed i received a hurried visit from mrs munden who came on her behalf to let me know that the season happened just not to be propitious and that our friend couldnt be quite sure to the hour when it would again become so she felt nothing would make it so but a total absence of worry  oh a total absence i said is a large order  we live in a worrying world  yes and she feels exactly thatmore than youd think  its in fact just why she mustnt have as she has now a particular distress on at the very moment  she wants of course to look her best and such things tell on her appearance  i shook my head  nothing tells on her appearance  nothing reaches it in any way nothing gets at it  however i can understand her anxiety but whats her particular distress  why the illness of miss dadd  and who in the worlds miss dadd  her most intimate friend and constant companionthe lady who was with us here that first day  oh the little round black woman who gurgled with admiration  none other  but she was taken ill last week and it may very well be that shell gurgle no more  she was very bad yesterday and is no better today and ninas much upset  if anything happens to miss dadd shell have to get another and though she has had two or three before that wont be so easy  two or three miss dadds is it possible  and still wanting another  i recalled the poor lady completely now  no i shouldnt indeed think it would be easy to get another  but why is a succession of them necessary to lady beldonalds existence  cant you guess  mrs munden looked deep yet impatient  they help  help what  help whom  why every one  you and me for instance  to do what  why to think nina beautiful  she has them for that purpose they serve as foils as accents serve on syllables as terms of comparison  they make her stand out  its an effect of contrast that must be familiar to you artists its what a woman does when she puts a band of black velvet under a pearl ornament that may require as she thinks a little showing off  i wondered  do you mean she always has them black  dear no ive seen them blue green yellow  they may be what they like so long as theyre always one other thing  hideous  mrs munden made a mouth for it  hideous is too much to say she doesnt really require them as bad as that  but consistently cheerfully loyally plain  its really a most happy relation  she loves them for it  and for what do they love her  why just for the amiability that they produce in her  then also for their home  its a career for them  i see  but if thats the case i asked why are they so difficult to find  oh they must be safe its all in that her being able to depend on them to keep to the terms of the bargain and never have moments of risingas even the ugliest woman will now and then say when shes in lovesuperior to themselves  i turned it over  then if they cant inspire passions the poor things maynt even at least feel them  she distinctly deprecates it  thats why such a man as you may be after all a complication  i continued to brood  youre very sure miss dadds ailment isnt an affection that being smothered has struck in  my joke however wasnt well timed for i afterwards learned that the unfortunate ladys state had been even while i spoke such as to forbid all hope  the worst symptoms had appeared she was destined not to recover and a week later i heard from mrs munden that she would in fact gurgle no more     chapter ii   all this had been for lady beldonald an agitation so great that access to her apartment was denied for a time even to her sisterinlaw  it was much more out of the question of course that she should unveil her face to a person of my special business with it so that the question of the portrait was by common consent left to depend on that of the installation of a successor to her late companion  such a successor i gathered from mrs munden widowed childless and lonely as well as inapt for the minor offices she had absolutely to have a more or less humble alter ago to deal with the servants keep the accounts make the tea and watch the windowblinds  nothing seemed more natural than that she should marry again and obviously that might come yet the predecessors of miss dadd had been contemporaneous with a first husband so that others formed in her image might be contemporaneous with a second  i was much occupied in those months at any rate and these questions and their ramifications losing themselves for a while to my view i was only brought back to them by mrs mundens arrival one day with the news that we were all right againher sisterinlaw was once more suited  a certain mrs brash an american relative whom she hadnt seen for years but with whom she had continued to communicate was to come out to her immediately and this person it appeared could be quite trusted to meet the conditions she was uglyugly enough without abuse of it and was unlimitedly good the position offered her by lady beldonald was moreover exactly what she needed widowed also after many troubles and reverses with her fortune of the smallest and her various children either buried or placed about she had never had time or means to visit england and would really be grateful in her declining years for the new experience and the pleasant light work involved in her cousins hospitality  they had been much together early in life and lady beldonald was immensely fond of herwould in fact have tried to get hold of her before hadnt mrs brash been always in bondage to family duties to the variety of her tribulations  i daresay i laughed at my friends use of the term positionthe position one might call it of a candlestick or a signpost and i daresay i must have asked if the special service the poor lady was to render had been made clear to her  mrs munden left me in any case with the rather droll image of her faring forth across the sea quite consciously and resignedly to perform it  the point of the communication had however been that my sitter was again looking up and would doubtless on the arrival and due initiation of mrs brash be in form really to wait on me  the situation must further to my knowledge have developed happily for i arranged with mrs munden that our friend now all ready to begin but wanting first just to see the things i had most recently done should come once more as a final preliminary to my studio  a good foreign friend of mine a french painter paul outreau was at the moment in london and i had proposed as he was much interested in types to get together for his amusement a small afternoon party  every one came my big room was full there was music and a modest spread and ive not forgotten the light of admiration in outreaus expressive face as at the end of half an hour he came up to me in his enthusiasm  bonte divine mon cherque cette vieille est donc belle  i had tried to collect all the beauty i could and also all the youth so that for a moment i was at a loss  i had talked to many people and provided for the music and there were figures in the crowd that were still lost to me  what old woman do you mean  i dont know her nameshe was over by the door a moment ago  i asked somebody and was told i think that shes american  i looked about and saw one of my guests attach a pair of fine eyes to outreau very much as if she knew he must be talking of her  oh lady beldonald  yes shes handsome but the great point about her is that she has been put up to keep and that she wouldnt be flattered if she knew you spoke of her as old  a box of sardines is old only after it has been opened lady beldonald never has yet beenbut im going to do it  i joked but i was somewhat disappointed  it was a type that with his unerring sense for the banal i shouldnt have expected outreau to pick out  youre going to paint her  but my dear man she is paintedand as neither you nor i can do it  ou estelle donc  he had lost her and i saw i had made a mistake shes the greatest of all the great holbeins  i was relieved  ah then not lady beldonald  but do i possess a holbein of any price unawares  there she isthere she is  dear dear dear what a head  and i saw whom he meantand what a small old lady in a black dress and a black bonnet both relieved with a little white who had evidently just changed her place to reach a corner from which more of the room and of the scene was presented to her  she appeared unnoticed and unknown and i immediately recognised that some other guest must have brought her and for want of opportunity had as yet to call my attention to her  but two things simultaneously with this and with each other struck me with force one of them the truth of outreaus description of her the other the fact that the person bringing her could only have been lady beldonald  she was a holbeinof the first water yet she was also mrs brash the imported foil the indispensable accent the successor to the dreary miss dadd  by the time i had put these things togetheroutreaus american having helped mei was in just such full possession of her face as i had found myself on the other first occasion of that of her patroness  only with so different a consequence  i couldnt look at her enough and i stared and stared till i became aware she might have fancied me challenging her as a person unpresented  all the same outreau went on equally held cest une tete a faire  if i were only staying long enough for a crack at her but i tell you whatand he seized my armbring her over  over  to paris  shed have a succes fou  ah thanks my dear fellow i was now quite in a position to say shes the handsomest thing in london andfor what i might do with her was already before me with intensityi propose to keep her to myself  it was before me with intensity in the light of mrs brashs distant perfection of a little white old face in which every wrinkle was the touch of a master but something else i suddenly felt was not less so for lady beldonald in the other quarter and though she couldnt have made out the subject of our notice continued to fix us and her eyes had the challenge of those of the woman of consequence who has missed something  a moment later i was close to her apologising first for not having been more on the spot at her arrival but saying in the next breath uncontrollably why my dear lady its a holbein  a holbein  what  why the wonderful sharp old face so extraordinarily consummately drawnin the frame of black velvet  that of mrs brash i meanisnt it her nameyour companion  this was the beginning of a most odd matterthe essence of my anecdote and i think the very first note of the oddity must have sounded for me in the tone in which her ladyship spoke after giving me a silent look  it seemed to come to me out of a distance immeasurably removed from holbein mrs brash isnt my companion in the sense you appear to mean  shes my rather near relation and a very dear old friend  i love herand you must know her  know her  rather  why to see her is to want on the spot to go for her  she also must sit for me  she  louisa brash  if lady beldonald had the theory that her beauty directly showed it when things werent well with her this impression which the fixed sweetness of her serenity had hitherto struck me by no means as justifying gave me now my first glimpse of its grounds  it was as if i had never before seen her face invaded by anything i should have called an expression  this expression moreover was of the faintestwas like the effect produced on a surface by an agitation both deep within and as yet much confused  have you told her so she then quickly asked as if to soften the sound of her surprise  dear no ive but just noticed heroutreau a moment ago put me on her but were both so taken and he also wants  to paint her lady beldonald uncontrollably murmured  dont be afraid we shall fight for her i returned with a laugh for this tone  mrs brash was still where i could see her without appearing to stare and she mightnt have seen i was looking at her though her protectress im afraid could scarce have failed of that certainty  we must each take our turn and at any rate shes a wonderful thing so that if youll let her go to paris outreau promises her there  there my companion gasped  a career bigger still than among us as he considers we havent half their eye  he guarantees her a succes fou  she couldnt get over it  louisa brash  in paris  they do see i went on more than we and they live extraordinarily dont you know in that  but shell do something here too  and what will she do  if frankly now i couldnt help giving mrs brash a longer look so after it i could as little resist sounding my converser  youll see  only give her time  she said nothing during the moment in which she met my eyes but then time it seems to me is exactly what you and your friend want  if you havent talked with her  we havent seen her  oh we see bang offwith a click like a steel spring  its our trade its our life and we should be donkeys if we made mistakes  thats the way i saw you yourself my lady if i may say so thats the way with a long pin straight through your body ive got you  and just so ive got her  all this for reasons had brought my guest to her feet but her eyes had while we talked never once followed the direction of mine  you call her a holbein  outreau did and i of course immediately recognised it  dont you  she brings the old boy to life  its just as i should call you a titian  you bring him to life  she couldnt be said to relax because she couldnt be said to have hardened but something at any rate on this took place in hersomething indeed quite disconnected from what i would have called her  dont you understand that she has always been supposed  it had the ring of impatience nevertheless it stopped short on a scruple  i knew what it was however well enough to say it for her if she preferred  to be nothing whatever to look at  to be unfortunately plainor even if you like repulsively ugly  oh yes i understand it perfectly just as i understandi have to as a part of my trademany other forms of stupidity  its nothing new to one that ninetynine people out of a hundred have no eyes no sense no taste  there are whole communities impenetrably sealed  i dont say your friends a person to make the men turn round in regent street  but it adds to the joy of the few who do see that they have it so much to themselves  where in the world can she have lived  you must tell me all about thator rather if shell be so good she must  you mean then to speak to her  i wondered as she pulled up again  of her beauty  her beauty cried lady beldonald so loud that two or three persons looked round  ah with every precaution of respect i declared in a much lower tone but her back was by this time turned to me and in the movement as it were one of the strangest little dramas ive ever known was well launched     chapter iii   it was a drama of small smothered intensely private things and i knew of but one other person in the secret yet that person and i found it exquisitely susceptible of notation followed it with an interest the mutual communication of which did much for our enjoyment and were present with emotion at its touching catastrophe  the small casefor so small a casehad made a great stride even before my little party separated and in fact within the next ten minutes  in that space of time two things had happened one of which was that i made the acquaintance of mrs brash and the other that mrs munden reached me cleaving the crowd with one of her usual pieces of news what she had to impart was that on her having just before asked nina if the conditions of our sitting had been arranged with me nina had replied with something like perversity that she didnt propose to arrange them that the whole affair was off again and that she preferred not to be further beset for the present  the question for mrs munden was naturally what had happened and whether i understood  oh i understood perfectly and what i at first most understood was that even when i had brought in the name of mrs brash intelligence wasnt yet in mrs munden  she was quite as surprised as lady beldonald had been on hearing of the esteem in which i held mrs brashs appearance  she was stupefied at learning that i had just in my ardour proposed to its proprietress to sit to me  only she came round promptlywhich lady beldonald really never did  mrs munden was in fact wonderful for when i had given her quickly why shes a holbein you know absolutely she took it up after a first fine vacancy with an immediate abysmal oh is she that as a piece of social gymnastics did her the greatest honour and she was in fact the first in london to spread the tidings for a faceabout it was magnificent  but she was also the first i must add to see what would really happenthough this she put before me only a week or two later  it will kill her my dearthats what it will do  she meant neither more nor less than that it would kill lady beldonald if i were to paint mrs brash for at this lurid light had we arrived in so short a space of time  it was for me to decide whether my aesthetic need of giving life to my idea was such as to justify me in destroying it in a woman after all in most eyes so beautiful  the situation was indeed sufficiently queer for it remained to be seen what i should positively gain by giving up mrs brash  i appeared to have in any case lost lady beldonald now too upsetit was always mrs mundens word about her and as i inferred her own about herselfto meet me again on our previous footing  the only thing i of course soon saw was to temporise to drop the whole question for the present and yet so far as possible keep each of the pair in view  i may as well say at once that this plan and this process gave their principal interest to the next several months  mrs brash had turned up if i remember early in the new year and her little wonderful career was in our particular circle one of the features of the following season  it was at all events for myself the most attaching its not my fault if i am so put together as often to find more life in situations obscure and subject to interpretation than in the gross rattle of the foreground  and there were all sorts of things things touching amusing mystifyingand above all such an instance as i had never yet metin this funny little fortune of the useful american cousin  mrs munden was promptly at one with me as to the rarity and to a near and human view the beauty and interest of the position  we had neither of us ever before seen that degree and that special sort of personal success come to a woman for the first time so late in life  i found it an example of poetic of absolutely retributive justice so that my desire grew great to work it as we say on those lines  i had seen it all from the original moment at my studio the poor lady had never known an hours appreciationwhich moreover in perfect good faith she had never missed  the very first thing i did after inducing so unintentionally the resentful retreat of her protectress had been to go straight over to her and say almost without preliminaries that i should hold myself immeasurably obliged for a few patient sittings what i thus came face to face with was on the instant her whole unenlightened past and the full if foreshortened revelation of what among us all was now unfailingly in store for her  to turn the handle and start that tune came to me on the spot as a temptation  here was a poor lady who had waited for the approach of old age to find out what she was worth  here was a benighted being to whom it was to be disclosed in her fiftyseventh yeari was to make that outthat she had something that might pass for a face  she looked much more than her age and was fairly frightenedas if i had been trying on her some possibly heartless london trickwhen she had taken in my appeal  that showed me in what an air she had lived andas i should have been tempted to put it had i spoken outamong what children of darkness  later on i did them more justice saw more that her wonderful points must have been points largely the fruit of time and even that possibly she might never in all her life have looked so well as at this particular moment  it might have been that if her hour had struck i just happened to be present at the striking  what had occurred all the same was at the worst a notable comedy  the famous irony of fate takes many forms but i had never yet seen it take quite this one  she had been had over on an understanding and she wasnt playing fair  she had broken the law of her ugliness and had turned beautiful on the hands of her employer  more interesting even perhaps than a view of the conscious triumph that this might prepare for her and of which had i doubted of my own judgement i could still take outreaus fine start as the full guaranteemore interesting was the question of the process by which such a history could get itself enacted the curious thing was that all the while the reasons of her having passed for plainthe reasons for lady beldonalds fond calculation which they quite justifiedwere written large in her face so large that it was easy to understand them as the only ones she herself had ever read  what was it then that actually made the old stale sentence mean something so differentinto what new combinations what extraordinary language unknown but understood at a glance had time and life translated it  the only thing to be said was that time and life were artists who beat us all working with recipes and secrets we could never find out  i really ought to have like a lecturer or a showman a chart or a blackboard to present properly the relation in the wonderful old tender battered blanched face between the original elements and the exquisite final style  i could do it with chalks but i can scarcely do it with words however the thing was for any artist who respected himself to feel itwhich i abundantly did and then not to conceal from her i felt itwhich i neglected as little  but she was really to do her complete justice the last to understand and im not sure that to the endfor there was an endshe quite made it all out or knew where she was  when youve been brought up for fifty years on black it must be hard to adjust your organism at a days notice to goldcolour  her whole nature had been pitched in the key of her supposed plainness  she had known how to be uglyit was the only thing she had learnt save if possible how not to mind it  being beautiful took in any case a new set of muscles  it was on the prior conviction literally that she had developed her admirable dress instinctively felicitous always either black or white and a matter of rather severe squareness and studied line  she was magnificently neat everything she showed had a way of looking both old and fresh and there was on every occasion the same picture in her draped headdraped in lowfalling blackand the fine white plaits of a painters white somehow disposed on her chest  what had happened was that these arrangements determined by certain considerations lent themselves in effect much better to certain others  adopted in mere shy silence they had really only deepened her accent  it was singular moreover that so constituted there was nothing in her aspect of the ascetic or the nun  she was a good hard sixteenthcentury figure not withered with innocence bleached rather by life in the open  she was in short just what we had made of her a holbein for a great museum and our position mrs mundens and mine rapidly became that of persons having such a treasure to dispose of  the worldi speak of course mainly of the artworldflocked to see it     chapter iv   but has she any idea herself poor thing was the way i had put it to mrs munden on our next meeting after the incident at my studio with the effect however only of leaving my friend at first to take me as alluding to mrs brashs possible prevision of the chatter she might create  i had my own sense of thatthis provision had been nil the question was of her consciousness of the office for which lady beldonald had counted on her and for which we were so promptly proceeding to spoil her altogether  oh i think she arrived with a goodish notion mrs munden had replied when i had explained for shes clever too you know as well as good looking and i dont see how if she ever really knew nina she could have supposed for a moment that she wasnt wanted for whatever she might have left to give up  hasnt she moreover always been made to feel that shes ugly enough for anything  it was even at this point already wonderful how my friend had mastered the case and what lights alike for its past and its future she was prepared to throw on it  if she has seen herself as ugly enough for anything she has seen herselfand that was the only wayas ugly enough for nina and she has had her own manner of showing that she understands without making nina commit herself to anything vulgar  women are never without ways for doing such thingsboth for communicating and receiving knowledgethat i cant explain to you and that you wouldnt understand if i could since you must be a woman even to do that  i daresay theyve expressed it all to each other simply in the language of kisses  but doesnt it at any rate make something rather beautiful of the relation between them as affected by our discovery  i had a laugh for her plural possessive  the point is of course that if there was a conscious bargain and our action on mrs brash is to deprive her of the sense of keeping her side of it various things may happen that wont be good either for her or for ourselves  she may conscientiously throw up the position  yes my companion musedfor she is conscientious  or nina without waiting for that may cast her forth  i faced it all  then we should have to keep her  as a regular model mrs munden was ready for anything  oh that would be lovely  but i further worked it out  the difficulty is that shes not a model hang itthat shes too good for one that shes the very thing herself when outreau and i have each had our go that will be all therell be nothing left for any one else  therefore it behoves us quite to understand that our attitudes a responsibility  if we cant do for her positively more than nina does  we must let her alone  my companion continued to muse  i see  yet dont i returned see too much  we can do more  than nina she was again on the spot  it wouldnt after all be difficult  we only want the directly opposite thingand which is the only one the poor dear can give  unless indeed she suggested we simply retractwe back out  i turned it over  its too late for that  whether mrs brashs peace is gone i cant say  but ninas is  yes and theres no way to bring it back that wont sacrifice her friend  we cant turn round and say mrs brash is ugly can we  but fancy ninas not having seen mrs munden exclaimed  she doesnt see now i answered  she cant im certain make out what we mean  the woman for her still is just what she always was but she has nevertheless had her stroke and her blindness while she wavers and gropes in the dark only adds to her discomfort  her blow was to see the attention of the world deviate  all the same i dont think you know my interlocutress said that nina will have made her a scene or that whatever we do shell ever make her one  that isnt the way it will happen for shes exactly as conscientious as mrs brash  then what is the way i asked  it will just happen in silence  and what will it as you call it be  isnt that what we want really to see  well i replied after a turn or two about whether we want it or not its exactly what we shall see which is a reason the more for fancying between the pair therein the quiet exquisite house and full of superiorities and suppressions as they both arethe extraordinary situation  if i said just now that its too late to do anything but assent its because ive taken the full measure of what happened at my studio  it took but a few momentsbut she tasted of the tree  my companion wondered  nina  mrs brash  and to have to put it so ministered while i took yet another turn to a sort of agitation  our attitude was a responsibility  but i had suggested something else to my friend who appeared for a moment detached  should you say shell hate her worse if she doesnt see  lady beldonald  doesnt see what we see you mean than if she does  ah i give that up i laughed  but what i can tell you is why i hold that as i said just now we can do most  we can do this we can give to a harmless and sensitive creature hitherto practically disinheritedand give with an unexpectedness that will immensely add to its pricethe pure joy of a deep draught of the very pride of life of an acclaimed personal triumph in our superior sophisticated world  mrs munden had a glow of response for my sudden eloquence  oh it will be beautiful     chapter v   well thats what on the whole and in spite of everything it really was  it has dropped into my memory a rich little gallery of pictures a regular panorama of those occasions that were to minister to the view from which i had so for a moment extracted a lyric inspiration  i see mrs brash on each of these occasions practically enthroned and surrounded and more or less mobbed see the hurrying and the nudging and the pressing and the staring see the people making up and introduced and catch the word when they have had their turn hear it above all the great oneah yes the famous holbeinpassed about with that perfection of promptitude that makes the motions of the london mind so happy a mixture of those of the parrot and the sheep  nothing would be easier of course than to tell the whole little tale with an eye only for that silly side of it great was the silliness but great also as to this case of poor mrs brash i will say for it the good nature  of course furthermore it took in particular our set with its positive child terror of the banal to be either so foolish or so wise though indeed ive never quite known where our set begins and ends and have had to content myself on this score with the indication once given me by a lady next whom i was placed at dinner oh its bounded on the north by ibsen and on the south by sargent  mrs brash never sat to me she absolutely declined and when she declared that it was quite enough for her that i had with that fine precipitation invited her i quite took this as she meant it before we had gone very far our understanding hers and mine was complete  her attitude was as happy as her success was prodigious the sacrifice of the portrait was a sacrifice to the true inwardness of lady beldonald and did much for the time i divined toward muffling their domestic tension  all it was thus in her power to sayand i heard of a few cases of her having said itwas that she was sure i would have painted her beautifully if she hadnt prevented me  she couldnt even tell the truth which was that i certainly would have done so if lady beldonald hadnt and she never could mention the subject at all before that personage  i can only describe the affair naturally from the outside and heaven forbid indeed that i should try too closely to reconstruct the possible strange intercourse of these good friends at home  my anecdote however would lose half the point it may have to show were i to omit all mention of the consummate turn her ladyship appeared gradually to have found herself able to give her deportment  she had made it impossible i should myself bring up our old our original question but there was real distinction in her manner of now accepting certain other possibilities  let me do her that justice her effort at magnanimity must have been immense  there couldnt fail of course to be ways in which poor mrs brash paid for it  how much she had to pay we were in fact soon enough to see and its my intimate conviction that as a climax her life at last was the price  but while she lived at leastand it was with an intensity for those wondrous weeks of which she had never dreamedlady beldonald herself faced the music  this is what i mean by the possibilities by the sharp actualities indeed that she accepted  she took our friend out she showed her at home never attempted to hide or to betray her played her no trick whatever so long as the ordeal lasted  she drank deep on her side too of the cupthe cup that for her own lips could only be bitterness  there was i think scarce a special success of her companions at which she wasnt personally present  mrs mundens theory of the silence in which all this would be muffled for them was none the less and in abundance confirmed by our observations  the whole thing was to be the death of one or the other of them but they never spoke of it at tea  i remember even that nina went so far as to say to me once looking me full in the eyes quite sublimely ive made out what you meanshe is a picture the beauty of this moreover was that as im persuaded she hadnt really made it out at allthe words were the mere hypocrisy of her reflective endeavour for virtue  she couldnt possibly have made it out her friend was as much as ever dreadfully plain to her she must have wondered to the last what on earth possessed us  wouldnt it in fact have been after all just this failure of vision this supreme stupidity in short that kept the catastrophe so long at bay  there was a certain sense of greatness for her in seeing so many of us so absurdly mistaken and i recall that on various occasions and in particular when she uttered the words just quoted this high serenity as a sign of the relief of her soreness if not of the effort of her conscience did something quite visible to my eyes and also quite unprecedented for the beauty of her face  she got a real lift from itsuch a momentary discernible sublimity that i recollect coming out on the spot with a queer crude amused do you know i believe i could paint you now  she was a fool not to have closed with me then and there for what has happened since has altered everythingwhat was to happen a little later was so much more than i could swallow  this was the disappearance of the famous holbein from one day to the otherproducing a consternation among us all as great as if the venus of milo had suddenly vanished from the louvre  she has simply shipped her straight backthe explanation was given in that form by mrs munden who added that any cord pulled tight enough would end at last by snapping  at the snap in any case we mightily jumped for the masterpiece we had for three or four months been living with had made us feel its presence as a luminous lesson and a daily need  we recognised more than ever that it had been for high finish the gem of our collectionwe found what a blank it left on the wall  lady beldonald might fill up the blank but we couldnt  that she did soon fill it upand heaven help us how was put before me after an interval of no great length but during which i hadnt seen her  i dined on the christmas of last year at mrs mundens and nina with a scratch lot as our hostess said was there so that the preliminary wait being longish she could approach me very sweetly  ill come to you tomorrow if you like she said and the effect of it after a first stare at her was to make me look all round  i took in by these two motions two things one of which was that though now again so satisfied herself of her high state she could give me nothing comparable to what i should have got had she taken me up at the moment of my meeting her on her distinguished concession the other that she was suited afresh and that mrs brashs successor was fully installed  mrs brashs successor was at the other side of the room and i became conscious that mrs munden was waiting to see my eyes seek her  i guessed the meaning of the wait what was one this time to say  oh first and foremost assuredly that it was immensely droll for this time at least there was no mistake the lady i looked upon and as to whom my friend again quite at sea appealed to me for a formula was as little a holbein or a specimen of any other school as she was like lady beldonald herself a titian  the formula was easy to give for the amusement was that her prettinessyes literally prodigiously her prettinesswas distinct  lady beldonald had been magnificenthad been almost intelligent  miss whatshername continues pretty continues even young and doesnt matter a straw  she matters so ideally little that lady beldonald is practically safer i judge than she has ever been  there hasnt been a symptom of chatter about this person and i believe her protectress is much surprised that were not more struck  it was at any rate strictly impossible to me to make an appointment for the day as to which i have just recorded ninas proposal and the turn of events since then has not quickened my eagerness  mrs munden remained in correspondence with mrs brashto the extent that is of three letters each of which she showed me  they so told to our imagination her terrible little story that we were quite preparedor thought we werefor her going out like a snuffed candle  she resisted on her return to her original conditions less than a year the taste of the tree as i had called it had been fatal to her what she had contentedly enough lived without before for half a century she couldnt now live without for a day  i know nothing of her original conditionssome minor american citysave that for her to have gone back to them was clearly to have stepped out of her frame  we performed mrs munden and i a small funeral service for her by talking it all over and making it all out  it wasntthe minor american citya market for holbeins and what had occurred was that the poor old picture banished from its museum and refreshed by the rise of no new movement to hang it was capable of the miracle of a silent revolution of itself turning in its dire dishonour its face to the wall  so it stood without the intervention of the ghost of a critic till they happened to pull it round again and find it mere dead paint  well it had had if thats anything its season of fame its name on a thousand tongues and printed in capitals in the catalogue we hadnt been at fault  i havent all the same the least note of hernot a scratch  and i did her so in intention  mrs munden continues to remind me however that this is not the sort of rendering with which on the other side after all lady beldonald proposes to content herself  she has come back to the question of her own portrait let me settle it then at last  since she will have the real thingwell hang it she shall
