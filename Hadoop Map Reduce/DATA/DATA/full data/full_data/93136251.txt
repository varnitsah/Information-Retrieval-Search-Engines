round his      throat and a dark norfolk jacket on his back is playing the      flute before a very large framed photograph of a woman which is      the only picture on the walls  his age is about thirtyfive his      figure thin and very upright and his cleanshorn face thin      upright narrow with long and rather pointed ears his dark      hair is brushed in a coxcomb off his forehead  a faint smile      hovers about his lips that nature has made rather full and he      has made thin as though keeping a hard secret but his bright      grey eyes dark round the rim look out and upwards almost as if      he were being crucified  there is something about the whole of      him that makes him seen not quite present  a gentle creature      burnt within       a low broad window above a windowseat forms the background to      his figure and through its lattice panes are seen the outer      gate and yewtrees of a churchyard and the porch of a church      bathed in may sunlight  the front door at right angles to the      windowseat leads to the village green and a door on the left      into the house       it is the third movement of veracinis violin sonata that      strangway plays  his back is turned to the door into the house      and he does not hear when it is opened and ivy burlacombe the      farmers daughter a girl of fourteen small and quiet as a      mouse comes in a prayerbook in one hand and in the other a      gloss of water with wild orchis and a bit of deep pink      hawthorn  she sits down on the windowseat and having opened      her book sniffs at the flowers  coming to the end of the      movement strangway stops and looking up at the face on the      wall heaves a long sigh  ivy  from the seat i picked these for yu mr strangway  strangway

a fair stolid blueeyed saxon both about sixteen      come in through the front door behind which they have evidently      been listening  they too have prayerbooks in their hands      they sidle past ivy and also sit down under the window  gladys  mercys comin mr strangway  strangway  good morning gladys good morning connie       he turns to a bookcase on a table against the far wall and      taking out a book finds his place in it  while he stands thus      with his back to the girls mercy jarland comes in from the      green  she also is about sixteen with fair hair and chinablue      eyes  she glides in quickly hiding something behind her and      sits down on the seat next the door  and at once there is a      whispering  strangway  turning to them good morning mercy  mercy  good

windowcurtain  a woman has entered      who is clearly the original of the large photograph  she is not      strictly pretty but there is charm in her pale resolute face      with its mocking lips flexible brows and greenish eyes whose      lids square above them have short dark lashes  she is      dressed in blue and her fair hair is coiled up under a cap and      motorveil  she comes in swiftly and closes the door behind      her becomes irresolute then suddenly deciding moves towards      the door into the house  mercy slips from behind her curtain to      make off but at that moment the door into the house is opened      and she has at once to slip back again into covert  it is ivy      who has appeared  ivy  amazed  oh  mrs strangway       evidently disconcerted by this

out      through the halfopen church door  figures are lurking or      moving stealthilypeople waiting and listening to the sound of      a voice speaking in the church words that are inaudible      excited whispering and faint giggles come from the deepest      yewtree shade made ghostly by the white faces and the frocks of      young girls continually flitting up and back in the blackness a      girls figure comes flying out from the porch down the path of      light and joins the stealthy group  whispering voice of mercy  wheres e got to now gladys  whispering voice of gladys  eve just

hsssh  quiet yu maids  the voice has      ceased speaking in the church  there is a moments dead      silence  the voice speaks again then from the wheezy little      organ come the first faint chords of a hymn  gladys  nearer my god to thee  voice of mercy  twill be funny with no one ardly singin       the sound of the old hymn sung by just six voices comes out to      them rather sweet and clear  gladys  softly  tis pretty tu  why  theyre only singin one verse       a moments silence and the voice speaks uplifted pronouncing      the blessing the peace of god as the last words die away      dark figures from the inn approach over the grass till quite a      crowd seems standing there without a word spoken  then from out      of the church porch come the congregation  tim clyst first

vestry to the church porch  he stands plainly visible in the      lighted porch locking the door then steps forward  just as he      reaches the edge of the porch a low hiss breaks the silence      it swells very gradually into a long hissing groan  strangway      stands motionless his hand over his eyes staring into the      darkness  a girls figure can be seen to break out of the      darkness and rush away  when at last the groaning has died into      sheer expectancy strangway drops his hand  strangway  in a loco voice  yes  im glad  is jarland there  freman  hes ereno thanks to yu  hsss

 takes it from the wall and lays it face upwards on the window      seat  strangway  to himself  gone  what is there now       the sound of an owls hooting is floating in and of voices      from the

the sound of scrabbling at the hitch of the side door      and strangway comes into the nearly dark barn  out in the night      the owl is still hooting  he closes the door and that sound is      lost  like a man walking in his sleep he goes up to the      ladder takes the rope in his hand and makes a noose  he can      be heard breathing and in the darkness the motions of his hands      are dimly seen freeing his throat and putting the noose round      his neck  he stands swaying to and fro at the foot of the      ladder then with a sigh sets his foot on it to mount  one of      the big doors creaks and opens in the wind letting in a broad      path of moonlight       strangway stops freeing his neck from the noose he walks      quickly up the track of moonlight whitened from head to foot      to close the doors       the sound of his boots on the bare floor has awakened tibby      jarland  struggling out of her hay nest she stands staring at      his whitened figure and bursts suddenly into a wail  tibby  ooh  mercy  where are yu  im frightened  im frightened  ooooo  strangway  turningstartled  whos that  who is it  tibby  ooh  a ghosty  ooooo  strangway  going to her quickly  its

footsteps a man clears his throat close by  strangway  whos that  cremer  jack cremer  the big mans figure appears out of the shadow of the barn  that yu zurr  strangway  yes jack  how goes it  cremer

against the lintel of the door looking at the moon that quite      full and golden hangs not far above the straight horizon where      the trees stand small in a row  strangway  lifting his hand in the gesture of prayer  god of the moon and the sun of joy and beauty of loneliness and sorrowgive me strength to go on till i love every living thing       he moves away following jack cremer  the full moon shines      the owl hoots and some one is shaking tibbys tambourine
