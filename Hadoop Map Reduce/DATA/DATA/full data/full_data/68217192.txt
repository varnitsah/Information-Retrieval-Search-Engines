68217192	the cricket on the hearth by charles dickens  illustrated by george alfred williams  new york the platt  peck co  copyright 1905 by the baker  taylor company     introduction   the combined qualities of the realist and the idealist which dickens possessed to a remarkable degree together with his naturally jovial attitude toward life in general seem to have given him a remarkably happy feeling toward christmas though the privations and hardships of his boyhood could have allowed him but little real experience with this day of days  dickens gave his first formal expression to his christmas thoughts in his series of small books the first of which was the famous christmas carol the one perfect chrysolite the success of the book was immediate thackeray wrote of it who can listen to objections regarding such a book as this it seems to me a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it a personal kindness  this volume was put forth in a very attractive manner with illustrations by john leech who was the first artist to make these characters live and his drawings were varied and spirited  there followed upon this four others the chimes the cricket on the hearth the battle of life and the haunted man with illustrations on their first appearance by doyle maclise and others the five are known today as the christmas books of them all the carol is the best known and loved and the cricket on the hearth although third in the series is perhaps next in point of popularity and is especially familiar to americans through joseph jeffersons characterisation of caleb plummer  dickens seems to have put his whole self into these glowing little stories whoever sees but a clever ghost story in the christmas carol misses its chief charm and lesson for there is a different meaning in the movements of scrooge and his attendant spirits a new life is brought to scrooge when he running to his window opened it and put out his head no fog no mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping for the blood to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry bells oh glorious glorious all this brightness has its attendant shadow and deep from the childish heart comes that true note of pathos the ever memorable toast of tiny tim god bless us every one the cricket on the hearth strikes a different note charmingly poetically the sweet chirping of the little cricket is associated with human feelings and actions and at the crisis of the story decides the fate and fortune of the carrier and his wife  dickenss greatest gift was characterization and no english writer save shakespeare has drawn so many and so varied characters it would be as absurd to interpret all of these as caricatures as to deny dickens his great and varied powers of creation dickens exaggerated many of his comic and satirical characters as was his right for caricature and satire are very closely related while exaggeration is the very essence of comedy but there remains a host of characters marked by humour and pathos yet the pictorial presentation of dickenss characters has ever tended toward the grotesque the interpretations in this volume aim to eliminate the grosser phases of the caricature in favour of the more human if the interpretations seem novel if scrooge be not as he has been pictured it is because a more human scrooge was desireda scrooge not wholly bad a scrooge of a better heart a scrooge to whom the resurrection described in this story was possible it has been the illustrators whole aim to make these people live in some form more fully consistent with their types                                         george alfred williams chatham nj     the cricket on the hearth  table of contents   chirp the first

roadside upright as a milestone                                                    118  when suddenly the struggling fire illuminated the whole chimney with a glow of light and the cricket on the hearth began to chirp                                                        166  illustration     the cricket on the hearth  a fairy tale of home  chirp the first   the kettle began it dont tell me what mrs peerybingle said i know better mrs peerybingle may leave it on record to the end of time that she couldnt say which of them began it but i say the kettle did i ought to know i hope the kettle began it full five minutes by the little waxyfaced dutch clock in the corner before the cricket uttered a chirp  as if the clock hadnt finished striking and the convulsive little haymaker at the top of it jerking away right and left with a scythe in front of a moorish palace hadnt mowed down half an acre of imaginary grass before the cricket joined in at all  why i am not naturally positive every one knows that i wouldnt set my own opinion against the opinion of mrs peerybingle unless i were quite sure on any account whatever nothing should induce me but this is a question of fact and the fact is that the kettle began it at least five minutes before the cricket gave any sign of being in existence contradict me and ill say ten  let me narrate exactly how it happened i should have proceeded to do so in my very first word but for this plain considerationif i am to tell a story i must begin at the beginning and how is it possible to begin at the beginning without beginning at the kettle  it appeared as if there were a sort of match or trial of skill you must understand between the kettle and the cricket and this is what led to it and how it came about  mrs peerybingle going out into the raw twilight and clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable rough impressions of the first proposition in euclid all about the yardmrs peerybingle filled the kettle at the waterbutt presently returning less the pattens and a good deal less for they were tall and mrs peerybingle was but short she set the kettle on the fire in doing which she lost her temper or mislaid it for an instant for the water being uncomfortably cold and in that slippy slushy sleety sort of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of substance patten rings includedhad laid hold of mrs peerybingles toes and even splashed her legs and when we rather plume ourselves with reason too upon our legs and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of stockings we find this for the moment hard to bear  besides the kettle was aggravating and obstinate it wouldnt allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar it wouldnt hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal it would lean forward with a drunken air and dribble a very idiot of a kettle on the hearth it was quarrelsome and hissed and spluttered morosely at the fire to sum up all the lid resisting mrs peerybingles fingers first of all turned topsyturvy and then with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause dived sideways indown to the very bottom of the kettle and the hull of the royal george has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water which the lid of that kettle employed against mrs peerybingle before she got it up again  it looked sullen and pigheaded enough even then carrying its handle with an air of defiance and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at mrs peerybingle as if it said i wont boil nothing shall induce me  but mrs peerybingle with restored goodhumour dusted her chubby little hands against each other and sat down before the kettle laughing meantime the jolly blaze uprose and fell flashing and gleaming on the little haymaker at the top of the dutch clock until one might have thought he stood stockstill before the moorish palace and nothing was in motion but the flame  he was on the move however and had his spasms two to the second all right and regular but his sufferings when the clock was going to strike were frightful to behold and when a cuckoo looked out of a trapdoor in the palace and gave note six times it shook him each time like a spectral voiceor like a something wiry plucking at his legs  it was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided that this terrified haymaker became himself again nor was he startled without reason for these rattling bony skeletons of clocks are very disconcerting in their operation and i wonder very much how any set of men but most of all how dutchmen can have had a liking to invent them there is a popular belief that dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own lower selves and they might know better than to leave their clocks so very lank and unprotected surely  now it was you observe that the kettle began to spend the evening now it was that the kettle growing mellow and musical began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat and to indulge in short vocal snorts which it checked in the bud as if it hadnt quite made up its mind yet to be good company now it was that after two or three such vain attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments it threw off all moroseness all reserve and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of  so plain too bless you you might have understood it like a bookbetter than some books you and i could name perhaps with its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet then hung about the chimneycorner as its own domestic heaven it trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness that its iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire and the lid itself the recently rebellious lidsuch is the influence of a bright exampleperformed a sort of jig and clattered like a deaf and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother  that this song of the kettles was a song of invitation and welcome to somebody out of doors to somebody at that moment coming on towards the snug small home and the crisp fire there is no doubt whatever mrs peerybingle knew it perfectly as she sat musing before the hearth its a dark night sang the kettle and the rotten leaves are lying by the way and above all is mist and darkness and below all is mire and clay and theres only one relief in all the sad and murky air and i dont know that it is one for its nothing but a glare of deep and angry crimson where the sun and wind together set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black and theres hoar frost on the fingerpost and thaw upon the track and the ice it isnt water and the water isnt free and you couldnt say that anything is what it ought to be but hes coming coming coming  and here if you like the cricket did chime in with a chirrup chirrup chirrup of such magnitude by way of chorus with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size as compared with the kettle size you couldnt see it that if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun if it had fallen a victim on the spot and chirruped its little body into fifty pieces it would have seemed a natural and inevitable consequence for which it had expressly laboured  the kettle had had the last of its solo performance it persevered with undiminished ardour but the cricket took first fiddle and kept it good heaven how it chirped its shrill sharp piercing voice resounded through the house and seemed to twinkle in the outer darkness like a star there was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it at its loudest which suggested its being carried off its legs and made to leap again by its own intense enthusiasm yet they went very well together the cricket and the kettle the burden of the song was still the same and louder louder louder still they sang it in their emulation  the fair little listenerfor fair she was and young though something of what is called the dumpling shape but i dont myself object to thatlighted a candle glanced at the haymaker on the top of the clock who was getting in a pretty average crop of minutes and looked out of the window where she saw nothing owing to the darkness but her own face imaged in the glass and my opinion is and so would yours have been that she might have looked a long way and seen nothing half so agreeable when she came back and sat down in her former seat the cricket and the kettle were still keeping it up with a perfect fury of competition the kettles weak side clearly being that he didnt know when he was beat  there was all the excitement of a race about it chirp chirp chirp cricket a mile ahead hum hum hummm kettle making play in the distance like a great top chirp chirp chirp cricket round the corner hum hum hummm kettle sticking to him in his own way no idea of giving in chirp chirp chirp cricket fresher than ever hum hum hummm kettle slow and steady chirp chirp chirp cricket going in to finish him hum hum hummm kettle not to be finished until at last they got so jumbled together in the hurryskurry helterskelter of the match that whether the kettle chirped and the cricket hummed or the cricket chirped and the kettle hummed or they both chirped and both hummed it would have taken a clearer head than yours or mine to have decided with anything like certainty but of this there is no doubt that the kettle and the cricket at one and the same moment and by some power of amalgamation best known to themselves sent each his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window and a long way down the lane and this light bursting on a certain person who on the instant approached towards it through the gloom expressed the whole thing to him literally in a twinkling and cried welcome home old fellow welcome home my boy  this end attained the kettle being dead beat boiled over and was taken off the fire mrs peerybingle then went running to the door where what with the wheels of a cart the tramp of a horse the voice of a man the tearing in and out of an excited dog and the surprising and mysterious appearance of a baby there was soon the very whatshisname to play  where the baby came from or how mrs peerybingle got hold of it in that flash of time i dont know but a live baby there was in mrs peerybingles arms and a pretty tolerable amount of pride she seemed to have in it when she was drawn gently to the fire by a sturdy figure of a man much taller and much older than herself who had to stoop a long way down to kiss her but she was worth the trouble six foot six with the lumbago might have done it  oh goodness john said mrs p what a state youre in with the weather  illustration a dot andhere he glanced at the babya dot and carryi wont say it for fear i should spoil it but i was very near a joke  he was something the worse for it undeniably the thick mist hung in clots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw and between the fog and fire together there were rainbows in his very whiskers  why you see dot john made answer slowly as he unrolled a shawl from about his throat and warmed his hands itit ant exactly summer weather so no wonder  i wish you wouldnt call me dot john i dont like it said mrs peerybingle pouting in a way that clearly showed she did like it very much  why what else are you returned john looking down upon her with a smile and giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give a dot andhere he glanced at the babya dot and carryi wont say it for fear i should spoil it but i was very near a joke i dont know as ever i was nearer  he was often near to something or other very clever by his own account this lumbering slow honest john this john so heavy but so light of spirit so rough upon the surface but so gentle at the core so dull without so quick within so stolid but so good oh mother nature give thy children the true poetry of heart that hid itself in this poor carriers breasthe was but a carrier by the wayand we can bear to have them talking prose and leading lives of prose and bear to bless thee for their company  it was pleasant to see dot with her little figure and her baby in her arms a very doll of a baby glancing with a coquettish thoughtfulness at the fire and inclining her delicate little head just enough on one side to let it rest in an odd halfnatural halfaffected wholly nestling and agreeable manner on the great rugged figure of the carrier it was pleasant to see him with his tender awkwardness endeavouring to adapt his rude support to her slight need and make his burly middle age a leaningstaff not inappropriate to her blooming youth it was pleasant to observe how tilly slowboy waiting in the background for the baby took special cognizance though in her earliest teens of this grouping and stood with her mouth and eyes wide open and her head thrust forward taking it in as if it were air nor was it less agreeable to observe how john the carrier reference being made by dot to the aforesaid baby checked his hand when on the point of touching the infant as if he thought he might crack it and bending down surveyed it from a safe distance with a kind of puzzled pride such as an amiable mastiff might be supposed to show if he found himself one day the father of a young canary  ant he beautiful john dont he look precious in his sleep  very precious said john very much so he generally is asleep ant he  lor john good gracious no  oh said john pondering i thought his eyes was generally shut halloa  goodness john how you startle one  it ant right for him to turn em up in that way said the astonished carrier is it see how hes winking with both of em at once and look at his mouth why hes gasping like a gold and silver fish  you dont deserve to be a father you dont said dot with all the dignity of an experienced matron but how should you know what little complaints children are troubled with john you wouldnt so much as know their names you stupid fellow and when she had turned the baby over on her left arm and had slapped its back as a restorative she pinched her husbands ear laughing  no said john pulling off his outer coat its very true dot i dont know much about it i only know that ive been fighting pretty stiffly with the wind tonight its been blowing northeast straight into the cart the whole way home  poor old man so it has cried mrs peerybingle instantly becoming very active here take the precious darling tilly while i make myself of some use bless it i could smother it with kissing it i could hie then good dog hie boxer boy only let me make the tea first john and then ill help you with the parcels like a busy bee how doth the littleand all the rest of it you know john did you ever learn how doth the little when you went to school john  not to quite know it john returned i was very near it once but i should only have spoilt it i dare say  ha ha laughed dot she had the blithest little laugh you ever heard what a dear old darling of a dunce you are john to be sure  not at all disputing this position john went out to see that the boy with the lantern which had been dancing to and fro before the door and window like a will of the wisp took due care of the horse who was fatter than you would quite believe if i gave you his measure and so old that his birthday was lost in the mists of antiquity boxer feeling that his attentions were due to the family in general and must be impartially distributed dashed in and out with bewildering inconstancy now describing a circle of short barks round the horse where he was being rubbed down at the stable door now feigning to make savage rushes at his mistress and facetiously bringing himself to sudden stops now eliciting a shriek from tilly slowboy in the low nursingchair near the fire by the unexpected application of his moist nose to her countenance now exhibiting an obtrusive interest in the baby now going round and round upon the hearth and lying down as if he had established himself for the night now getting up again and taking that nothing of a fagend of a tail of his out into the weather as if he had just remembered an appointment and was off at a round trot to keep it  there theres the teapot ready on the hob said dot as briskly busy as a child at play at keeping house and theres the cold knuckle of ham and theres the butter and theres the crusty loaf and all heres a clothes basket for the small parcels john if youve got any there where are you john dont let the dear child fall under the grate tilly whatever you do  it may be noted of miss slowboy in spite of her rejecting the caution with some vivacity that she had a rare and surprising talent for getting this baby into difficulties and had several times imperilled its short life in a quiet way peculiarly her own she was of a spare and straight shape this young lady insomuch that her garments appeared to be in constant danger of sliding off those sharp pegs her shoulders on which they were loosely hung her costume was remarkable for the partial development on all possible occasions of some flannel vestment of a singular structure also for affording glimpses in the region of the back of a corset or a pair of stays in colour a dead green being always in a state of gaping admiration at everything and absorbed besides in the perpetual contemplation of her mistresss perfections and the babys miss slowboy in her little errors of judgment may be said to have done equal honour to her head and to her heart and though these did less honour to the babys head which they were the occasional means of bringing into contact with deal doors dressers stairrails bedposts and other foreign substances still they were the honest results of tilly slowboys constant astonishment at finding herself so kindly treated and installed in such a comfortable home for the maternal and paternal slowboy were alike unknown to fame and tilly had been bred by public charity a foundling which word though only differing from fondling by one vowels length is very different in meaning and expresses quite another thing  to have seen little mrs peerybingle come back with her husband tugging at the clothes basket and making the most strenuous exertions to do nothing at all for he carried it would have amused you almost as much as it amused him it may have entertained the cricket too for anything i know but certainly it now began to chirp again vehemently  illustration tilly slowboy  heyday said john in his slow way its merrier than ever tonight i think  and its sure to bring us good fortune john it always has done so to have a cricket on the hearth is the luckiest thing in all the world  john looked at her as if he had very nearly got the thought into his head that she was his cricket in chief and he quite agreed with her but it was probably one of his narrow escapes for he said nothing  the first time i heard its cheerful little note john was on that night when you brought me homewhen you brought me to my new home here its little mistress nearly a year ago you recollect john  oh yes john remembered i should think so  its chirp was such a welcome to me it seemed so full of promise and encouragement it seemed to say you would be kind and gentle with me and would not expect i had a fear of that john then to find an old head on the shoulders of your foolish little wife  john thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders and then the head as though he would have said no no he had had no such expectation he had been quite content to take them as they were and really he had reason they were very comely  it spoke the truth john when it seemed to say so for you have ever been i am sure the best the most considerate the most affectionate of husbands to me this has been a happy home john and i love the cricket for its sake  why so do i then said the carrier so do i dot  i love it for the many times i have heard it and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me sometimes in the twilight when i have felt a little solitary and downhearted johnbefore baby was here to keep me company and make the house gaywhen i have thought how lonely you would be if i should die how lonely i should be if i could know that you had lost me dear its chirp chirp chirp upon the hearth has seemed to tell me of another little voice so sweet so very dear to me before whose coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream and when i used to feari did fear once john i was very young you knowthat ours might prove to be an illassorted marriage i being such a child and you more like my guardian than my husband and that you might not however hard you tried be able to learn to love me as you hoped and prayed you might its chirp chirp chirp has cheered me up again and filled me with new trust and confidence i was thinking of these things tonight dear when i sat expecting you and i love the cricket for their sake  and so do i repeated john but dot i hope and pray that i might learn to love you how you talk i had learnt that long before i brought you here to be the crickets little mistress dot  she laid her hand an instant on his arm and looked up at him with an agitated face as if she would have told him something next moment she was down upon her knees before the basket speaking in a sprightly voice and busy with the parcels  there are not many of them tonight john but i saw some goods behind the cart just now and though they give more trouble perhaps still they pay as well so we have no reason to grumble have we besides you have been delivering i dare say as you came along  oh yes john said a good many  why whats this round box heart alive john its a weddingcake  leave a woman alone to find out that said john admiringly now a man would never have thought of it whereas its my belief that if you was to pack a weddingcake up in a teachest or a turnup bedstead or a pickledsalmon keg or any unlikely thing a woman would be sure to find it out directly yes i called for it at the pastrycooks  and it weighs i dont know whatwhole hundredweights cried dot making a great demonstration of trying to lift it whose is it john where is it going  read the writing on the other side said john  why john my goodness john  ah whod have thought it john returned  you never mean to say pursued dot sitting on the floor and shaking her head at him that its gruff and tackleton the toymaker  john nodded  mrs peerybingle nodded also fifty times at least not in assentin dumb and pitying amazement screwing up her lips the while with all their little force they were never made for screwing up i am clear of that and looking the good carrier through and through in her abstraction miss slowboy in the meantime who had a mechanical power of reproducing scraps of current conversation for the delectation of the baby with all the sense struck out of them and all the nouns changed into the plural number inquired aloud of that young creature was it gruffs and tackletons the toymakers then and would it call at pastrycooks for weddingcakes and did its mothers know the boxes when its fathers brought them home and so on  and that is really to come about said dot why she and i were girls at school together john  he might have been thinking of her or nearly thinking of her perhaps as she was in that same schooltime he looked upon her with a thoughtful pleasure but he made no answer  and hes as old as unlike herwhy how many years older than you is gruff and tackleton john  how many more cups of tea shall i drink tonight at one sitting than gruff and tackleton ever took in four i wonder replied john goodhumouredly as he drew a chair to the round table and began at the cold ham as to eating i eat but little but that little i enjoy dot  even this his usual sentiment at mealtimes one of his innocent delusions for his appetite was always obstinate and flatly contradicted him awoke no smile in the face of his little wife who stood among the parcels pushing the cakebox slowly from her with her foot and never once looked though her eyes were cast down too upon the dainty shoe she generally was so mindful of absorbed in thought she stood there heedless alike of the tea and john although he called to her and rapped the table with his knife to startle her until he rose and touched her on the arm when she looked at him for a moment and hurried to her place behind the teaboard laughing at her negligence but not as she had laughed before the manner and the music were quite changed  the cricket too had stopped somehow the room was not so cheerful as it had been nothing like it  so these are all the parcels are they john she said breaking a long silence which the honest carrier had devoted to the practical illustration of one part of his favourite sentimentcertainly enjoying what he ate if it couldnt be admitted that he ate but little so these are all the parcels are they john  thats all said john whynoilaying down his knife and fork and taking a long breathi declareive clean forgotten the old gentleman  the old gentleman  in the cart said john he was asleep among the straw the last time i saw him ive very nearly remembered him twice since i came in but he went out of my head again halloa yahip there rouse up thats my hearty  john said these latter words outside the door whither he had hurried with the candle in his hand  miss slowboy conscious of some mysterious reference to the old gentleman and connecting in her mystified imagination certain associations of a religious nature with the phrase was so disturbed that hastily rising from the low chair by the fire to seek protection near the skirt of her mistress and coming into contact as she crossed the doorway with an ancient stranger she instinctively made a charge or butt at him with the only offensive instrument within her reach this instrument happening to be the baby great commotion and alarm ensued which the sagacity of boxer rather tended to increase for that good dog more thoughtful than his master had it seemed been watching the old gentleman in his sleep lest he should walk off with a few young poplartrees that were tied up behind the cart and he still attended on him very closely worrying his gaiters in fact and making dead sets at the buttons  youre such an undeniably good sleeper sir said john when tranquillity was restored in the meantime the old gentleman had stood bareheaded and motionless in the centre of the room that i have half a mind to ask you where the other six areonly that would be a joke and i know i should spoil it very near though murmured the carrier with a chuckle very near  the stranger who had long white hair good features singularly bold and well defined for an old man and dark bright penetrating eyes looked round with a smile and saluted the carriers wife by gravely inclining his head  his garb was very quaint and odda long long way behind the time its hue was brown all over in his hand he held a great brown club or walkingstick and striking this upon the floor it fell asunder and became a chair on which he sat down quite composedly  there said the carrier turning to his wife thats the way i found him sitting by the roadside upright as a milestone and almost as deaf  sitting in the open air john  in the open air replied the carrier just at dusk carriage paid he said and gave me eighteenpence then he got in and there he is  hes going john i think  not at all he was only going to speak  if you please i was to be left till called for said the stranger mildly dont mind me  with that he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets and a book from another and leisurely began to read making no more of boxer than if he had been a house lamb  the carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity the stranger raised his head and glancing from the latter to the former said  your daughter my good friend  wife returned john  niece said the stranger  wife roared john  indeed observed the stranger surely very young  he quietly turned over and resumed his reading but before he could have read two lines he again interrupted himself to say  baby yours  john gave him a gigantic nod equivalent to an answer in the affirmative delivered through a speaking trumpet  girl  boooy roared john  also very young eh  mrs peerybingle instantly struck in two months and three daays vaccinated just six weeks agoo took very finely considered by the doctor a remarkably beautiful chiild equal to the general run of children at five months old takes notice in a way quite wonderful may seem impossible to you but feels his legs already  illustration thats the way i found him sitting by the roadside upright as a milestone  here the breathless little mother who had been shrieking these short sentences into the old mans ear until her pretty face was crimsoned held up the baby before him as a stubborn and triumphant fact while tilly slowboy with a melodious cry of ketcher ketcherwhich sounded like some unknown words adapted to a popular sneezeperformed some cowlike gambols around that all unconscious innocent  hark hes called for sure enough said john theres somebody at the door open it tilly  before she could reach it however it was opened from without being a primitive sort of door with a latch that any one could lift if he choseand a good many people did choose for all kinds of neighbours liked to have a cheerful word or two with the carrier though he was no great talker himself being opened it gave admission to a little meagre thoughtful dingyfaced man who seemed to have made himself a greatcoat from the sackcloth covering of some old box for when he turned to shut the door and keep the weather out he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription g  t in large black capitals also the word glass in bold characters  good evening john said the little man good evening mum good evening tilly good evening unbeknown hows baby mum boxers pretty well i hope  all thriving caleb replied dot i am sure you need only look at the dear child for one to know that  and im sure i need only look at you for another said caleb  he didnt look at her though he had a wandering and thoughtful eye which seemed to be always projecting itself into some other time and place no matter what he said a description which will equally apply to his voice  or at john for another said caleb or at tilly as far as that goes or certainly at boxer  busy just now caleb asked the carrier  why pretty well john he returned with the distraught air of a man who was casting about for the philosophers stone at least pretty much so theres rather a run on noahs arks at present i could have wished to improve on the family but i dont see how its to be done at the price it would be a satisfaction to ones mind to make it clearer which was shems and hams and which was wives flies ant on that scale neither as compared with elephants you know ah well have you got anything in the parcel line for me john  the carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat he had taken off and brought out carefully preserved in moss and paper a tiny flowerpot  there it is he said adjusting it with great care not so much as a leaf damaged full of buds  calebs dull eye brightened as he took it and thanked him  dear caleb said the carrier very dear at this season  never mind that it would be cheap to me what ever it cost returned the little man anything else john  a small box replied the carrier here you are  for caleb plummer said the little man spelling out the direction with cash with cash john i dont think its for me  with care returned the carrier looking over his shoulder where do you make out cash  oh to be sure said caleb its all right with care yes yes thats mine it might have been with cash indeed if my dear boy in the golden south americas had lived john you loved him like a son didnt you you neednt say you did i know of course caleb plummer with care yes yes its all right its a box of dolls eyes for my daughters work i wish it was her own sight in a box john  i wish it was or could be cried the carrier  thankee said the little man you speak very hearty to think that she should never see the dollsand them a staring at her so bold all day long thats where it cuts whats the damage john  ill damage you said john if you inquire dot very near  well its like you to say so observed the little man its your kind way let me see i think thats all  i think not said the carrier try again  something for our governor eh said caleb after pondering a little while to be sure thats what i came for but my heads so running on them arks and things he hasnt been here has he  not he returned the carrier hes too busy courting  hes coming round though said caleb for he told me to keep on the near side of the road going home and it was ten to one hed take me up i had better go bythebyeyou couldnt have the goodness to let me pinch boxers tail mum for half a moment could you  why caleb what a question  oh never mind mum said the little man he mightnt like it perhaps theres a small order just come in for barking dogs and i should wish to go as close to natur as i could for sixpence thats all never mind mum  it happened opportunely that boxer without receiving the proposed stimulus began to bark with great zeal but as this implied the approach of some new visitor caleb postponing his study from the life to a more convenient season shouldered the round box and took a hurried leave he might have spared himself the trouble for he met the visitor upon the threshold  oh you are here are you wait a bit ill take you home john peerybingle my service to you more of my service to your pretty wife handsomer every day better too if possible and younger mused the speaker in a low voice thats the devil of it  i should be astonished at your paying compliments mr tackleton said dot not with the best grace in the world but for your condition  you know all about it then  i have got myself to believe it somehow said dot  after a hard struggle i suppose  very  tackleton the toy merchant pretty generally known as gruff and tackletonfor that was the firm though gruff had been bought out long ago only leaving his name and as some said his nature according to its dictionary meaning in the businesstackleton the toy merchant was a man whose vocation had been quite misunderstood by his parents and guardians if they had made him a money lender or a sharp attorney or a sheriffs officer or a broker he might have sown his discontented oats in his youth and after having had the full run of himself in illnatured transactions might have turned out amiable at last for the sake of a little freshness and novelty but cramped and chafing in the peaceable pursuit of toymaking he was a domestic ogre who had been living on children all his life and was their implacable enemy he despised all toys wouldnt have bought one for the world delighted in his malice to insinuate grim expressions into the faces of brownpaper farmers who drove pigs to market bellmen who advertised lost lawyers consciences movable old ladies who darned stockings or carved pies and other like samples of his stockintrade in appalling masks hideous hairy redeyed jacks in boxes vampire kites demoniacal tumblers who wouldnt lie down and were perpetually flying forward to stare infants out of countenance his soul perfectly revelled they were his only relief and safetyvalve he was great in such inventions anything suggestive of a pony nightmare was delicious to him he had even lost money and he took to that toy very kindly by getting up goblin slides for magic lanterns whereon the powers of darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural shellfish with human faces in intensifying the portraiture of giants he had sunk quite a little capital and though no painter himself he could indicate for the instruction of his artists with a piece of chalk a certain furtive leer for the countenances of those monsters which was safe to destroy the peace of mind of any young gentleman between the ages of six and eleven for the whole christmas or midsummer vacation  what he was in toys he was as most men are in other things you may easily suppose therefore that within the great green cape which reached down to the calves of his legs there was buttoned up to the chin an uncommonly pleasant fellow and that he was about as choice a spirit and as agreeable a companion as ever stood in a pair of bullheadedlooking boots with mahoganycoloured tops  still tackleton the toy merchant was going to be married in spite of all this he was going to be married and to a young wife too a beautiful young wife  he didnt look much like a bridegroom as he stood in the carriers kitchen with a twist in his dry face and a screw in his body and his hat jerked over the bridge of his nose and his hands tucked down into the bottoms of his pockets and his whole sarcastic illconditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens but a bridegroom he designed to be  in three days time next thursday the last day of the first month in the year thats my weddingday said tackleton  did i mention that he had always one eye wide open and one eye nearly shut and that the one eye nearly shut was always the expressive eye i dont think i did  thats my weddingday said tackleton rattling his money  why its our weddingday too exclaimed the carrier  ha ha laughed tackleton odd youre just such another couple just  the indignation of dot at this presumptuous assertion is not to be described what next his imagination would compass the possibility of just such another baby perhaps the man was mad  i say a word with you murmured tackleton nudging the carrier with his elbow and taking him a little apart youll come to the wedding were in the same boat you know  how in the same boat inquired the carrier  a little disparity you know said tackleton with another nudge come and spend an evening with us beforehand  why demanded john astonished at this pressing hospitality  why returned the other thats a new way of receiving an invitation why for pleasuresociability you know and all that  i thought you were never sociable said john in his plain way  tchah its of no use to be anything but free with you i see said tackleton why then the truth is you have awhat teadrinking people call a sort of a comfortable appearance together you and your wife we know better you know but  no we dont know better interposed john what are you talking about  well we dont know better then said tackleton well agree that we dont as you like what does it matter i was going to say as you have that sort of appearance your company will produce a favourable effect on mrs tackleton that will be and though i dont think your good ladys very friendly to me in this matter still she cant help herself from falling into my views for theres a compactness and cosiness of appearance about her that always tells even in an indifferent case youll say youll come  we have arranged to keep our weddingday as far as that goes at home said john we have made the promise to ourselves these six months we think you see that home  bah whats home cried tackleton four walls and a ceiling why dont you kill that cricket i would i always do i hate their noise there are four walls and a ceiling at my house come to me  you kill your crickets eh said john  scrunch em sir returned the other setting his heel heavily on the floor youll say youll come its as much your interest as mine you know that the women should persuade each other that theyre quiet and contented and couldnt be better off i know their way whatever one woman says another woman is determined to clinch always theres that spirit of emulation among em sir that if your wife says to my wife im the happiest woman in the world and mines the best husband in the world and i dote on him my wife will say the same to yours or more and half believe it  do you mean to say she dont then asked the carrier  dont cried tackleton with a short sharp laugh dont what  the carrier had some faint idea of adding dote upon you but happening to meet the halfclosed eye as it twinkled upon him over the turnedup collar of the cape which was within an ace of poking it out he felt it such an unlikely part and parcel of anything to be doted on that he substituted that she dont believe it  ah you dog youre joking said tackleton  but the carrier though slow to understand the full drift of his meaning eyed him in such a serious manner that he was obliged to be a little more explanatory  i have the humour said tackleton holding up the fingers of his left hand and tapping the forefinger to imply there i am tackleton to wit i have the humour sir to marry a young wife and a pretty wife here he rapped his little finger to express the bride not sparingly but sharply with a sense of power im able to gratify that humour and i do its my whim butnow look there  he pointed to where dot was sitting thoughtfully before the fire leaning her dimpled chin upon her hand and watching the bright blaze the carrier looked at her and then at him and then at her and then at him again  she honours and obeys no doubt you know said tackleton and that as i am not a man of sentiment is quite enough for me but do you think theres anything more in it  i think observed the carrier that i should chuck any man out of window who said there wasnt  exactly so returned the other with an unusual alacrity of assent to be sure doubtless you would of course im certain of it good night pleasant dreams  the carrier was puzzled and made uncomfortable and uncertain in spite of himself he couldnt help showing it in his manner  good night my dear friend said tackleton compassionately im off were exactly alike in reality i see you wont give us tomorrow evening well next day you go out visiting i know ill meet you there and bring my wife that is to be itll do her good youre agreeable thankee whats that  it was a loud cry from the carriers wife a loud sharp sudden cry that made the room ring like a glass vessel she had risen from her seat and stood like one transfixed by terror and surprise the stranger had advanced towards the fire to warm himself and stood within a short stride of her chair but quite still  dot cried the carrier mary darling whats the matter  they were all about her in a moment caleb who had been dozing on the cakebox in the first imperfect recovery of his suspended presence of mind seized miss slowboy by the hair of her head but immediately apologised  mary exclaimed the carrier supporting her in his arms are you ill what is it tell me dear  she only answered by beating her hands together and falling into a wild fit of laughter then sinking from his grasp upon the ground she covered her face with her apron and wept bitterly and then she laughed again and then she cried again and then she said how cold she was and suffered him to lead her to the fire where she sat down as before the old man standing as before quite still  im better john she said im quite well nowi  john but john was on the other side of her why turn her face towards the strange old gentleman as if addressing him was her brain wandering  only a fancy john deara kind of shocka something coming suddenly before my eyesi dont know what it was its quite gone quite gone  im glad its gone muttered tackleton turning the expressive eye all round the room i wonder where its gone and what it was humph caleb come here whos that with the grey hair  i dont know sir returned caleb in a whisper never see him before in all my life a beautiful figure for a nutcracker quite a new model with a screwjaw opening down into his waistcoat hed be lovely  not ugly enough said tackleton  or for a firebox either observed caleb in deep contemplation what a model unscrew his head to put the matches in turn him heels upards for the light and what a firebox for a gentlemans mantelshelf just as he stands  not half ugly enough said tackleton nothing in him at all come bring that box all right now i hope  oh quite gone quite gone said the little woman waving him hurriedly away good night  good night said tackleton good night john peerybingle take care how you carry that box caleb let it fall and ill murder you dark as pitch and weather worse than ever eh good night  so with another sharp look round the room he went out at the door followed by caleb with the weddingcake on his head  the carrier had been so much astounded by his little wife and so busily engaged in soothing and tending her that he had scarcely been conscious of the strangers presence until now when he again stood there their only guest  he dont belong to them you see said john i must give him a hint to go  i beg your pardon friend said the old gentleman advancing to him the more so as i fear your wife has not been well but the attendant whom my infirmity he touched his ears and shook his head renders almost indispensable not having arrived i fear there must be some mistake the bad night which made the shelter of your comfortable cart may i never have a worse so acceptable is still as bad as ever would you in your kindness suffer me to rent a bed here  yes yes cried dot yes certainly  oh said the carrier surprised by the rapidity of this consent well i dont object but still im not quite sure that  hush she interrupted dear john  why hes stone deaf urged john  i know he is butyes sir certainly yes certainly ill make him up a bed directly john  as she hurried off to do it the flutter of her spirits and the agitation of her manner were so strange that the carrier stood looking after her quite confounded  did its mothers make it up a beds then cried miss slowboy to the baby and did its hair grow brown and curly when its caps was lifted off and frighten it a precious pets a sitting by the fires  with that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifles which is often incidental to a state of doubt and confusion the carrier as he walked slowly to and fro found himself mentally repeating even these absurd words many times so many times that he got them by heart and was still conning them over and over like a lesson when tilly after administering as much friction to the little bald head with her hand as she thought wholesome according to the practice of nurses had once more tied the babys cap on  and frighten it a precious pets a sitting by the fires what frightened dot i wonder mused the carrier pacing to and fro  he scouted from his heart the insinuations of the toy merchant and yet they filled him with a vague indefinite uneasiness for tackleton was quick and sly and he had that painful sense himself of being a man of slow perception that a broken hint was always worrying to him he certainly had no intention in his mind of linking anything that tackleton had said with the unusual conduct of his wife but the two subjects of reflection came into his mind together and he could not keep them asunder  the bed was soon made ready and the visitor declining all refreshment but a cup of tea retired then dotquite well again she said quite well againarranged the great chair in the chimneycorner for her husband filled his pipe and gave it him and took her usual little stool beside him on the hearth  she always would sit on that little stool i think she must have had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing wheedling little stool  she was out and out the very best filler of a pipe i should say in the four quarters of the globe to see her put that chubby little finger in the bowl and then blow down the pipe to clear the tube and when she had done so affect to think that there was really something in the tube and blow a dozen times and hold it to her eye like a telescope with a most provoking twist in her capital little face as she looked down it was quite a brilliant thing as to the tobacco she was perfect mistress of the subject and her lighting of the pipe with a wisp of paper when the carrier had it in his mouthgoing so very near his nose and yet not scorching itwas art high art  and the cricket and the kettle turning up again acknowledged it the bright fire blazing up again acknowledged it the little mower on the clock in his unheeded work acknowledged it the carrier in his smoothing forehead and expanding face acknowledged it the readiest of all  and as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his old pipe and as the dutch clock ticked and as the red fire gleamed and as the cricket chirped that genius of his hearth and home for such the cricket was came out in fairy shape into the room and summoned many forms of home about him dots of all ages and all sizes filled the chamber dots who were merry children running on before him gathering flowers in the fields coy dots half shrinking from half yielding to the pleading of his own rough image newlymarried dots alighting at the door and taking wondering possession of the household keys motherly little dots attended by fictitious slowboys bearing babies to be christened matronly dots still young and blooming watching dots of daughters as they danced at rustic balls fat dots encircled and beset by troops of rosy grandchildren withered dots who leaned on sticks and tottered as they crept along old carriers too appeared with blind old boxers lying at their feet and newer carts with younger drivers peerybingle brothers on the tilt and sick old carriers tended by the gentlest hands and graves of dead and gone old carriers green in the churchyard and as the cricket showed him all these thingshe saw them plainly though his eyes were fixed upon the firethe carriers heart grew light and happy and he thanked his household gods with all his might and cared no more for gruff and tackleton than you do                                but what was that young figure of a man which the same fairy cricket set so near her stool and which remained there singly and alone why did it linger still so near her with its arm upon the chimneypiece ever repeating married and not to me  oh dot oh failing dot there is no place for it in all your husbands visions why has its shadow fallen on his hearth     chirp the second   caleb plummer and his blind daughter lived all alone by themselves as the story books sayand my blessing with yours to back it i hope on the story books for saying anything in this workaday worldcaleb plummer and his blind daughter lived all alone by themselves in a little cracked nutshell of a wooden house which was in truth no better than a pimple on the prominent redbrick nose of gruff and tackleton the premises of gruff and tackleton were the great feature of the street but you might have knocked down caleb plummers dwelling with a hammer or two and carried off the pieces in a cart  if any one had done the dwellinghouse of caleb plummer the honour to miss it after such an inroad it would have been no doubt to commend its demolition as a vast improvement it stuck to the premises of gruff and tackleton like a barnacle to a ships keel or a snail to a door or a little bunch of toadstools to the stem of a tree but it was the germ from which the fullgrown trunk of gruff and tackleton had sprung and under its crazy roof the gruff before last had in a small way made toys for a generation of old boys and girls who had played with them and found them out and broken them and gone to sleep  i have said that caleb and his poor blind daughter lived here i should have said that caleb lived here and his poor blind daughter somewhere elsein an enchanted home of calebs furnishing where scarcity and shabbiness were not and trouble never entered caleb was no sorcerer but in the only magic art that still remains to us the magic of devoted deathless love nature had been the mistress of his study and from her teaching all the wonder came  the blind girl never knew that ceilings were discoloured walls blotched and bare of plaster here and there high crevices unstopped and widening every day beams mouldering and tending downward the blind girl never knew that iron was rusting wood rotting paper peeling off the size and shape and true proportion of the dwelling withering away the blind girl never knew that ugly shapes of delf and earthenware were on the board that sorrow and faintheartedness were in the house that calebs scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey before her sightless face the blind girl never knew they had a master cold exacting and uninterestednever knew that tackleton was tackleton in short but lived in the belief of an eccentric humorist who loved to have his jest with them and who while he was the guardian angel of their lives disdained to hear one word of thankfulness  and all was calebs doing all the doing of her simple father but he too had a cricket on his hearth and listening sadly to its music when the motherless blind child was very young that spirit had inspired him with the thought that even her great deprivation might be almost changed into a blessing and the girl made happy by these little means for all the cricket tribe are potent spirits even though the people who hold converse with them do not know it which is frequently the case and there are not in the unseen world voices more gentle and more true that may be so implicitly relied on or that are so certain to give none but tenderest counsel as the voices in which the spirits of the fireside and the hearth address themselves to humankind  caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual workingroom which served them for their ordinary livingroom as well and a strange place it was there were houses in it finished and unfinished for dolls of all stations in life suburban tenements for dolls of moderate means kitchens and single apartments for dolls of the lower classes capital town residences for dolls of high estate some of these establishments were already furnished according to estimate with a view to the convenience of dolls of limited income others could be fitted on the most expensive scale at a moments notice from whole shelves of chairs and tables sofas bedsteads and upholstery the nobility and gentry and public in general for whose accommodation these tenements were designed lay here and there in baskets staring straight up at the ceiling but in denoting their degrees in society and confining them to their respective stations which experience shows to be lamentably difficult in real life the makers of these dolls had far improved on nature who is often froward and perverse for they not resting on such arbitrary marks as satin cotton print and bits of rag had superadded striking personal differences which allowed of no mistake thus the dolllady of distinction had wax limbs of perfect symmetry but only she and her compeers the next grade in the social scale being made of leather and the next of coarse linen stuff as to the common people they had just so many matches out of tinderboxes for their arms and legs and there they wereestablished in their sphere at once beyond the possibility of getting out of it  there were various other samples of his handicraft besides dolls in caleb plummers room there were noahs arks in which the birds and beasts were an uncommonly tight fit i assure you though they could be crammed in anyhow at the roof and rattled and shaken into the smallest compass by a bold poetical licence most of these noahs arks had knockers on the doors inconsistent appendages perhaps as suggestive of morning callers and a postman yet a pleasant finish to the outside of the building there were scores of melancholy little carts which when the wheels went round performed most doleful music many small fiddles drums and other instruments of torture no end of cannon shields swords spears and guns there were little tumblers in red breeches incessantly swarming up high obstacles of red tape and coming down head first on the other side and there were innumerable old gentlemen of respectable not to say venerable appearance insanely flying over horizontal pegs inserted for the purpose in their own streetdoors there were beasts of all sorts horses in particular of every breed from the spotted barrel on four pegs with a small tippet for a mane to the thoroughbred rocker on his highest mettle as it would have been hard to count the dozens upon dozens of grotesque figures that were ever ready to commit all sorts of absurdities on the turning of a handle so it would have been no easy task to mention any human folly vice or weakness that had not its type immediate or remote in caleb plummers room and not in an exaggerated form for very little handles will move men and women to as strange performances as any toy was ever made to undertake  in the midst of all these objects caleb and his daughter sat at work the blind girl busy as a dolls dressmaker caleb painting and glazing the fourpair front of a desirable family mansion  the care imprinted in the lines of calebs face and his absorbed and dreamy manner which would have sat well on some alchemist or abstruse student were at first sight an odd contrast to his occupation and the trivialities about him but trivial things invented and pursued for bread become very serious matters of fact and apart from this consideration i am not at all prepared to say myself that if caleb had been a lord chamberlain or a member of parliament or a lawyer or even a great speculator he would have dealt in toys one whit less whimsical while i have a very great doubt whether they would have been as harmless  so you were out in the rain last night father in your beautiful new greatcoat said calebs daughter  in my beautiful new greatcoat answered caleb glancing towards a clothesline in the room on which the sackcloth garment previously described was carefully hung up to dry  how glad i am you bought it father  and of such a tailor too said caleb quite a fashionable tailor its too good for me  the blind girl rested from her work and laughed with delight too good father what can be too good for you  im half ashamed to wear it though said caleb watching the effect of what he said upon her brightening face upon my word when i hear the boys and people say behind me halloa heres a swell i dont know which way to look and when the beggar wouldnt go away last night and when i said i was a very common man said no your honour bless your honour dont say that i was quite ashamed i really felt as if i hadnt a right to wear it  happy blind girl how merry she was in her exultation  i see you father she said clasping her hands as plainly as if i had the eyes i never want when you are with me a blue coat  bright blue said caleb  yes yes bright blue exclaimed the girl turning up her radiant face the colour i can just remember in the blessed sky you told me it was blue before a bright blue coat  made loose to the figure suggested caleb  yes loose to the figure cried the blind girl laughing heartily and in it you dear father with your merry eye your smiling face your free step and your dark hairlooking so young and handsome  halloa halloa said caleb i shall be vain presently  i think you are already cried the blind girl pointing at him in her glee i know you father ha ha ha ive found you out you see  how different the picture in her mind from caleb as he sat observing her she had spoken of his free step she was right in that for years and years he had never once crossed that threshold at his own slow pace but with a footfall counterfeited for her ear and never had he when his heart was heaviest forgotten the light tread that was to render hers so cheerful and courageous  heaven knows but i think calebs vague bewilderment of manner may have half originated in his having confused himself about himself and everything around him for the love of his blind daughter how could the little man be otherwise than bewildered after labouring for so many years to destroy his own identity and that of all the objects that had any bearing on it  there we are said caleb falling back a pace or two to form the better judgment of his work as near the real thing as sixpennorth of halfpence is to sixpence what a pity that the whole front of the house opens at once if there was only a staircase in it now and regular doors to the rooms to go in at but thats the worst of my calling im always deluding myself and swindling myself  you are speaking quite softly you are not tired father  tired echoed caleb with a great burst of animation what should tire me bertha i was never tired what does it mean  to give the greater force to his words he checked himself in an involuntary imitation of two halflength stretching and yawning figures on the mantelshelf who were represented as in one eternal state of weariness from the waist upwards and hummed a fragment of a song it was a bacchanalian song something about a sparkling bowl he sang it with an assumption of a devilmaycare voice that made his face a thousand times more meagre and more thoughtful than ever  what youre singing are you said tackleton putting his head in at the door go it i cant sing  nobody would have suspected him of it he hadnt what is generally termed a singing face by any means  i cant afford to sing said tackleton im glad you can i hope you can afford to work too hardly time for both i should think  if you could only see him bertha how hes winking at me whispered caleb such a man to joke youd think if you didnt know him he was in earnestwouldnt you now  the blind girl smiled and nodded  the bird that can sing and wont sing must be made to sing they say grumbled tackleton what about the owl that cant sing and oughtnt to sing and will sing is there anything that he should be made to do  the extent to which hes winking at this moment whispered caleb to his daughter oh my gracious  always merry and lighthearted with us cried the smiling bertha  oh youre there are you answered tackleton poor idiot  he really did believe she was an idiot and he founded the belief i cant say whether consciously or not upon her being fond of him  well and being therehow are you said tackleton in his grudging way  oh well quite well and as happy as even you can wish me to be as happy as you would make the whole world if you could  poor idiot muttered tackleton no gleam of reason not a gleam  the blind girl took his hand and kissed it held it for a moment in her own two hands and laid her cheek against it tenderly before releasing it there was such unspeakable affection and such fervent gratitude in the act that tackleton himself was moved to say in a milder growl than usual  whats the matter now  i stood it close beside my pillow when i went to sleep last night and remembered it in my dreams and when the day broke and the glorious red sunthe red sun father  red in the mornings and the evenings bertha said poor caleb with a woeful glance at his employer  when it rose and the bright light i almost fear to strike myself against in walking came into the room i turned the little tree towards it and blessed heaven for making things so precious and blessed you for sending them to cheer me  bedlam broke loose said tackleton under his breath we shall arrive at the straitwaistcoat and mufflers soon were getting on  caleb with his hands hooked loosely in each other stared vacantly before him while his daughter spoke as if he really were uncertain i believe he was whether tackleton had done anything to deserve her thanks or not if he could have been a perfectly free agent at that moment required on pain of death to kick the toy merchant or fall at his feet according to his merits i believe it would have been an even chance which course he would have taken yet caleb knew that with his own hands he had brought the little rosetree home for her so carefully and that with his own lips he had forged the innocent deception which should help to keep her from suspecting how much how very much he every day denied himself that she might be happier  bertha said tackleton assuming for the nonce a little cordiality come here  oh i can come straight to you you neednt guide me she rejoined  shall i tell you a secret bertha  if you will she answered eagerly  how bright the darkened face how adorned with light the listening head  this is the day on which little whatshername the spoilt child peerybingles wife pays her regular visit to youmakes her fantastic picnic here ant it said tackleton with a strong expression of distaste for the whole concern  yes replied bertha this is the day  i thought so said tackleton i should like to join the party  do you hear that father cried the blind girl in an ecstasy  yes yes i hear it murmured caleb with the fixed look of a sleepwalker but i dont believe it its one of my lies ive no doubt  you see ii want to bring the peerybingles a little more into company with may fielding said tackleton im going to be married to may  married cried the blind girl starting from him  shes such a confounded idiot muttered tackleton that i was afraid shed never comprehend me ah bertha married church parson clerk beadle glass coach bells breakfast bridecake favours marrowbones cleavers and all the rest of the tomfoolery a wedding you know a wedding dont you know what a wedding is  i know replied the blind girl in a gentle tone i understand  do you muttered tackleton its more than i expected well on that account i want to join the party and to bring may and her mother ill send in a little something or other before the afternoon a cold leg of mutton or some comfortable trifle of that sort youll expect me  yes she answered  she had drooped her head and turned away and so stood with her hands crossed musing  i dont think you will muttered tackleton looking at her for you seem to have forgotten all about it already caleb  i may venture to say im here i suppose thought caleb sir  take care she dont forget what ive been saying to her  she never forgets returned caleb its one of the few things she ant clever in  every man thinks his own geese swans observed the toy merchant with a shrug poor devil  having delivered himself of which remark with infinite contempt old gruff and tackleton withdrew  bertha remained where he had left her lost in meditation the gaiety had vanished from her downcast face and it was very sad three or four times she shook her head as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss but her sorrowful reflections found no vent in words  it was not until caleb had been occupied some time in yoking a team of horses to a waggon by the summary process of nailing the harness to the vital parts of their bodies that she drew near to his workingstool and sitting down beside him said  father i am lonely in the dark i want my eyes my patient willing eyes  here they are said caleb always ready they are more yours than mine bertha any hour in the fourandtwenty what shall your eyes do for you dear  look round the room father  all right said caleb no sooner said than done bertha  tell me about it  its much the same as usual said caleb homely but very snug the gay colours on the walls the bright flowers on the plates and dishes the shining wood where there are beams or panels the general cheerfulness and neatness of the buildingmake it very pretty  cheerful and neat it was wherever berthas hands could busy themselves but nowhere else were cheerfulness and neatness possible in the old crazy shed which calebs fancy so transformed  you have your working dress on and are not so gallant as when you wear the handsome coat said bertha touching him  not quite so gallant answered caleb pretty brisk though  father said the blind girl drawing close to his side and stealing one arm round his neck tell me something about may she is very fair  she is indeed said caleb and she was indeed it was quite a rare thing to caleb not to have to draw on his invention  her hair is dark said bertha pensively darker than mine her voice is sweet and musical i know i have often loved to hear it her shape  theres not a dolls in all the room to equal it said caleb and her eyes  he stopped for bertha had drawn closer round his neck and from the arm that clung about him came a warning pressure which he understood too well  he coughed a moment hammered for a moment and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling bowl his infallible resource in all such difficulties  our friend father our benefactor i am never tired you know of hearing about himnow was i ever she said hastily  of course not answered caleb and with reason  ah with how much reason cried the blind girl with such fervency that caleb though his motives were so pure could not endure to meet her face but dropped his eyes as if she could have read in them his innocent deceit  then tell me again about him dear father said bertha many times again his face is benevolent kind and tender honest and true i am sure it is the manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a show of roughness and unwillingness beats in its every look and glance  and makes it noble added caleb in his quiet desperation  and makes it noble cried the blind girl he is older than may father  yees said caleb reluctantly hes a little older than may but that dont signify  oh father yes to be his patient companion in infirmity and age to be his gentle nurse in sickness and his constant friend in suffering and sorrow to know no weariness in working for his sake to watch him tend him sit beside his bed and talk to him awake and pray for him asleep what privileges these would be what opportunities for proving all her truth and her devotion to him would she do all this dear father  no doubt of it said caleb  i love her father i can love her from my soul exclaimed the blind girl and saying so she laid her poor blind face on calebs shoulder and so wept and wept that he was almost sorry to have brought that tearful happiness upon her  in the meantime there had been a pretty sharp commotion at john peerybingles for little mrs peerybingle naturally couldnt think of going anywhere without the baby and to get the baby under way took time not that there was much of the baby speaking of it as a thing of weight and measure but there was a vast deal to do about and about it and it all had to be done by easy stages for instance when the baby was got by hook and by crook to a certain point of dressing and you might have rationally supposed that another touch or two would finish him off and turn him out a tiptop baby challenging the world he was unexpectedly extinguished in a flannel cap and hustled off to bed where he simmered so to speak between two blankets for the best part of an hour from this state of inaction he was then recalled shining very much and roaring violently to partake ofwell i would rather say if youll permit me to speak generallyof a slight repast after which he went to sleep again mrs peerybingle took advantage of this interval to make herself as smart in a small way as ever you saw anybody in all your life and during the same short truce miss slowboy insinuated herself into a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious that it had no connection with herself or anything else in the universe but was a shrunken dogseared independent fact pursuing its lonely course without the least regard to anybody by this time the baby being all alive again was invested by the united efforts of mrs peerybingle and miss slowboy with a creamcoloured mantle for its body and a sort of nankeen raised pie for its head and so in course of time they all three got down to the door where the old horse had already taken more than the full value of his days toll out of the turnpike trust by tearing up the road with his impatient autographs and whence boxer might be dimly seen in the remote perspective standing looking back and tempting him to come on without orders  as to a chair or anything of that kind for helping mrs peerybingle into the cart you know very little of john if you think that was necessary before you could have seen him lift her from the ground there she was in her place fresh and rosy saying john how can you think of tilly  if i might be allowed to mention a young ladys legs on any terms i would observe of miss slowboys that there was a fatality about them which rendered them singularly liable to be grazed and that she never effected the smallest ascent or descent without recording the circumstance upon them with a notch as robinson crusoe marked the days upon his wooden calendar but as this might be considered ungenteel ill think of it  john youve got the basket with the veal and ham pie and things and the bottles of beer said dot if you havent you must turn round again this very minute  youre a nice little article returned the carrier to be talking about turning round after keeping me a full quarter of an hour behind my time  i am sorry for it john said dot in a great bustle but i really could not think of going to berthasi would not do it john on any accountwithout the veal and ham pie and things and the bottles of beer way  this monosyllable was addressed to the horse who didnt mind it at all  oh do way john said mrs peerybingle please  itll be time enough to do that returned john when i begin to leave things behind me the baskets safe enough  what a hardhearted monster you must be john not to have said so at once and save me such a turn i declare i wouldnt go to berthas without the veal and ham pie and things and the bottles of beer for any money regularly once a fortnight ever since we have been married john have we made our little picnic there if anything was to go wrong with it i should almost think we were never to be lucky again  it was a kind thought in the first instance said the carrier and i honour you for it little woman  my dear john replied dot turning very red dont talk about honouring me good gracious  bythebyeobserved the carrierthat old gentleman  again so visibly and instantly embarrassed  hes an odd fish said the carrier looking straight along the road before them i cant make him out i dont believe theres any harm in him  none at all imim sure theres none at all  yes said the carrier with his eyes attracted to her face by the great earnestness of her manner i am glad you feel so certain of it because its a confirmation to me its curious that he should have taken it into his head to ask leave to go on lodging with us ant it things come about so strangely  so very strangely she rejoined in a low voice scarcely audible  however hes a goodnatured old gentleman said john and pays as a gentleman and i think his word is to be relied upon like a gentlemans i had quite a long talk with him this morning he can hear me better already he says as he gets more used to my voice he told me a great deal about himself and i told him a good deal about myself and a rare lot of questions he asked me i gave him information about my having two beats you know in my business one day to the right from our house and back again another day to the left from our house and back again for hes a stranger and dont know the names of places about here and he seemed quite pleased why then i shall be returning home tonight your way he says when i thought youd be coming in an exactly opposite direction thats capital i may trouble you for another lift perhaps but ill engage not to fall so sound asleep again he was sound asleep surelydot what are you thinking of  thinking of john ii was listening to you  oh thats all right said the honest carrier i was afraid from the look of your face that i had gone rambling on so long as to set you thinking about something else i was very near it ill be bound  dot making no reply they jogged on for some little time in silence but it was not easy to remain silent very long in john peerybingles cart for everybody on the road had something to say though it might only be how are you and indeed it was very often nothing else still to give that back again in the right spirit of cordiality required not merely a nod and a smile but as wholesome an action of the lungs withal as a longwinded parliamentary speech sometimes passengers on foot or horseback plodded on a little way beside the cart for the express purpose of having a chat and then there was a great deal to be said on both sides  then boxer gave occasion to more goodnatured recognitions of and by the carrier than halfadozen christians could have done everybody knew him all along the roadespecially the fowls and pigs who when they saw him approaching with his body all on one side and his ears pricked up inquisitively and that knob of a tail making the most of itself in the air immediately withdrew into remote backsettlements without waiting for the honour of a nearer acquaintance he had business elsewhere going down all the turnings looking into all the wells bolting in and out of all the cottages dashing into the midst of all the dame schools fluttering all the pigeons magnifying the tails of all the cats and trotting into the publichouses like a regular customer wherever he went somebody or other might have been heard to cry halloa heres boxer and out came that somebody forthwith accompanied by at least two or three other somebodies to give john peerybingle and his pretty wife good day  the packages and parcels for the errand cart were numerous and there were many stoppages to take them in and give them out which were not by any means the worst parts of the journey some people were so full of expectation about their parcels and other people were so full of wonder about their parcels and other people were so full of inexhaustible directions about their parcels and john had such a lively interest in all the parcels that it was as good as a play likewise there were articles to carry which required to be considered and discussed and in reference to the adjustment and disposition of which councils had to be holden by the carrier and the senders at which boxer usually assisted in short fits of the closest attention and long fits of tearing round and round the assembled sages and barking himself hoarse of all these little incidents dot was the amused and openeyed spectatress from her chair in the cart and as she sat there looking ona charming little portrait framed to admiration by the tiltthere was no lack of nudgings and glancings and whisperings and envyings among the younger men and this delighted john the carrier beyond measure for he was proud to have his little wife admired knowing that she didnt mind itthat if anything she rather liked it perhaps  the trip was a little foggy to be sure in the january weather and was raw and cold but who cared for such trifles not dot decidedly not tilly slowboy for she deemed sitting in a cart on any terms to be the highest point of human joys the crowning circumstance of earthly hope not the baby ill be sworn for its not in baby nature to be warmer or more sound asleep though its capacity is great in both respects than that blessed young peerybingle was all the way  you couldnt see very far in the fog of course but you could see a great deal its astonishing how much you may see in a thicker fog than that if you will only take the trouble to look for it why even to sit watching for the fairyrings in the fields and for the patches of hoar frost still lingering in the shade near hedges and by trees was a pleasant occupation to make no mention of the unexpected shapes in which the trees themselves came starting out of the mist and glided into it again the hedges were tangled and bare and waved a multitude of blighted garlands in the wind but there was no discouragement in this it was agreeable to contemplate for it made the fireside warmer in possession and the summer greener in expectancy the river looked chilly but it was in motion and moving at a good pacewhich was a great point the canal was rather slow and torpid that must be admitted never mind it would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly in and then there would be skating and sliding and the heavy old barges frozen up somewhere near a wharf would smoke their rusty iron chimneypipes all day and have a lazy time of it  in one place there was a great mound of weeds or stubble burning and they watched the fire so white in the daytime flaring through the fog with only here and there a dash of red in it until in consequence as she observed of the smoke getting up her nose miss slowboy chokedshe could do anything of that sort on the smallest provocationand woke the baby who wouldnt go to sleep again but boxer who was in advance some quarter of a mile or so had already passed the outposts of the town and gained the corner of the street where caleb and his daughter lived and long before they had reached the door he and the blind girl were on the pavement waiting to receive them  boxer by the way made certain delicate distinctions of his own in his communication with bertha which persuade me fully that he knew her to be blind he never sought to attract her attention by looking at her as he often did with other people but touched her invariably what experience he could ever have had of blind people or blind dogs i dont know he had never lived with a blind master nor had mr boxer the elder nor mrs boxer nor any of his respectable family on either side ever been visited with blindness that i am aware of he may have found it out for himself perhaps but he had got hold of it somehow and therefore he had hold of bertha too by the skirt and kept hold until mrs peerybingle and the baby and miss slowboy and the basket were all got safely within doors  may fielding was already come and so was her mothera little querulous chip of an old lady with a peevish face who in right of having preserved a waist like a bedpost was supposed to be a most transcendent figure and who in consequence of having once been better off or of labouring under an impression that she might have been if something had happened which never did happen and seemed to have never been particularly likely to come to passbut its all the samewas very genteel and patronising indeed gruff and tackleton was also there doing the agreeable with the evident sensation of being as perfectly at home and as unquestionably in his own element as a fresh young salmon on the top of the great pyramid  may my dear old friend cried dot running up to meet her what a happiness to see you  her old friend was to the full as hearty and as glad as she and it really was if youll believe me quite a pleasant sight to see them embrace tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question may was very pretty  you know sometimes when you are used to a pretty face how when it comes into contact and comparison with another pretty face it seems for the moment to be homely and faded and hardly to deserve the high opinion you have had of it now this was not at all the case either with dot or may for mays face set off dots and dots face set off mays so naturally and agreeably that as john peerybingle was very near saying when he came into the room they ought to have been born sisterswhich was the only improvement you could have suggested  tackleton had brought his leg of mutton and wonderful to relate a tart besidesbut we dont mind a little dissipation when our brides are in the case we dont get married every dayand in addition to these dainties there were the veal and ham pie and things as mrs peerybingle called them which were chiefly nuts and oranges and cakes and such small deer when the repast was set forth on the board flanked by calebs contribution which was a great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes he was prohibited by solemn compact from producing any other viands tackleton led his intended motherinlaw to the post of honour for the better gracing of this place at the high festival the majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe she also wore her gloves but let us be genteel or die  caleb sat next his daughter dot and her old schoolfellow were side by side the good carrier took care of the bottom of the table miss slowboy was isolated for the time being from every article of furniture but the chair she sat on that she might have nothing else to knock the babys head against  as tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys they stared at her and at the company the venerable old gentleman at the streetdoors who were all in full action showed especial interest in the party pausing occasionally before leaping as if they were listening to the conversation and then plunging wildly over and over a great many times without halting for breathas in a frantic state of delight with the whole proceedings  certainly if these old gentlemen were inclined to have a fiendish joy in the contemplation of tackletons discomfiture they had good reason to be satisfied tackleton couldnt get on at all and the more cheerful his intended bride became in dots society the less he liked it though he had brought them together for that purpose for he was a regular dog in the manger was tackleton and when they laughed and he couldnt he took it into his head immediately that they must be laughing at him  ah may said dot dear dear what changes to talk of those merry school days makes one young again  why you ant particularly old at any time are you said tackleton  look at my sober plodding husband there returned dot he adds twenty years to my age at least dont you john  forty john replied  how many youll add to marys i am sure i dont know said dot laughing but she cant be much less than a hundred years of age on her next birthday  ha ha laughed tackleton hollow as a drum that laugh though and he looked as if he could have twisted dots neck comfortably  dear dear said dot only to remember how we used to talk at school about the husbands we would choose i dont know how young and how handsome and how gay and how lively mine was not to be and as to maysah dear i dont know whether to laugh or cry when i think what silly girls we were  may seemed to know which to do for the colour flashed into her face and tears stood in her eyes  even the very persons themselvesreal live young menwe fixed on sometimes said dot we little thought how things would come about i never fixed on john im sure i never so much as thought of him and if i had told you you were ever to be married to mr tackleton why youd have slapped me wouldnt you may  though may didnt say yes she certainly didnt say no or express no by any means  tackleton laughedquite shouted he laughed so loud john peerybingle laughed too in his ordinary goodnatured and contented manner but his was a mere whisper of a laugh to tackletons  you couldnt help yourselves for all that you couldnt resist us you see said tackleton here we are here we are where are your gay young bridegrooms now  some of them are dead said dot and some of them forgotten some of them if they could stand among us at this moment would not believe we were the same creatures would not believe that what they saw and heard was real and we could forget them so no they would not believe one word of it  why dot exclaimed the carrier little woman  she had spoken with such earnestness and fire that she stood in need of some recalling to herself without doubt her husbands check was very gentle for he merely interfered as he supposed to shield old tackleton but it proved effectual for she stopped and said no more there was an uncommon agitation even in her silence which the wary tackleton who had brought his halfshut eye to bear upon her noted closely and remembered to some purpose too  may uttered no word good or bad but sat quite still with her eyes cast down and made no sign of interest in what had passed the good lady her mother now interposed observing in the first instance that girls were girls and bygones bygones and that so long as young people were young and thoughtless they would probably conduct themselves like young and thoughtless persons with two or three other positions of a no less sound and incontrovertible character she then remarked in a devout spirit that she thanked heaven she had always found in her daughter may a dutiful and obedient child for which she took no credit to herself though she had every reason to believe it was entirely owing to herself with regard to mr tackleton she said that he was in a moral point of view an undeniable individual and that he was in an eligible point of view a soninlaw to be desired no one in their senses could doubt she was very emphatic here with regard to the family into which he was so soon about after some solicitation to be admitted she believed mr tackleton knew that although reduced in purse it had some pretensions to gentility and that if certain circumstances not wholly unconnected she would go so far as to say with the indigo trade but to which she would not more particularly refer had happened differently it might perhaps have been in possession of wealth she then remarked that she would not allude to the past and would not mention that her daughter had for some time rejected the suit of mr tackleton and that she would not say a great many other things which she did say at great length finally she delivered it as the general result of her observation and experience that those marriages in which there was least of what was romantically and sillily called love were always the happiest and that she anticipated the greatest possible amount of blissnot rapturous bliss but the solid steadygoing articlefrom the approaching nuptials she concluded by informing the company that tomorrow was the day she had lived for expressly and that when it was over she would desire nothing better than to be packed up and disposed of in any genteel place of burial  as these remarks were quite unanswerablewhich is the happy property of all remarks that are sufficiently wide of the purposethey changed the current of the conversation and diverted the general attention to the veal and ham pie the cold mutton the potatoes and the tart in order that the bottled beer might not be slighted john peerybingle proposed tomorrow the weddingday and called upon them to drink a bumper to it before he proceeded on his journey  for you ought to know that he only rested there and gave the old horse a bait he had to go some four or five miles farther on and when he returned in the evening he called for dot and took another rest on his way home this was the order of the day on all the picnic occasions and had been ever since their institution  there were two persons present besides the bride and bridegroom elect who did but indifferent honour to the toast one of these was dot too flushed and discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence of the moment the other bertha who rose up hurriedly before the rest and left the table  goodbye said stout john peerybingle pulling on his dreadnought coat i shall be back at the old time goodbye all  goodbye john returned caleb  he seemed to say it by rote and to wave his hand in the same unconscious manner for he stood observing bertha with an anxious wondering face that never altered its expression  goodbye young shaver said the jolly carrier bending down to kiss the child which tilly slowboy now intent upon her knife and fork had deposited asleep and strange to say without damage in a little cot of berthas furnishing goodbye time will come i suppose when youll turn out into the cold my little friend and leave your old father to enjoy his pipe and his rheumatics in the chimneycorner eh wheres dot  im here john she said starting  come come returned the carrier clapping his sounding hands wheres the pipe  i quite forgot the pipe john  forgot the pipe was such a wonder ever heard of she forgot the pipe  illill fill it directly its soon done  but it was not so soon done either it lay in the usual placethe carriers dreadnought pocketwith the little pouch her own work from which she was used to fill it but her hand shook so that she entangled it and yet her hand was small enough to have come out easily i am sure and bungled terribly the filling of the pipe and lighting it those little offices in which i have commended her discretion were vilely done from first to last during the whole process tackleton stood looking on maliciously with the halfclosed eye which whenever it met hersor caught it for it can hardly be said to have ever met another eye rather being a kind of trap to snatch it upaugmented her confusion in a most remarkable degree  why what a clumsy dot you are this afternoon said john i could have done it better myself i verily believe  with these goodnatured words he strode away and presently was heard in company with boxer and the old horse and the cart making lively music down the road what time the dreamy caleb still stood watching his blind daughter with the same expression on his face  bertha said caleb softly what has happened how changed you are my darling in a few hourssince this morning you silent and dull all day what is it tell me  oh father father cried the blind girl bursting into tears oh my hard hard fate  caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he answered her  but think how cheerful and how happy you have been bertha how good and how much loved by many people  that strikes me to the heart dear father always so mindful of me always so kind to me  caleb was very much perplexed to understand her  to beto be blind bertha my poor dear he faltered is a great affliction but  i have never felt it cried the blind girl i have never felt it in its fulness never i have sometimes wished that i could see you or could see himonly once dear father only for one little minutethat i might know what it is i treasure up she laid her hands upon her breast and hold here that i might be sure i have it right and sometimes but then i was a child i have wept in my prayers at night to think that when your images ascended from my heart to heaven they might not be the true resemblance of yourselves but i have never had these feelings long they have passed away and left me tranquil and contented  and they will again said caleb  but father oh my good gentle father bear with me if i am wicked said the blind girl this is not the sorrow that so weighs me down  her father could not choose but let his moist eyes overflow she was so earnest and pathetic but he did not understand her yet  bring her to me said bertha i cannot hold it closed and shut within myself bring her to me father  she knew he hesitated and said may bring may  may heard the mention of her name and coming quietly towards her touched her on the arm the blind girl turned immediately and held her by both hands  look into my face dear heart sweet heart said bertha read it with your beautiful eyes and tell me if the truth is written on it  dear bertha yes  the blind girl still upturning the blank sightless face down which the tears were coursing fast addressed her in these words  there is not in my soul a wish or thought that is not for your good bright may there is not in my soul a grateful recollection stronger than the deep remembrance which is stored there of the many many times when in the full pride of sight and beauty you have had consideration for blind bertha even when we two were children or when bertha was as much a child as ever blindness can be every blessing on your head light upon your happy course not the less my dear mayand she drew towards her in a closer graspnot the less my bird because today the knowledge that you are to be his wife has wrung my heart almost to breaking father may mary oh forgive me that it is so for the sake of all he has done to relieve the weariness of my dark life and for the sake of the belief you have in me when i call heaven to witness that i could not wish him married to a wife more worthy of his goodness  while speaking she had released may fieldings hands and clasped her garments in an attitude of mingled supplication and love sinking lower and lower down as she proceeded in her strange confession she dropped at last at the feet of her friend and hid her blind face in the folds of her dress  great power exclaimed her father smitten at one blow with the truth have i deceived her from her cradle but to break her heart at last  it was well for all of them that dot that beaming useful busy little dotfor such she was whatever faults she had and however you may learn to hate her in good timeit was well for all of them i say that she was there or where this would have ended it were hard to tell but dot recovering her selfpossession interposed before may could reply or caleb say another word  come come dear bertha come away with me give her your arm may so how composed she is you see already and how good it is of her to mind us said the cheery little woman kissing her upon the forehead come away dear bertha come and heres her good father will come with her wont you caleb tobesure  well well she was a noble little dot in such things and it must have been an obdurate nature that could have withstood her influence when she had got poor caleb and his bertha away that they might comfort and console each other as she knew they only could she presently came bouncing backthe saying is as fresh as any daisy i say fresherto mount guard over that bridling little piece of consequence in the cap and gloves and prevent the dear old creature from making discoveries  so bring me the precious baby tilly said she drawing a chair to the fire and while i have it in my lap heres mrs fielding tilly will tell me all about the management of babies and put me right in twenty points where im as wrong as can be wont you mrs fielding  not even the welsh giant who according to the popular expression was so slow as to perform a fatal surgical operation upon himself in emulation of a juggling trick achieved by his arch enemy at breakfasttime not even he fell half so readily into the snare prepared for him as the old lady into this artful pitfall the fact of tackleton having walked out and furthermore of two or three people having been talking together at a distance for two minutes leaving her to her own resources was quite enough to have put her on her dignity and the bewailment of that mysterious convulsion in the indigo trade for fourandtwenty hours but this becoming deference to her experience on the part of the young mother was so irresistible that after a short affectation of humility she began to enlighten her with the best grace in the world and sitting bolt upright before the wicked dot she did in half an hour deliver more infallible domestic recipes and precepts than would if acted on have utterly destroyed and done up that young peerybingle though he had been an infant samson  to change the theme dot did a little needleworkshe carried the contents of a whole workbox in her pocket however she contrived it i dont knowthen did a little nursing then a little more needlework then had a little whispering chat with may while the old lady dozed and so in little bits of bustle which was quite her manner always found it a very short afternoon then as it grew dark and as it was a solemn part of this institution of the picnic that she should perform all berthas household tasks she trimmed the fire and swept the hearth and set the teaboard out and drew the curtain and lighted a candle then she played an air or two on a rude kind of harp which caleb had contrived for bertha and played them very well for nature had made her delicate little ear as choice a one for music as it would have been for jewels if she had had any to wear by this time it was the established hour for having tea and tackleton came back again to share the meal and spend the evening  caleb and bertha had returned some time before and caleb had sat down to his afternoons work but he couldnt settle to it poor fellow being anxious and remorseful for his daughter it was touching to see him sitting idle on his working stool regarding her so wistfully and always saying in his face have i deceived her from her cradle but to break her heart  when it was night and tea was done and dot had nothing more to do in washing up the cups and saucers in a wordfor i must come to it and there is no use in putting it offwhen the time drew nigh for expecting the carriers return in every sound of distant wheels her manner changed again her colour came and went and she was very restless not as good wives are when listening for their husbands no no no it was another sort of restlessness from that  wheels heard a horses feet the barking of a dog the gradual approach of all the sounds the scratching paw of boxer at the door  whose step is that cried bertha starting up  whose step returned the carrier standing in the portal with his brown face ruddy as a winter berry from the keen night air why mine  the other step said bertha the mans tread behind you  she is not to be deceived observed the carrier laughing come along sir youll be welcome never fear  he spoke in a loud tone and as he spoke the deaf old gentleman entered  hes not so much a stranger that you havent seen him once caleb said the carrier youll give him house room till we go  oh surely john and take it as an honour  hes the best company on earth to talk secrets in said john i have reasonable good lungs but he tries em i can tell you sit down sir all friends here and glad to see you  when he had imparted this assurance in a voice that amply corroborated what he had said about his lungs he added in his natural tone a chair in the chimneycorner and leave to sit quite silent and look pleasantly about him is all he cares for hes easily pleased  bertha had been listening intently she called caleb to her side when he had set the chair and asked him in a low voice to describe their visitor when he had done so truly now with scrupulous fidelity she moved for the first time since he had come in and sighed and seemed to have no further interest concerning him  the carrier was in high spirits good fellow that he was and fonder of his little wife than ever  a clumsy dot she was this afternoon he said encircling her with his rough arm as she stood removed from the rest and yet i like her somehow see yonder dot  he pointed to the old man she looked down i think she trembled  hesha ha hahes full of admiration for you said the carrier talked of nothing else the whole way here why hes a brave old boy i like him for it  i wish he had a better subject john she said with an uneasy glance about the room at tackleton especially  a better subject cried the jovial john theres no such thing come off with the greatcoat off with the thick shawl off with the heavy wrappers and a cosy halfhour by the fire my humble service mistress a game at cribbage you and i thats hearty the cards and board dot and a glass of beer here if theres any left small wife  his challenge was addressed to the old lady who accepting it with gracious readiness they were soon engaged upon the game at first the carrier looked about him sometimes with a smile or now and then called dot to peep over his shoulder at his hand and advise him on some knotty point but his adversary being a rigid disciplinarian and subject to an occasional weakness in respect of pegging more than she was entitled to required such vigilance on his part as left him neither eyes nor ears to spare thus his whole attention gradually became absorbed upon the cards and he thought of nothing else until a hand upon his shoulder restored him to a consciousness of tackleton  i am sorry to disturb youbut a word directly  im going to deal returned the carrier its a crisis  it is said tackleton come here man  there was that in his pale face which made the other rise immediately and ask him in a hurry what the matter was  hush john peerybingle said tackleton i am sorry for this i am indeed i have been afraid of it i have suspected it from the first  what is it asked the carrier with a frightened aspect  hush ill show you if youll come with me  the carrier accompanied him without another word they went across a yard where the stars were shining and by a little sidedoor into tackletons own countinghouse where there was a glass window commanding the wareroom which was closed for the night there was no light in the countinghouse itself but there were lamps in the long narrow wareroom and consequently the window was bright  a moment said tackleton can you bear to look through that window do you think  why not returned the carrier  a moment more said tackleton dont commit any violence its of no use its dangerous too youre a strongmade man and you might do murder before you know it  the carrier looked him in the face and recoiled a step as if he had been struck in one stride he was at the window and he saw  oh shadow on the hearth oh truthful cricket oh perfidious wife  he saw her with the old manold no longer but erect and gallantbearing in his hand the false white hair that had won his way into their desolate and miserable home he saw her listening to him as he bent his head to whisper in her ear and suffering him to clasp her round the waist as they moved slowly down the dim wooden gallery towards the door by which they had entered it he saw them stop and saw her turnto have the face the face he loved so so presented to his viewand saw her with her own hands adjust the lie upon his head laughing as she did it at his unsuspicious nature  he clenched his strong right hand at first as if it would have beaten down a lion but opening it immediately again he spread it out before the eyes of tackleton for he was tender of her even then and so as they passed out fell down upon a desk and was as weak as any infant  he was wrapped up to the chin and busy with his horse and parcels when she came into the room prepared for going home  now john dear good night may good night bertha  could she kiss them could she be blithe and cheerful in her parting could she venture to reveal her face to them without a blush yes tackleton observed her closely and she did all this  tilly was hushing the baby and she crossed and recrossed tackleton a dozen times repeating drowsily  did the knowledge that it was to be its wives then wring its hearts almost to breaking and did its fathers deceive it from its cradles but to break its hearts at last  now tilly give me the baby good night mr tackleton wheres john for goodness sake  hes going to walk beside the horses head said tackleton who helped her to her seat  my dear john walk tonight  the muffled figure of her husband made a hasty sign in the affirmative and the false stranger and the little nurse being in their places the old horse moved off boxer the unconscious boxer running on before running back running round and round the cart and barking as triumphantly and merrily as ever  when tackleton had gone off likewise escorting may and her mother home poor caleb sat down by the fire beside his daughter anxious and remorseful at the core and still saying in his wistful contemplation of her have i deceived her from her cradle but to break her heart at last  the toys that had been set in motion for the baby had all stopped and run down long ago in the faint light and silence the imperturbably calm dolls the agitated rockinghorses with distended eyes and nostrils the old gentlemen at the streetdoors standing half doubled up upon their failing knees and ankles the wryfaced nutcrackers the very beasts upon their way into the ark in twos like a boardingschool out walking might have been imagined to be stricken motionless with fantastic wonder at dot being false or tackleton beloved under any combination of circumstances     chirp the third   the dutch clock in the corner struck ten when the carrier sat down by his fireside so troubled and griefworn that he seemed to scare the cuckoo who having cut his ten melodious announcements as short as possible plunged back into the moorish palace again and clapped his little door behind him as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings  if the little haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes and had cut at every stroke into the carriers heart he never could have gashed and wounded it as dot had done  it was a heart so full of love for her so bound up and held together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance spun from the daily working of her many qualities of endearment it was a heart in which she had enshrined herself so gently and so closely a heart so single and so earnest in its truth so strong in right so weak in wrongthat it could cherish neither passion nor revenge at first and had only room to hold the broken image of its idol  but slowly slowly as the carrier sat brooding on his hearth now cold and dark other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him as an angry wind comes rising in the night the stranger was beneath his outraged roof three steps would take him to his chamber door one blow would beat it in you might do murder before you know it tackleton had said how could it be murder if he gave the villain time to grapple with him hand to hand he was the younger man  it was an illtimed thought bad for the dark mood of his mind it was an angry thought goading him to some avenging act that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would dread to pass by night and where the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when the moon was dim and hear wild noises in the stormy weather  he was the younger man yes yes some lover who had won the heart that he had never touched some lover of her early choice of whom she had thought and dreamed for whom she had pined and pined when he had fancied her so happy by his side oh agony to think of it  she had been abovestairs with the baby getting it to bed as he sat brooding on the hearth she came close beside him without his knowledgein the turning of the rack of his great misery he lost all other soundsand put her little stool at his feet he only knew it when he felt her hand upon his own and saw her looking up into his face  with wonder no it was his first impression and he was fain to look at her again to set it right no not with wonder with an eager and inquiring look but not with wonder at first it was alarmed and serious then it changed into a strange wild dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts then there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow and her bent head and falling hair  though the power of omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment he had too much of its diviner property of mercy in his breast to have turned one feathers weight of it against her but he could not bear to see her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her with love and pride so innocent and gay and when she rose and left him sobbing as she went he felt it a relief to have the vacant place beside him rather than her so longcherished presence this in itself was anguish keener than all reminding him how desolate he was become and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder  illustration when suddenly the struggling fire illuminated the whole chimney with a glow of light and the cricket on the hearth began to chirp  the more he felt this and the more he knew he could have better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with her little child upon her breast the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy he looked about him for a weapon  there was a gun hanging on the wall he took it down and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious strangers room he knew the gun was loaded some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a wild beast seized him and dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous demon in complete possession of him casting out all milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire  that phrase is wrong not casting out his milder thoughts but artfully transforming them changing them into scourges to drive him on turning water into blood love into hate gentleness into blind ferocity her image sorrowing humbled but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless power never left his mind but staying there it urged him to the door raised the weapon to his shoulder fitted and nerved his fingers to the trigger and cried kill him in his bed  he reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door he already held it lifted in the air some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to him to fly for gods sake by the window  when suddenly the struggling fire illuminated the whole chimney with a glow of light and the cricket on the hearth began to chirp  no sound he could have heard no human voice not even hers could so have moved and softened him the artless words in which she had told him of her love for this same cricket were once more freshly spoken her trembling earnest manner at the moment was again before him her pleasant voiceoh what a voice it was for making household music at the fireside of an honest manthrilled through and through his better nature and awoke it into life and action  he recoiled from the door like a man walking in his sleep awakened from a frightful dream and put the gun aside clasping his hands before his face he then sat down again beside the fire and found relief in tears  the cricket on the hearth came out into the room and stood in fairy shape before him  i love it said the fairy voice repeating what he well remembered for the many times i have heard it and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me  she said so cried the carrier true  this has been a happy home john and i love the cricket for its sake  it has been heaven knows returned the carrier she made it happy alwaysuntil now  so gracefully sweettempered so domestic joyful busy and lighthearted said the voice  otherwise i never could have loved her as i did returned the carrier  the voice correcting him said do  the carrier repeated as i did but not firmly his faltering tongue resisted his control and would speak in its own way for itself and him  the figure in an attitude of invocation raised its hand and said  upon your own hearth  the hearth she has blighted interposed the carrier  the hearth she hashow oftenblessed and brightened said the cricket the hearth which but for her were only a few stones and bricks and rusty bars but which has been through her the altar of your home on which you have nightly sacrificed some petty passion selfishness or care and offered up the homage of a tranquil mind a trusting nature and an overflowing heart so that the smoke from this poor chimney has gone upward with a better fragrance than the richest incense that is burnt before the richest shrines in all the gaudy temples of this worldupon your own hearth in its quiet sanctuary surrounded by its gentle influences and associations hear her hear me hear everything that speaks the language of your hearth and home  and pleads for her inquired the carrier  all things that speak the language of your hearth and home must plead for her returned the cricket for they speak the truth  and while the carrier with his head upon his hands continued to sit meditating in his chair the presence stood beside him suggesting his reflections by its power and presenting them before him as in a glass or picture it was not a solitary presence from the hearthstone from the chimney from the clock the pipe the kettle and the cradle from the floor the walls the ceiling and the stairs from the cart without and the cupboard within and the household implements from everything and every place with which she had ever been familiar and with which she had ever entwined one recollection of herself in her unhappy husbands mindfairies came trooping forth not to stand beside him as the cricket did but to busy and bestir themselves to do all honour to her image to pull him by the skirts and point to it when it appeared to cluster round it and embrace it and strew flowers for it to tread on to try to crown its fair head with their tiny hands to show that they were fond of it and loved it and that there was not one ugly wicked or accusatory creature to claim knowledge of itnone but their playful and approving selves  his thoughts were constant to her image it was always there  she sat plying her needle before the fire and singing to herself such a blithe thriving steady little dot the fairy figures turned upon him all at once by one consent with one prodigious concentrated stare and seemed to say is this the light wife you are mourning for  there were sounds of gaiety outside musical instruments and noisy tongues and laughter a crowd of young merrymakers came pouring in among whom were may fielding and a score of pretty girls dot was the fairest of them all as young as any of them too they came to summon her to join their party it was a dance if ever little foot were made for dancing hers was surely but she laughed and shook her head and pointed to her cookery on the fire and her table ready spread with an exulting defiance that rendered her more charming than she was before and so she merrily dismissed them nodding to her wouldbe partners one by one as they passed out with a comical indifference enough to make them go and drown themselves immediately if they were her admirersand they must have been so more or less they couldnt help it and yet indifference was not her character oh no for presently there came a certain carrier to the door and bless her what a welcome she bestowed upon him  again the staring figures turned upon him all at once and seemed to say is this the wife who has forsaken you  a shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture call it what you will a great shadow of the stranger as he first stood underneath their roof covering its surface and blotting out all other objects but the nimble fairies worked like bees to clear it off again and dot again was there still bright and beautiful  rocking her little baby in its cradle singing to it softly and resting her head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in the musing figure by which the fairy cricket stood  the nighti mean the real night not going by fairy clockswas wearing now and in this stage of the carriers thoughts the moon burst out and shone brightly in the sky perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen also in his mind and he could think more soberly of what had happened  although the shadow of the stranger fell at intervals upon the glassalways distinct and big and thoroughly definedit never fell so darkly as at first whenever it appeared the fairies uttered a general cry of consternation and plied their little arms and legs with inconceivable activity to rub it out and whenever they got at dot again and showed her to him once more bright and beautiful they cheered in the most inspiring manner  they never showed her otherwise than beautiful and bright for they were household spirits to whom falsehood is an annihilation and being so what dot was there for them but the one active beaming pleasant little creature who had been the light and sun of the carriers home  the fairies were prodigiously excited when they showed her with the baby gossipping among a knot of sage old matrons and affecting to be wondrous old and matronly herself and leaning in a staid demure old way upon her husbands arm attemptingshe such a bud of a little womanto convey the idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in general and of being the sort of person to whom it was no novelty at all to be a mother yet in the same breath they showed her laughing at the carrier for being awkward and pulling up his shirt collar to make him smart and mincing merrily about that very room to teach him how to dance  they turned and stared immensely at him when they showed her with the blind girl for though she carried cheerfulness and animation with her wheresoever she went she bore those influences into caleb plummers home heaped up and running over the blind girls love for her and trust in her and gratitude to her her own good busy way of setting berthas thanks aside her dexterous little arts for filling up each moment of the visit in doing something useful to the house and really working hard while feigning to make holiday her bountiful provision of those standing delicacies the veal and ham pie and the bottles of beer her radiant little face arriving at the door and taking leave the wonderful expression in her whole self from her neat foot to the crown of her head of being a part of the establishmenta something necessary to it which it couldnt be withoutall this the fairies revelled in and loved her for and once again they looked upon him all at once appealingly and seemed to say while some among them nestled in her dress and fondled her is this the wife who has betrayed your confidence  more than once or twice or thrice in the long thoughtful night they showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat with her bent head her hands clasped on her brow her falling hair as he had seen her last and when they found her thus they neither turned nor looked upon him but gathered close round her and comforted and kissed her and pressed on one another to show sympathy and kindness to her and forgot him altogether  thus the night passed the moon went down the stars grew pale the cold day broke the sun rose the carrier still sat musing in the chimneycorner he had sat there with his head upon his hands all night all night the faithful cricket had been chirp chirp chirping on the hearth all night he had listened to its voice all night the household fairies had been busy with him all night she had been amiable and blameless in the glass except when that one shadow fell upon it  he rose up when it was broad day and washed and dressed himself he couldnt go about his customary cheerful avocationshe wanted spirit for thembut it mattered the less that it was tackletons weddingday and he had arranged to make his rounds by proxy he had thought to have gone merrily to church with dot but such plans were at an end it was their own weddingday too ah how little he had looked for such a close to such a year  the carrier expected that tackleton would pay him an early visit and he was right he had not walked to and fro before his own door many minutes when he saw the toy merchant coming in his chaise along the road as the chaise drew nearer he perceived that tackleton was dressed out sprucely for his marriage and that he had decorated his horses head with flowers and favours  the horse looked much more like a bridegroom than tackleton whose halfclosed eye was more disagreeably expressive than ever but the carrier took little heed of this his thoughts had other occupation  john peerybingle said tackleton with an air of condolence my good fellow how do you find yourself this morning  i have had but a poor night master tackleton returned the carrier shaking his head for i have been a good deal disturbed in my mind but its over now can you spare me half an hour or so for some private talk  i came on purpose returned tackleton alighting never mind the horse hell stand quiet enough with the reins over this post if youll give him a mouthful of hay  the carrier having brought it from his stable and set it before him they turned into the house  you are not married before noon he said i think  no answered tackleton plenty of time plenty of time  when they entered the kitchen tilly slowboy was rapping at the strangers door which was only removed from it by a few steps one of her very red eyes for tilly had been crying all night long because her mistress cried was at the keyhole and she was knocking very loud and seemed frightened  if you please i cant make nobody hear said tilly looking round i hope nobody ant gone and been and died if you please  this philanthropic wish miss slowboy emphasized with various new raps and kicks at the door which led to no result whatever  shall i go said tackleton its curious  the carrier who had turned his face from the door signed him to go if he would  so tackleton went to tilly slowboys relief and he too kicked and knocked and he too failed to get the least reply but he thought of trying the handle of the door and as it opened easily he peeped in looked in went in and soon came running out again  john peerybingle said tackleton in his ear i hope there has been nothingnothing rash in the night  the carrier turned upon him quickly  because hes gone said tackleton and the windows open i dont see any marksto be sure its almost on a level with the garden but i was afraid there might have been somesome scuffle eh  he nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether he looked at him so hard and he gave his eye and his face and his whole person a sharp twist as if he would have screwed the truth out of him  make yourself easy said the carrier he went into that room last night without harm in word or deed from me and no one has entered it since he is away of his own freewill id go out gladly at that door and beg my bread from house to house for life if i could so change the past that he had never come but he has come and gone and i have done with him  ohwell i think he has got off pretty easy said tackleton taking a chair  the sneer was lost upon the carrier who sat down too and shaded his face with his hand for some little time before proceeding  you showed me last night he said at length my wifemy wife that i lovesecretly  and tenderly insinuated tackleton  conniving at that mans disguise and giving him opportunities of meeting her alone i think theres no sight i wouldnt have rather seen than that i think theres no man in the world i wouldnt have rather had to show it me  i confess to having had my suspicions always said tackleton and that has made me objectionable here i know  but as you did show it me pursued the carrier not minding him and as you saw her my wife my wife that i lovehis voice and eye and hand grew steadier and firmer as he repeated these words evidently in pursuance of a steadfast purposeas you saw her at this disadvantage it is right and just that you should also see with my eyes and look into my breast and know what my mind is upon the subject for its settled said the carrier regarding him attentively and nothing can shake it now  tackleton muttered a few general words of assent about its being necessary to vindicate something or other but he was overawed by the manner of his companion plain and unpolished as it was it had a something dignified and noble in it which nothing but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the man could have imparted  i am a plain rough man pursued the carrier with very little to recommend me i am not a clever man as you very well know i am not a young man i loved my little dot because i had seen her grow up from a child in her fathers house because i knew how precious she was because she had been my life for years and years theres many men i cant compare with who never could have loved my little dot like me i think  he paused and softly beat the ground a short time with his foot before resuming  i often thought that though i wasnt good enough for her i should make her a kind husband and perhaps know her value better than another and in this way i reconciled it to myself and came to think it might be possible that we should be married and in the end it came about and we were married  hah said tackleton with a significant shake of his head  i had studied myself i had had experience of myself i knew how much i loved her and how happy i should be pursued the carrier but i had noti feel it nowsufficiently considered her  to be sure said tackleton giddiness frivolity fickleness love of admiration not considered all left out of sight hah  you had best not interrupt me said the carrier with some sternness till you understand me and youre wide of doing so if yesterday id have struck that man down at a blow who dared to breathe a word against her today id set my foot upon his face if he was my brother  the toy merchant gazed at him in astonishment he went on in a softer tone  did i consider said the carrier that i took herat her age and with her beautyfrom her young companions and the many scenes of which she was the ornament in which she was the brightest little star that ever shone to shut her up from day to day in my dull house and keep my tedious company did i consider how little suited i was to her sprightly humour and how wearisome a plodding man like me must be to one of her quick spirit did i consider that it was no merit in me or claim in me that i loved her when everybody must who knew her never i took advantage of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition and i married her i wish i never had for her sake not for mine  the toy merchant gazed at him without winking even the halfshut eye was open now  heaven bless her said the carrier for the cheerful constancy with which she has tried to keep the knowledge of this from me and heaven help me that in my slow mind i have not found it out before poor child poor dot i not to find it out who have seen her eyes fill with tears when such a marriage as our own was spoken of i who have seen the secret trembling on her lips a hundred times and never suspected it till last night poor girl that i could ever hope she would be fond of me that i could ever believe she was  she made a show of it said tackleton she made such a show of it that to tell you the truth it was the origin of my misgivings  and here he asserted the superiority of may fielding who certainly made no sort of show of being fond of him  she has tried said the poor carrier with greater emotion than he had exhibited yet i only now begin to know how hard she has tried to be my dutiful and zealous wife how good she has been how much she has done how brave and strong a heart she has let the happiness i have known under this roof bear witness it will be some help and comfort to me when i am here alone  here alone said tackleton oh then you do mean to take some notice of this  i mean returned the carrier to do her the greatest kindness and make her the best reparation in my power i can release her from the daily pain of an unequal marriage and the struggle to conceal it she shall be as free as i can render her  make her reparation exclaimed tackleton twisting and turning his great ears with his hands there must be something wrong here you didnt say that of course  the carrier set his grip upon the collar of the toy merchant and shook him like a reed  listen to me he said and take care that you hear me right listen to me do i speak plainly  very plainly indeed answered tackleton  as if i meant it  very much as if you meant it  i sat upon that hearth last night all night exclaimed the carrier on the spot where she has often sat beside me with her sweet face looking into mine i called up her whole life day by day i had her dear self in its every passage in review before me and upon my soul she is innocent if there is one to judge the innocent and guilty  staunch cricket on the hearth loyal household fairies  passion and distrust have left me said the carrier and nothing but my grief remains in an unhappy moment some old lover better suited to her tastes and years than i forsaken perhaps for me against her will returned in an unhappy moment taken by surprise and wanting time to think of what she did she made herself a party to his treachery by concealing it last night she saw him in the interview we witnessed it was wrong but otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth on earth  if that is your opinion tackleton began  so let her go pursued the carrier go with my blessing for the many happy hours she has given me and my forgiveness for any pang she has caused me let her go and have the peace of mind i wish her shell never hate me shell learn to like me better when im not a drag upon her and she wears the chain i have riveted more lightly this is the day on which i took her with so little thought for her enjoyment from her home today she shall return to it and i will trouble her no more her father and mother will be here todaywe had made a little plan for keeping it togetherand they shall take her home i can trust her there or anywhere she leaves me without blame and she will live so i am sure if i should diei may perhaps while she is still young i have lost some courage in a few hoursshell find that i remembered her and loved her to the last this is the end of what you showed me now its over  oh no john not over do not say its over yet not quite yet i have heard your noble words i could not steal away pretending to be ignorant of what has affected me with such deep gratitude do not say its over till the clock has struck again  she had entered shortly after tackleton and had remained there she never looked at tackleton but fixed her eyes upon her husband but she kept away from him setting as wide a space as possible between them and though she spoke with most impassioned earnestness she went no nearer to him even then how different in this from her old self  no hand can make the clock which will strike again for me the hours that are gone replied the carrier with a faint smile but let it be so if you will my dear it will strike soon its of little matter what we say id try to please you in a harder case than that  well muttered tackleton i must be off for when the clock strikes again itll be necessary for me to be upon my way to church good morning john peerybingle im sorry to be deprived of the pleasure of your company sorry for the loss and the occasion of it too  i have spoken plainly said the carrier accompanying him to the door  oh quite  and youll remember what i have said  why if you compel me to make the observation said tackleton previously taking the precaution of getting into his chaise i must say that it was so very unexpected that im far from being likely to forget it  the better for us both returned the carrier goodbye i give you joy  i wish i could give it to you said tackleton as i cant thankee between ourselves as i told you before eh i dont much think i shall have the less joy in my married life because may hasnt been too officious about me and too demonstrative goodbye take care of yourself  the carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in the distance than his horses flowers and favours near at hand and then with a deep sigh went strolling like a restless broken man among some neighbouring elms unwilling to return until the clock was on the eve of striking  his little wife being left alone sobbed piteously but often dried her eyes and checked herself to say how good he was how excellent he was and once or twice she laughed so heartily triumphantly and incoherently still crying all the time that tilly was quite horrified  ow if you please dont said tilly its enough to dead and bury the baby so it is if you please  will you bring him sometimes to see his father tilly inquired her mistress drying her eyeswhen i cant live here and have gone to my old home  ow if you please dont cried tilly throwing back her head and bursting out into a howlshe looked at the moment uncommonly like boxer ow if you please dont ow what has everybody gone and been and done with everybody making everybody else so wretched owwww  the softhearted slowboy tailed off at this juncture into such a deplorable howl the more tremendous from its long suppression that she must infallibly have awakened the baby and frightened him into something serious probably convulsions if her eyes had not encountered caleb plummer leading in his daughter this spectacle restoring her to a sense of the proprieties she stood for some few moments silent with her mouth wide open and then posting off to the bed on which the baby lay asleep danced in a weird st vitus manner on the floor and at the same time rummaged with her face and head among the bedclothes apparently deriving much relief from those extraordinary operations  mary said bertha not at the marriage  i told her you would not be there mum whispered caleb i heard as much last night but bless you said the little man taking her tenderly by both hands i dont care for what they say i dont believe them there ant much of me but that little should be torn to pieces sooner than id trust a word against you  he put his arms about her neck and hugged her as a child might have hugged one of his own dolls  bertha couldnt stay at home this morning said caleb she was afraid i know to hear the bells ring and couldnt trust herself to be so near them on their weddingday so we started in good time and came here i have been thinking of what i have done said caleb after a moments pause i have been blaming myself till i hardly knew what to do or where to turn for the distress of mind i have caused her and ive come to the conclusion that id better if youll stay with me mum the while tell her the truth youll stay with me the while he inquired trembling from head to foot i dont know what effect it may have upon her i dont know what shell think of me i dont know that shell ever care for her poor father afterwards but its best for her that she should be undeceived and i must bear the consequences as i deserve  mary said bertha where is your hand ah here it is here it is pressing it to her lips with a smile and drawing it through her arm i heard them speaking softly among themselves last night of some blame against you they were wrong  the carriers wife was silent caleb answered for her  they were wrong he said  i knew it cried bertha proudly i told them so i scorned to hear a word blame her with justice she pressed the hand between her own and the soft cheek against her face no i am not so blind as that  her father went on one side of her while dot remained upon the other holding her hand  i know you all said bertha better than you think but none so well as her not even you father there is nothing half so real and so true about me as she is if i could be restored to sight this instant and not a word were spoken i could choose her from a crowd my sister  bertha my dear said caleb i have something on my mind i want to tell you while we three are alone hear me kindly i have a confession to make to you my darling  a confession father  i have wandered from the truth and lost myself my child said caleb with a pitiable expression in his bewildered face i have wandered from the truth intending to be kind to you and have been cruel  she turned her wonderstricken face towards him and repeated cruel  he accuses himself too strongly bertha said dot youll say so presently youll be the first to tell him so  he cruel to me cried bertha with a smile of incredulity  not meaning it my child said caleb but i have been though i never suspected it till yesterday my dear blind daughter hear me and forgive me the world you live in heart of mine doesnt exist as i have represented it the eyes you have trusted in have been false to you  she turned her wonderstricken face towards him still but drew back and clung closer to her friend  your road in life was rough my poor one said caleb and i meant to smooth it for you i have altered objects changed the characters of people invented many things that never have been to make you happier i have had concealments from you put deceptions on you god forgive me and surrounded you with fancies  but living people are not fancies she said hurriedly and turning very pale and still retiring from him you cant change them  i have done so bertha pleaded caleb there is one person that you know my dove  oh father why do you say i know she answered in a term of keen reproach what and whom do i know i who have no leader i so miserably blind  in the anguish of her heart she stretched out her hands as if she were groping her way then spread them in a manner most forlorn and sad upon her face  the marriage that takes place today said caleb is with a stern sordid grinding man a hard master to you and me my dear for many years ugly in his looks and in his nature cold and callous always unlike what i have painted him to you in everything my child in everything  oh why cried the blind girl tortured as it seemed almost beyond endurance why did you ever do this why did you ever fill my heart so full and then come in like death and tear away the objects of my love o heaven how blind i am how helpless and alone  her afflicted father hung his head and offered no reply but in his penitence and sorrow  she had been but a short time in this passion of regret when the cricket on the hearth unheard by all but her began to chirp not merrily but in a low faint sorrowing way it was so mournful that her tears began to flow and when the presence which had been beside the carrier all night appeared behind her pointing to her father they fell down like rain  she heard the cricketvoice more plainly soon and was conscious through her blindness of the presence hovering about her father  mary said the blind girl tell me what my home is what it truly is  it is a poor place bertha very poor and bare indeed the house will scarcely keep out wind and rain another winter it is as roughly shielded from the weather bertha dot continued in a low clear voice as your poor father in his sackcloth coat  the blind girl greatly agitated rose and led the carriers little wife aside  those presents that i took such care of that came almost at my wish and were so dearly welcome to me she said trembling where did they come from did you send them  no  who then  dot saw she knew already and was silent the blind girl spread her hands before her face again but in quite another manner now  dear mary a moment one moment more this way speak softly to me you are true i know youd not deceive me now would you  no bertha indeed  no i am sure you would not you have too much pity for me mary look across the room to where we were just nowto where my father ismy father so compassionate and loving to meand tell me what you see  i see said dot who understood her well an old man sitting in a chair and leaning sorrowfully on the back with his face resting on his hand as if his child should comfort him bertha  yes yes she will go on  he is an old man worn with care and work he is a spare dejected thoughtful greyhaired man i see him now despondent and bowed down and striving against nothing but bertha i have seen him many times before and striving hard in many ways for one great sacred object and i honour his grey head and bless him  the blind girl broke away from her and throwing herself upon her knees before him took the grey head to her breast  it is my sight restored it is my sight she cried i have been blind and now my eyes are open i never knew him to think i might have died and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me  there were no words for calebs emotion  there is not a gallant figure on this earth exclaimed the blind girl holding him in her embrace that i would love so dearly and would cherish so devotedly as this the greyer and more worn the dearer father never let them say i am blind again theres not a furrow in his face theres not a hair upon his head that shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to heaven  caleb managed to articulate my bertha  and in my blindness i believed him said the girl caressing him with tears of exquisite affection to be so different and having him beside me day by day so mindful of me always never dreamed of this  the fresh smart father in the blue coat bertha said poor caleb hes gone  nothing is gone she answered dearest father no everything is herein you the father that i loved so well the father that i never loved enough and never knew the benefactor whom i first began to reverence and love because he had such sympathy for meall are here in you nothing is dead to me the soul of all that was most dear to me is herehere with the worn face and the grey head and i am not blind father any longer  dots whole attention had been concentrated during this discourse upon the father and daughter but looking now towards the little haymaker in the moorish meadow she saw that the clock was within a few minutes of striking and fell immediately into a nervous and excited state  father said bertha hesitating mary  yes my dear returned caleb here she is  there is no change in her you never told me anything of her that was not true  i should have done it my dear im afraid returned caleb if i could have made her better than she was but i must have changed her for the worse if i had changed her at all nothing could improve her bertha  confident as the blind girl had been when she asked the question her delight and pride in the reply and her renewed embrace of dot were charming to behold  more changes than you think for may happen though my dear said dot changes for the better i mean changes for great joy to some of us you mustnt let them startle you too much if any such should ever happen and affect you are those wheels upon the road youve a quick ear bertha are they wheels  yes coming very fast  iii know you have a quick ear said dot placing her hand upon her heart and evidently talking on as fast as she could to hide its palpitating state because i have noticed it often and because you were so quick to find out that strange step last night though why you should have said as i very well recollect you did say bertha whose step is that and why you should have taken any greater observation of it than of any other step i dont know though as i said just now there are great changes in the world great changes and we cant do better than prepare ourselves to be surprised at hardly anything  caleb wondered what this meant perceiving that she spoke to him no less than to his daughter he saw her with astonishment so fluttered and distressed that she could scarcely breathe and holding to a chair to save herself from falling  they are wheels indeed she panted coming nearer nearer very close and now you hear them stopping at the gardengate and now you hear a step outside the doorthe same step bertha is it notand now  she uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight and running up to caleb put her hands upon his eyes as a young man rushed into the room and flinging away his hat into the air came sweeping down upon them  is it over cried dot  yes  happily over  yes  do you recollect the voice dear caleb did you ever hear the like of it before cried dot  if my boy in the golden south americas was alive said caleb trembling  he is alive shrieked dot removing her hands from his eyes and clapping them in ecstasy look at him see where he stands before you healthy and strong your own dear son your own dear living loving brother bertha  all honour to the little creature for her transports all honour to her tears and laughter when the three were locked in one anothers arms all honour to the heartiness with which she met the sunburnt sailorfellow with his dark streaming hair halfway and never turned her rosy little mouth aside but suffered him to kiss it freely and to press her to his bounding heart  and honour to the cuckoo toowhy notfor bursting out of the trapdoor in the moorish palace like a housebreaker and hiccoughing twelve times on the assembled company as if he had got drunk for joy  the carrier entering started back and well he might to find himself in such good company  look john said caleb exultingly look here my own boy from the golden south americas my own son him that you fitted out and sent away yourself him that you were always such a friend to  the carrier advanced to seize him by the hand but recoiling as some feature in his face awakened a remembrance of the deaf man in the cart said  edward was it you  now tell him all cried dot tell him all edward and dont spare me for nothing shall make me spare myself in his eyes ever again  i was the man said edward  and could you steal disguised into the house of your old friend rejoined the carrier there was a frank boy oncehow many years is it caleb since we heard that he was dead and had it proved we thoughtwho never would have done that  there was a generous friend of mine once more a father to me than a friend said edward who never would have judged me or any other man unheard you were he so i am certain you will hear me now  the carrier with a troubled glance at dot who still kept far away from him replied well thats but fair i will  you must know that when i left here a boy said edward i was in love and my love was returned she was a very young girl who perhaps you may tell me didnt know her own mind but i knew mine and i had a passion for her  you had exclaimed the carrier you  indeed i had returned the other and she returned it i have ever since believed she did and now i am sure she did  heaven help me said the carrier this is worse than all  constant to her said edward and returning full of hope after many hardships and perils to redeem my part of our old contract i heard twenty miles away that she was false to me that she had forgotten me and had bestowed herself upon another and a richer man i had no mind to reproach her but i wished to see her and to prove beyond dispute that this was true i hoped she might have been forced into it against her own desire and recollection it would be small comfort but it would be some i thought and on i came that i might have the truth the real truth observing freely for myself and judging for myself without obstruction on the one hand or presenting my own influence if i had any before her on the other i dressed myself unlike myselfyou know how and waited on the roadyou know where you had no suspicion of me neither hadhad she pointing to dot until i whispered in her ear at that fireside and she so nearly betrayed me  but when she knew that edward was alive and had come back sobbed dot now speaking for herself as she had burned to do all through this narrative and when she knew his purpose she advised him by all means to keep his secret close for his old friend john peerybingle was much too open in his nature and too clumsy in all artificebeing a clumsy man in general said dot half laughing and half cryingto keep it for him and when shethats me john sobbed the little womantold him all and how his sweetheart had believed him to be dead and how she had at last been overpersuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly dear old thing called advantageous and when shethats me again johntold him they were not yet married though close upon it and that it would be nothing but a sacrifice if it went on for there was no love on her side and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear itthen shethats me againsaid she would go between them as she had often done before in old times john and would sound his sweetheart and be sure that what sheme again johnsaid and thought was right and it was right john and they were brought together john and they were married john an hour ago and heres the bride and gruff and tackleton may die a bachelor and im a happy little woman may god bless you  she was an irresistible little woman if that be anything to the purpose and never so completely irresistible as in her present transports there never were congratulations so endearing and delicious as those she lavished on herself and on the bride  amid the tumult of emotions in his breast the honest carrier had stood confounded flying now towards her dot stretched out her hand to stop him and retreated as before  no john no hear all dont love me any more john till youve heard every word i have to say it was wrong to have a secret from you john im very sorry i didnt think it any harm till i came and sat down by you on the little stool last night but when i knew by what was written in your face that you had seen me walking in the gallery with edward and when i knew what you thought i felt how giddy and how wrong it was but oh dear john how could you could you think so  little woman how she sobbed again john peerybingle would have caught her in his arms but no she wouldnt let him  dont love me yet please john not for a long time yet when i was sad about this intended marriage dear it was because i remembered may and edward such young lovers and knew that her heart was far away from tackleton you believe that now dont you john  john was going to make another rush at this appeal but she stopped him again  no keep there please john when i laugh at you as i sometimes do john and call you clumsy and a dear old goose and names of that sort its because i love you john so well and take such pleasure in your ways and wouldnt see you altered in the least respect to have you made a king tomorrow  hooroar said caleb with unusual vigour my opinion  and when i speak of people being middleaged and steady john and pretend that we are a humdrum couple going on in a jogtrot sort of way its only because im such a silly little thing john that i like sometimes to act as a kind of play with baby and all that and make believe  she saw that he was coming and stopped him again but she was very nearly too late  no dont love me for another minute or two if you please john what i want most to tell you i have kept to the last my dear good generous john when we were talking the other night about the cricket i had it on my lips to say that at first i did not love you quite so dearly as i do now when i first came home here i was half afraid that i mightnt learn to love you every bit as well as i hoped and prayed i mightbeing so very young john but dear john every day and hour i loved you more and more and if i could have loved you better than i do the noble words i heard you say this morning would have made me but i cant all the affection that i had it was a great deal john i gave you as you well deserve long long ago and i have no more left to give now my dear husband take me to your heart again thats my home john and never never think of sending me to any other  you never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious little woman in the arms of a third party as you would have felt if you had seen dot run into the carriers embrace it was the most complete unmitigated soulfraught little piece of earnestness that ever you beheld in all your days  you may be sure the carrier was in a state of perfect rapture and you may be sure dot was likewise and you may be sure they all were inclusive of miss slowboy who wept copiously for joy and wishing to include her young charge in the general interchange of congratulations handed round the baby to everybody in succession as if it were something to drink  but now the sound of wheels was heard again outside the door and somebody exclaimed that gruff and tackleton was coming back speedily that worthy gentleman appeared looking warm and flustered  why what the devils this john peerybingle said tackleton theres some mistake i appointed mrs tackleton to meet me at the church and ill swear i passed her on the road on her way here oh here she is i beg your pardon sir i havent the pleasure of knowing you but if you can do me the favour to spare this young lady she has rather a particular engagement this morning  but i cant spare her returned edward i couldnt think of it  what do you mean you vagabond said tackleton  i mean that as i can make allowance for your being vexed returned the other with a smile i am as deaf to harsh discourse this morning as i was to all discourse last night  the look that tackleton bestowed upon him and the start he gave  i am sorry sir said edward holding out mays left hand and especially the third finger that the young lady cant accompany you to church but as she has been there once this morning perhaps youll excuse her  tackleton looked hard at the third finger and took a little piece of silver paper apparently containing a ring from his waistcoat pocket  miss slowboy said tackleton will you have the kindness to throw that in the fire thankee  it was a previous engagement quite an old engagement that prevented my wife from keeping her appointment with you i assure you said edward  mr tackleton will do me the justice to acknowledge that i revealed it to him faithfully and that i told him many times i never could forget it said may blushing  oh certainly said tackleton oh to be sure oh its all right its quite correct mrs edward plummer i infer  thats the name returned the bridegroom  ah i shouldnt have known you sir said tackleton scrutinising his face narrowly and making a low bow i give you joy sir  thankee  mrs peerybingle said tackleton turning suddenly to where she stood with her husband im sorry you havent done me a very great kindness but upon my life i am sorry you are better than i thought you john peerybingle i am sorry you understand me thats enough its quite correct ladies and gentlemen all and perfectly satisfactory good morning  with these words he carried it off and carried himself off too merely stopping at the door to take the flowers and favours from his horses head and to kick that animal once in the ribs as a means of informing him that there was a screw loose in his arrangements  of course it became a serious duty now to make such a day of it as should mark these events for a high feast and festival in the peerybingle calendar for evermore accordingly dot went to work to produce such an entertainment as should reflect undying honour on the house and on every one concerned and in a very short space of time she was up to her dimpled elbows in flour and whitening the carriers coat every time he came near her by stopping him to give him a kiss that good fellow washed the greens and peeled the turnips and broke the plates and upset iron pots full of cold water on the fire and made himself useful in all sorts of ways while a couple of professional assistants hastily called in from somewhere in the neighbourhood as on a point of life or death ran against each other in all the doorways and round all the corners and everybody tumbled over tilly slowboy and the baby everywhere tilly never came out in such force before her ubiquity was the theme of general admiration she was a stumblingblock in the passage at fiveandtwenty minutes past two a mantrap in the kitchen at halfpast two precisely and a pitfall in the garret at fiveandtwenty minutes to three the babys head was as it were a test and touchstone for every description of matter animal vegetable and mineral nothing was in use that day that didnt come at some time or other into close acquaintance with it  then there was a great expedition set on foot to go and find out mrs fielding and to be dismally penitent to that excellent gentlewoman and to bring her back by force if needful to be happy and forgiving and when the expedition first discovered her she would listen to no terms at all but said an unspeakable number of times that ever she should have lived to see the day and couldnt be got to say anything else except now carry me to the grave which seemed absurd on account of her not being dead or anything at all like it after a time she lapsed into a state of dreadful calmness and observed that when that unfortunate train of circumstances had occurred in the indigo trade she had foreseen that she would be exposed during her whole life to every species of insult and contumely and that she was glad to find it was the case and begged they wouldnt trouble themselves about herfor what was sheoh dear a nobodybut would forget that such a being lived and would take their course in life without her from this bitterly sarcastic mood she passed into an angry one in which she gave vent to the remarkable expression that the worm would turn if trodden on and after that she yielded to a soft regret and said if they had only given her their confidence what might she not have had it in her power to suggest taking advantage of this crisis in her feelings the expedition embraced her and she very soon had her gloves on and was on her way to john peerybingles in a state of unimpeachable gentility with a paper parcel at her side containing a cap of state almost as tall and quite as stiff as a mitre  then there were dots father and mother to come in another little chaise and they were behind their time and fears were entertained and there was much looking out for them down the road and mrs fielding always would look in the wrong and morally impossible direction and being apprised thereof hoped she might take the liberty of looking where she pleased at last they came a chubby little couple jogging along in a snug and comfortable little way that quite belonged to the dot family and dot and her mother side by side were wonderful to see they were so like each other  then dots mother had to renew her acquaintance with mays mother and mays mother always stood on her gentility and dots mother never stood on anything but her active little feet and old dotso to call dots father i forgot it wasnt his right name but never mindtook liberties and shook hands at first sight and seemed to think a cap but so much starch and muslin and didnt defer himself at all to the indigo trade but said there was no help for it now and in mrs fieldings summing up was a goodnatured kind of manbut coarse my dear  i wouldnt have missed dot doing the honours in her weddinggown my benison on her bright face for any money no nor the good carrier so jovial and so ruddy at the bottom of the table nor the brown fresh sailorfellow and his handsome wife nor any one among them to have missed the dinner would have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal as man need eat and to have missed the overflowing cups in which they drank the wedding day would have been the greatest miss of all  after dinner caleb sang the song about the sparkling bowl as im a living man hoping to keep so for a year or two he sang it through  and bythebye a most unlookedfor incident occurred just as he finished the last verse  there was a tap at the door and a man came staggering in without saying with your leave or by your leave with something heavy on his head setting this down in the middle of the table symmetrically in the centre of the nuts and apples he said  mr tackletons compliments and as he hasnt got no use for the cake himself praps youll eat it  and with those words he walked off  there was some surprise among the company as you may imagine mrs fielding being a lady of infinite discernment suggested that the cake was poisoned and related a narrative of a cake which within her knowledge had turned a seminary for young ladies blue but she was overruled by acclamation and the cake was cut by may with much ceremony and rejoicing  i dont think any one had tasted it when there came another tap at the door and the same man appeared again having under his arm a vast brownpaper parcel  mr tackletons compliments and hes sent a few toys for the babby they aint ugly  after the delivery of which expressions he retired again  the whole party would have experienced great difficulty in finding words for their astonishment even if they had had ample time to seek them but they had none at all for the messenger had scarcely shut the door behind him when there came another tap and tackleton himself walked in  mrs peerybingle said the toy merchant hat in hand im sorry im more sorry than i was this morning i have had time to think of it john peerybingle i am sour by disposition but i cant help being sweetened more or less by coming face to face with such a man as you caleb this unconscious little nurse gave me a broken hint last night of which i have found the thread i blush to think how easily i might have bound you and your daughter to me and what a miserable idiot i was when i took her for one friends one and all my house is very lonely tonight i have not so much as a cricket on my hearth i have scared them all away be gracious to me let me join this happy party  he was at home in five minutes you never saw such a fellow what had he been doing with himself all his life never to have known before his great capacity of being jovial or what had the fairies been doing with him to have effected such a change  john you wont send me home this evening will you whispered dot  he had been very near it though  there wanted but one living creature to make the party complete and in the twinkling of an eye there he was very thirsty with hard running and engaged in hopeless endeavours to squeeze his head into a narrow pitcher he had gone with the cart to its journeys end very much disgusted with the absence of his master and stupendously rebellious to the deputy after lingering about the stable for some little time vainly attempting to incite the old horse to the mutinous act of returning on his own account he had walked into the taproom and laid himself down before the fire but suddenly yielding to the conviction that the deputy was a humbug and must be abandoned he had got up again turned tail and come home  there was a dance in the evening with which general mention of that recreation i should have left it alone if i had not some reason to suppose that it was quite an original dance and one of a most uncommon figure it was formed in an odd way in this way  edward that sailorfellowa good free dashing sort of fellow he washad been telling them various marvels concerning parrots and mines and mexicans and gold dust when all at once he took it in his head to jump up from his seat and propose a dance for berthas harp was there and she such a hand upon it as you seldom hear dot sly little piece of affectation when she chose said her dancing days were over i think because the carrier was smoking his pipe and she liked sitting by him best mrs fielding had no choice of course but to say her dancing days were over after that and everybody said the same except may may was ready  so may and edward get up amid great applause to dance alone and bertha plays her liveliest tune  well if youll believe me they had not been dancing five minutes when suddenly the carrier flings his pipe away takes dot round the waist dashes out into the room and starts off with her toe and heel quite wonderfully tackleton no sooner sees this than he skims across to mrs fielding takes her round the waist and follows suit old dot no sooner sees this than up he is all alive whisks off mrs dot into the middle of the dance and is foremost there caleb no sooner sees this than he clutches tilly slowboy by both hands and goes off at score miss slowboy firm in the belief that diving hotly in among the other couples and effecting any number of concussions with them is your only principle of footing it  hark how the cricket joins the music with its chirp chirp chirp and how the kettle hums                                but what is this even as i listen to them blithely and turn towards dot for one last glimpse of a little figure very pleasant to me she and the rest have vanished into air and i am left alone a cricket sings upon the hearth a broken childs toy lies upon the ground and nothing else remains
