giuseppe giusti  francesco dall ongaro  giovanni prati  aleardo aleardi     introduction   this book has grown out of studies begun twenty years ago in italy and continued fitfully as i found the mood and time for them long after their original circumstance had become a pleasant memory if any one were to say that it did not fully represent the italian poetry of the period which it covers chronologically i should applaud his discernment and perhaps i should not contend that it did much more than indicate the general character of that poetry at the same time i think that it does not ignore any principal name among the italian poets of the great movement which resulted in the national freedom and unity and it does form a sketch however slight and desultory of the history of italian poetry during the hundred years ending in 1870  since that time literature has found in italy the scientific and realistic development which has marked it in all other countries the romantic school came distinctly to a close there with the close of the long period of patriotic aspiration and endeavor but i do not know the more recent work except in some of the novels and i have not attempted to speak of the newer poetry represented by carducci the translations here are my own i have tried to make them faithful i am sure they are careful  possibly i should not offer my book to the public at all if i knew of another work in english studying even with my incoherence the italian poetry of the time mentioned or giving a due impression of its extraordinary solidarity it forms part of the great intellectual movement of which the most unmistakable signs were the french revolution and its numerous brood of revolutions of the first second and third generations throughout europe but this poetry is unique in the history of literature for the unswerving singleness of its tendency  the boundaries of epochs are very obscure and of course the poetry of the century closing in 1870 has much in common with earlier italian poetry parini did not begin it nor alfieri it began them and its spirit must have been felt in the perfumed air of the soft lorrainese despotism at florence when filicaja breathed over his native land the sigh which makes him immortal yet finally every age is individual it has a moment of its own when its character has ceased to be general and has not yet begun to be general and it is one of these moments which is eternized in the poetry before us it was perhaps more than any other poetry in the world an incident and an instrument of the political redemption of the people among whom it arose in free and tranquil countries said the novelist guerrazzi in conversation with m monnier the sprightly swiss critic recently dead who wrote so much and so well about modern italian literature men have the happiness and the right to be artists for arts sake with us this would be weakness and apathy when i write it is because i have something to do my books are not productions but deeds before all here in italy we must be men when we have not the sword we must take the pen we heap together materials for building batteries and fortresses and it is our misfortune if these structures are not works of art to write slowly coldly of our times and of our country with the set purpose of creating a chefdoeuvre would be almost an impiety when i compose a book i think only of freeing my soul of imparting my idea or my belief as vehicle i choose the form of romance since it is popular and best liked at this day my picture is my thoughts my doubts or my dreams i begin a story to draw the crowd when i feel that i have caught its ear i say what i have to say when i think the lesson is growing tiresome i take up the anecdote again and whenever i can leave it i go back to my moralizing detestable aesthetics i grant you my works of siege will be destroyed after the war i dont doubt but what does it matter   ii  the political purpose of literature in italy had become conscious long before guerrazzis time but it was the motive of poetry long before it became conscious when alfieri for example began to write in the last quarter of the eighteenth century there was no reason to suppose that the future of italy was ever to differ very much from its past italian civilization had long worn a fixed character and italian literature had reflected its traits it was soft unambitious elegant and trivial at that time piedmont had a king whom she loved but not that free constitution which she has since shared with the whole peninsula lombardy had lapsed from spanish to austrian despotism the republic of venice still retained a feeble hold upon her wide territories of the mainland and had little trouble in drugging any intellectual aspiration among her subjects with the sensual pleasures of her capital tuscany was quiet under the lorrainese dukes who had succeeded the medici the little states of modena and parma enjoyed each its little court and its little bourbon prince apparently without a dream of liberty the holy father ruled over bologna ferrara ancona and all the great cities and towns of the romagna and naples was equally divided between the bourbons and the bandits there seemed no reason for anything that priests or princes of that day could foresee why this state of things should not continue indefinitely and it would be a long story to say just why it did not continue what every one knows is that the french revolution took place that armies of french democrats overran all these languid lordships and drowsy despotisms and awakened their subjects more or less willingly or unwillingly to a sense of the rights of man as frenchmen understood them and to the approach of the nineteenth century the whole of italy fell directly or indirectly under french sway the piedmontese and neapolitan kings were driven away as were the smaller princes of the other states the republic of venice ceased to be and the pope became very much less a prince if not more a priest than he had been for a great many ages in due time french democracy passed into french imperialism and then french imperialism passed altogether away and so after 1815 came the holy alliance with its consecrated contrivances for fettering mankind lombardy with all venetia was given to austria the dukes of parma of modena and tuscany were brought back and propped up on their thrones again the bourbons returned to naples and the popes temporal glory and power were restored to him this condition of affairs endured with more or less disturbance from the plots of the carbonari and many other ineffectual aspirants and conspirators until 1848 when as we know the austrians were driven out as well as the pope and the various princes small and great except the king of sardinia who not only gave a constitution to his people but singularly kept the oath he swore to support it the pope and the other princes even the austrians had given constitutions and sworn oaths but their memories were bad and their repute for veracity was so poor that they were not believed or trusted the italians had then the idea of freedom and independence but not of unity and their enemies easily broke one at a time the power of states which even if bound together could hardly have resisted their attack in a little while the austrians were once more in milan and venice the dukes and granddukes in their different places the pope in rome the bourbons in naples and all was as if nothing had been or worse than nothing except in sardinia where the constitution was still maintained and the foundations of the present kingdom of italy were laid carlo alberto had abdicated on that battlefield where an austrian victory over the sardinians sealed the fate of the italian states allied with him and his son victor emmanuel succeeded him as to what took place ten years later when the austrians were finally expelled from lombardy and the transitory sovereigns of the duchies and of naples flitted for good and the popes dominion was reduced to the meager size it kept till 1871 and the italian states were united under one constitutional kingi need not speak  in this way the governments of italy had been four times wholly changed and each of these changes was attended by the most marked variations in the intellectual life of the people yet its general tendency always continued the same   iii  the longing for freedom is the instinct of selfpreservation in literature and consciously or unconsciously the italian poets of the last hundred years constantly inspired the italian people with ideas of liberty and independence of course the popular movements affected literature in turn and i should by no means attempt to say which had been the greater agency of progress it is not to be supposed that a man like alfieri with all his tragical eloquence against tyrants arose singly out of a perfectly servile society his time was no doubt ready for him though it did not seem so but on the other hand there is no doubt that he gave not only an utterance but a mighty impulse to contemporary thought and feeling he was in literature what the revolution was in politics and if hardly any principle that either sought immediately to establish now stands it is none the less certain that the time had come to destroy what they overthrew and that what they overthrew was hopelessly vicious  in alfieri the great literary movement came from the north and by far the larger number of the writers of whom i shall have to speak were northern italians alfieri may represent for us the period of time covered by the french democratic conquests the principal poets under the italian governments of napoleon during the first twelve years of this century were vincenzo monti and ugo foscolothe former a ferrarese by birth and the latter a grecovenetian the literary as well as the political center was then milan and it continued to be so for many years after the return of the austrians when the socalled school of resignation nourished there this epoch may be most intelligibly represented by the names of manzoni silvio pellico and tommaso grossiall lombards about 1830 a new literary life began to be felt in florence under the indifferentism or toleration of the granddukes the chiefs of this school were giacomo leopardi giambattista niccolini the author of certain famous tragedies of political complexion guerrazzi the writer of a great number of revolutionary romances and giuseppe giusti a poet of very marked and peculiar powers and perhaps the greatest political satirist of the century the chief poets of a later time were aleardo aleardi a veronese giovanni prati who was born in the trentino near the tyrol and francesco dall ongaro a native of trieste i shall mention all these and others particularly hereafter and i have now only named them to show how almost entirely the literary life of militant italy sprang from the north there were one or two neapolitan poets of less note among whom was gabriele rossetti the father of the english rossettis now so well known in art and literature   iv  in dealing with this poetry i naturally seek to give its universal and aesthetic flavor wherever it is separable from its political quality for i should not hope to interest any one else in what i had myself often found very tiresome i suspect indeed that political satire and invective are not relished best in free countries no danger attends their exercise there is none of the charm of secrecy or the pleasure of transgression in their production there is no special poignancy to free administrations in any one of ten thousand assaults upon them the poets leave this sort of thing mostly to the newspapers besides we have not so to speak the grounds that such a longstruggling people as the italians had for the enjoyment of patriotic poetry as an average american i have found myself very greatly embarrassed when required by count alfieri for example to hate tyrants of course i do hate them in a general sort of way but having never seen one how is it possible for me to feel any personal fury toward them when the later italian poets ask me to loathe spies and priests i am equally at a loss i can hardly form the idea of a spy of an agent of the police paid to haunt the steps of honest men to overhear their speech and if possible entrap them into a political offense as to priestswell yes i suppose they are bad though i do not know this from experience and i find them generally upon acquaintance very amiable but all this was different with the italians they had known seen and felt tyrants both foreign and domestic of every kind spies and informers had helped to make their restricted lives anxious and insecure and priests had leagued themselves with the police and the oppressors until the church which should have been kept a sacred refuge from all the sorrows and wrongs of the world became the most dreadful of its prisons it is no wonder that the literature of these people should have been so filled with the patriotic passion of their life and i am not sure that literature is not as nobly employed in exciting men to heroism and martyrdom for a great cause as in the purveyance of mere intellectual delights what it was in italy when it made this its chief business we may best learn from an inquiry that i have at last found somewhat amusing it will lead us over vast meadows of green baize enameled with artificial flowers among streams that do nothing but purl in this region the shadows are mostly brown and the mountains are invariably horrid there are tumbling floods and sighing groves there are naturally nymphs and swains and the chief business of life is to be in love and not to be in love to burn and to freeze without regard to the mercury need i say that this region is arcady     arcadian shepherds   one day near the close of the seventeenth century a number of ladies and gentlemenmostly poets and poetesses according to their thinking were assembled on a pleasant hill in the neighborhood of rome as they lounged upon the grass in attitudes as graceful and picturesque as they could contrive and listened to a sonnet or an ode with the sweet patience of their racefor they were all italiansit occurred to the most conscious man among them that here was something uncommonly like the golden age unless that epoch had been flattered there had been reading and praising of odes and sonnets the whole blessed afternoon and now he cried out to the complaisant canorous company behold arcadia revived in us  this struck everybody at once by its truth it struck most of all a certain giovan maria crescimbeni honored in his day and despised in ours as a poet and critic he was of a cold dull temperament a mind half lead half wood as one italian writer calls him but he was an inveterate maker of verses and he was wise in his own generation he straightway proposed to the tuneful abbés cavalieri serventi and précieuses who went singing and lovemaking up and down italy in those times the foundation of a new academy to be called the academy of the arcadians  literary academies were then the fashion in italy and every part of the peninsula abounded in them they bore names fanciful or grotesque such as the ardent the illuminated the unconquered the intrepid or the dissonant the sterile the insipid the obtuse the astray the stunned and they were all devoted to one purpose namely the production and the perpetuation of twaddle it is prodigious to think of the incessant wash of slipslop which they poured out in verse of the grave disputations they held upon the most trivial questions of the inane formalities of their sessions at the meetings of a famous academy in milan they placed in the chair a child just able to talk a question was proposed and the answer of the child whatever it was was held by one side to solve the problem and the debates pro and con followed upon this point other academies in other cities had other follies but whatever the absurdity it was encouraged alike by church and state and honored by all the great world the governments of italy in that day whether lay or clerical liked nothing so well as to have the intellectual life of the nation squandered in the trivialities of the academiesin their debates about nothing their odes and madrigals and masks and sonnets and the greatest politeness you could show a stranger was to invite him to a sitting of your academy to be furnished with a letter to the academy in the next city was the highest favor you could ask for yourself  in literature the humorous bernesque school had passed tasso had long been dead and the neapolitan marini called the corrupter of italian poetry ruled from his grave the taste of the time this taste was so bad as to require a very desperate remedy and it was professedly to counteract it that the academy of the arcadians had arisen  the epoch was favorable and as emilianigiudici whom we shall follow for the present teaches in his history of italian literature the idea of crescimbeni spread electrically throughout italy the gayest of the finest ladies and gentlemen the world ever saw the illustrissimi of that polite age united with monks priests cardinals and scientific thinkers in establishing the arcadia and even popes and kings were proud to enlist in the crusade for the true poetic faith in all the chief cities arcadian colonies were formed dependent upon the roman arcadia as upon the supreme archflock and in three years the academy numbered thirteen hundred members every one of whom had first been obliged to give proof that he was a good poet they prettily called themselves by the names of shepherds and shepherdesses out of theocritus and being a republic they refused to own any earthly prince or ruler but declared the baby jesus to be the protector of arcadia their code of laws was written in elegant latin by a grave and learned man and inscribed upon tablets of marble  according to one of the articles the academicians must study to reproduce the customs of the ancient arcadians and the character of their poetry and straightway italy was filled on every hand with thyrsides menalcases and meliboeuses who made their harmonious songs resound the names of their chlorises their phyllises their niceas and there was poured out a deluge of pastoral compositions some of them by earnest thinkers and philosophical writers who were not ashamed to assist in sustaining that miserable literary vanity which in the history of human thought will remain a lamentable witness to the moral depression of the italian nation as a pattern of perfect poetizing these artless nymphs and swains chose constanzo a very fair poet of the sixteenth century they collected his verse and printed it at the expense of the academy and it was established without dissent that each arcadian in turn at the hut of some conspicuous shepherd in the presence of the keeper such was the jargon of those most amusing unrealities should deliver a commentary upon some sonnet of constanzo as for crescimbeni who declared that arcadia was instituted strictly for the purpose of exterminating bad taste and of guarding against its revival pursuing it continually wherever it should pause or lurk even to the most remote and unconsidered villages and hamletscrescimbeni could not do less than write four dialogues as he did in which he evolved from four of constanzos sonnets all that was necessary for tuscan lyric poetry  thus says emilianigiudici referring to the crusading intent of crescimbeni the arcadians were a sect of poetical sanfedista who taking for example the zeal and performance of san domingo de gruzman proposed to renew in literature the scenes of the holy office among the albigenses happily the fire of arcadian verse did not really burn the institution was at first derided then it triumphed and prevailed in such fame and greatness that shining forth like a new sun it consumed the splendor of the lesser lights of heaven eclipsing the glitter of all those academiesthe thunderstruck the extravagant the humid the tipsy the imbeciles and the likewhich had hitherto formed the glory of the peninsula   i  giuseppe torelli a charming modern italian writer in a volume called paessaggi e profili landscapes and profiles makes a study of carlo innocenzo frugoni one of the most famous of the famous arcadian shepherds and from this we may learn something of the age and society in which such a folly could not only be possible but illustrious the patriotic italian critics and historians are apt to give at least a full share of blame to foreign rulers for the corruption of their nation and signor torelli finds the spanish domination over a vast part of italy responsible for the degradation of italian mind and manners in the seventeenth century he declares that because of the spaniards the italian theater was then silent or filled with the noise of insipid allegories there was little or no education among the common people the slender literature that survived existed solely for the amusement and distinction of the great the army and the church were the only avenues of escape from obscurity and poverty all classes were sunk in indolence  the social customs were mostly copied from france except that purely italian invention the cavaliere servente who was in great vogue but there were everywhere in the cities coteries of fine ladies called preziose who were formed upon the french précieuses ridiculed by molière and were i suppose something like what is called in boston demisemiliterary ladiesladies who cultivated alike the muses and the modes the preziose held weekly receptions at their houses and assembled poets and cavaliers from all quarters who entertained the ladies with their lampoons and gallantries their madrigals and gossip their sonnets and their repartees little by little the poets had the better of the cavaliers a felicitous rhyme was valued more than an elaborately constructed compliment and this easy form of literature became the highest fashion people hastened to call themselves by the sentimental pastoral names of the arcadians and almost forgot their loveintrigues so much were they absorbed in the production and applause of toasts epitaphs for dogs verses on wagers epigrams on fruits on echo on the marchionesss canaries on the saints these were read here and repeated there declaimed in the public resorts and on the promenades and gravely studied and commented on a strange and surprising jargon arose the utterance of the feeblest and emptiest affectation in those days eyes were not eyes but pupils not pupils but orbs not orbs but the devil knows what says signor torelli losing patience it was the golden age of pretty words and as to the sense of a composition good society troubled itself very little about that good society expressed itself in a sort of poetical gibberish and whoever had said for example muses instead of castalian divinities would have passed for a lowbred person dropped from some mountain village men of fine mind rich gentlemen of leisure brilliant and accomplished ladies had resolved that the time was come to lose their wits academically   ii  in such a world arcadia nourished into such a world that illustrious shepherd carlo innocenze frugoni was born he was the younger son of a noble family of genoa and in youth was sent into a cloister as a genteel means of existence rather than from regard to his own wishes or fitness he was in fact of a very gay and mundane temper and escaped from his monastery as soon as ever he could and spent his long life thereafter at the comfortable court of parma where he sang with great constancy the fortunes of varying dynasties and celebrated in his verse all the polite events of society of course even a life so pleasant as this had its little pains and mortifications and it is history that when in 1731 the last duke of the farnese family died leaving a widow frugoni predicted and maintained in twentyfive sonnets that she would yet give an heir to the duke but in spite of the twentyfive sonnets the affair turned out otherwise and the extinction of the house of farnese was written  frugoni however was taken into favor by the spanish bourbon who succeeded and after he had got himself unfrocked with infinite difficulty and only upon the intercession of divers princes and prelates he was as happy as any man of real talent could be who devoted his gifts to the merest intellectual trifling not long before his death he was addressed by one that wished to write his life he made answer that he had been a versifier and nothing more epigrammatically recounted the chief facts of his career and ended by saying of what i have written it is not worth while to speak and posterity has upon the whole agreed with him though of course no edition of the italian classics would be perfect without him we know this from the classics of our own tongue which abound in marvels of insipidity and emptiness  but all this does not make him less interesting as a figure in that amusing literarified society and we may be glad to see him in parma with signor torellis eyes as he issues smug ornate with his wellfitting polished shoe his handsome leg in its neat stocking his whole immaculate person and his demure visage and gently sauntering from casa caprara takes his way toward casa landi  i do not know casa landi i have never seen it and yet i think i can tell you of it a gloomyfronted pile of romanesque architecture the lower story remarkable for its weatherstained vermiculated stone and the ornamental iron gratings at the windows the portecochère stands wide open and shows the leaf and blossom of a lovely garden inside with a tinkling fountain in the midst the marble nymphs and naiads inhabiting the shrubbery and the water are already somewhat timeworn and have here and there a touch of envious mildew but as yet their noses are unbroken and they have all the legs and arms that the sculptor designed them with and the fountain which after disasters must choke plays prettily enough over their nude loveliness for it is now the first half of the eighteenth century and casa landi is the uninvaded sanctuary of illustrissimi and illustrissime the resplendent porter who admits our melodious abbate carlo and the gay lackey who runs before his smiling face to open the door of the sala where the company is assembled may have had nothing to speak of for breakfast but they are full of zeal for the grandeur they serve and would not know what the rights of man were if you told them they too have their idleness and their intrigues and their life of pleasure but poor souls they fade pitiably in the magnificence of that noble assembly in the sala what coats of silk and waistcoats of satin what trig rapiers and flowing wigs and laces and ruffles and ah me what hoops and brocades what paint and patches behind the chair of every lady stands her cavaliere servente or bows before her with a cup of chocolate or sweet abasement stoops to adjust the footstool better to her satin shoe there is a buzz of satirical expectation no doubt till the abbate arrives and then after the first compliments and obeisances says signor torelli he throws his hat upon the great armchair recounts the chronicle of the gay world and prepares for the special entertainment of the occasion  what is there new on parnassus he is probably asked  nothing he replies save the bleating of a lambkin lost upon the lonely heights of the sacred hill  ill wager cries one of the ladies that the shepherd who has lost this lambkin is our abbate carlo  and what can escape the penetrating eye of aglauro cidonia retorts frugoni softly with a modest air  let us hear its bleating cries the lady of the house  let us hear it echo her husband and her cavaliere servente  let us hear it cry one two three a halfdozen visitors  frugoni reads his new production ten exclamations receive the first strophe the second awakens twenty evvivas and when the reading is ended the noise of the plaudits is so great that they cannot be counted his new production has cost frugoni half an hours work it is possibly the answer to some mecaenas who has invited him to his countryseat or the funeral eulogy of some wellknown cat is fame bought at so cheap a rate he is a fool who would buy it dearer and with this reasoning which certainly is not without foundation frugoni remained frugoni when he might have been something very much better if a bird sang or a cat sneezed or a dinner was given or the talk turned upon anything no matter how remote from poetry it was still for frugoni an invitation to some impromptu effusion if he pricked his finger in mending a pen he called from on high the god of lemnos and all the ironworkers of olympus not excepting mars whom it was not reasonable to disturb for so little and launched innumerable reproaches at them since without their invention of arms a penknife would never have been made if the heavens cleared up after a long rain all the signs of the zodiac were laid under contribution and charged to give an account of their performance if somebody died he instantly poured forth rivers of tears in company with the nymphs of eridanus and the heliades he upraided phaethon themis the shades of erebus and the parcae the amaryllises the dryads the fauns the woolly lambs the shepherds the groves the demigods the castalian virgins the loosehaired nymphs the leafy boughs the goatfooted gods the graces the pastoral pipes and all the other sylvan rubbish were the prime materials of every poetic composition   iii  signor torelli is less severe than emilianigiudici upon the founders of the arcadia and thinks they may have had intentions quite different from the academical follies that resulted while leigh hunt who has some account of the arcadia in his charming essay on the sonnet feels none of the national shame of the italian critics and is able to write of it with perfect gayety he finds a reason for its amazing success in the childlike traits of italian character and reminding his readers that the arcadia was established in 1690 declares that what the englishmen of william and marys reign would have received with shouts of laughter and the french under louis xiv would have corrupted and made perilous to decency was so mixed up with better things in these imaginative and strange as it may seem most unaffected people the italiansfor such they arethat far from disgusting a nation accustomed to romantic impulses and to the singing of poetry in their streets and gondolas their gravest and most distinguished men and in many instances women too ran childlike into the delusion the best of their poets the sweettongued filicaja among others accepted farms in arcadia forthwith  and so little transitory did the fashion turn out to be that not only was crescimbeni its active officer for eightandthirty years but the society to whatever state of insignificance it may have been reduced exists at the present moment  leigh hunt names among englishmen who were made shepherds of arcadia mathias author of the pursuits of literature and joseph cowper who wrote the memoirs of tassoni and an historical memoir of italian tragedy haly and mrs thrale as well as those poor delia cruscans whom bloodyminded gifford champed between his tusked jaws in his now forgotten satires pope pius vii gave the arcadians a suite of apartments in the vatican but i dare say the wicked tyranny now existing at rome has deprived the harmless swains of this shelter if indeed they had not been turned out before victor emmanuel came  in the chapter on the arcadia with which vernon lee opens her admirable studies of the eighteenth century in italy she tells us of several visits which she recently paid to the bosco parrasio long the chief fold of the academy she found it with difficulty on the road to the villa pamphili in a neighborhood wholly ignorant of arcadia and of the relation of bosco parrasio to it the house once the summer resort of arcadian sonneteers was now abandoned to a family of marketgardeners who hung their hats and jackets on the marble heads of improvvisatori and crowned poetesses and threw their beans maize and gardentools into the corners of the desolate receptionrooms from whose mildewed walls looked down a host of celebritiesbrocaded doges powdered princesses and scarletrobed cardinals simpering drearily in their desolation and sad haggard poetesses in seagreen and skyblue draperies with lank powdered locks and meager arms holding lyres fat illshaven priests in white bands and mopwigs sonneteering ladies sweet and vapid in dovecolored stomachers and embroidered sleeves jolly extemporary poets flaunting in manycolored waistcoats and gorgeous shawls  but whatever the material adversity of arcadia it still continues to reward ascertained merit by grants of pasturage out of its ideal domains indeed it is but a few years since our own longfellow on a visit to rome was waited upon by the secretary of the archflock and presented after due ceremonies and the reading of a floral and herbaceous sonnet with a parchment bestowing upon him some very magnificent possessions in that extraordinary dreamland in telling me of this he tried to recall his arcadian name but could only remember that it was olympico something     giuseppe parini   i  in 1748 began for italy a peace of nearly fifty years when the wars of the succession with which the contesting strangers had ravaged her soil absolutely ceased in lombardy the austrian rulers who had succeeded the spaniards did and suffered to be done many things for the material improvement of a province which they were content to hold while leaving the administration mainly to the lombards the spanish bourbon at naples also did as little harm and as much good to his realm as a bourbon could pier leopoldo of tuscany don filippo i of parma francis iii of modena and the popes benedict xiv clement xiv and pius vi were all disposed to be paternally beneficent to their peoples who at least had repose under them and in this period gave such names to science as those of galvani and volta to humanity that of beccaria to letters those of alfieri filicaja goldoni parini and many others  but in spite of the literary and scientific activity of the period italian society was never quite so fantastically immoral as in this long peace which was broken only by the invasions of the french republic a widespread sentimentality curiously mixed of love and letters enveloped the peninsula commerce politics all the business of life went on as usual under the roseate veil which gives its hue to the social history of the time but the idea which remains in the mind is one of a tranquillity in which every person of breeding devoted himself to the cult of some muse or other and established himself as the conventional admirer of his neighbors wife the great academy of arcadia founded to restore good taste in poetry prescribed conditions by which everybody of whatever age or sex could become a poetaster and good society expected every gentleman and lady to be in love the arcadia still exists but that gallant society hardly survived the eighteenth century perhaps the greatest wonder about it is that it could have lasted so long as it did its end was certainly not delayed for want of satirists who perceived its folly and pursued it with scorn but this again only brings one doubt often felt whether satire ever accomplished anything beyond a lively portraiture of conditions it proposed to reform  it is the opinion of some italian critics that italian demoralization began with the reaction against luther when the jesuits rose to supreme power in the church and gathered the whole education of the young into the hands of the priests cesare cantù whose book on parini ed il suo secolo may be read with pleasure and instruction by such as like to know more fully the time of which i speak was of this mind he became before his death a leader of the clerical party in italy and may be supposed to be without unfriendly prejudice he alleges that the priestly education made the italians literati rather than citizens latinists poets instead of good magistrates workers fathers of families it cultivated the memory at the expense of the judgment the fancy at the cost of the reason and made them selfish polished false it left a boy apathetic irresolute thoughtless pusillanimous he flattered his superiors and hated his fellows in each of whom he dreaded a spy he knew the beautiful and loved the grandiose his pride of family and ancestry was inordinately pampered what other training he had was in the graces and accomplishments he was thoroughly instructed in so much of warlike exercise as enabled him to handle a rapier perfectly and to conduct or fight a duel with punctilio  but he was no warrior his career was peace the old medieval italians who had combated like lions against the french and germans and against each other when resting from the labors and the high conceptions which have left us the chief sculptures and architecture of the peninsula were dead and their posterity had almost ceased to know war italy had indeed still remained a battleground but not for italian quarrels nor for italian swords the powers which like venice could afford to have quarrels of their own mostly hired other people to fight them out all the independent states of the peninsula had armies but armies that did nothing in lombardy neither frenchman spaniard nor austrian had been able to recruit or draft soldiers the flight of young men from the conscription depopulated the province until at last francis ii declared it exempt from military service piedmont the macedon the boeotia of that greece alone remained warlike and piedmont was alone able when the hour came to show italy how to do for herself  yet except in the maritime republics the army idle and unwarlike as it was in most cases continued to be one of the three careers open to the younger sons of good family the civil service and the church were the other two in genoa nobles had engaged in commerce with equal honor and profit nearly every argosy that sailed to or from the port of venice belonged to some lordly speculator but in milan a noble who descended to trade lost his nobility by a law not abrogated till the time of charles iv the nobles had therefore nothing to do they could not go into business if they entered the army it was not to fight the civil service was of course actually performed by subordinates there were not cures for half the priests and there grew up that odd polite rabble of abbati like our good frugoni priests without cures sometimes attached to noble families as chaplains sometimes devoting themselves to literature or science sometimes leading lives of mere leisure and fashion they were mostly of plebeian origin when they did anything at all besides pay court to the ladies  in milan the nobles were exempt from many taxes paid by the plebeians they had separate courts of law with judges of their own order before whom a plebeian plaintiff appeared with what hope of justice can be imagined yet they were not oppressive they were at worst only insolent to their inferiors and they commonly used them with the gentleness which an italian can hardly fail in there were many ties of kindness between the classes the memory of favors and services between master and servant landlord and tenant in relations which then lasted a lifetime and even for generations in venice where it was one of the high privileges of the patrician to spit from his box at the theater upon the heads of the people in the pit the familiar bond of patron and client so endeared the old republican nobles to the populace that the venetian poor of this day who know them only by tradition still lament them but on the whole men have found it at venice as elsewhere better not to be spit upon even by an affectionate nobility  the patricians were luxurious everywhere in rome they built splendid palaces in milan they gave gorgeous dinners goldoni in his charming memoirs tells us that the milanese of his time never met anywhere without talking of eating and they did eat upon all possible occasions public domestic and religious throughout italy they have yet the nickname of lupi lombardi lombard wolves which their good appetites won them the nobles of that gay old milan were very hospitable easy of access to persons of the proper number of descents and full of invitations for the stranger a french writer found their cooking delicate and estimable as that of his own nation but he adds that many of these friendly welldining aristocrats had not good ton one can think of them at our distance of time and place with a kindness which italian critics especially those of the bitter period of struggle about the middle of this century do not affect emilianigiudici for example does not when he calls them and their order throughout italy an aristocratic leprosy he assures us that at the time of that long peace the moral degradation of what the french call the great world was the inveterate habit of centuries the nobles wallowed in their filth untouched by remorse and he speaks of them as gilded swine vain of the glories of their blazons which they dragged through the mire of their vices   ii  this is when he is about to consider a poem in which the lombard nobility are satirizedif it was satire to paint them to the life he says that he would be at a loss what passages to quote from it but fortunately an unanimous posterity has done parini due honor and he supposes now there is no man of whatever sect or opinion but has read his immortal poem and has its finest scenes by heart it is this fact which embarrasses me however for how am i to rehabilitate a certain obsolete characteristic figure without quoting from parini and constantly wearying people with what they know already so well the gentle reader familiar with parinis immortal poem  the gentle readerhis immortal poem what is his immortal poem i never heard even the name of it  is it possible but you fair reader who have its finest scenes by heart  the fair readeryes certainly of course but one reads so many things i dont believe i half remember those striking passages ofwhat is the poem and who did you say the author was  oh madam and is this undying fame is this the immortality for which we waste our time is this the remembrance for which the essayist sicklies his visage over with the pale cast of thought why at this rate even those whose books are favorably noticed by the newspapers will be forgotten in a thousand years but it is at least consoling to know that you have merely forgotten parinis poems the subject of which you will at once recollect when i remind you that it is called the day and celebrates the morning the noon the evening and the night of a gentleman of fashion as milan knew him for fifty years in the last century  this gentleman whatever his nominal business in the world might be was first and above all a cavaliere servente and the cavaliere servente was the invention it is said of genoese husbands who had not the leisure to attend their wives to the theater the promenade the cardtable the conversazione and so installed their nearest idle friends permanently in the office the arrangement was found so convenient that the cavaliere servente presently spread throughout italy no lady of fashion was thought properly appointed without one and the office was now no longer reserved to bachelors it was not at all good form for husband and wife to love each other and the husband became the cavalier of some other lady and the whole fine world was thus united by a usage of which it is very hard to know just how far it was wicked and how far it was only foolish perhaps it is safest to say that at the best it was apt to be somewhat of the one and always a great deal of the other in the good society of that day marriage meant a settlement in life for the girl who had escaped her sisters fate of a sometimes forced religious vocation but it did not matter so much about the husband if the marriage contract stipulated that she should have her cavaliere servente and as sometimes happened specified him by name with her husband there was a union of fortunes with the expectation of heirs the companionship the confidence the faith was with the cavalier there could be no domesticity no family life with either the cavaliere servente went with his lady to church where he dipped his finger in the holywater and offered it her to moisten her own finger at and he held her prayerbook for her when she rose from her knees and bowed to the high altar in fact his place seems to have been as fully acknowledged and honored if not by the church then by all the other competent authorities as that of the husband like other things his relation to his lady was subject to complication and abuse no doubt ladies of fickle minds changed their cavaliers rather often and in those days following the disorder of the french invasions the relation suffered deplorable exaggerations and perversions but when giuseppe parini so minutely and graphically depicted the day of a noble lombard youth the cavaliere servente was in his most prosperous and illustrious state and some who have studied italian social conditions in the past bid us not too virtuously condemn him since preposterous as he was his existence was an amelioration of disorders at which we shall find it better not even to look askance  parinis poem is written in the form of instructions to the hero for the politest disposal of his time and in a strain of polished irony allots the follies of his day to their proper hours the poets apparent seriousness never fails him but he does not suffer his irony to become a burden to the reader relieving it constantly with pictures episodes and excursions and now and then breaking into a strain of solemn poetry which is fine enough the work will suggest to the english reader the light mockery of the rape of the lock and in less degree some qualities of grays trivia but in form and manner it is more like phillipss splendid shilling than either of these and yet it is not at all like the last in being a mere burlesque of the epic style these resemblances have been noted by italian critics who find them as unsatisfactory as myself but they will serve to make the extracts i am to give a little more intelligible to the reader who does not recur to the whole poem parini was not one to break a butterfly upon a wheel he felt the fatuity of heavily moralizing upon his material the only way was to treat it with affected gravity and to use his hero with the respect which best mocks absurdity one of his arts is to contrast the deeds of his hero with those of his forefathers of which he is so proudof course the contrast is to the disadvantage of the forefathersand in these allusions to the past glories of italy it seems to me that the modern patriotic poetry which has done so much to make italy begins for the first time to feel its wings  parini was in all things a very stanch brave and original spirit and if he was of any school it was that of the venetian gasparo gozzi who wrote pungent and amusing social satires in blank verse and published at venice an essaypaper like the spectator the name of which he turned into losservatore it dealt like the spectator and all that race of journals with questions of letters and manners and was long honored like the spectator as a model of prose with an apparent prevalence of french taste there was in fact much study by italian authors of english literature at this time which was encouraged by dr johnsons friend baretti the author of the famous frusta letteraria literary scourge which drew blood from so many authorlings now bloodless it was wielded with more severity than wisdom and fell pretty indiscriminately upon the bad and the good it scourged among others goldoni the greatest master of the comic art then living but it spared our parini the first part of whose poem baretti salutes with many kindly phrases though he cannot help advising him to turn the poem into rhyme but when did a critic ever know less than a poet about a poets business   iii  the first part of parinis day is morning that mature hour at which the hero awakes from the glories and fatigues of the past night his valet appears and throwing open the shutters asks whether he will have coffee or chocolate in bed and when he has broken his fast and risen the business of the day begins the earliest comer is perhaps the dancingmaster whose elegant presence we must not deny ourselves                    he entering stops     erect upon the threshold elevating     both shoulders then contracting like a tortoise     his neck a little at the same time drops     slightly his chin and with the extremest tip     of his plumed hat lightly touches his lips  in their order come the singingmaster and the master of the violin and with more impressiveness than the rest the teacher of french whose advent hushes all italian sounds and who is to instruct the hero to forget his plebeian native tongue he is to send meanwhile to ask how the lady he serves has passed the night and attending her response he may read voltaire in a sumptuous dutch or french binding or he may amuse himself with a french romance or it may happen that the artist whom he has engaged to paint the miniature of his lady to be placed in the same jeweled case with his own shall bring his work at this hour for criticism then the valets robe him from head to foot in readiness for the hairdresser and the barber whose work is completed with the powdering of his hair      at last the labor of the learned comb     is finished and the elegant artist strews     with lightly shaken hand a powdery mist     to whiten ere their time thy youthful locks                                                                   now take heart     and in the bosom of that whirling cloud     plunge fearlessly o brave o mighty thus     appeared thine ancestor through smoke and fire     of battle when his countrys trembling gods     his sword avenged and shattered the fierce foe     and put to flight but he his visage stained     with dust and smoke and smirched with gore and sweat     his hair torn and tossed wild came from the strife     a terrible vision even to compatriots     his hand had rescued milder thou by far     and fairer to behold in white array     shalt issue presently to bless the eyes     of thy fond country which the mighty arm     of thy forefather and thy heavenly smile     equally keep content and prosperous  when the hero is finally dressed for the visit to his lady it is in this splendid figure      let purple gaiters clasp thine ankles fine     in noble leather that no dust or mire     blemish thy foot down from thy shoulders flow     loosely a tunic fair thy shapely arms     cased in its closelyfitting sleeves whose borders     of crimson or of azure velvet let     the heliotropes color tinge thy slender throat     encircle with a soft and gauzy band                      thy watch already     bids thee make haste to go o me how fair     the arsenal of tiny charms that hang     with a harmonious tinkling from its chain     what hangs not there of fairy carriages     and fairy steeds so marvelously feigned     in gold that every charger seems alive  this magnificent swell of the times when swells had the world quite their own way finds his lady already surrounded with visitors when he calls to revere her as he would have said and he can therefore make the more effective arrival entering her presence he puts on his very finest manner which i am sure we might all study to our advantage      let thy right hand be pressed against thy side     beneath thy waistcoat and the other hand     upon thy snowy linen rest and hide     next to thy heart let the breast rise sublime     the shoulders broaden both and bend toward her     thy pliant neck then at the corners close     thy lips a little pointed in the middle     somewhat and from thy month thus set exhale     a murmur inaudible meanwhile her right     let her have given and now softly drop     on the warm ivory a double kiss     seat thyself then and with one hand draw closer     thy chair to hers while every tongue is stilled     thou only bending slightly over with her     exchange in whisper secret nothings which     ye both accompany with mutual smiles     and covert glances that betray or seem     at least your tender passion to betray  it must have been mighty pretty as master pepys says to look at the life from which this scene was painted for many a dandy of either sex doubtless sat for it the scene was sometimes heightened by the different humor in which the lady and the cavalier received each other as for instance when they met with reproaches and offered the spectacle of a lovers quarrel to the company in either case it is for the hero to lead the lady out to dinner                                     with a bound     rise to thy feet signor and give thy hand     unto thy lady whom tenderly drooping     support thou with thy strength and to the table     accompany while the guests come after you     and last of all the husband follows  or rather                        if to the husband still     the vestige of a generous soul remain     let him frequent another board beside     another lady sit whose husband dines     yet somewhere else beside another lady     whose spouse is likewise absent and so add     new links unto the chain immense wherewith     love alternating binds the whole wide world      behold thy lady seated at the board     relinquish now her hand and while the servant     places the chair that not too far she sit     and not so near that her soft bosom press     too close against the table with a spring     stoop thou and gather round thy ladys feet     the wandering volume of her robe beside her     then sit thee down for the true cavalier     is not permitted to forsake the side     of her he serves except there should arise     some strange occasion warranting the use     of so great freedom  when one reads of these springs and little hops which were once so elegant it is almost with a sigh for a world which no longer springs or hops in the service of beauty or even dreams of doing it but a passage which will touch the sympathetic with a still keener sense of loss is one which hints how lovely a lady looked when carving as she then sometimes did                          swiftly now the blade     that sharp and polished at thy right hand lies     draw naked forth and like the blade of mars     flash it upon the eyes of all the point     press twixt thy fingertips and bowing low     offer the handle to her now is seen     the soft and delicate playing of the muscles     in the white hand upon its work intent     the graces that around the lady stoop     clothe themselves in new forms and from her fingers     sportively flying flutter to the tips     of her unconscious rosy knuckles thence     to dip into the hollows of the dimples     that love beside her knuckles has impressed  throughout the dinner it is the part of the wellbred husbandif so illbred as to remain at all to sit impassive and quiescent while the cavalier watches over the wife with tender care prepares her food offers what agrees with her and forbids what harms he is virtually master of the house he can order the servants about if the dinner is not to his mind it is even his high prerogative to scold the cook  the poet reports something of the talk at table and here occurs one of the most admired passages of the poem the light irony of which it is hard to reproduce in a version one of the guests in a strain of affected sensibility has been denouncing mans cruelty to animals      thus he discourses and a gentle tear     springs while he speaks into thy ladys eyes                            she recalls the day     alas the cruel daywhat time her lapdog     her beauteous lapdog darling of the graces     sporting in youthful gayety impressed     the light mark of her ivory tooth upon     the rude foot of a menial he with bold     and sacrilegious toe flung her away     over and over thrice she rolled and thrice     rumpled her silken coat and thrice inhaled     with tender nostril the thick choking dust     then raised imploring cries and help help help     she seemed to call while from the gilded vaults     compassionate echo answered her again     and from their cloistral basements in dismay     the servants rushed and from the upper rooms     the pallid maidens trembling flew all came     thy ladys face was with reviving essence     sprinkled and she awakened from her swoon     anger and grief convulsed her still she cast     a lightning glance upon the guilty menial     and thrice with languid voice she called her pet     who rushed to her embrace and seemed to invoke     vengeance with her shrill tenor and revenge     thou hadst fair poodle darling of the graces     the guilty menial trembled and with eyes     downcast received his doom naught him availed     his twenty years desert naught him availed     his zeal in secret services for him     in vain were prayer and promise forth he went     spoiled of the livery that till now had made him     enviable with the vulgar and in vain     he hoped another lord the tender dames     were horrorstruck at his atrocious crime     and loathed the author the false wretch succumbed     with all his squalid brood and in the streets     with his lean wife in tatters at his side     vainly lamented to the passerby  it would be quite out of taste for the lover to sit as apathetic as the husband in the presence of his ladys guests and he is to mingle gracefully in the talk from time to time turning it to such topics as may best serve to exploit his own accomplishments as a man of the first fashion he must be in the habit of seeming to have read horace a little and it will be a pretty effect to quote him now one may also show ones acquaintance with the new french philosophy and approve its skepticism while keeping clear of its pernicious doctrines which insidiously teach      that every mortal is his fellows peer     that not less dear to nature and to god     is he who drives thy carriage or who guides     the plow across thy field than thine own self  but at last the lady makes a signal to the cavalier that it is time to rise from the table                               spring to thy feet     the first of all and drawing near thy lady     remove her chair and offer her thy hand     and lead her to the other rooms nor suffer longer     that the stale reek of viands shall offend     her delicate sense thee with the rest invites     the grateful odor of the coffee where     it smokes upon a smaller table hid     and graced with indian webs the redolent gums     that meanwhile burn sweeten and purify     the heavy atmosphere and banish thence     all lingering traces of the feastye sick     and poor whom misery or whom hope perchance     has guided in the noonday to these doors     tumultuous naked and unsightly throng     with mutilated limbs and squalid faces     in litters and on crutches from afar     comfort yourselves and with expanded nostrils     drink in the nectar of the feast divine     that favorable zephyrs waft to you     but do not dare besiege these noble precincts     importunately offering her that reigns     within your loathsome spectacle of woe     and now sir tis your office to prepare     the tiny cup that then shall minister     slow sipped its liquor to thy ladys lips     and now bethink thee whether she prefer     the boiling beverage much or little tempered     with sweet or if perchance she like it best     as doth the barbarous spouse then when she sits     upon brocades of persia with light fingers     the bearded visage of her lord caressing  with the dinner the second part of the poem entitled the noon concludes and the afternoon begins with the visit which the hero and his lady pay to one of her friends he has already thought with which of the husbands horses they shall drive out he has suggested which dress his lady shall wear and which fan she shall carry he has witnessed the agonizing scene of her parting with her lapdogher children are at nurse and never intrudeand they have arrived in the palace of the lady on whom they are to call      and now the ardent friends to greet each other     impatient fly and pressing breast to breast     they tenderly embrace and with alternate kisses     their cheeks resound then clasping hands they drop     plummetlike down upon the sofa both     together seated thus one flings a phrase     subtle and pointed at the others heart     hinting of certain things that rumor tells     and in her turn the other with a sting     assails the lovely face of one is flushed     with beauteous anger and the other bites     her pretty lips a little evermore     at every instant waxes violent     the anxious agitation of the fans     so in the age of turpin if two knights     illustrious and well cased in mail encountered     upon the way each cavalier aspired     to prove the valor of the other in arms     and after greetings courteous and fair     they lowered their lances and their chargers dashed     ferociously together then they flung     the splintered fragments of their spears aside     and fired with generous fury drew their huge     twohanded swords and rushed upon each other     but in the distance through a savage wood     the clamor of a messenger is heard     who comes full gallop to recall the one     unto king charles and th other to the camp     of the young agramante dare thou too     dare thou invincible youth to expose the curls     and the toupet so exquisitely dressed     this very morning to the deadly shock     of the infuriate fans to new emprises     thy fair invite and thus the extreme effects     of their periculous enmity suspend  is not this most charmingly done it seems to me that the warlike interpretation of the scene is delightful and those embattled fanstheir perfumed breath comes down a hundred years in the verse  the cavalier and his lady now betake them to the promenade where all the fair world of milan is walking or driving with a punctual regularity which still distinguishes italians in their walks and drives the place is full of their common acquaintance and the carriages are at rest for the exchange of greetings and gossip in which the hero must take his part all this is described in the same note of ironical seriousness as the rest of the poem and the afternoon closes with a strain of stately and grave poetry which admirably heightens the desired effect          behold the servants     ready for thy descent and now skip down     and smooth the creases from thy coat and order     the laces on thy breast a little stoop     and on thy snowy stockings bend a glance     and then erect thyself and strut away     either to pace the promenade alone     t is thine if t please thee walk or else to draw     anigh the carriages of other dames     thou clamberest up and thrustest in thy head     and arms and shoulders half thyself within     the carriage door there let thy laughter rise     so loud that from afar thy lady hear     and rage to hear and interrupt the wit     of other heroes who had swiftly run     amid the dusk to keep her company     while thou wast absent o ye powers supreme     suspend the night and let the noble deeds     of my young hero shine upon the world     in the clear day nay night must follow still     her own inviolable laws and droop     with silent shades over one half the globe     and slowly moving on her dewy feet     she blends the varied colors infinite     and with the border of her mighty garments     blots everything the sister she of death     leaves but one aspect indistinct one guise     to fields and trees to flowers to birds and beasts     and to the great and to the lowly born     confounding with the painted cheek of beauty     the haggard face of want and gold with tatters     nor me will the blind air permit to see     which carriages depart and which remain     secret amidst the shades but from my hand     the pencil caught my hero is involved     within the tenebrous and humid veil  the concluding section of the poem by chance or by wise design of the author remains a fragment in this he follows his hero from the promenade to the evening party with an account of which the night is mainly occupied so far as it goes there are many lively pictures in it with light sketches of expression and attitude but on the whole it has not so many distinctly quotable passages as the other parts of the poem the perfunctory devotion of the cavalier and the lady continues throughout and the same ironical reverence depicts them alighting from their carriage arriving in the presence of the hostess sharing in the gossip of the guests supping and sitting down at those games of chance with which every fashionable house was provided and at which the lady loses or doubles her pinmoney in milan long trains were then the mode and any woman might wear them but only patricians were allowed to have them carried by servants the rich plebeian must drag her costly skirts in the dust and the nobility of our heros lady is honored by the flunkeys who lift her train as she enters the house the hostess seated on a sofa receives her guests with a few murmured greetings and then abandons herself to the arduous task of arranging the various partners at cards when the cavalier serves his lady at supper he takes his handkerchief from his pocket and spreads it on her lap such usages and the differences of costume distinguished an evening party at milan then from the like joy in our time and country   iv  the poet who sings this gay world with such mocking seriousness was not himself born to the manner of it he was born plebeian in 1729 at bosisio near lake pusiano and his parents were poor he himself adds that they were honest but the phrase has now lost its freshness his father was a dealer in raw silk and was able to send him to school in milan where his scholarship was not equal to his early literary promise at least he took no prizes but this often happens with people whose laurels come abundantly later he was to enter the church and in due time he took orders but he did not desire a cure and he became like so many other accomplished abbati a teacher in noble families the great and saintly family borromeo among others in whose houses and in those he frequented with them he saw the life he paints in his poem his father was now dead and he had already supported himself and his mother by copying lawpapers he had also at the age of twentythree published a small volume of poems and had been elected a shepherd of arcadia but in a country where ones copyright was good for nothing across the borderscarcely a fair stonesthrow awayof ones own little duchy or province and the printers everywhere stole a book as soon as it was worth stealing it is not likely that he made great gains by a volume of verses which later in life he repudiated baretti had then returned from living in london where he had seen the prosperity of the trade of an author in days which we do not now think so very prosperous and he viewed with open disgust the abject state of authorship in his own country so there was nothing for parini to do but to become a maestro in casa with the borromei he always remained friends and in their company he went into society a good deal emilianigiudici supposes that he came to despise the great world with the same scorn that shows in his poem but probably he regarded it quite as much with the amused sense of the artist as with the moralists indignation some of his contemporaries accused him of a snobbish fondness for the great but certainly he did not flatter them and in one passage of his poem he is at the pains to remind his noble acquaintance that not the smallest drop of patrician blood is microscopically discoverable in his veins his days were rendered more comfortable when he was appointed editor of the government newspaperthe only newspaper in milanand yet easier when he was made professor of eloquence in the academy of fine arts in this employment it was his hard duty to write poems from time to time in praise of archdukes and emperors but by and by the french revolution arrived in milan and parini was relieved of that labor the revolution made an end of archdukes and emperors but the liberty it bestowed was peculiar and consisted chiefly in not allowing one to do anything that one liked the altars were abased and trees of liberty were planted for making a tumult about an outraged saint a mob was severely handled by the military and for insulting a tree of liberty a poor fellow at como was shot parini was chosen one of the municipal government which apparently popular could really do nothing but register the decrees of the military commandant he proved so little useful in this government that he was expelled from it and giving his salary to his native parish he fell into something like his old poverty he who had laughed to scorn the insolence and folly of the nobles could not enjoy the insolence and folly of the plebeians and he was unhappy in that wild ferment of ideas hopes principles sentiments which milan became in the time of the cisalpine republic he led a retired life and at last in 1799 having risen one day to studies which he had never remitted he died suddenly in his armchair  many stories are told of his sayings and doings in those troubled days when he tried to serve the public at the theater once some one cried out long live the republic death to the aristocrats no shouted parini who abhorred the abominable bloodthirstiness of the liberators long live the republic death to nobody they were going to take away a crucifix from a room where he appeared on public business very well he observed where citizen christ cannot stay i have nothing to do and went out equality doesnt consist in dragging me down to your level he said to one who had impudently given him the thou but in raising you to mine if possible you will always be a pitiful creature even though you call yourself citizen and though you call me citizen you cant help my being the abbate parini to another who reproached him for kindness to an austrian prisoner he answered i would do as much for a turk a jew an arab i would do it even for you if you were in need in his closing years many sought him for literary counsel those for whom there was hope he encouraged those for whom there was none he made it a matter of conscience not to praise a poor fellow came to repeat him two sonnets in order to be advised which to print parini heard the first and without waiting further besought him print the other     vittorio alfieri   vittorio alfieri the italian poet whom his countrymen would undoubtedly name next after dante petrarch ariosto and tasso and who in spite of his limitations was a man of signal and distinct dramatic power not surpassed if equaled since is scarcely more than a name to most english readers he was born in the year 1749 at asti a little city of that piedmont where there has always been a greater regard for feudal traditions than in any other part of italy and he belonged by birth to a nobility which is still the proudest in europe what a singular country is ours said the chevalier nigra one of the first diplomats of our time who for many years managed the delicate and difficult relations of italy with france during the second empire but who was the son of an apothecary in paris they admit me everywhere i am asked to court and petted as few frenchmen are but here in my own city of turin it would not be possible for me to be received by the marchioness doria and if this was true in the afternoon of the nineteenth century one easily fancies what society must have been at turin in the forenoon of the eighteenth   i  it was in the order of the things of that day and country that alfieri should leave home while a child and go to school at the academy of turin here as he tells in that most amusing autobiography of his he spent several years in acquiring a profound ignorance of whatever he was meant to learn and he came away a stranger not only to the humanities but to any one language speaking a barbarous mixture of french and piedmontese and reading little or nothing doubtless he does not spare color in this statement but almost anything you like could be true of the education of a gentleman as a gentleman got it from the italian priests of the last century we translated he says the lives of cornelius nepos but none of us perhaps not even the masters knew who these men were whose lives we translated nor where was their country nor in what times they lived nor under what governments nor what any government was he learned latin enough to turn virgils georgics into his sort of italian but when he read ariosto by stealth he atoned for his transgression by failing to understand him yet alfieri tells us that he was one of the first scholars of that admirable academy and he really had some impulses even then toward literature for he liked reading goldoni and metastasio though he had never heard of the name of tasso this was whilst he was still in the primary classes under strict priestly control when he passed to a more advanced grade and found himself free to do what he liked in the manner that pleased him best in common with the young russians germans and englishmen then enjoying the advantages of the academy of turin he says that being grounded in no study directed by no one and not understanding any language well he did not know what study to take up or how to study the reading of many french romances he goes on the constant association with foreigners and the want of all occasion to speak italian or to hear it spoken drove from my head that small amount of wretched tuscan which i had contrived to put there in those two or three years of burlesque study of the humanities and asinine rhetoric in place of it he says the french entered into my empty brain but he is careful to disclaim any literary merit for the french he knew and he afterward came to hate it with everything else that was french very bitterly  it was before this a little that alfieri contrived his first sonnet which when he read it to the uncle with whom he lived made that old soldier laugh unmercifully so that until his twentyfifth year the poet made no further attempts in verse when he left school he spent three years in travel after the fashion of those grandtouring days when you had to be a gentleman of birth and fortune in order to travel and when you journeyed by your own conveyance from capital to capital with letters to your sovereigns ambassadors everywhere and spent your money handsomely upon the dissipations of the countries through which you passed alfieri is constantly at the trouble to have us know that he was a very morose and illconditioned young animal and the figure he makes as a traveler is no more amiable than edifying he had a ruling passion for horses and then several smaller passions quite as wasteful and idle he was driven from place to place by a demon of unrest and was mainly concerned after reaching a city in getting away from it as soon as he could he gives anecdotes enough in proof of this and he forgets nothing that can enhance the surprise of his future literary greatness at the ambrosian library in milan they showed him a manuscript of petrarchs which like a true barbarian as he says he flung aside declaring that he knew nothing about it having a rancor against this petrarch whom he had once tried to read and had understood as little as ariosto at rome the sardinian minister innocently affronted him by repeating some verses of marcellus which the sulky young noble could not comprehend in ferrara he did not remember that it was the city of that divine ariosto whose poem was the first that came into his hands and which he had now read in part with infinite pleasure but my poor intellect he says was then sleeping a most sordid sleep and every day as far as regards letters rusted more and more it is true however that with respect to knowledge of the world and of men i constantly learned not a little without taking note of it so many and diverse were the phases of life and manners that i daily beheld at florence he visited the galleries and churches with much disgust and no feeling for the beautiful especially in painting his eyes being very dull to color if i liked anything better it was sculpture a little and architecture yet a little more and it is interesting to note how all his tragedies reflect these preferences in their lack of color and in their sculpturesque sharpness of outline  from italy he passed as restlessly into france yet with something of a more definite intention for he meant to frequent the french theater he had seen a company of french players at turin and had acquainted himself with the most famous french tragedies and comedies but with no thought of writing tragedies of his own he felt no creative impulse and he liked the comedies best though as he says he was by nature more inclined to tears than to laughter but he does not seem to have enjoyed the theater much in paris a city for which he conceived at once the greatest dislike he says on account of the squalor and barbarity of the buildings the absurd and pitiful pomp of the few houses that affected to be palaces the filthiness and gothicism of the churches the vandalic structure of the theaters of that time and the many and many and many disagreeable objects that all day fell under my notice and worst of all the unspeakably misshapen and beplastered faces of those ugliest of women  he had at this time already conceived that hatred of kings which breathes or i may better say bellows from his tragedies and he was enraged even beyond his habitual fury by his reception at court where it was etiquette for louis xv to stare at him from head to foot and give no sign of having received any impression whatever  in holland he fell in love for the first time and as was requisite in the polite society of that day the object of his passion was another mans wife in england he fell in love the second time and as fashionably as before the intrigue lasted for months in the end it came to a duel with the ladys husband and a great scandal in the newspapers but in spite of these displeasures alfieri liked everything in england the streets the taverns the horses the women the universal prosperity the life and activity of that island the cleanliness and convenience of the houses though extremely littleas they still strike every one coming from italythese and other charms of that fortunate and free country made an impression upon him that never was effaced he did not at that time he says study profoundly the constitution mother of so much prosperity but he knew enough to observe and value its sublime effects  before his memorable sojourn in england he spent half a year at turin reading rousseau among other philosophers and voltaire whose prose delighted and whose verse wearied him but the book of books for me he says and the one which that winter caused me to pass hours of bliss and rapture was plutarch his lives of the truly great and some of these as timoleon caesar brutus pelopidas cato and others i read and read again with such a transport of cries tears and fury that if any one had heard me in the next room he would surely have thought me mad in meditating certain grand traits of these supreme men i often leaped to my feet agitated and out of my senses and tears of grief and rage escaped me to think that i was born in piedmont and in a time and under a government where no high thing could be done or said and it was almost useless to think or feel it  illustration vittorio alfieri  these characters had a lifelong fascination for alfieri and his admiration of such types deeply influenced his tragedies so great was his scorn of kings at the time he writes of that he despised even those who liked them and poor little metastasio who lived by the bounty of maria theresa fell under alfieris bitterest contempt when in vienna he saw his brotherpoet before the empress in the imperial gardens at schonbrunn performing the customary genuflexions with a servilely contented and adulatory face this loathing of royalty was naturally intensified beyond utterance in prussia on entering the states of frederick i felt redoubled and triplicated my hate for that infamous military trade most infamous and sole base of arbitrary power he told his minister that he would be presented only in civil dress because there were uniforms enough at that court and he declares that on beholding frederick he felt no emotion of wonder or of respect but rather of indignation and rage the king addressed me the three or four customary words i fixed my eyes respectfully upon his and inwardly blessed heaven that i had not been born his slave and i issued from that universal prussian barracks  abhorring it as it deserved  in paris alfieri bought the principal italian authors which he afterwards carried everywhere with him on his travels but he says that he made very little use of them having neither the will nor the power to apply his mind to anything in fact he knew very little italian most of the authors in his collection were strange to him and at the age of twentytwo he had read nothing whatever of dante petrarch tasso boccaccio or machiavelli  he made a journey into spain among other countries where he admired the andalusian horses and bored himself as usual with what interests educated people and he signalized his stay at madrid by a murderous outburst of one of the worst tempers in the world one night his servant elia in dressing his hair had the misfortune to twitch one of his locks in such a way as to give him a slight pain on which alfieri leaped to his feet seized a heavy candlestick and without a word struck the valet such a blow upon his temple that the blood gushed out over his face and over the person of a young spanish gentleman who had been supping with alfieri elia sprang upon his master who drew his sword but the spaniard after great ado quieted them both and so ended this horrible encounter says alfieri for which i remained deeply afflicted and ashamed i told elia that he would have done well to kill me and he was the man to have done it being a palm taller than myself who am very tall and of a strength and courage not inferior to his height two hours later his wound being dressed and everything put in order i went to bed leaving the door from my room into elias open as usual without listening to the spaniard who warned me not thus to invite a provoked and outraged man to vengeance i called to elia who had already gone to bed that he could if he liked and thought proper kill me that night for i deserved it but he was no less heroic than i and would take no other revenge than to keep two handkerchiefs which had been drenched in his blood and which from time to time he showed me in the course of many years this reciprocal mixture of fierceness and generosity on both our parts will not be easily understood by those who have had no experience of the customs and of the temper of us piedmontese though here perhaps alfieri does his country too much honor in making his ferocity a national trait for the rest he says he never struck a servant except as he would have done an equalnot with a cane but with his fist or a chair or anything else that came to hand and he seems to have thought this a democratic if not an amiable habit when at last he went back to turin he fell once more into his old life of mere vacancy varied before long by a most unworthy amour of which he tells us that he finally cured himself by causing his servant to tie him in his chair and so keep him a prisoner in his own house a violent distemper followed this treatment which the lightmoraled gossip of the town said alfieri had invented exclusively for his own use many days he lay in bed tormented by this anguish but when he rose he was no longer a slave to his passion shortly after he wrote a tragedy or a tragic dialogue rather in italian blank verse called cleopatra which was played in a turinese theater with a success of which he tells us he was at once and always ashamed  yet apparently it encouraged him to persevere in literature his qualifications for tragical authorship being a resolute spirit very obstinate and untamed a heart running over with passions of every kind among which predominated a bizarre mixture of love and all its furies and a profound and most ferocious rage and abhorrence against all tyranny whatsoever  a very dim and uncertain remembrance of various french tragedies seen in the theaters many years before  an almost total ignorance of all the rules of tragic art and an unskillfulness almost total in the divine and most necessary art of writing and managing my own language with this stock in trade he set about turning his filippo and his polinice which he wrote first in french prose into italian verse making at the same time a careful study of the italian poets it was at this period that the poet ossian was introduced to mankind by the ingenious and selfsacrificing mr macpherson and cesarottis translation of him came into alfieris hands these blank verses were the first that really pleased him with a little modification he thought they would be an excellent model for the verse of dialogue  he had now refused himself the pleasure of reading french and he had nowhere to turn for tragic literature but to the classics which he read in literal versions while he renewed his faded latin with the help of a teacher but he believed that his originality as a tragic author suffered from his reading and he determined to read no more tragedies till he had made his own for this reason he had already given up shakespeare the more that author accorded with my humor though i very well perceived all his defects the more i was resolved to abstain he tells us  this was during a literary sojourn in tuscany whither he had gone to accustom himself to speak hear think and dream in tuscan and not otherwise evermore here he versified his first two tragedies and sketched others and here he says i deluged my brain with the verses of petrarch of dante of tasso and of ariosto convinced that the day would infallibly come in which all these forms phrases and words of others would return from its cells blended and identified with my own ideas and emotions  he had now indeed entered with all the fury of his nature into the business of making tragedies which he did very much as if he had been making love he abandoned everything else for itcountry home money friends for having decided to live henceforth only in tuscany and hating to ask that royal permission to remain abroad without which annually renewed the piedmontese noble of that day could not reside out of his own country he gave up his estates at asti to his sister keeping for himself a pension that came only to about half his former income the king of piedmont was very well as kings went in that day and he did nothing to hinder the poets expatriation the long period of study and production which followed alfieri spent chiefly at florence but partly also at rome and naples during this time he wrote and printed most of his tragedies and he formed that relation common enough in the best society of the eighteenth century with the countess of albany which continued as long as he lived the countesss husband was the pretender charles edward the last of the english stuarts who like all his house abetted his own evil destiny and was then drinking himself to death there were difficulties in the way of her living with alfieri which would not perhaps have beset a less exalted lady and which required an especial grace on the part of the pope but this the pope refused ever to bestow even after being much prayed and when her husband was dead she and alfieri were privately married or were not married the fact is still in dispute their house became a center of fashionable and intellectual society in florence and to be received in it was the best that could happen to any one the relation seems to have been a sufficiently happy one neither was painfully scrupulous in observing its ties and after alfieris death the countess gave to the painter fabre a heart which says massimo dazeglio in his memoirs according to the usage of the time and especially of high society felt the invincible necessity of keeping itself in continual exercise a cynical little story of alfieri reading one of his tragedies in company while fabre stood behind him making eyes at the countess and from time to time kissing her ring on his finger was told to dazeglio by an aunt of his who witnessed the scene  in 1787 the poet went to france to oversee the printing of a complete edition of his works and five years later he found himself in paris when the revolution was at its height the countess was with him and after great trouble he got passports for both and hurried to the city barrier the national guards stationed there would have let them pass but a party of drunken patriots coming up had their worst fears aroused by the sight of two carriages with sober and decent people in them and heavily laden with baggage while they parleyed whether they had better stone the equipages or set fire to them alfieri leaped out and a scene ensued which placed him in a very characteristic light and which enables us to see him as it were in person when the patriots had read the passports he seized them and as he says full of disgust and rage and not knowing at the moment or in my passion despising the immense peril that attended us i thrice shook my passport in my hand and shouted at the top of my voice look listen alfieri is my name italian and not french tall lean pale red hair i am he look at me i have my passport and i have had it legitimately from those who could give it we wish to pass and by heaven we will pass  they passed and two days later the authorities that had approved their passports confiscated the horses furniture and books that alfieri had left behind him in paris and declared him and the countessboth foreignersto be refugee aristocrats  he established himself again in florence where in his fortysixth year he took up the study of greek and made himself master of that literature though till then he had scarcely known the greek alphabet the chief fruit of this study was a tragedy in the manner of euripides which he wrote in secret and which he read to a company so polite that they thought it really was euripides during the whole of the first two acts  alfieris remaining years were spent in study and the revision of his works to the number of which he added six comedies in 1800 the presence and domination of the detested french in florence embittered his life somewhat but if they had not been there he could never have had the pleasure of refusing to see the french commandant who had a taste for literary people if not for literature and would fain have paid his respects to the poet he must also have found consolation in the thought that if the french had become masters of europe many kings had been dethroned and every tyrant who wore a crown was in a very pitiable state of terror or disaster  nothing in alfieris life was more like him than his death of which the abbate di caluso gives a full account in his conclusion of the poets biography his malady was gout and amidst its tortures he still labored at the comedies he was then writing he was impatient at being kept indoors and when they added plasters on the feet to the irksomeness of his confinement he tore away the bandages that prevented him from walking about his room he would not go to bed and they gave him opiates to ease his anguish under their influence his mind was molested by many memories of things long past the studies and labors of thirty years says the abbate recurred to him and what was yet more wonderful he repeated in order from memory a good number of greek verses from the beginning of hesiod which he had read but once these he said over to the signora contessa who sat by his side but it does not appear for all this that there ever came to him the thought that death which he had been for a long time used to imagine near was then imminent it is certain at least that he made no sign to the contessa though she did not leave him till morning about six oclock he took oil and magnesia without the physicians advice and near eight he was observed to be in great danger and the signora contessa being called found him in agonies that took away his breath nevertheless he rose from his chair and going to the bed leaned upon it and presently the day was darkened to him his eyes closed and he expired the duties and consolations of religion were not forgotten but the evil was not thought so near nor haste necessary and so the confessor who was called did not come in time dazeglio relates that the confessor arrived at the supreme moment and saw the poet bow his head he thought it was a salutation but it was the death of vittorio alfieri   ii  i once fancied that a parallel between alfieri and byron might be drawn but their disparities are greater than their resemblances on the whole both however were born noble both lived in voluntary exile both imagined themselves friends and admirers of liberty both had violent natures and both indulged the curious hypocrisy of desiring to seem worse than they were and of trying to make out a shocking case for themselves when they could they were men who hardly outgrew their boyishness alfieri indeed had to struggle against so many defects of training that he could not have reached maturity in the longest life and he was ruled by passions and ideals he hated with equal noisiness the tyrants of europe and the frenchmen who dethroned them  when he left the life of a dissolute young noble for that of tragic authorship he seized upon such histories and fables as would give the freest course to a harsh narrow gloomy vindictive and declamatory nature and his dramas reproduce the terrible fatalistic traditions of the greeks the stories of oedipus myrrha alcestis clytemnestra orestes and such passages of roman history as those relating to the brutuses and to virginia in modern history he has taken such characters and events as those of philip ii mary stuart don garzia and the conspiracy of the pazzi two of his tragedies are from the bible the abel and the saul one the rosmunda from longobardic history and these themes varying so vastly as to the times races and religions with which they originated are all treated in the same spiritthe spirit alfieri believed greek their interest comes from the situation and the action of character as we have it in the romantic drama and supremely in shakespeare there is scarcely anything and the language is shorn of all metaphor and picturesque expression of course their form is wholly unlike that of the romantic drama alfieri holds fast by the famous unities as the chief and saving grace of tragedy all his actions take place within twentyfour hours there is no change of scene and so far as he can master that most obstinate unity the unity of action each piece is furnished with a tangible beginning middle and ending the wide stretches of time which the old spanish and english and all modern dramas cover and their frequent transitions from place to place were impossible and abhorrent to him  emilianigiudici the italian critic writing about the middle of our century declares that when the fiery love of freedom shall have purged italy the alfierian drama will be the only representation worthy of a great and free people this critic holds that alfieris tragical ideal was of such a simplicity that it would seem derived regularly from the greek but for the fact that when he felt irresistibly moved to write tragedy he probably did not know even the names of the greek dramatists and could not have known the structure of their dramas by indirect means having read then only some metastasian plays of the french school so that he created that ideal of his by pure instinctive force of genius with him as with the greeks art arose spontaneously he felt the form of greek art by inspiration he believed from the very first that the dramatic poet should assume to render the spectators unconscious of theatrical artifice and make them take part with the actors and he banished from the scene everything that could diminish their illusion he would not mar the intensity of the effect by changing the action from place to place or by compressing within the brief time of the representation the events of months and years to achieve the unity of action he dispensed with all those parts which did not seem to him the most principal and he studied how to show the subject of the drama in the clearest light in all this he went to the extreme but he so wrought that the print of his cothurnus stamped upon the field of art should remain forever singular and inimitable reading his tragedies in order from the cleopatra to the saul you see how he never changed his tragic ideal but discerned it more and more distinctly until he fully realized it aeschylus and alfieri are two links that unite the chain in a circle in alfieri art once more achieved the faultless purity of its proper character greek tragedy reached the same height in the italians saul that it touched in the greeks prometheus two dramas which are perhaps the most gigantic creations of any literature emilianigiudici thinks that the literary ineducation of alfieri was the principal exterior cause of this prodigious development that a more regular course of study would have restrained his creative genius and while smoothing the way before it would have subjected it to methods and robbed it of originality of feeling and conception tragedy born sublime terrible vigorous heroic the life of liberty  was as it were redeemed by vittorio alfieri reassumed the masculine athletic forms of its original existence and recommenced the exercise of its lost ministry  i do not begin to think this is all true alfieri himself owns his acquaintance with the french theater before the time when he began to write and we must believe that he got at least some of his ideas of athens from paris though he liked the frenchmen none the better for his obligation to them a less mechanical conception of the greek idea than his would have prevented its application to historical subjects in alfieris brutus the first a far greater stretch of imagination is required from the spectator in order to preserve the unities of time and place than the most capricious changes of scene would have asked the scene is always in the forum in rome the action occurs within twentyfour hours during this limited time we see the body of lucretia borne along in the distance brutus harangues the people with the bloody dagger in his hand the emissaries of tarquin arrive and organize a conspiracy against the new republic the sons of brutus are found in the plot and are convicted and put to death   iii  but such incongruities as these do not affect us in the tragedies based on the heroic fables here the poet takes without offense any liberty he likes with time and place the whole affair is in his hands to do what he will so long as he respects the internal harmony of his own work for this reason i think we find alfieri at his best in these tragedies among which i have liked the orestes best as giving the widest range of feeling with the greatest vigor of action the agamemnon which precedes it and which ought to be read first closes with its most powerful scene agamemnon has returned from troy to argos with his captive cassandra and aegisthus has persuaded clytemnestra that her husband intends to raise cassandra to the throne she kills him and reigns with aegisthus electra concealing orestes on the night of the murder and sending him secretly away with strophius king of phocis  in the last scene as clytemnestra steals through the darkness to her husbands chamber she soliloquizes with the dagger in her hand      it is the hour and sunk in slumber now     lies agamemnon shall he nevermore     open his eyes to the fair light my hand     once pledge to him of stainless love and faith     is it to be the minister of his death     did i swear that ay that and i must keep     my oath quick let me go my foot heart hand     all over i tremble oh what did i promise     wretch what do i attempt how all my courage     hath vanished from me since aegisthus vanished     i only see the immense atrocity     of this my horrible deed i only see     the bloody specter of atrides ah     in vain do i accuse thee no thou lovest     cassandra not me only me thou lovest     unworthy of thy love thou hast no blame     save that thou art my husband in the world     of trustful sleep to deaths arms by my hand     and where then shall i hide me o perfidy     can i eer hope for peace o woful life     life of remorse of madness and of tears     how shall aegisthus even aegisthus dare     to rest beside the parricidal wife     upon her murderstained marriagebed     nor tremble for himself away away

agamemnons chamber whence his dying outcries are heard                          o treachery     thou wife o headens i die o treachery  clytemnestra comes out with the dagger in her hand      the

  thou art my daughter stilldost thou not weep     at tears like mine  clytemnestra confesses that aegisthus no longer loves her but she loves him and she shrinks from electras fierce counsel that she shall kill him he enters to find her in tears and a violent scene between him and electra follows in which clytemnestra interposes      cly o daughter he is my husband think aegisthus     she is my

endearments be     of love so bloodstained  the first act closes with a scene between aegisthus and clytemnestra in which he urges her to consent that he shall send to have orestes murdered and reminds her of her former crimes when she revolts from this the scene is very well managed with that sparing phrase which in alfieri is quite as apt to be touchingly simple as bare and poor in the opening scene of the second act orestes has returned in disguise to argos with pylades the son of strophius to whom he speaks      we are come at last here agamemnon fell     murdered and here aegisthus reigns here rose     in memory still though i a child departed     these natal walls and the just heaven in time     leads me back hither      twice five years have passed     this very day since that dread night of blood     when slain by treachery my father made     the whole wide palace with his dolorous cries     echo again oh well do i remember     electra swiftly bore me through this hall     thither where strophius in his pitying arms     received mestrophius less by far thy father     than mine thereafterand fled onward with me     by yonder posterngate all tremulous     and after me there ran upon the air     long a wild clamor and a lamentation     that made me weep and shudder and lament     i knew not why and weeping strophius ran     preventing with his hand my outcries shrill     clasping me close and sprinkling all my face     with bitter tears and to the lonely coast     where only now we landed with his charge     he came apace and eagerly unfurled     his sails before the wind  pylades strives to restrain the passion for revenge in orestes which imperils them both the friend proposes that they shall feign themselves messengers sent by strophius with tidings of orestes death and orestes has reluctantly consented when electra reappears and they recognize each other pylades discloses their plan and when her brother urges the means is vile she answers all woman      less vile than is aegisthus there is none     better or surer none believe me when     you are led to him let it be mine to think     of allthe place the manner time and arms     to kill him still i keep orestes still     i keep the steel that in her husbands breast     she plunged whom nevermore we might call mother      orestes how fares it with that impious woman      electra                                 ah     thou canst not know how she drags out her life     save only agamemnons children all     must pity herand even we must pity     full ever of suspicion and of terror     and held in scorn even by aegisthus self     loving aegisthus though she know his guilt     repentant and yet ready to renew     her crime perchance if the unworthy love     which is her shame and her abhorrence would     now wife now mother never wife nor mother     bitter remorse gnaws at her heart by day     unceasingly and horrible shapes by night     scare slumber from her eyesso fares it with her  in the third scene of the following act clytemnestra meets orestes and pylades who announce themselves as messengers from phocis to the king she bids them deliver their tidings to her and they finally do so pylades struggling to prevent orestes from revealing himself there are touchingly simple and natural passages in the lament that clytemnestra breaks into over her sons death and there is fire with its true natural extinction in tears when she upbraids aegisthus who now enters      my only son beloved i gave thee all                                           all that i gave thou didst account as nothing     while aught remained to take who ever saw     at once so cruel and so false a heart     the guilty love that thou didst feign so ill     and i believed so well what hindrance to it     what hindrance tell me was the child orestes     yet scarce had agamemnon died before     thou didst cry out for his sons blood and searched     through all the palace in thy fury then     the blade thou durst not wield against the father     then thou didst brandish ay bold wast thou then     against a helpless child     unhappy son what booted it to save thee     from thy sires murderer since thou hast found     death ere thy time in strange lands far away     aegisthus villainous usurper thou     thou hast slain my son aegisthusoh forgive     i was a mother and am so no more  throughout this scene and in the soliloquy preceding it alfieri paints very forcibly the struggle in clytemnestra between her love for her son and her love for aegisthus to whom she clings even while he exults in the tidings that wring her heart it is all too baldly presented doubtless but it is very effective and affecting  orestes and pylades are now brought before aegisthus and he demands how and where orestes died for after his first rejoicing he has come to doubt the fact pylades responds in one of those speeches with which alfieri seems to carve the scene in basrelief      every fifth year an ancient use renews     in crete the games and offerings unto jove     the love of glory and innate ambition     lure to that coast the youth and by his side     goes pylades inseparable from him     in the light car upon the arena wide     the hopes of triumph urge him to contest     the proud palm of the flyingfooted steeds     and too intent on winning there his life     he gives for victory      aeg                       but how say on      pyl too fierce impatient and incautious he     now frights his horses on with threatening cries     now whirls his bloodstained

their loose manes tossed     upon the wind and in thick clouds involved     of choking dust round the vast circles bound     as lightning swift they whirl and whirl again     fright horror mad confusion death the car     spreads in its crooked circles everywhere     until at last the smoking axle dashed     with horrible shock against a marble pillar     orestes headlong falls      cly

guilty wifenow art content aegisthus  aegisthus still doubts and pursues the pretended messengers with such insulting question that orestes goaded beyond endurance betrays that their character is assumed they are seized and about to be led to prison in chains when electra enters and in her anguish at the sight exclaims orestes led to die then ensues a heroic scene in which each of the friends claims to be orestes at last orestes shows the dagger electra has given him and offers it to clytemnestra that she may stab aegisthus with the same weapon with which she killed agamemnon      whom then i would call mother take it thou knowst how     to wield it plunge it in aegisthus heart     leave me to die i care not if i see     my father avenged i ask no other proof     of thy maternal

us not ah he is mad forever pylades we must go beside him  pyl                               hard inevitable law of ruthless fate   iv  alfieri himself wrote a critical comment on each of his tragedies discussing their qualities and the question of their failure or success dispassionately enough for example he frankly says of his maria stuarda that it is the worst tragedy he ever wrote and the only one that he could wish not to have written of his agamennone that all the good in it came from the author and all the bad from the subject of his fillippo ii that it may make a very terrible impression indeed of mingled pity and horror or that it may disgust through the cold atrocity of philip even to the point of nausea on the orestes we may very well consult him more at length he declares this tragic action has no other motive or development nor admits any other passion than an implacable revenge but the passion of revenge though very strong by nature having become greatly enfeebled among civilized peoples is regarded as a vile passion and its effects are wont to be blamed and looked upon with loathing nevertheless when it is just when the offense received is very atrocious when the persons and the circumstances are such that no human law can indemnify the aggrieved and punish the aggressor then revenge under the names of war invasion conspiracy the duel and the like ennobles itself and so works upon our minds as not only to be endured but to be admirable and sublime  in his orestes he confesses that he sees much to praise and very little to blame orestes to my thinking is ardent in sublime degree and this daring character of his together with the perils he confronts may greatly diminish in him the atrocity and coldness of a meditated revenge let those who do not believe in the force of a passion for high and just revenge add to it in the heart of orestes private interest the love of power rage at beholding his natural heritage occupied by a murderous usurper and then they will have a sufficient reason for all his fury let them consider also the ferocious ideas in which he must have been nurtured by strophius king of phocis the persecutions which he knows to have been everywhere moved against him by the usurperhis being in fine the son of agamemnon and greatly priding himself thereonand all these things will certainly account for the vindictive passion of orestes clytemnestra is very difficult to treat in this tragedy since she must be here      now wife now mother never wife nor mother  which is much easier to say in a verse than to manage in the space of five acts yet i believe that clytemnestra through the terrible remorse she feels the vile treatment which she receives from aegisthus and the awful perplexity in which she lives  will be considered sufficiently punished by the spectator aegisthus is never able to elevate his soul  he will always be an unpleasing vile and difficult personage to manage well a character that brings small praise to the author when made sufferable and much blame if not made so i believe the fourth and fifth acts would produce the highest effect on the stage if well represented in the fifth there is a movement a brevity a rapidly operating heat that ought to touch agitate and singularly surprise the spirit so it seems to me but perhaps it is not so  this analysis is not only very amusing for the candor with which alfieri praises himself but it is also remarkable for the justice with which the praise is given and the strong conscious hold which it shows him to have had upon his creations it leaves one very little to add but i cannot help saying that i think the management of clytemnestra especially admirable throughout she loves aegisthus with the fatal passion which no scorn or cruelty on his part can quench but while he is in power and triumphant her heart turns tenderly to her hapless children whom she abhors as soon as his calamity comes then she has no thought but to save him she can join her children in hating the murder which she has herself done on agamemnon but she cannot avenge it on aegisthus and thus expiate her crime in their eyes aegisthus is never able to conceive of the unselfishness of her love he believes her ready to betray him when danger threatens and to shield herself behind him from the anger of the argives it is a deep knowledge of human nature that makes him interpose the memory of her unatonedfor crime between her and any purpose of good  orestes always sees his revenge as something sacred and that is a great scene in which he offers his dagger to clytemnestra and bids her kill aegisthus with it believing for the instant that even she must exult to share his vengeance his feeling towards aegisthus never changes it is not revolting to the spectator since orestes is so absolutely unconscious of wrong in putting him to death he shows his bloodstained sword to pylades with a real sorrow that his friend should not also have enjoyed the rapture of killing the usurper his story of his escape on the night of agamemnons murder is as simple and grand in movement as that of figures in an antique basrelief here and elsewhere one feels how alfieri does not paint but sculptures his scenes and persons cuts their outlines deep and strongly carves their attitudes and expression  electra is the worthy sister of orestes and the family likeness between them is sharply traced she has all his faith in the sacredness of his purpose while she has womanlike a far keener and more specific hatred of aegisthus the ferocity of her exultation when clytemnestra and aegisthus upbraid each other is terrible but the picture she draws for orestes of their mothers life is touched with an exquisite filial pity she seems to me studied with marvelous success  the close of the tragedy is full of fire and life yet never wanting in a sort of lofty austere grace that lapses at last into a truly statuesque despair orestes mad with electra and pylades on either side it is the attitude and gesture of greek sculpture a group forever fixed in the imperishable sorrow of stone  in reading alfieri i am always struck with what i may call the narrowness of his tragedies they have height and depth but not breadth the range of sentiment is as limited in any one of them as the range of phrase in this orestes where the recurrence of the same epithets horrible bloody terrible fatal awful is not apparently felt by the poet as monotonous four or five persons each representing a purpose or a passion occupy the scene and obviously contribute by every word and deed to the advancement of the tragic action and this narrowness and rigidity of intent would be intolerable if the tragedies were not so brief i do not think any of them is much longer than a single act of one of shakespeares plays they are in all other ways equally unlike shakespeares plays when you read macbeth or hamlet you find yourself in a world where the interests and passions are complex and divided against themselves as they are here and now the action progresses fitfully as events do in life it is promoted by the things that seem to retard it and it includes long stretches of time and many places when you read orestes you find yourself attendant upon an imminent calamity which nothing can avert or delay in a solitude like that of dreams those hapless phantasms dark types of remorse of cruel ambition of inexorable revenge move swiftly on the fatal end they do not grow or develop on the imagination their character is stamped at once and they have but to act it out there is no lingering upon episodes no digressions no reliefs they cannot stir from that spot where they are doomed to expiate or consummate their crimes one little day is given them and then all is over  mr lowell in his essay on dryden speaks of a style of poetry whose great excellence was that it was in perfect sympathy with the genius of the people among whom it came into being and this i conceive to be the virtue of the alferian poetry the italians love beauty of form and we goths love picturesque effect and alfieri has little or none of the kind of excellence which we enjoy but while      i look and own myself a happy goth  i have moods in the presence of his simplicity and severity when i feel that he and all the classicists may be right when i see how much he achieves with his sparing phrase his sparsely populated scene his narrow plot and angular design when i find him perfectly sufficient in expression and entirely adequate in suggestion the classic alone appears elegant and truetill i read shakespeare again or till i turn to nature whom i do not find sparing or severe but full of variety and change and relief and yet having a sort of elegance and truth of her own  in the treatment of historical subjects alfieri allowed himself every freedom he makes lorenzo de medici a brutal and very insolent tyrant a tyrant after the high roman fashion a tyrant almost after the fashion of the late edwin forrest yet there are some good passages in the congiura dei pazzi of the peculiarly hard alfierian sort      an enemy insulted and not slain     what breast in triple iron armed but needs     must tremble at him  is a saying of giuliano de medici who when asked if he does not fear one of the conspirators puts the whole political wisdom of the sixteenth century into his answer      being feared i fear  the filippo of alfieri must always have an interest for english readers because of its chance relation to keats who sick to death of consumption bought a copy of alfieri when on his way to rome as mr lowell relates in his sketch of the poets life the dying man opened the book at the second page and read the linesperhaps the tenderest that alfieri ever wrote      misero me sollievo a me non resta     altro che il pianto e il pianto è delitto  keats read these words and then laid down the book and opened it no more the closing scene of the fourth act of this tragedy can well be studied as a striking example of alfieris power of condensation  some of the nonpolitical tragedies of alfieri are still played ristori has played his mirra and salvini his saul but i believe there is now no italian critic who praises him so entirely as giudici did yet the poet finds a warm defender against the french and german critics in de sanctis note saggi critici di francesco de sanctis napoli antonio morano 1859 a very clever and brilliant italian who accounts for alfieri in a way that helps to make all italian things more intelligible to us he is speaking of alfieris epoch and social circumstances education had been classic for ages our ideal was rome and greece our heroes brutus and cato our books livy tacitus and plutarch and if this was true of all europe how much more so of italy where this history might be called domestic a thing of our own a part of our traditions still alive to the eye in our cities and monuments from dante to machiavelli from machiavelli to metastasio our classical tradition was never broken in the social dissolution of the last century all disappeared except this ideal in fact in that first enthusiasm when the minds of men confidently sought final perfection it passed from the schools into life ruled the imagination inflamed the will people lived and died romanly the situations that alfieri has chosen in his tragedies have a visible relation to the social state to the fears and to the hopes of his own time it is always resistance to oppression of man against man of people against tyrant in the classicism of alfieri there is no positive side it is an ideal rome and greece outside of time and space floating in the vague  which his contemporaries filled up with their own life  giuseppe arnaud in his admirable criticisms on the patriotic poets of italy has treated of the literary side of alfieri in terms that seem to me on the whole very just he sacrificed the foreshortening which has so great a charm for the spectator to the sculptured full figure that always presents itself face to face with you and in entire relief the grand passions which are commonly sparing of words are in his system condemned to speak much and to explain themselves too much to what shall we attribute that respectful somnolence which nowadays reigns over the audience during the recitation of alfieris tragedies if they are not sustained by some theatrical celebrity you will certainly say to the mediocrity of the actors but i hold that the tragic effect can be produced even by mediocre actors if this effect truly abounds in the plot of the tragedy i know that these opinions of mine will not be shared by the great majority of the italian public and so be it the contrary will always be favorable to one who greatly loved his country always desired to serve her and succeeded in his own time and own manner whoever should say that alfieris tragedies in spite of many eminent merits were constructed on a theory opposed to grand scenic effects and to one of the two bases of tragedy namely compassion would certainly not say what was far from the truth and yet with all this alfieri will still remain that dry harsh blast which swept away the noxious miasms with which the italian air was infected he will still remain that poet who aroused his country from its dishonorable slumber and inspired its heart with intolerance of servile conditions and with regard for its dignity up to his time we had bleated and he roared in fact says dazeglio one of the merits of that proud heart was to have found italy metastasian and left it alfierian and his first and greatest merit was to my thinking that he discovered italy so to speak as columbus discovered america and initiated the idea of italy as a nation i place this merit far beyond that of his verses and his tragedies  besides his tragedies alfieri wrote as i have already stated some comedies in his last years but i must own my ignorance of all six of them and he wrote various satires odes sonnets epigrams and other poems most of these are of political interest the misogallo is an expression of his scorn and hatred of the french nation the america liberata celebrates our separation from england the etruria vendicata praises the murder of the abominable alessandro de medici by his kinsman lorenzaccio none of the satires whether on kings aristocrats or people have lent themselves easily to my perusal the epigrams are signally unreadable but some of the sonnets are very good he seems to find in their limitations the same sort of strength that he finds in his restricted tragedies and they are all in the truest sense sonnets  here is one which loses of course by translation in this and other of my versions i have rarely found the english too concise for the italian and often not concise enough      he imagines the death of his lady      the sad bell that within my bosom aye       clamors and bids me still renew my tears     doth stun my senses and my soul bewray       with wandering fantasies and cheating fears     the gentle form of her that is but taen       a little from my sight i seem to see     at lifes bourne lying faint and pale with pain       my love that to these tears abandons me     o my own true one tenderly she cries       i grieve for thee love that thou winnest naught     save hapless life with all thy many sighs       life never though thy blessed steps have taught     my feet the path in all welldoing stay       at this last pass t is mine to lead the way  there is a still more characteristic sonnet of alfieris with which i shall close as i began in the very open air of his autobiography      his portrait      thou mirror of veracious speech sublime       what i am like in soul and body show     red hairin front grown somewhat thin with time       tall stature with an earthward head bowed low     a meager form with two straight legs beneath       an aspect good white skin with eyes of blue     a proper nose fine lips and choicest teeth       face paler than a throned kings in hue     now hard and bitter yielding now and mild       malignant never passionate alway     with mind and heart in endless strife embroiled       sad mostly and then gayest of the gay     achilles now thersites in his turn     man art thou great or vile die and thou lt learn     vincenzo monti and ugo foscolo   i  the period of vincenzo monti and ugo foscolo is that covered in political history by the events of the french revolution the french invasion of italy and the napoleonic wars there against the austrians the establishment of the cisalpine republic and of the kingdom of italy the final overthrow of the french dominion and the restoration of the austrians during all these events the city of milan remained the literary as well as the political center of italy and whatever were the moral reforms wrought by the disasters of which it was also the center there is no doubt that intellectually a vast change had taken place since the days when parinis satire was true concerning the life of the milanese nobles the transformation of national character by war is never perhaps so immediate or entire as we are apt to expect when our own war broke out those who believed that we were to be purged and ennobled in all our purposes by calamity looked for a sort of total and instant conversion this indeed seemed to take place but there was afterward the inevitable reaction and it appears that there are still some small blemishes upon our political and social state yet for all this each of us is conscious of some vast and inestimable difference in the nation  it is instructive if it is not ennobling to be moved by great and noble impulses to feel ones self part of a people and to recognize country for once as the supreme interest and these were the privileges the french revolution gave the italians it shed their blood and wasted their treasure and stole their statues and pictures but it bade them believe themselves men it forced them to think of italy as a nation and the very tyranny in which it ended was a realization of unity and more to be desired a thousand times than the shameless tranquillity in which it had found them it is imaginable that when the revolution advanced upon milan it did not seem the greatest and finest thing in life to serve a lady when the battles of marengo and lodi were fought and mantua was lost and won to court ones neighbors wife must have appeared to some gentlemen rather a waste of time when the youth of the italian legion in napoleons campaign perished amidst the snows of russia their brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers must have found intrigues and operas and fashions but a poor sort of distraction by these terrible means the old forces of society were destroyed not quickly but irreparably the cavaliere servente was extinct early in this century and men and women opened their eyes upon an era of work the most industrious age that the world has ever seen  the change took place slowly much of the material was old and hopelessly rotten but in the new generation the growth towards better and greater things was more rapid  yet it would not be well to conjure up too heroic an image of italian revolutionary society we know what vices fester and passions rage in wartime and italy was then almost constantly involved in war intellectually men are active but the great poems are not written in wartime nor the highest effects of civilization produced there is a taint of insanity and of instability in everything a mark of feverishness and haste and transition the revolution gave italy a chance for new life but this was the most the revolution could do it was a great gift not a perfect one and as it remained for the italians to improve the opportunity they did it partially fitfully as men do everything   ii  the poets who belong to this time are numerous enough but those best known are vincenzo monti and ugo foscolo these men were long the most conspicuous literati in the capital of lombardy but neither was lombard monti was educated in the folds of arcadia at rome foscolo was a native of one of the greek islands dependent on venice and passed his youth and earlier manhood in the lagoons the accident of residence at milan brought the two men together and made friends of those who had naturally very little in common they can only be considered together as part of the literary history of the time in which they both happened to be born and as one of its most striking contrasts  in 1802 napoleon bestowed a republican constitution on lombardy and the other provinces of italy which had been united under the name of the cisalpine republic and milan became the capital of the new state thither at once turned all that was patriotic hopeful and ambitious in italian life and though one must not judge this phase of italian civilization from vincenzo monti it is an interesting comment on its effervescent unstable fictitious and partial nature that he was its most conspicuous poet few men appear so base as monti but it is not certain that he was of more fickle and truthless soul than many other contemplative and cultivated men of the poetic temperament who are never confronted with exigent events and who therefore never betray the vast difference that lies between the ideal heroism of the poets vision and the actual heroism of occasion we all have excellent principles until we are tempted and it was montis misfortune to be born in an age which put his principles to the test with a prospect of more than the usual prosperity in reward for servility and compliance and more than the usual want suffering and danger in punishment of candor and constancy  he was born near ferrara in 1754 and having early distinguished himself in poetry he was conducted to rome by the cardinallegate borghesi at rome he entered the arcadian fold of course and piped by rule there with extraordinary acceptance and might have died a shepherd but for the french revolution which broke out and gave him a chance to be a man the secretary of the french legation at naples appearing in rome with the tricolor of the republic was attacked by the foolish populace and killed and monti the petted and caressed of priests the elegant and tuneful young poet in the train of cardinal borghesi seized the event of ugo bassvilles death and turned it to epic account in the moment of dissolution bassville repenting his republicanism receives pardon but as a condition of his acceptance into final bliss he is shown through several cantos of terza rima the woes which the revolution has brought upon france and the world the bad people of the poem are naturally the french revolutionists the good people those who hate them the most admired episode is that descriptive of poor louis xvis ascent into heaven from the scaffold  illustration vincenzo monti  there is some reason to suppose that monti was sincerer in this poem than in any other of political bearing which he wrote and the dantesque plan of the work gave it with the occasional help of dantes own phraseology and many fine turns of expression picked up in the course of a multifarious reading a dignity from which the absurdity of the apotheosis of priests and princes detracted nothing among its readers at any rate it was received by arcadia with rapturous acclaim though its theme was not the golden age and on the bassvilliana the little that is solid in montis fame rests at this day his lyric poetry is seldom quoted his tragedies are no longer played not even his galeoto manfredi in which he has stolen almost enough from shakespeare to vitalize one of the characters after a while the romans wearied of their idol and began to attack him in politics and literature and in 1797 monti after a sojourn of twenty years in the papal capital fled from rome to milan here he was assailed in one of the journals by a fanatical neapolitan who had also written a bassvilliana but with celestial powers heroes and martyrs of french politics and who now accused monti of enmity to the rights of man monti responded by a letter to this poet in which he declared that his bassvilliana was no expression of his own feelings but that he had merely written it to escape the fury of bassvilles murderers who were incensed against him as bassvilles friend but for all this the bassvilliana was publicly burnt before the cathedral in milan and monti was turned out of a government place he had got because he had published books calculated to inspire hatred of democracy or predilection for the government of kings of theocrats and aristocrats the poet was equal to this exigency and he now reprinted his works and made them praise the french and the revolutionists wherever they had blamed them before all the bad systems and characters were depicted as monarchies and kings and popes instead of anarchies and demagogues bonaparte was exalted and poor louis xvi sent to heaven with so much ceremony in the bassvilliana was abased in a later ode on superstition  monti was amazed that all this did not suffice to overcome that fatal combination of circumstances which had caused him to be judged as the courtier of despotism how gladly he writes would i have accepted the destiny which envy could not reach but this scourge of honest men clings to my flesh and i cannot hope to escape it except i turn scoundrel to become fortunate when the austrians returned to milan the only honest man unhanged in italy fled with other democrats to paris whither the fatal combination of circumstances followed him and caused him to be looked on with coldness and suspicion by the republicans after bonaparte was made first consul monti invoked his might against the germans in italy and carried his own injured virtue back to milan in the train of the conqueror when bonaparte was crowned emperor this democrat and patriot was the first to hail and glorify him and the emperor rewarded the poets devotion with a chair in the university of pavia and a pension attached to the place of historiographer monti accepted the honors and emoluments due to longsuffering integrity and inalterable virtue and continued in the enjoyment of them till the austrians came back to milan a second time in 1815 when his chaste muse was stirred to a new passion by the charms of german despotism and celebrated as the wise the just the best of kings francis augustus who if one were to believe monti in war was a whirlwind and in peace a zephyr but the heavy austrian who knew he was nothing of the kind thrust out his surly under lip at these blandishments said that this muses favors were mercenary and cut off montis pension stung by such ingratitude the victim of his own honesty retired forever from courts and thenceforward sang only the merits of rich persons in private station who could afford to pay for spontaneous and incorruptible adulation he died in 1826 having probably endured more pain and rungreater peril in his desire to avoid danger and suffering than the bravest and truest man in a time when courage and truth seldom went in company it is not probable that he thought himself despicable or other than unjustly wretched  perhaps after all he was not so greatly to blame as de sanctis subtly observes he was always a liberal how not be liberal in those days when even the reactionaries shouted for libertyof course true liberty as they called it and in that name he glorified all governments and it was not with hypocrisy he was a man who would have liked to reconcile the old and the new ideas all opinions yet being forced to choose he clung to the majority with no desire to play the martyr so he became the secretary of the dominant feeling the poet of success kindly tolerant sincere a good friend a courtier more from necessity and weakness than perversity or wickedness if he could have retired into his own heart he might have come out a poet monti in fact was always an improvvisatore and the subjects which events cast in his way were like the themes which the improvvisatore receives from his audience he applied his poetic faculty to their celebration with marvelous facility and doubtless regarded the results as rhetorical feats his poetry was an art not a principle and perhaps he was really surprised when people thought him in earnest and held him personally to account for what he wrote a man of sensation rather than sentiment says arnaud monti cared only for the objective side of life he poured out melodies colors and chaff in the service of all causes he was the poetadvocate the siren of the italian parnassus of course such a man instinctively hated the ideas of the romantic school and he contested their progress in literature with great bitterness he believed that poetry meant feigning not making and he declared that the hard truth was the grave of the beautiful the latter years of his life were spent in futile battle with the audacious boreal school and in noxious revival of the foolish old disputes of the italian grammarians and emilianigiudici condemns him for having done more than any enemy of his country to turn italian thought from questions of patriotic interest to questions of philology from the unity of italy to the unity of the language from the usurpations and tyranny of austria to the assumptions of della crusca but monti could scarcely help any cause which he espoused and it seems to me that he was as well employed in disputing the claims of the tuscan dialect to be considered the italian language as he would have been in any other way the wonderful facility no less than the unreality of the man appears in many things but in none more remarkably than his translation of homer which is the translation universally accepted and approved in italy he knew little more than the greek alphabet and produced his translation from the preceding versions in latin and italian submitting the work to the correction of eminent scholars before he printed it his poems fill many volumes and all display the ease perspicuity and obvious beauty of the improvvisatore from a fathomless memory he drew felicities which had clung to it in his vast reading and gave them a new excellence by the art with which he presented them as new the commonplace italians long continued to speak awfully of monti as a great poet because the commonplace mind regards everything established as great he is a classic of those classics common to all languagesdead corpses which retain their forms perfectly in the coffin but crumble to dust as soon as exposed to the air   iii  from the bassvilliana i have translated the passage descriptive of louis xvis ascent to heaven and i offer this perhaps not quite justly in illustration of what i have been saying of monti as a poet there is something of his curious verbal beauty in it and his singular good luck of phrase with his fortunate reminiscences of other poets the collocation of the different parts is very comical and the application of it all to louis xvi is one of the most preposterous things in literature but one must remember that the poor king was merely a subject a theme with the poet      as when the sun uprears himself among     the lesser dazzling substances and drives     his eager steeds along the fervid curve      when in one only hue is painted all     the heavenly vault and every other star     is touched with pallor and doth veil its front      so with sidereal splendor all aflame     amid a thousand glad souls following     high into heaven arose that beauteous soul      smiled as he passed them the majestical     tremulous daughters of the light and shook     their glowing and dewy tresses as they moved      he among all with longing and with love     beaming ascended until he was come     before the triune uncreated life      there his flight ceases there the heart become     aim of the threefold gaze divine is stilled     and all the urgence of desire is lost      there on his temples he receives the crown     of living amaranth immortal on     his cheek the kiss of everlasting peace      and then were heard consonances and notes     of an ineffable sweetness and the orbs     began again to move their starry wheels      more swiftly yet the steeds that bore the day     exulting flew and with their mighty tread     did beat the circuit of their airy way  in this there are three really beautiful lines namely those which describe the arrival of the spirit in the presence of god      there his flight ceases there the heart become     aim of the threefold gaze divine is stilled     and all the urgence of desire is lost  or as it stands in the italian      ivi queta il suo voi ivi sappunta     in tre sguardi beata ivi il cor tace     e tutta perde del desio la punta  it was the fortune of monti as i have said to sing all round and upon every side of every subject and he was governed only by knowledge of which side was for the moment uppermost if a poem attacked the french when their triumph seemed doubtful the offending verses were erased as soon as the french conquered and the same poem unblushingly exalted them in a new editionnow religion and the church were celebrated in montis song now the goddess of reason and the reign of liberty the pope was lauded in rome and the inquisition was attacked in milan england was praised whilst monti was in the antifrench interest and as soon as the poet could turn his coat of many colors the sun was urged to withdraw from england the small amount of light and heat which it vouchsafed the foggy island and the rev henry boyd who translated the bassvilliana into our tongue must have been very much dismayed to find this eloquent foe of revolutions assailing the hereditary enemy of france in his next poem and uttering the hope that she might be surrounded with waves of blood and with darkness and shaken with earthquakes but all this was nothing to montis treatment of the shade of poor king louis xvi we have seen with how much ceremony the poet ushered that unhappy prince into eternal bliss and in mr boyds translation of the bassvilliana we can read the portents with which monti makes the heavens recognize the crime of his execution in paris      then from their houses like a billowy tide     men rush enfrenzied and from every breast     banished shrinks pity weeping terrified     now the earth quivers trampled and oppressed     by wheels by feet of horses and of men     the air in hollow moans speaks its unrest     like distant thunders roar scarce within ken     like the hoarse murmurs of the midnight surge     like the north wind rushing from its faroff den                                           through the dark crowds that round the scaffold flock     the monarch see with look and gait appear     that might to soft compassion melt a rock     melt rocks from hardest flint draw pitys tear     but not from gallic tigers to what fate     monsters have ye brought him who loved you dear  it seems scarcely possible that a personage so flatteringly attended from the scaffold to the very presence of the trinity could afterward have been used with disrespect by the same master of ceremonies yet in his ode on superstition monti has later occasion to refer to the french monarch in these terms                       the tyrant has fallen ye peoples                      oppressèd rise nature breathes freely                      proud kings bow before them and tremble                      yonder crumbles the greatest of thrones     repeat there was stricken the vile perjurer capet  he will only give louis his family name                       who had worn out the patience of god                      in that pitiless blood dip thy fingers                      france delivered from fetters unworthy                      t is blood sucked from the veins of thy children                      whom the despot has cruelly wronged                      o freemen to arms that are flying                      bathe bathe in that blood your bright weapons                      triumph rests mid the terror of battle                      upon swords that have smitten a king  this every one must allow was a very unhandsome way of treating an exmartyr but at the time monti wrote he was in milan in the midst of most revolutionary spirits and he felt obliged to be rude to the memory of the unhappy king after all probably it did not hurt the king so much as the poet   iv  the troubled life of ugo foscolo is a career altogether wholesomer than montis to contemplate there is much of violence vanity and adventure in it to remind of byron but foscolo had neither the badness of byrons heart nor the greatness of his talent he was moreover a better scholar and a man of truer feeling coming to venice from zante in 1793 he witnessed the downfall of a system which venetians do not yet know whether to lament or execrate and he was young and generous enough to believe that bonaparte really meant to build up a democratic republic on the ruins of the fallen oligarchy foscolo had been one of the popular innovators before the republic perished and he became the secretary of the provisional government and was greatly beloved by the people it is related that they were so used to his voice and so fond of hearing it that one day when they heard another reading in his place they became quite turbulent till the president called out with that deliciously caressing venetian familiarity popolo ste cheto foscolo xe rochio people be quiet foscolo is hoarse while in this office he brought out his first tragedy which met with great success and at the same time napoleon played the cruel farce with which he had beguiled the venetians by selling them to austria at campoformio foscolo then left venice and went to milan where he established a patriotic journal in which a genuine love of country found expression and in which he defended unworthy monti against the attacks of the red republicans he also defended the latin language when the legislature which found time in a season of great public peril and anxiety to regulate philology fulminated a decree against that classic tongue and he soon afterward quitted milan in despair of the republics future he had many such fits of disgust and in one of them he wrote that the wickedness and shame of italy were so great that they could never be effaced till the two seas covered her there was fighting in those days for such as had stomach for it in every part of italy and foscolo being enrolled in the italian legion was present at the battle of cento and took part in the defense of genoa but found time amid all his warlike occupations for literature he had written in the flush of youthful faith and generosity an ode to bonaparte liberator and he employed the leisure of the besieged in republishing it at genoa affixing to the verses a reproach to napoleon for the treaty of campoformio and menacing him with a tacitus he returned to milan after the battle of marengo but his enemies procured his removal to boulogne whither the italian legion had been ordered and where foscolo cultivated his knowledge of english and his hatred of napoleon after travel in holland and marriage with an englishwoman there he again came back to milan which he found full as ever of folly intrigue baseness and envy leaving the capital says arnaud he took up his abode on the hills of brescia and for two weeks was seen wandering over the heights declaiming and gesticulating the mountaineers thought him mad one morning he descended to the city with the manuscript of the sepoleri it was in 1807 not jena not friedland could dull the sensation it imparted to the italian republic of letters   v  it is doubtful whether this poem which giudici calls the sublimest lyrical composition modern literature has produced will stir the english reader to enthusiastic admiration the poem is of its agedeclamatory ambitious eloquent but the ideas do not seem great or new though that perhaps is because they have been so often repeated since de sanctis declares it the earliest lyrical note of the new literature the affirmation of the rehabilitated conscience of the new manhood a law of the republicthe french republic prescribed the equality of men before death the splender of monuments seemed a privilege of the nobles and the rich and the republicans contested the privilege the distinction of classes even in this form  this revolutionary logic driven to its ultimate corollaries clouded the poetry of life for him he lacked the religious idea but the sense of humanity in its progress and its aims bound together by the family the state liberty gloryfrom this foscolo drew his harmonies a new religion of the tomb  he touches in it on the funeral usages of different times and peoples with here and there an episodic allusion to the fate of heroes and poets and disquisitions on the aesthetic and spiritual significance of posthumous honors the mostadmired passage of the poem is that in which the poet turns to the monuments of italys noblest dead in the church of santa croce at florence      the urnèd ashes of the mighty kindle     the great soul to great actions pindemonte     and fair and holy to the pilgrim make     the earth that holds them when i saw the tomb     where rests the body of that great one1 who     tempering the scepter of the potentate     strips off its laurels and to the people shows     with what tears it doth reek and with what blood     when i beheld the place of him who raised     a new olympus to the gods in rome2     of him3 who saw the worlds wheel through the heights     of heaven illumined by the moveless

summit pours for thee the moon     glad in thy breath laps in her clearest light     thy hills with vintage laughing and thy vales     filled with their clustering cots and olivegroves     send heavenward th incense of a thousand flowers     and thou wert first florence to hear the song     with which the ghibelline exile charmed his wrath6     and thou his language and his ancestry     gavest that sweet lip of calliope7     who clothing on in whitest purity     love in greece nude and nude in rome again     restored him unto the celestial venus     but happiest i count thee that

that sailed the sea under euboea saw     flashing amidst the wide obscurity     the steel of helmets and of clashing brands     the smoke and lurid flame of funeral pyres     and phantom warriors clad in glittering mail     seeking the combat through the silences     and horror of the night along the field     the tumult of the phalanxes arose     mixing itself with sound of warlike tubes     and clatter of the hoofs of steeds that rushed     trampling the helms of dying warriors     and sobs and hymns and the wild parcaes songs9   notes  1 question of machiavelli whether the prince was

historians that the divina commedia was commenced before the exile of dantefoscolo  7 petrarch was born in exile of florentine parentsibid  8 alfieri so foscolo saw him in his last years  9 the poet quoting pausanias says the sepulture of the athenians who fell in the battle took place on the plain of marathon and there every night is heard the neighing of the steeds and the phantoms of the combatants appear   the poem ends with the prophecy that poetry after time destroys the sepulchers shall preserve the memories of the great and the unhappy and invokes the shades of greece and troy to give an illusion of sublimity to the close the poet doubts if there be any comfort to the dead in monumental stones but declares that they keep memories alive and concludes that only those who leave no love behind should have little joy of their funeral urns he blames the promiscuous burial of the good and bad the great and base he dwells on the beauty of the ancient cemeteries and the pathetic charm of english churchyards the poem of i sepolcri has peculiar beauties yet it does not seem to me the grand work which the italians have esteemed it though it has the pensive charm which attaches to all elegiac verse de sanctis attaches a great political and moral value to it the revolution in the horror of its excesses was passing more temperate ideas prevailed the need of a moral and religious restoration was felt foscolos poem touched these chords  which vibrated in all hearts  the tragedies of foscolo are little read and his unfinished but faithful translation of homer did not have the success which met the facile paraphrase of monti his other works were chiefly critical and are valued for their learning the italians claim that in his studies of dante he was the first to reveal him to europe in his political character as the inspired poet who availed himself of art for the civil regeneration of the people speaking the language which he dedicated to supreme song and they count as among their best critical works foscolos exquisite essays on petrarch and boccaccio his romance the last letters of jacopo ortis is a novel full of patriotism suffering and suicide which found devoted readers among youth affected by the sorrows of werther and which was the first cry of italian disillusion with the french yet it had no political effect de sanctis says because it was not in accord with the popular hopefulness of the time it was of course wildly romantic of the romantic sort that came before the school had got its name and it was supposed to celebrate one of foscolos first loves he had a great many loves first and last and is reproached with a dissolute life by the german critic gervinius  he was made professor of italian eloquence at the university of pavia in 1809 but refusing to flatter napoleon in his inaugural address his professorship was abolished when the austrians returned to milan in 1815 they offered him the charge of their official newspaper but he declined it and left milan for the last time he wandered homeless through switzerland for a while and at last went to london where he gained a livelihood by teaching the italian language and lecturing on its literature and where tormented by homesickness and the fear of blindness he died in 1827 poverty would make even homer abject in london he said  one of his biographers however tells us that he was hospitably welcomed at holland house in london and entertained by the most illustrious islanders but the indispensable etiquette of the country grievous to all strangers was intolerable to foscolo and he soon withdrew from these elegant circles and gave himself up to his beloved books like alfieri on whom he largely modeled his literary ideal and whom he fervently admired foscolo has left us his portrait drawn by himself which the reader may be interested to see      a furrowed brow with cavernous eyes aglow       hair tawny hollow cheeks looks resolute     lips pouting but to smiles and pleasance slow       head bowed neck beautiful and breast hirsute     limbs shapely simple yet elect in dress       rapid my steps my thoughts my acts my tones     grave humane stubborn prodigal to excess       to the world adverse fortune me disowns     shame makes me vile and anger makes me brave       reason in me is cautious but my heart     doth rich in vices and in virtues rave       sad for the most and oft alone apart     incredulous alike of hope and fear       death shall bring rest and honor to my bier  illustration ugo foscolo  cantù thinks that foscolo succeeded by imitating unusual models in seeming original and probably more with reference to the time in which he wrote than to the qualities of his mind classes him with the school of monti although his poetry is full of mythology and classic allusion the use of the wellworn machinery is less mechanical than in monti and foscolo writing always with one high purpose was essentially different in inspiration from the poet who merchandised his genius and sold his song to any party threatening hard or paying well foscolo was a brave man and faithfully loved freedom and he must be ranked with those poets who in later times have devoted themselves to the liberation of italy he is classic in his forms but he is revolutionary and he hoped for some ideal athenian liberty for his country rather than the english freedom she enjoys but we cannot venture to pronounce dead or idle the greek tradition and we must confess that the romanticism which brought into literary worship the trumpery picturesqueness of the middle ages was a lapse from generous feeling     alessandro manzoni   i  it was not till the turbulent days of the napoleonic age were past that the theories and thoughts of romance were introduced into italy when these days came to an end the whole political character of the peninsula reverted as nearly as possible to that of the times preceding the revolutions the bourbons were restored to naples the pope to rome the dukes and grand dukes to their several states the house of savoy to piedmont and the austrians to venice and lombardy and it was agreed among all these despotic governments that there was to be no italy save as metternich suggested in a geographical sense they encouraged a relapse among their subjects into the follies and vices of the past and they largely succeeded but after all the age was against them and people who have once desired and done great things are slow to forget them though the censor may forbid them to be named and the prison and the scaffold may enforce his behest  with the restoration of the austrians there came a tranquillity to milan which was not the apathy it seemed it was now impossible for literary patriotism to be openly militant as it had been in alfieri and foscolo but it took on the retrospective phase of romance and devoted itself to the celebration of the past glories of italy in this way it still fulfilled its educative and regenerative mission it dwelt on the victories which italians had won in other days over their oppressors and it tacitly reminded them that they were still oppressed by foreign governments it portrayed their own former corruption and crimes and so taught them the virtues which alone could cure the ills their vices had brought upon them only secondarily political and primarily moral it forbade the italians to hope to be good citizens without being good men this was romance in its highest office as manzoni grossi and dazeglio conceived it aesthetically the new school struggled to overthrow the classic traditions to liberate tragedy from the bondage of the unities and let it concern itself with any tragical incident of life to give comedy the generous scope of english and spanish comedy to seek poetry in the common experiences of men and to find beauty in any theme to be utterly free untrammeled and abundant to be in literature what the gothic is in architecture it perished because it came to look for beauty only and all that was good in it became merged in realism which looks for truth  these were the purposes of romance and the masters in whom the italian romanticists had studied them were the great german and english poets the tragedies of shakespeare were translated and admired and the dramas of schiller were reproduced in italian verse the poems of byron and of scott were made known and the ballads of such lyrical germans as bürger but of course so quick and curious a people as the italians had been sensitive to all preceding influences in the literary world and before what we call romance came in from germany a breath of nature had already swept over the languid elegance of arcady from the northern lands of storms and mists and the effects of this are visible in the poetry of foscolos period  the enthusiasm with which ossian was received in france remained or perhaps only began after the hoax was exploded in england in italy the misty essence of the caledonian bard was hailed as a substantial presence the king took his spear and struck his deeply sounding shield as it hung on the willows over the neatly kept gardenwalks and the shepherds and shepherdesses promenading there in perpetual villeggiatura were alarmed and perplexed out of a composure which many noble voices had not been able to move emilianigiudici declares that melchiorre cesarotti a professor in the university of padua dealt the first blow against the power of arcadia this professor of greek made the acquaintance of george sackville who inflamed him with a desire to read ossians poems then just published in england and cesarotti studied the english language in order to acquaint himself with a poet whom he believed greater than homer he translated macpherson into italian verse retaining however in extraordinary degree the genius of the language in which he found the poetry he is said for i have not read his version to have twisted the italian into our curt idioms and indulged himself in excesses of compound words to express the manner of his original he believed that the italian language had become sterile timid and superstitious through the fault of the grammarians and in adopting the blank verse for his translation he ventured upon new forms and achieved complete popularity if not complete success in fact says giudici the poems of ossian were no sooner published than italy was filled with uproar by the new methods of poetry clothed in all the magic of magnificent forms till then unknown the arcadian flocks were thrown into tumult and proclaimed a crusade against cesarotti as a subverter of ancient order and a mover of anarchy in the peaceful republicit was a tyranny and they called it a republicof letters cesarotti was called corrupter sacrilegious profane and assailed with titles of obscene contumely but the poems of ossian were read by all and the name of the translator till then little known became famous in and out of italy in fine cesarotti founded a school but blinded by his marvelous success he attempted to translate homer into the same fearless italian which had received his ossian he failed and was laughed at ossian however remained a power in italian letters though cesarotti fell and his influence was felt for romance before the time of the romantic school monti imitated him as he found him in italian yet though montis verse abounds like ossian in phantoms and apparitions they are not northern specters but respectable shades classic wellmannered orderly and have no kinship with anything but the personifications vice virtue fear pleasure and the rest of their genteel allegorical company unconsciously however monti had helped to prepare the way for romantic realism by his choice of living themes louis xvi though decked in epic dignity was something that touched and interested the age and bonaparte even in pagan apotheosis was so positive a subject that the improvvisatore acquired a sort of truth and sincerity in celebrating him bonaparte might not be the sun he was hailed to be but even in montis verse he was a soldier ambitious unscrupulous irresistible recognizable in every guise  in germany where the great revival of romantic letters took placewhere the poets and scholars studying their own minnesingers and the ballads of england and scotland reproduced the simplicity and directness of thought characteristic of young literaturesthe life as well as the song of the people had once been romantic but in italy there had never been such a period the people were municipal mercantile the poets burlesqued the tales of chivalry and the traders made money out of the crusades in italy moreover the patriotic instincts of the people as well as their habits and associations were opposed to those which fostered romance in germany and the poets and novelists who sought to naturalize the new element of literature were naturally accused of political friendship with the hated germans the obstacles in the way of the romantic school at milan were very great and it may be questioned if after all its disciples succeeded in endearing to the italians any form of romantic literature except the historical novel which came from england and the untrammeled drama which was studied from english models they produced great results for good in italian letters but as usual these results were indirect and not just those at which the romanticists aimed  in italy the romantic school was not so sharply divided into a first and second period as in germany where it was superseded for a time by the classicism following the study of winckelmann yet it kept in its own way the general tendency of german literature for the sorrows of werther the italians had the last letters of jacopo ortis for the brood of poets who arose in the fatherland to defy the revolution incarnate in napoleon with hymn and ballad a retrospective national feeling in italy found the same channels of expression through the lombard group of lyrists and dramatists while the historical romance flourished as richly as in england and for a much longer season  de sanctis studies the literary situation in the concluding pages of his history they are almost the most brilliant pages and they embody a conception of it so luminous that it would be idle to pretend to offer the reader anything better than a résumé of his work the revolution had passed away under the horror of its excesses more temperate ideas prevailed the need of a religious and moral restoration was felt foscolo died in 1827 and pellico manzoni grossi berchet had risen above the horizon the romantic schoolthe audacious boreal school had appeared 1815 is a memorable date it marks the official manifestation of a reaction not only political but philosophical and literary the reaction was as rapid and violent as the revolution the white terror succeeded to the red  our critic says that there were at this time two enemies materialism and skepticism and that there rose against them a spirituality carried to idealism to mysticism to the right of nature was opposed the divine right to popular sovereignty legitimacy to individual rights the state to liberty authority or order the middle ages returned in triumph christianity hitherto the target of all offense became the center of every philosophical investigation the banner of all social and religious progress the criterions of art were changed there was a pagan art and a christian art whose highest expression was sought in the gothic in the glooms the mysteries the vague the indefinite in a beyond which was called the ideal in an aspiration towards the infinite incapable of fruition and therefore melancholy to voltaire and rousseau succeeded chateaubriand de staël lamartine victor hugo lamennais and in 1815 appeared the sacred hymns of the young manzoni  the romantic movement was as universal then as the realistic movement is now and as irresistible it was the literary expression of monarchy and aristocracy as realism is the literary expression of republicanism and democracy what de sanctis shows is that out of the political tempest absolutism issued stronger than ever that the clergy and the nobles once its rivals became its creatures the prevailing bureaucracy interested the citizen class in the perpetuity of the state but turned them into officeseekers the police became the mainspring of power the officeholder the priest and the soldier became spies there resulted an organized corruption called government absolute in form or under a mask of constitutionalism  such a reaction in violent contradiction of modern ideas could not last there were outbreaks in spain naples piedmont the romagna greece and belgium rose legitimacy fell citizenkings came in and a long quiet followed in which the sciences and letters nourished even in austriaridden italy where constitutionalism was impossible the middle class was allowed a part in the administration little by little the new and the old learned to live together the divine right and the popular will were associated in laws and writs  the movement was the same revolution as before mastered by experience and selfdisciplined chateaubriand lamartine victor hugo lamennais manzoni grossi pellico were liberal no less than voltaire and rousseau alfieri and foscolo the religious sentiment too deeply offended vindicated itself yet it could not escape from the lines of the revolution  it was a reaction transmuted into a reconciliation  the literary movement was called romantic as against the old classicism medieval and christian it made the papacy the hero of its poetry it abandoned greek and roman antiquity for national antiquity but the modern spirit finally informed romanticism as it had informed classicism parini and manzoni were equally modern men religion is restored but it is no longer a creed it is an artistic motive it is not enough that there are saints they must be beautiful the christian idea returns as art providence comes back to the world the miracle reappears in story hope and prayer revive the heart softens it opens itself to gentle influences manzoni reconstructs the ideal of the christian paradise and reconciles it with the modern spirit mythology goes the classic remains the eighteenth century is denied its ideas prevail  the pantheistic idealism which resulted pleased the citizenfancy the notion of evolution succeeded to that of revolution one said civilization progress culture instead of liberty louis philippe realized the citizen ideal the problem was solved the skein untangled god might rest the supernatural was not believed but it was explained and respected one did not accept christ as divine but a human christ was exalted to the stars religion was spoken of with earnestness and the ministers of god with reverence  a new criticism arose and bade literature draw from life while a vivid idealism accompanied anxiety for historical truth in italy where the liberals could not attack the governments they attacked aristotle and a tremendous war arose between the romanticists and the classicists the former grouped themselves at milan chiefly and battled through the conciliatore a literary journal famous in italian annals they vaunted the english and germans they could not endure mythology they laughed the three unities to scorn at paris manzoni had imbibed the new principles and made friends with the new masters for goethe and schiller he abandoned alfieri and monti yet if the romantic school by its name its ties its studies its impressions was allied to german traditions and french fashions it was at bottom italian in accent aspiration form and motive every one felt our hopes palpitating under the medieval robe the least allusion the remotest meanings were caught by the public which was in the closest accord with the writers the middle ages were no longer treated with historical and positive intention they became the garments of our ideals the transparent expression of our hopes  it is this fact which is especially palpable in manzonis work and manzoni was the chief poet of the romantic school in that land where it found the most realistic development and set itself seriously to interpret the emotions and desires of the nation when these were fulfilled even the form of romanticism ceased to be   iii  alessandro manzoni was born at milan in 1784 and inherited from his father the title of count which he always refused to wear from his mother who was the daughter of beccaria the famous and humane writer on crimes and punishments he may have received the nobility which his whole life has shown  illustration alessandro manzoni  in his youth he was a liberal thinker in matters of religion the stricter sort of catholics used to class him with the voltaireans and there seems to have been some ground for their distrust of his orthodoxy but in 1808 he married mlle louisa henriette blondel the daughter of a banker of geneva who having herself been converted from protestantism to the catholic faith on coming to milan converted her husband in turn and thereafter there was no question concerning his religion she was long remembered in her second country for her fresh blond head and her blue eyes her lovely eyes and she made her husband very happy while she lived the young poet signalized his devotion to his young bride and the faith to which she restored him in his sacred hymns published in this devout and joyous time but manzoni was never a catholic of those catholics who believed in the temporal power of the pope he said to madam colet the author of litalie des italiens a silly and gossiping but entertaining book i bow humbly to the pope and the church has no more respectful son but why confound the interests of earth and those of heaven the roman people are right in asking their freedomthere are hours for nations as for governments in which they must occupy themselves not with what is convenient but with what is just let us lay hands boldly upon the temporal power but let us not touch the doctrine of the church the one is as distinct from the other as the immortal soul from the frail and mortal body to believe that the church is attacked in taking away its earthly possessions is a real heresy to every true christian  the sacred hymns were published in 1815 and in 1820 manzoni gave the world his first tragedy il conte di carmagnola a romantic drama written in the boldest defiance of the unities of time and place he dispensed with these hitherto indispensable conditions of dramatic composition among the italians eight years before victor hugo braved their tyranny in his cromwell and in an introduction to his tragedy he gave his reasons for this audacious innovation following the carmagnola in 1822 came his second and last tragedy adelchi in the mean time he had written his magnificent ode on the death of napoleon il cinque maggio which was at once translated by goethe and recognized by the french themselves as the last word on the subject it placed him at the head of the whole continental romantic school  in 1825 he published his romance i promessi sposi known to every one knowing anything of italian and translated into all modern languages besides these works and some earlier poems manzoni wrote only a few essays upon historical and literary subjects and he always led a very quiet and uneventful life he was very fond of the country early every spring he left the city for his farm whose labors he directed and shared his life was so quiet indeed and his fate so happy in contrast with that of pellico and other literary contemporaries at milan that he was accused of indifference in political matters by those who could not see the subtler tendency of his whole life and works marc monnier says there are countries where it is a shame not to be persecuted and this is the only disgrace which has ever fallen upon manzoni  when the austrians took possession of milan after the retirement of the french they invited the patricians to inscribe themselves in a book of nobility under pain of losing their titles and manzoni preferred to lose his he constantly refused honors offered him by the government and he sent back the ribbon of a knightly order with the answer that he had made a vow never to wear any decoration when victor emanuel in turn wished to do him a like honor he held himself bound by his excuse to the austrians but accepted the honorary presidency of the lombard institute of sciences letters and arts in 1860 he was elected a senator of the realm he appeared in order to take the oath and then he retired to a privacy never afterwards broken   iv  goethes praise says a sneer turned proverb is a brevet of mediocrity manzoni must rest under this damaging applause which was not too freely bestowed upon other italian poets of his time or upon italy at all for that matter  goethe could not laud manzonis tragedies too highly he did not find one word too much or too little in them the style was free noble full and rich as to the religious lyrics the manner of their treatment was fresh and individual although the matter and the significance were not new and the poet was a christian without fanaticism a roman catholic without bigotry a zealot without hardness  the tragedies had no success upon the stage the carmagnola was given in florence in 1828 but in spite of the favor of the court and the open rancor of the friends of the classic school it failed at turin where the adelchi was tried pellico regretted that the attempt to play it had been made and deplored the vile irreverence of the public  both tragedies deal with patriotic themes but they are both concerned with occurrences of remote epochs the time of the carmagnola is the fifteenth century that of the adelchi the eighth century and however strongly marked are the charactersand they are very strongly marked and differ widely from most persons of italian classic tragedy in this respectone still feels that they are subordinate to the great contests of elements and principles for which the tragedy furnishes a scene in the carmagnola the pathos is chiefly in the feeling embodied by the magnificent chorus lamenting the slaughter of italians by italians at the battle of maclodio in the adelchi we are conscious of no emotion so strong as that we experience when we hear the wail of the italian people to whom the overthrow of their longobard oppressors by the franks is but the signal of a new enslavement this chorus is almost as fine as the more famous one in the carmagnola both are incomparably finer than anything else in the tragedies and are much more dramatic than the dialogue it is in the emotion of a spectator belonging to our own time rather than in that of an actor of those past times that the poet shows his dramatic strength and whenever he speaks abstractly for country and humanity he moves us in a way that permits no doubt of his greatness  after all there is but one shakespeare and in the drama below him manzoni holds a high place the faults of his tragedies are those of most plays which are not acting plays and their merits are much greater than the great number of such plays can boast i have not meant to imply that you want sympathy with the persons of the drama but only less sympathy than with the ideas embodied in them there are many affecting scenes and the whole of each tragedy is conceived in the highest and best ideal   v  in the carmagnola the action extends from the moment when the venetian senate at war with the duke of milan places its armies under the command of the count who is a soldier of fortune and has formerly been in the service of the duke the senate sends two commissioners into his camp to represent the state there and to be spies upon his conduct this was a somewhat clumsy contrivance of the republic to give a patriotic character to its armies which were often recruited from mercenaries and generaled by them and of course the hireling leaders must always have chafed under the surveillance after the battle of maclodio in which the venetian mercenaries defeated the milanese the victors according to the custom of their trade began to free their comrades of the other side whom they had taken prisoners the commissioners protested against this waste of results but carmagnola answered that it was the usage of his soldiers and he could not forbid it he went further and himself liberated some remaining prisoners his action was duly reported to the senate and as he had formerly been in the service of the duke of milan whose kinswoman he had married he was suspected of treason he was invited to venice and received with great honor and conducted with every flattering ceremony to the hall of the grand council after a brief delay sufficient to exclude carmagnolas followers the doge ordered him to be seized and upon a summary trial he was put to death from this tragedy i give first a translation of that famous chorus of which i have already spoken i have kept the measure and the movement of the original at some loss of literality the poem is introduced into the scene immediately succeeding the battle of maclodio where the two bands of those italian condottieri had met to butcher each other in the interests severally of the duke of milan and the signory of venice      chorus      on the right hand a trumpet is sounding       on the left hand a trumpet replying     the field upon all sides resounding         with the trampling of foot and of horse       yonder flashes a flag yonder flying     through the still air a

mothers that bare them       for the wives of these warriors maddened     why come not their loved ones to tear them         away from the infamous field       their sires whom long years have saddened     and thoughts of the sepulcher chastened     in warning why have they not hastened         to bid them to hold and to yield      as under the vine that embowers       his own happy threshold the smiling     clown watches the tempest that lowers         on the furrows his plow has not turned       so each waits in safety beguiling     the time with his count of those falling

fiercer the strife than before       but along the ranks rent and unsteady     many waverthey yield they are flying     with the last hope of victory dying         the love of life rises again      as

suddenly dashes     athwart their wild flight and that stays them     while hard on the hindmost dismays them         the pursuit of the enemys horse      at the feet of the foe they fall trembling       and yield life and sword to his keeping     in the shouts of the victors assembling         the moans of the dying are drowned       to the saddle a courier leaping     takes a missive and through

weak with despair  here is the whole political history of italy in this poem the picture of the confronted hosts the vivid scenes of the combat the lamentations over the ferocity of the embattled brothers and the indifference of those that behold their kinsmens carnage the strokes by which the victory the rout and the captivity are given and then the apostrophe to italy and finally the appeal to conscienceare all masterly effects i do not know just how to express my sense of near approach through that last stanza to the heart of a very great and good man but i am certain that i have such a feeling  the noble sonorous music the solemn movement of the poem are in great part lost by its version into english yet i hope that enough are left to suggest the original i think it quite unsurpassed in its combination of great artistic and moral qualities which i am sure my version has not wholly obscured bad as it is   vi  the scene following first upon this chorus also strikes me with the grand spirit in which it is wrought and in its revelations of the motives and ideas of the old professional soldierlife it reminds me of schillers wallensteins camp manzonis canvas has not the breadth of that of the other master but he paints with as free and bold a hand and his figures have an equal heroism of attitude and motive the generous soldierly pride of carmagnola and the strange esprit du corps of the mercenaries who now stood side by side and now front to front in battle who sold themselves to any buyer that wanted killing done and whose noblest usage was in violation of the letter of their bargains are the qualities on which the poet touches in order to waken our pity for what has already raised our horror it is humanity in either case that inspires hima humanity characteristic of many italians of this century who have studied so long in the school of suffering that they know how to abhor a system of wrong and yet excuse its agents  the scene i am to give is in the tent of the great condottiere carmagnola is speaking with one of the commissioners of the venetian republic when the other suddenly enters  commissioner     my lord if instantly you haste not to prevent it treachery shameless and bold will be accomplished making our victory vain ast partly hath already  count how now  com the prisoners leave the camp in troops the leaders and the soldiers vie together to set them free and nothing can restrain them saving command of yours  count              command of mine  com you hesitate to give it  count                   t is a use this

heaped with corpses scattered wide and broken are the resta most flourishing army with which if it were still united and it were mine mine truly id engage to overrun all italy every design of the enemy baffled even the hope of harm taken away from him and from my hand hardly escaped and glad of their escape four captains against whom but yesterday it were a boast to show resistance vanished

my lords                                    to the coms i never will be merciful to your foes till i have conquered them  a notable thing in this tragedy of carmagnola is that the interest of love is entirely wanting to it and herein it differs very widely from the play of schiller the soldiers are simply soldiers and this singleness of motive is in harmony with the italian conception of art yet the carmagnola of manzoni is by no means like the heroes of the alfierian tragedy he is a man not merely an embodied passion or mood his character is rounded and has all the checks and counterpoises the inconsistencies in a word without which nothing actually lives in literature or usefully lives in the world in his generous and magnificent illogicality he comes the nearest being a woman of all the characters in the tragedy there is no other personage in it equaling him in interest but he also is subordinated to the authors purpose of teaching his countrymen an enlightened patriotism i am loath to blame this didactic aim which i suppose mars the aesthetic excellence ofthe piece  carmagnolas liberation of the prisoners was not forgiven him by venice who indeed never forgave anything he was in due time entrapped in the hall of the grand council and condemned to die the tragedy ends with a scene in his prison where he awaits his wife and daughter who are coming with one of his old comrades gonzaga to bid him a last farewell these passages present the poet in his sweeter and tenderer moods and they have had a great charm for me  scenethe prison  count speaking of his wife and daughter by this time     they must know my fate ah why might i not die far from them dread indeed would be the news that reached them but at least the darkest hour of agony would be past and now it stands before us we must needs drink the draft drop by drop o open fields o liberal sunshine o uproar of arms o joy of peril o trumpets and the cries of combatants o my true steed midst you t were fair to die but now i go rebellious to meet my destiny driven to my doom like some vile criminal uttering on the way impotent vows and pitiful complaints                                       but i

internal wars which desolated medieval italy manzoni in the adelchi takes a step further back in time and evolves his tragedy from the downfall of the longobard kingdom and the invasion of the franks these enter italy at the bidding of the priests to sustain the church against the disobedience and contumacy of the longobards  desiderio and his son adelchi are kings of the longobards and the tragedy opens with the return to their city pavia of ermenegarda adelchis sister who was espoused to carlo king of the franks and has been repudiated by him the longobards have seized certain territories belonging to the church and as they refuse to restore them the ecclesiastics send a messenger who crosses the alps on foot to the camp of the franks and invites their king into italy to help the cause of the church the franks descend into the valley of susa and soon after defeat the longobards it is in this scene that the chorus of the italian peasants who suffer no matter which side conquers is introduced the longobards retire to verona and ermenegarda whose character is painted with great tenderness and delicacy and whom we may take for a type of what little goodness and gentleness sorely puzzled there was in the world at that time which was really one of the worst of all the bad times in the world dies in a convent near brescia while the war rages all round her retreat a defection takes place among the longobards desiderio is captured a last stand is made by adelchi at verona where he is mortally wounded and is brought prisoner to his father in the tent of carlo the tragedy ends with his death and i give the whole of the last scene                enter carlo and desiderio  desiderio oh how heavily hast thou descended upon my gray head thou hand of god how comes my son to me my son my only glory here i languish and tremble to behold thee shall i see thy deadly wounded body i that should be wept by thee i miserable alone dragged thee to this blind

sobs and reverent grief of thy true liegemen ah it still had been anguish ineffable and now thou diest no king deserted in thy foemans land with no lament saving thy fathers uttered before the man

servitude remain to weep   i wish to give another passage from this tragedy the speech which the emissary of the church makes to carlo when he reaches his presence after his arduous passage of the alps i suppose that all will note the beauty and reality of the description in the story this messenger tells of his adventures and i feel for my part a profound effect of wildness and loneliness in the verse which has almost the solemn light and balsamy perfume of those mountain solitudes                                      from the camp unseen i issued and retraced the steps but lately taken thence upon the right i turned toward aquilone abandoning the beaten paths i found myself within a dark and narrow valley but it grew wider before my eyes as further on i kept my way here now and then i saw the wandering flocks and huts of shepherds t was the furthermost abode of men i entered one of the huts craved shelter and upon the woolly fleece i slept the night away rising at dawn of my good shepherd host i asked my way to france beyond those heights are other heights he said and others yet and france is far and far away but path theres none and thousands are those mountains steep naked dreadful uninhabited unless by ghosts and never mortal man passed over them the ways of god are many far more than those of mortals i replied and god sends me and god guide you he said then from among the loaves he kept in store he gathered up as many as a pilgrim may carry and in a coarse sack wrapping them he laid them on my shoulders recompense i prayed from heaven for him and took my way beaching the valleys top a peak arose and putting faith in god i climbed it here no trace of man appeared only the forests of untouched pines rivers unknown and vales without a path all hushed and nothing else but my own steps i heard and now and then the rushing of the torrents and the sudden scream of the hawk or else the eagle launched from his high nest and hurtling through the dawn passed close above my head or then at noon struck by the sun the crackling of the cones of the wild pines and so three days i walked and under the great trees and in the clefts three nights i rested the sun was my guide i rose with him and him upon his journey i followed till he set uncertain still of my own way i went from vale to vale crossing forever or if it chanced at times i saw the accessible slope of some great height rising before me and attained its crest yet loftier summits still before around towered over me and other heights with snow from foot to summit whitening that did seem like steep sharp tents fixed in the soil and others appeared like iron and arose in guise of walls insuperable the third day fell what time i had a mighty mountain seen that raised its top above the others t was all one green slope and all its top was crowned with trees and thither eagerly i turned my weary steps it was the eastern side sire of this very mountain on which lies thy camp that faces toward the setting sun while i yet lingered on its spurs the darkness did overtake me and upon the dry and slippery needles of the pine that covered the ground i made my bed and pillowed me against their ancient trunks a smiling hope awakened me at daybreak and all full of a strange vigor up the steep i climbed scarce had i reached the summit when my ear was smitten with a murmur that from far appeared to come deep ceaseless and i stood and listened motionless t was not the waters broken upon the rocks below twas not the wind that blew athwart the woods and whistling ran from one tree to another but verily a sound of living men an indistinct rumor of words of arms of trampling feet swarming from far away an agitation immense of men my heart leaped and my steps i hastened on that peak o king that seems to us like some sharp blade to pierce the heaven there lies an ample plain thats covered thick with grass neer trod before  and this i crossed the quickest way and now at every instant the murmur nearer grew and i devoured the space between i reached the brink i launched my glance into the valley and i saw i saw the tents of israel the desired pavilion of jacob on the ground i fell thanked god adored him and descended   viii  i could easily multiply beautiful and effective passages from the poetry of manzoni but i will give only one more version the fifth of may that ode on the death of napoleon which if not the most perfect lyric of modern times as the italians vaunt it to be is certainly very grand i have followed the movement and kept the meter of the italian and have at the same time reproduced it quite literally yet i feel that any translation of such a poem is only a little better than none i think i have caught the shadow of this splendid lyric but there is yet no photography that transfers the splendor itself the life the light the color i can give you the meaning but not the feeling that pervades every syllable as the blood warms every fiber of a man not the words that flashed upon the poet as he wrote nor the yet more precious and inspired words that came afterward to his patient waiting and pondering and touched the whole with fresh delight and grace if you will take any familiar passage from one of our poets in which every motion of the music is endeared by long association and remembrance and every tone is sweet upon the tongue and substitute a few strange words for the original you will have some notion of the wrong done by translation      the fifth of may      he passed and as immovable       as with the last sigh given     lay his own clay oblivious       from that great spirit riven     so the world stricken and wondering        stands at the tidings dread     mutely pondering the ultimate       hour of that fateful being     and in the vast futurity       no peer of his foreseeing     among the countless myriads        her bloodstained dust that tread      him on his throne and glorious       silent saw i that never     when with awful vicissitude       he sank rose fell forever     mixed my voice with the numberless        voices that pealed on high     guiltless of servile flattery       and of the scorn of coward     come i when darkness suddenly       on so great light hath lowered     and offer a song at his sepulcher        that haply shall not die      from the alps unto the pyramids       from rhine to manzanares     unfailingly the thunderstroke       his lightning purpose carries     bursts from scylla to tanais        from one to the other sea     was it true gloryposterity       thine be the hard decision     bow we before the mightiest       who willed in him the vision     of his creative majesty        most grandly traced should be      the eager and tempestuous       joy of the great plans hour     the throe of the heart that controllessly       burns with a dream of power     and wins it and seizes victory        it had seemed folly to hope     all he hath known the

he spoke his name two centuries       armed and threatening either     turned unto him submissively       as waiting fate together     he made a silence and arbiter        he sat between the two     he vanished his days in the idleness       of his islandprison spending     mark of immense malignity       and of a pity unending     of hatred inappeasable        of deathless love and true      as on the head of the mariner       its weight some billow heaping     falls even while the castaway       with strained sight far sweeping     scanneth the empty distances        for some dim sail in vain     so over his soul the memories       billowed and gathered ever     how oft to tell posterity       himself he did endeavor     and on the pages helplessly        fell his weary hand again      how many times when listlessly       in the long dull days declining     downcast those glances fulminant       his arms on his breast entwining     he stood assailed by the memories        of days that were passed away     he thought of the camps the arduous       assaults the shock of forces     the lightningflash of the infantry       the billowy rush of horses     the thrill in his supremacy        the eagerness to obey      ah haply in so great agony       his panting soul had ended     despairing but that potently       a hand from heaven extended     into a clearer atmosphere        in mercy lifted him     and led him on by blossoming       pathways of hope ascending     to deathless fields to happiness       all earthly dreams transcending     where in the glory celestial        earths fame is dumb and dim      beautiful deathless beneficent       faith used to triumphs even     this also write exultantly       no loftier pride neath heaven     unto the shame of calvary        stooped ever yet its crest     thou from his weary mortality       disperse all bitter passions     the god that humbleth and hearteneth       that comforts and that chastens     upon the pillow else desolate        to his pale lips lay pressed   ix  giuseppe arnaud says that in his sacred poetry manzoni gave the catholic dogmas the most moral explanation in the most attractive poetical language and he suggests that manzoni had a patriotic purpose in them or at least a sympathy with the effort of the romantic writers to give priests and princes assurance that patriotism was religious and thus win them to favor the italian cause it must be confessed that such a temporal design as this would fatally affect the devotional quality of the hymns even if the poets consciousness did not but i am not able to see any evidence of such sympathy in the poems themselves i detect there a perfectly sincere religious feeling and nothing of devotional rapture the poet had no doubt a satisfaction in bringing out the beauty and sublimity of his faith and as a literary artist he had a right to be proud of his work for its spirit is one of which the tuneful piety of italy had long been void in truth since david king of israel left making psalms religious songs have been poorer than any other sort of songs and it is high praise of manzonis inni sacri to say that they are in irreproachable taste and unite in unaffected poetic appreciation of the grandeur of christianity as much reason as may coexist with obedience  the poetry of manzoni is so small in quantity that we must refer chiefly to excellence of quality the influence and the fame it has won him though i do not deny that his success may have been partly owing at first to the errors of the school which preceded him it could be easily shown from literary history that every great poet has appeared at a moment fortunate for his renown just as we might prove from natural science that it is felicitous for the sun to get up about daybreak manzonis art was very great and he never gave his thought defective expression while the expression was always secondary to the thought for the selfrespect then of an honest man which would not permit him to poetize insincerity and shape the void and for the great purpose he always cherished of making literature an agent of civilization and christianity the italians are right to honor manzoni arnaud thinks that the school he founded lingered too long on the educative and religious ground he chose and marc monnier declares manzoni to be the poet of resignation thus distinguishing him from the poets of revolution the former critic is the nearer right of the two though neither is quite just as it seems to me for i do not understand how any one can read the romance and the dramas of manzoni without finding him full of sympathy for all italy has suffered and a patriot very far from resigned and i think political conditionsor the austrians in milan to put it more concretelyscarcely left to the choice of the lombard school that attitude of aggression which others assumed under a weaker if not a milder despotism at florence the utmost allowed the milanese poets was the expression of a retrospective patriotism which celebrated the glories of italys past which deplored her errors and which denounced her crimes and thus contributed to keep the sense of nationality alive under such governments as endured in piedmont until 1848 in lombardy until 1859 in venetia until 1866 literature must remain educative or must cease to be in the works therefore of manzoni and of nearly all his immediate followers there is nothing directly revolutionary except in giovanni berchet the line between them and the directly revolutionary poets is by no means to be traced with exactness however in their literature and in their lives they were all alike patriotic  manzoni lived to see all his hopes fulfilled and died two years after the fall of the temporal power in 1873 toward midday says a milanese journal at the time of his death he turned suddenly to the household friends about him and said this man is failingsinkingcall my confessor  the confessor came and he communed with him half an hour speaking as usual from a mind calm and clear after the confessor left the room manzoni called his friends and said to them when i am dead do what i did every day pray for italypray for the king and his familyso good to me his country was the last thought of this great man dying as in his whole long life it had been his most vivid and constant affection     silvio pellico tomasso grossi luigi career and giovanni berchet   i  as i have noted nearly all the poets of the romantic school were lombards and they had nearly all lived at milan under the censorship and espionage of the austrian government what sort of life this must have been we born and reared in a free country can hardly imagine we have no experience by which we can judge it and we never can do full justice to the intellectual courage and devotion of a people who amid inconceivable obstacles and oppressions expressed themselves in a new and vigorous literature it was not i have explained openly revolutionary but whatever tended to make men think and feel was a sort of indirect rebellion against austria when a society of learned milanese gentlemen once presented an address to the emperor he replied with brutal insolence that he wanted obedient subjects in italy nothing more and it is certain that the activity of the romantic school was regarded with jealousy and dislike by the government from the first the authorities awaited only a pretext for striking a deadly blow at the poets and novelists who ought to have been satisfied with being good subjects but who instead must needs even found a newspaper and discuss in it projects for giving the italians a literary life since they could not have a political existence the perils of contributing to the conciliatore were such as would attend housebreaking and horsestealing in happier countries and later times the government forbade any of its employees to write for it under pain of losing their places the police through whose hands every article intended for publication had to pass not only struck out all possibly offensive expressions but informed one of the authors that if his articles continued to come to them so full of objectionable things he should be banished even though those things never reached the public at last the time came for suppressing this journal and punishing its managers the chief editor was a young piedmontese poet who politically was one of the most harmless and inoffensive of men his literary creed obliged him to choose italian subjects for his poems and he thus erred by mentioning italy yet arnaud in his poeti patriottici tells us he could find but two lines from which this poet could be suspected of patriotism and he altogether refuses to class him with the poets who have promoted revolution nevertheless it is probable that this poet wished freedom well he was indefinitely hopeful for italy he was young generous and credulous of goodness and justice his youth his generosity his truth made him odious to austria one day he returned from a visit to turin and was arrested he could have escaped when danger first threatened but his faith in his own innocence ruined him after a tedious imprisonment and repeated examinations in milan he was taken to venice and lodged in the famous piombi or cells in the roof of the ducal palace there after long delays he had his trial and was sentenced to twenty years in the prison of spielberg by a sort of poetical license which the imperial clemency sometimes used the nights were counted as days and the term was thus reduced to ten years many other young and gifted italians suffered at the same time most of them came to this country at the end of their long durance this piedmontese poet returned to his own city of turin an old and brokenspirited man doubting of the political future and half a jesuit in religion he was devastated and for once a cruel injustice seemed to have accomplished its purpose  such is the grim outline of the story of silvio pellico he was arrested for no offense save that he was an italian and an intellectual man for no other offense he was condemned and suffered his famous book my prisons is the touching and forgiving record of one of the greatest crimes ever perpetrated  few have borne wrong with such christlike meekness and charity as pellico one cannot read his prigioni without doing homage to his purity and goodness and cannot turn to his other works without the misgiving that the sole poem he has left the world is the story of his most fatal and unmerited suffering i have not the hardihood to pretend that i have read all his works i must confess that i found it impossible to do so though i came to their perusal inured to drought by travel through saharas of italian verse i can boast only of having read the francesca da rimini among the tragedies and two or three of the canticlesor romantic stories of the middle ages in blank versewhich now refuse to be identified i know from a despairing reference to his volume that his remaining poems are chiefly of a religious cast   ii  a much better poet of the romantic school was tommaso grossi who like manzoni and pellico is now best known by a prose worka novel which enjoys a popularity as great as that of le mie prigioni and which has been nearly as much read in italy as i promessi sposi the marco visconti of grossi is a romance of the thirteenth century and though not as cantù says an historic episode but a succession of episodes which do not leave a general and unique impression it yet contrives to bring you so pleasantly acquainted with the splendid squalid poetic miserable italian life in milan and on its neighboring hills and lakes during the middle ages that you cannot help reading it to the end i suppose that this is the highest praise which can be bestowed upon an historical romance and that it implies great charm of narrative and beauty of style i can add that the feeling of grossis marco visconti is genuine and exalted and that its morality is blameless it has scarcely the right to be analyzed here however and should not have been more than mentioned but for the fact that it chances to be the setting of the authors best thing in verse i hope that even in my crude english version the artless pathos and sweet natural grace of one of the tenderest little songs in any tongue have not wholly perished  illustration tommaso grossi       the fair prisoner to the swallow      pilgrim swallow pilgrim swallow       on my grated windows sill     singing as the

thy roundelay  it is a great good fortune for a man to have written a thing so beautiful as this and not a singular fortune that he should have written nothing else comparable to it the like happens in all literatures and no one need be surprised to learn that i found the other poems of grossi often difficult and sometimes almost impossible to read  grossi was born in 1791 at bollano by lovely como whose hills and waters he remembers in all his works with constant affection he studied law at the university of pavia but went early to milan where he cultivated literature rather than the austerer science to which he had been bred and soon became the fashion writing tales in milanese and italian verse and making the women cry by his pathetic art of storytelling ildegonda published in 1820 was the most popular of all these tales and won grossi an immense number of admirers every one says his biographer cantù of the fair sex who began to wear ildegonda dresses and ildegonda bonnets the poem was printed and reprinted it is the heartbreaking story of a poor little maiden in the middle ages whom her father and brother shut up in a convent because she is in love with the right person and will not marry the wrong onea common thing in all ages the cruel abbess and wicked nuns by the order of ildegondas family try to force her to take the veil but she supported by her own repugnance to the cloister and by the secret counsels of one of the sisters with whom force had succeeded resists persuasion reproach starvation cold imprisonment and chains her lover attempts to rescue her by means of a subterranean vault under the convent but the plot is discovered and the unhappy pair are assailed by armed men at the very moment of escape ildegonda is dragged back to her dungeon and rizzardo already under accusation of heresy is quickly convicted and burnt at the stake they bring the poor girl word of this and her sick brain turns in her delirium she sees her lover in torment for his heresy and flying from the hideous apparition she falls and strikes her head against a stone she wakes in the arms of the beloved sister who had always befriended her the cruel efforts against her cease now and she writes to her father imploring his pardon which he gives with a prayer for hers at last she dies peacefully the story is pathetic and it is told with art though its lapses of taste are woful and its faults those of the whole class of italian poetry to which it belongs the agony is tedious as italian agony is apt to be the passion is outrageously violent or excessively tender the description too often prosaic the effects are sometimes produced by very rough magic the more than occasional infelicity and awkwardness of diction which offend in byrons poetic tales are not felt so much in those of grossi but in ildegonda there is horror more material even than in parisina here is a picture of rizzardos apparition for which my faint english has no stomach       chè dalla bocca fuori gli pendea     la coda smisurata d un serpente     e il flagellava per la faccia mentre     il capo e il tronco gli scendean nel ventre      fischia la biscia nell orribil lutta     entro il ventre profondo del dannato     che dalla bocca lacerata erutta     un torrente di sangue aggruppato     e bava gialla venenosa e brutta     dalle narici fuor manda col fiato     la qual pel mento giù gli cola e lassa     insolcata la carne ovunque passa  it seems to have been the fate of grossi as a poet to achieve fashion and not fame and his great poem in fifteen cantos called i lombardi alla prima crociata which made so great a noise in its day was eclipsed in reputation by his subsequent novel of marco visconti since the gerusalemma of tasso it is said that no poem has made so great a sensation in italy as i lombardi in which the theme treated by the elder poet is celebrated according to the aesthetics of the romantic school such parts of the poem as i have read have not tempted me to undertake the whole but many people must have at least bought it for it gave the author thirty thousand francs in solid proof of popularity  after the marco visconti grossi seems to have produced no work of importance he married late but happily and he now devoted himself almost exclusively to the profession of the law in milan where he died in 1853 leaving the memory of a good man and the fame of a poet unspotted by reproach as long as he lived he was the beloved friend of manzoni he dwelt many years under the influence of the stronger mind but not servile to it adopting its literary principles but giving them his own expression   iii  luigi carrer of venice was the first of that large number of minor poets and dramatists to which the states of the old republic have given birth during the present century his life began with our century and he died in 1850 during this time he witnessed great political eventsthe retirement of the french after the fall of napoleon the failure of all the schemes and hopes of the carbonarito shake off the yoke of the stranger and that revolution in 1848 which drove out the austrians only that a year later they should return in such force as to make the hope of venetian independence through the valor of venetian arms a vain dream forever there is not wanting evidence of a tender love of country in the poems of carrer and probably the effectiveness of the austrian system of repression rather than his own indifference is witnessed by the fact that he has scarcely a line to betray a hope for the future or a consciousness of political anomaly in the present  carrer was poor but the rich were glad to be his friends without putting him to shame and as long as the once famous conversazioni were held in the great venetian houses he was the star of whatever place assembled genius and beauty he had a professorship in a private school and while he was young he printed his verses in the journals as he grew older he wrote graceful books of prose and drew his slender support from their sale and from the minute pay of some offices in the gift of his native city  carrers ballads are esteemed the best of his poems and i may offer an idea of the quality and manner of some of his ballads by the following translation but i cannot render his peculiar elegance nor give the whole range of his fancy       the duchess       from the horrible profound       of the voiceless sepulcher     comes or seems to come a sound       ist his grace the duke astir     in his trance he hath been laid     as one dead among the dead      the relentless stone he tries       with his utmost strength to move     fails and in his fury cries       smiting his hands that those above     if any shall be passing there     hear his blasphemy or his prayer      and at last he seems to hear       light feet overhead go by     o whoever passes near       where i am the duke am i     all my states and all i have     to him that takes me from this grave      there is no one that replies       surely some one seemed to come     on his brow the cold sweat lies       as he waits an instant dumb     then he cries with broken breath     save me take me back from death      where thou liest lie thou must       prayers and curses alike are vain     over thee dead gismonds dust       whom thy pitiless hand hath slain     on this stone so heavily     rests we cannot set thee free      from the sepulchers thick walls       comes a low wail of dismay     and as when a body falls       a dull soundand the next day     in a convent the dukes wife     hideth her remorseful life  of course carrer wrote much poetry besides his ballads there are idyls and romances in verse and hymns sonnets of feeling and of occasion odes sometimes of considerable beauty apologues of such exceeding fineness of point that it often escapes one satires and essays or sermoni some of which i have read with no great relish the same spirit dominates nearly allthe spirit of pensive disappointment which life brings to delicate and sensitive natures and which they love to affect even more than they feel among carrers many sonnets i think i like best the following of which the sentiment seems to me simple and sweet and the expression very winning      i am a pilgrim swallow and i roam       beyond strange seas of other lands in quest     leaving the wellknown lakes and hills of home       and that dear roof where late i hung my nest     all things beloved and loves eternal woes       i fly an exile from my native shore     i cross the cliffs and woods but with me goes       the care i thought to abandon evermore     along the banks of streams unknown to me       i pipe the elms and willows pensive lays     and call on her whom i despair to see       and pass in banishment and tears my days     breathe air of spring for which i pine and yearn     that to his nest the swallow may return  the prose writings of carrer are essays on aesthetics and morals and sentimentalized history his chief work is of the latter nature i sette gemme di venezia are sketches of the lives of the seven venetian women who have done most to distinguish the name of their countrywomen by their talents or misfortunes or sins you feel in looking through the book that its interest is in great part factitious the stories are all expanded and filled up with facile but not very relevant discourse which a pleasant fancy easily supplies and which is always best left to the readers own thought the style is somewhat florid but the author contrives to retain in his fantastic strain much of the grace of simplicity it is the work of a cunning artist but it has a certain insipidity and it wearies carrer did well in the limit which he assigned himself but his range was circumscribed at the time of his death he had written sixteen cantos of an epic poem called la fata vergine which a venetian critic has extravagantly praised and which i have not seen he exercised upon the poetry of his day an influence favorable to lyric naturalness and his ballads were long popular   iv  giovanni berchet was a poet who alone ought to be enough to take from the lombard romanticists the unjust reproach of resignation where our poetry says de sanctis throws off every disguise romantic or classic is in the verse of berchet if giovanni berchet had remained in italy probably his genius would have remained enveloped in the allusions and shadows of romanticism but in his exile at london he uttered the sorrow and the wrath of his betrayed and vanquished country it was the accent of the national indignation which leaving the generalities of the sonnets and the ballads dramatized itself and portrayed our life in its most touching phases  berchets family was of french origin but he was the most italian of italians and nearly all his poems are of an ardent political tint and temperature naturally he spent a great part of his life in exile after the austrians were reestablished in milan he was some time in england and i believe he died in switzerland  i have most of his patriotic poems in a little book which is curiously historical of a situation forever past i picked it up i do not remember where or when in venice and as it is a collection of pieces all meant to embitter the spirit against austria it had doubtless not been brought into the city with the connivance of the police there is no telling where it was printed the mysterious date of publication being italy 1861 and nothing more with the english motto adieu my native land adieu  the principal poem here is called le fantasie and consists of a series of lyrics in which an italian exile contrasts the lombards who drove out frederick barbarossa in the twelfth century with the lombards of 1829 who crouched under the power defied of old it is full of burning reproaches sarcasms and appeals and it probably had some influence in renewing the political agitation which in italy followed the french revolution of 1830 other poems of berchet represent social aspects of the austrian rule like one entitled remorse which paints the isolation and wretchedness of an italian woman married to an austrian and another giulia which gives a picture of the frantic misery of an austrian conscription in italy a very impressive poem is that called the hermit of mt cenis a traveler reaches the summit of the pass and looking over upon the beauty and magnificence of the italian plains and seeing only their loveliness and peace his face is lighted up with an involuntary smile when suddenly the hermit who knows all the invisible disaster and despair of the scene suddenly accosts him with accursed be he who approaches without tears this home of sorrow  at the time the romantic school rose in italian literature say from 1815 till 1820 society was brilliant if not contented or happy in lombardy and venetia immediately after the treaties of the holy alliance had consigned these provinces to austria there flourished famous conversazioni at many noble houses in those of milan many distinguished literary men of other nations met byron and hobhouse were frequenters of the same salons as pellico manzoni and grossi the schlegels represented the german romantic school and madame de staël the sympathizing movement in france there was very much that was vicious still and very much that was ignoble in italian society but this was by sufferance and not as of old by approval and it appears that the tone of the highest life was intellectual it cannot be claimed that this tone was at all so general as the badness of the last century it was not so easily imitated as that and it could not penetrate so subtly into all ranks and conditions still it was very observable and mingled with it in many leading minds was the strain of religious resignation audible in manzonis poetry that was a time when the italians might if ever have adapted themselves to foreign rule but the austrians sofar from having learned political wisdom during the period of their expulsion from italy had actually retrograded from being passive authorities whom long sojourn was gradually italianizing they had in their absence become active and relentless tyrants and they now seemed to study how most effectually to alienate themselves they found out their error later but when too late to repair it and from 1820 until 1859 in milan and until 1866 in venice the hatred which they had themselves enkindled burned fiercer and fiercer against them it is not extravagant to say that if their rule had continued a hundred years longer the italians would never have been reconciled to it society took the form of habitual and implacable defiance to them the life of the whole people might be said to have resolved itself into a protest against their presence this hatred was the heritage of children from their parents the bond between friends the basis of social faith it was a thread even in the tie between lovers it was so intense and so pervasive that it cannot be spoken  berchet was the vividest if not the earliest expression of it in literature and the following poem which i have already mentioned is therefore not only intensely true to italian feeling but entirely realistic in its truth to a common fact       remorse      alone in the midst of the throng       mid the lights and the splendor alone     her eyes dropped for shame of her wrong       she lifts not to eyes she has known     around her the whirl and the stir       of the lightfooting dancers she hears     none seeks her no whisper for her       of the gracious words filling her ears      the fair boy that runs to her knees       with a shout for his mother and kiss     for the teardrop that welling he sees       to her eyes from her sorrows abyss     though he blooms like a rose the fair boy       no praise of his beauty is heard     none with him stays to jest or to toy       none to her gives a smile or a word      if unknowing one ask who may be       this woman that as in disgrace     oer the curls of the boy at her knee       bows her beautiful joyless face     a hundred tongues answer in scorn       a hundred lips teach him to know     wife of one of our tyrants forsworn       to her friends in her truth to their foe      at the play in the streets in the lanes       at the fane of the merciful god     midst a people in prison and chains       spyhaunted at home and abroad     steals through all like the hiss of a snake       hate by

practically dispersed by the austrian police after the carbonari disturbances in 182122 and the literary spirit of the nation took refuge under the mild and careless despotism of the grand dukes at florence  in 1821 austria was mistress of pretty near all italy she held in her own grasp the vast provinces of lombardy and venetia she had garrisons in naples piedmont and the romagna and rome was ruled according to her will but there is always something fatally defective in the vigilance of a policeman and in the very place which perhaps austria thought it quite needless to guard the restless and indomitable spirit of free thought entered it was in tuscany a fief of the holy roman empire reigned over by a family set on the grandducal throne by austria herself and united to her hapsburgs by many ties of blood and affectionin tuscany right under both noses of the doubleheaded eagle as it were that a new literary and political life began for italy the leopoldine code was famously mild toward criminals and the lorrainese princes did not show themselves crueler than they could help toward poets essayists historians philologists and that class of malefactors indeed it was the philosophy of their family to let matters alone and the grand duke restored after the fall of napoleon was as has been said an absolute monarch but he was also an honest man this galantuomo had even a minister who successfully combated the austrian influences and so though there were of course spies and a censorship in florence there was also indulgence and if it was not altogether a pleasant place for literary men to live it was at least tolerable and there they gathered from their exile and their silence throughout italy their point of union and their means of affecting the popular mind was for twelve years the critical journal entitled the antologia founded by that vieusseux who also opened those delightful and beneficent readingrooms whither we all rush as soon as we reach florence to look at the newspapers and magazines of our native land the antologia had at last the misfortune to offend the emperor of russia and to do that prince a pleasure the tuscan government suppressed it such being the international amenities when sovereigns really reigned in europe after the antologia there came another review published at leghorn but it was not so successful and in fact the conditions of literature gradually grew more irksome in tuscany until the violent liberation came in 48 and a little later the violent reënslavement  giambattista niccolini like nearly all the poets of his time and country was of noble birth his father being a cavaliere and holding a small government office at san giuliano near pistoja here in 1782 niccolini was born to very decided penury his father had only that little office and his income died with him the mother had nothingpossibly because she was descended from a poet the famous filicaja from his mother doubtless niccolini inherited his power and perhaps his patriotism but little or nothing is known of his early life it is certain merely that after leaving school he continued his studies in the university of pisa and that he very soon showed himself a poet his first published effort was a sort of lamentation over an epidemic that desolated tuscany in 1804 and this was followed by five or six pretty thoroughly forgotten tragedies in the classic or alfierian manner of these only the medea is still played but they all made a stir in their time and for another he was crowned by the accademia della crusca which i suppose does not mean a great deal the fact that niccolini early caught the attention and won the praises of ugo foscolo is more important there grew up indeed between the two poets such esteem that the elder at this time dedicated one of his books to the younger and their friendship continued through life  when elisa bonaparte was made queen of etruria by napoleon niccolini became secretary of the academy of fine arts and professor of history and mythology it is said that in the latter capacity he instilled into his hearers his own notions of liberty and civic virtue he was in truth a democrat and he suffered with the other jacobins as they were called in italy when the napoleonic governments were overthrown the benefits which the french revolution conferred upon the people of their conquered provinces when not very doubtful were still such as they were not prepared to receive and after the withdrawal of the french support all the italians through whom they had ruled fell a prey to the popular hate and contumely in those days when dynasties restored to their thrones after the lapse of a score of years ignored the intervening period and treated all its events as if they had no bearing upon the future it was thought the part of the true friends of order to resume the old fashions which went out with the old régime the queue or pigtail had always been worn when it was safe to wear it by the supporters of religion and good government from this fashion came the famous political nickname codino pigtailwearer or conservative which used to occur so often in italian talk and literature and now whoever appeared on the street without this emblem of loyalty and piety was in danger of public outrage a great many jacobins bowed their heads to the popular will and had pigtails sewed on thema device which the idle boys and other unemployed friends of legitimacy busied themselves in detecting they laid rude hands on this ornament singing      if the queue remains in your hand       a true republican is he     hurrah hurrah hurrah       give him a kick for liberty  it is related that the superficial and occasional character of niccolinis conversion was discovered by this test and that he underwent the apposite penalty he rebelled against the treatment he received and was arrested and imprisoned for his contumacy when ferdinando iii had returned and established his government on the letalone principle to which i have alluded the dramatist was made librarian of the palatine library at the pitti palace but he could not endure the necessary attendance at court where his politics were remembered against him by the courtiers and he gave up the place the grand duke was sorry and said so adding that he was perfectly contented your highness answered the poet in this case it takes two to be contented   ii  the first political tragedy of niccolini was the nebuchadnezzar which was printed in london in 1819 and figured under that scriptural disguise the career of napoleon after that came his antonio foscarini in which the poet who had heretofore been a classicist tried to reconcile that school with the romantic by violating the sacred unities in a moderate manner in his subsequent tragedies he seems not to have regarded them at all and to have been romantic as the most romantic lombard of them all could have asked of course his defection gave exquisite pain to the lovers of italian good taste as the classicists called themselves but these were finally silenced by the success of his tragedy the reader of it nowadays we suspect will think its success not very expensively achieved and it certainly has a main fault that makes it strangely disagreeable when the past was chiefly the affair of fable the storehouse of tradition it was well enough for the poet to take historical events and figures and fashion them in any way that served his purpose but this will not do in our modern daylight where a freedom with the truth is an offense against common knowledge and does not charm the fancy but painfully bewilders it at the best and at the second best is impudent and ludicrous in his tragedy niccolini takes two very familiar incidents of venetian history that of the foscari which byron has used and that of antonio foscarini who was unjustly hanged more than a hundred years later for privity to a conspiracy against the state whereas the attributive crime of jacopo foscari was the assassination of a fellowpatrician the poet is then forced to make the doge foscari do duty throughout as the father of foscarini the only doge of whose name served out his term very peaceably and died the author of an extremely dull official history of venetian literature foscarini who up to the time of his hanging was an honored servant of the state and had been ambassador to france is obliged on his part to undergo all of jacopo foscaris troubles and i have not been able to see why the poet should have vexed himself to make all this confusion and why the story of the foscari was not sufficient for his purpose in the tragedy there is much denunciation of the oligarchic oppression of the ten in venice and it may be regarded as the first of niccolinis dramatic appeals to the love of freedom and the manhood of the italians  it is much easier to understand the success of niccolinis subsequent drama lodovico il moro which is in many respects a touching and effective tragedy and the historical truth is better observed in it though as none of our race can ever love his country with that passionate and personal devotion which the italians feel we shall never relish the high patriotic flavor of the piece the story is simply that of giovangaleazzo sforza duke of milan whose uncle lodovico on pretense of relieving him of the cares of government has usurped the sovereignty and keeps galeazzo and his wife in virtual imprisonment the young duke wasting away with a slow but fatal malady to further his ambitious schemes in lombardy lodovico has called in charles viii of france who claims the crown of naples against the aragonese family and pauses on his way to naples at milan isabella wife of galeazzo appeals to charles to liberate them but reaches his presence in such an irregular way that she is suspected of treason both to her husband and to charles yet the king is convinced of her innocence and he places the sick duke under the protection of a french garrison and continues his march on naples lodovico has appeared to consent but by seeming to favor the popular leaders has procured the citizens to insist upon his remaining in power he has also secretly received the investiture from the emperor of germany to be published upon the death of galeazzo he now therefore defies the french galeazzo tormented by alternate hope and despair dies suddenly and lodovico throwing off the mask of a popular ruler puts the republican leaders to death and reigns the feudatory of the emperor the interest of the play is almost entirely political and patriotism is the chief passion involved the main personal attraction of the tragedy is in the love of galeazzo and his wife and in the character of the latter the dreamy languor of a hopeless invalid is delicately painted  the giovanni da procida was a further advance in political literature in this tragedy abandoning the indirectly liberal teachings of the foscarini niccolini set himself to the purpose of awakening a tuscan hatred of foreign rule the subject is the expulsion of the french from sicily and when the french ambassador complained to the austrian that such a play should be tolerated by the tuscan government the austrian answered the address is to the french but the letter is for the germans the giovanni da procida was a further development of niccolinis political purposes in literature and at the time of its first representation it raised the florentines to a frenzy of theatergoing patriotism the tragedy ends with the terrible sicilian vespers but its main affair is with preceding events largely imagined by the poet and the persons are in great part fictitious yet they all bear a certain relation to fact and the historical persons are more or less historically painted giovanni da procida a great sicilian nobleman believed dead by the french comes home to palermo after long exile to stir up the sicilians to rebellion and finds that his daughter is married to the son of one of the french rulers though neither this daughter imelda nor her husband tancredi knew the origin of the latter at the time of their marriage precida in his allabsorbing hate of the oppressors cannot forgive them yet he seizes tancredi and imprisons him in his castle in order to save his life from the impending massacre of the french and in a scene with imelda he tells her that while she was a babe the father of tancredi had abducted her mother and carried her to france years after she returned heartbroken to die in her husbands arms a secret which she tries to reveal perishing with her while imelda remains horrorstruck by this history procida receives an intercepted letter from eriberto tancredis father in which he tells the young man that he and imelda are children of the same mother procida in pity of his daughter the victim of this awful fatality prepares to send her away to a convent in pisa but a french law forbids any ship to sail at that time and imelda is brought back and confronted in a public place with tancredi who has been rescued by the french  he claims her as his wife but she filled with the horror of what she knows declares that he is not her husband it is the moment of the vespers and tancredi falls among the first slain by the sicilians he implores imelda for a last kiss but wildly answering that they are brother and sister she swoons away while tancredi dies in this climax of selfloathing and despair the management of a plot so terrible is very simple the feelings of the characters in the hideous maze which involves them are given only such expression as should come from those utterly broken by their calamity imelda swoons when she hears the letter of eriberto declaring the fatal tie of blood that binds her to her husband and forever separates her from him when she is restored she finds her father weeping over her and says                   ah thou dost look on me     and weep at least this comfort i can feel     in the horror of my state thou canst not hate     a woman so unhappy       oh from all     be hid the atrocity to some holy shelter     let me be taken far from hence i feel     naught can be more than my calamity     saving gods pity i have no father now     nor child nor husband heavens what do i say     he is my brother now and well i know     i must not ask to see him more i living lose     everything death robs other women of  by far the greater feeling and passion are shown in the passages describing the wrongs which the sicilians have suffered from the french and expressing the aspiration and hate of procida and his fellowpatriots niccolini does not often use pathos and he is on that account perhaps the more effective in the use of it however this may be i find it very touching when after coming back from his long exile procida says to imelda who is trembling for the secret of her marriage amidst her joy in his return                        daughter art thou still       so sad i have not heard yet from thy lips       a word of the old love            ah thou knowest not       what sweetness hath the natal spot how many       the longings exile hath how heavyt is       to arrive at doors of homes where no one waits thee       imelda thou mayst abandon thine own land       but not forget her i a pilgrim saw       many a city but none among them had       a memory that spoke unto my heart       and fairer still than any other seemed       the country whither still my spirit turned  in a vein as fierce and passionate as this is tender procida relates how returning to sicily when he was believed dead by the french he passed in secret over the island and inflamed italian hatred of the foreigners                        i sought the pathless woods     and drew the cowards thence and made them blush     and then made fury follow on their shame     i hailed the peasant in his fertile fields     where neath the burden of the cruel tribute     he dropped from famine midst the harvest sheaves     with his starved brood open thou with thy scythe     the breasts of frenchmen let the earth no more     be fertile to our tyrants i found my way     in palaces in hovels tranquil i     both great and lowly did make drunk with rage     i knew the art to call forth cruel tears     in every eye to wake in every heart     a love of slaughter a ferocious need     of blood and in a thousand strong right hands     glitter the arms i gave  in the last act occurs one of those lyrical passages in which niccolini excels and two lines from this chorus are among the most famous in modern italian poetry      perchè tanto sorriso del cielo     sulla terra del vile dolor  the scene is in a public place in palermo and the time is the moment before the massacre of the french begins a chorus of sicilian poets remind the people of their sorrows and degradation and sing      the wind vexes the forest no longer     in the sunshine the leaflets expand     with barrenness cursed be the land     that is bathed with the sweat of the slave      on the fields now the harvests are waving     on the fields that our blood has made red     harvests grown for our enemys bread     from the bones of our children they wave      with a veil of black clouds would the tempest     might the face of this italy cover     why should heaven smile so glorious over     the land of our infamous woe      all nature is suddenly wakened     here in slumbers unending man sleeps     dust trod evermore by the steps     of everstrange lords he lies low   illustration giambattista niccolini  with this tragedy says an italian biographer of niccolini the poet potently touched all chords of the human heart from the most impassioned love to the most implacable hate the enthusiasm rose to the greatest height and for as many nights of the severe winter of 1830 as the tragedy was given the theater was always thronged by the overflowing audience the doors of the cocomero were opened to the impatient people many hours before the spectacle began spectators thought themselves fortunate to secure a seat next the roof of the theater even in the prompters hole note on the italian stage the prompter rises from a hole in the floor behind the footlights and is hidden from the audience merely by a canvas shade places were sought to witness the admired work and whilst they wept over the illstarred love of imelda and all hearts palpitated in the touching situation of the dramawhere the public and the personal interests so wonderfully blended and the vengeance of a people mingled with that of a man outraged in the most sacred affections of the heartprocida rose terrible as the billows of his sea imprecating before all the wrongs of their oppressed country in whatever servitude inflicted by whatever aliens among all those that had trampled derided and martyred her and raising the cry of resistance which stirred the heart of all italy at the picture of the abject sufferings of their common country the whole audience rose and repeated with tears of rage     why should heaven smile so glorious over     the land of our infamous woe  by the year 1837 had begun the singular illusion of the italians that their freedom and unity were to be accomplished through a liberal and patriotic pope niccolini however never was cheated by it though he was very much disgusted and he retired not only from the political agitation but almost from the world he was seldom seen upon the street but to those who had access to him he did not fail to express all the contempt and distrust he felt a liberal pope a liberal pope he said with a scornful enjoyment of that contradiction in terms he was thoroughly florentine and tuscan in his antipapal spirit and he was faithful in it to the tradition of dante petrarch machiavelli guicciardini and alfieri who all doubted and combated the papal influence as necessarily fatal to italian hopes in 1843 he published his great and principal tragedy arnaldo da brescia which was a response to the ideas of the papal school of patriots in due time pius ix justified niccolini and all others that distrusted him by turning his back upon the revolution which belief in him more than anything else had excited  the tragedies which succeeded the arnaldo were the filippo strozzi published in 1847 the beatrice cenci a version from the english of shelley and the mario e i cimbri  a part of the arnaldo da brescia was performed in florence in 1858 not long before the war which has finally established italian freedom the name of the cocomero theater had been changed to the teatro niccolini and in spite of the governmental anxiety and opposition the occasion was made a popular demonstration in favor of niccolinis ideas as well as himself his biographer says the audience now maintained a religious silence now moved by irresistible force broke out into uproarious applause as the eloquent protests of the friar and the insolent responses of the pope awakened their interest for italy then like the unhappy martyr had risen to proclaim the decline of that monstrous power which in the name of a religion profaned by it sanctifies its own illegitimate and feudal origin its abuses its pride its vices its crimes it was a beautiful and affecting spectacle to see the illustrious poet receiving the warm congratulations of his fellowcitizens who enthusiastically recognized in him the utterer of so many lofty truths and the prophet of italy that night niccolini was accompanied to his house by the applauding multitude and if all this was a good deal like the honors the florentines were accustomed to pay to a very pretty ballerina or a successful prima donna there is no doubt that a poet is much worthier the popular frenzy and it is a pity that the forms of popular frenzy have to be so cheapened by frequent use the two remaining years of niccolinis life were spent in great retirement and in a satisfaction with the fortunes of italy which was only marred by the fact that the french still remained in rome and that the temporal power yet stood he died in 1861   iii  the work of niccolini in which he has poured out all the lifelong hatred and distrust he had felt for the temporal power of the popes is the arnaldo da brescia this we shall best understand through a sketch of the life of arnaldo who is really one of the most heroic figures of the past deserving to rank far above savonarola and with the leaders of the reformation though he preceded these nearly four hundred years he was born in brescia of lombardy about the year 1105 and was partly educated in france in the school of the famous abelard he early embraced the ecclesiastical life and when he returned to his own country entered a convent but not to waste his time in idleness and the corruptions of his order in fact he began at once to preach against these and against the usurpation of temporal power by all the great and little dignitaries of the church he thus identified himself with the democratic side in politics which was then locally arrayed against the bishop aspiring to rule brescia arnaldo denounced the political power of the pope as well as that of the prelates and the bishop making this known to the pontiff at rome had sufficient influence to procure a sentence against arnaldo as a schismatic and an order enjoining silence upon him he was also banished from italy whereupon retiring to france he got himself into further trouble by aiding abelard in the defense of his teachings which had been attainted of heresy both abelard and arnaldo were at this time bitterly persecuted by st bernard and arnaldo took refuge in switzerland whence after several years he passed to rome and there began to assume an active part in the popular movements against the papal rule he was an ardent republican and was a useful and efficient partisan teaching openly that whilst the pope was to be respected in all spiritual things he was not to be recognized at all as a temporal prince when the english monk nicholas breakspear became pope adrian iv he excommunicated and banished arnaldo but arnaldo protected by the senate and certain powerful nobles remained at rome in spite of the popes decree and disputed the lawfulness of the excommunication finally the whole city was laid under interdict until arnaldo should be driven out holy week was drawing near the people were eager to have their churches thrown open and to witness the usual shows and splendors and they consented to the exile of their leader the followers of a cardinal arrested him but he was rescued by his friends certain counts of the campagna who held him for a saint and who now lodged him safely in one of their castles the emperor frederick barbarossa coming to rome to assume the imperial crown was met by embassies from both parties in the city he warmly favored that of the pope and not only received that of the people very coldly but arrested one of the counts who had rescued arnaldo and forced him to name the castle in which the monk lay concealed arnaldo was then given into the hands of the cardinals and these delivered him to the prefect of rome who caused him to be hanged his body to be burned upon a spit and his ashes to be scattered in the tiber that the people might not venerate his relics as those of a saint this happened says the priest giovanni battista guadagnini of brescia whose life published in 1790 i have made use ofthis happened in the year 1155 before the 18th of june previous to the coronation of frederick arnaldo being according to my thinking fifty years of age his eloquence continues guadagnini was celebrated by his enemies themselves the exemplarity of his life was superior to their malignity constraining them all to silence although they were in such great number and it received a splendid eulogy from st bernard the luminary of that century who being strongly impressed against him condemned him first as a schismatic and then for the affair of the council of sens the defense of abelard persecuted him as a heretic and then had finally nothing to say against him his courage and his zeal for the discipline of the church have been sufficiently attested by the toils the persecutions and the death which he underwent for that cause   iv  the scene of the first act of niccolinis tragedy is near the capitoline hill in rome where two rival leaders frangipani and giordano pierleone are disputing in the midst of their adherents the former is a supporter of the papal usurpations the latter is a republican chief who has been excommunicated for his politics and is also under sentence of banishment but who like arnaldo remains in rome in spite of church and state giordano withdraws to the campidôglio with his adherents and there arnaldo suddenly appears among them when the people ask what cure there is for their troubles arnaldo answers in denunciation of the papacy                  liberty and god     a voice from the orient     a voice from the occident     a voice from thy deserts     a voice of echoes from the open graves     accuses thee thou shameless harlot drunk     art thou with blood of saints and thou hast lain     with all the kings of earth ah you behold her     she is clothed on with purple gold and pearls     and gems are heaped upon her and her vestments     once white the pleasure of her former spouse     that nows in heaven she has dragged in dust     lo is she full of names and blasphemies     and on her brow is written mystery     ah nevermore you hear her voice console     the afflicted all she threatens and creates     with her perennial curse in trembling souls     ineffable pangs the unhappyas we here     are all of usfly in their common sorrows     to embrace each other she the cruel one     sunders them in the name of jesus fathers     she kindles against sons and wives she parts     from husbands and she makes a war between     harmonious brothers of the evangel she     is cruel interpreter and teaches hate     out of the book of love the years are come     whereof the rapt evangelist of patmos     did prophesy and to deceive the people     satan has broken the chains he bore of old     and she the cruel on the infinite waters     of tears that are poured out for her sits throned     the enemy of man two goblets places     unto her shameless lips and one is blood     and gold is in the other greedy and fierce     she drinks so from them both the world knows not     if she of blood or gold have greater thirst     lord those that fled before thy scourge of old     no longer stand to barter offerings     about thy temples borders but within     mans self is sold and thine own blood is trafficked     thou son of god  the people ask arnaldo what he counsels them to do and he advises them to restore the senate and the tribunes appealing to the glorious memories of the place where they stand the capitoline hill      where the earth calls at every step oh pause     thou treadest on a hero  they desire to make him a tribune but he refuses promising however that he will not withhold his counsel whilst he speaks some cardinals with nobles of the papal party appear and announce the election of the new pope adrian what is his name the people demand and a cardinal answers breakspear a briton giordano exclaims      impious race youve chosen rome for shepherd     a cruel barbarian and even his name     tortures our ears      arnaldo i never care to ask     where popes are born and from long suffering     you romans before heaven should have learnt     that priests can have no country     i know this man his father was a thrall     and he is fit to be a slave he made     friends with the norman that enslaves his country     a wandering beggar to avignons cloisters     he came in boyhood and was known to do     all abject services there those false monks     he with astute humility cajoled     he learned their arts and mid intrigues and hates     he rose at last out of his native filth     a tyrant of the vile  the cardinals confounded by arnaldos presence and invectives withdraw but leave one of their party to work on the fears of the romans and make them return to their allegiance by pictures of the desolating war which barbarossa now approaching rome to support adrian has waged upon the rebellious lombards at rosate and elsewhere arnaldo replies                                          romans     i will tell all the things that he has hid     i know not how to cheat you yes rosate     a ruin is from which the smoke ascends     the bishop lord of monferrato guided     the german arms against chieri and asti     now turned to dust that shepherd pitiless     did thus avenge his own offenses on     his flying flocks himself with torches armed     the german hand houses and churches saw     destroyed and gave his blessing on the flames     this is the pardon that you may expect     from mitered tyrants a heap of ashes now     crowneth the hill where once tortona stood     and drunken with her wine and with her blood     fallen there amidst their spoil upon the dead     slept the wild beasts of germany like ghosts     dim wandering through the darkness of the night     those that were left by famine and the sword     hidden within the heart of thy dim caverns     desolate city rose and turned their steps     noiselessly toward compassionate milan     there they have borne their swords and hopes i see     a thousand heroes born from the example     tortona gave o city if i could     o sacred city upon the ruins fall     reverently and take them in my loving arms     the relics of thy brave id gather up     in precious urns and from the altars here     in days of battle offer to be kissed     oh praise be to the lord men die no more     for chains and errors martyrs now at last     hast thou o holy freedom and fain were i     ashes for theebut i see you grow pale     ye romans down go down this holy height     is not for cowards  in the valley there     your tyrant waits you go and fall before him     and cover his haughty foot with tears and kisses     hell tread you in the dust and then absolve you      the people the arms we have are strange and few     our walls are fallen and ruinous      arnaldo           their hearts are walls     unto the brave                          and they shall rise again     the walls that blood of freemen has baptized     but among slaves their ruins are eternal      people you outrage us sir      arnaldo               wherefore do ye tremble     before the trumpet sounds o thou that wast     once the worlds lord and first in italy     wilt thou be now the last      people no more  cease or thou diest  arnaldo having roused the pride of the romans now tells them that two thousand swiss have followed him from his exile and the act closes with some lyrical passages leading to the fraternization of the people with these  the second act of this curious tragedy where there may be said to be scarcely any personal interest but where we are aware of such an impassioned treatment of public interests as perhaps never was before opens with a scene between the pope adrian and the cardinal guido the character of both is finely studied by the poet and guido the type of ecclesiastical submission has not more faith in the sacredness and righteousness of adrian than adrian the type of ecclesiastical ambition has in himself the pope tells guido that he stands doubting between the cities of lombardy leagued against frederick and frederick who is coming to rome not so much to befriend the papacy as to place himself in a better attitude to crush the lombards the german dreams of the restoration of charlemagnes empire he believes the church corrupt and he and arnaldo would be friends if it were not for arnaldos vain hope of reëstablishing the republican liberties of rome the pope utters his ardent desire to bring arnaldo back to his allegiance and when guido reminds him that arnaldo has been condemned by a council of the church and that it is scarcely in his power to restore him adrian turns upon him                             what sayest thou     i can do all dare the audacious members     rebel against the head within these hands     lie not the keys that once were given to peter     the heavens repeat as t were the word of god     my word that here has power to loose and bind     arnaldo did not dare so much the kingdom     of earth alone he did deny me thou     art more outside the church than he      guido kneeling at adrians feet o god     i erred forgive i rise not from thy feet     till thou absolve me my zeal blinded me     im clay before thee shape me as thou wilt     a vessel apt to glory or to shame  guido then withdraws at the popes bidding in order to send a messenger to arnaldo and adrian utters this fine soliloquy      at every step by which ive hither climbed     ive found a sorrow but upon the summit     all sorrows are and thorns more thickly spring     around my chair than ever round a throne     what weary toil to keep up from the dust     this mantle thats weighed down the strongest limbs     these splendid gems that blaze in my tiara     they are a fire that burns the aching brow     i lift with many tears o lord to thee     yet i must fear not he that did know how     to bear the cross so heavy with the sins     of all the world will succor the weak servant     that represents his power here on earth     of mine own isle that make the light o the sun     obscure as one day was my lot amidst     the furious tumults of this guilty rome     here under the superb effulgency     of burning skies i think of you and weep  the popes messenger finds arnaldo in the castle of giordano where these two are talking of the present fortunes and future chances of rome the patrician forebodes evil from the approach of the emperor but arnaldo encourages him and when the popes messenger appears he is eager to go to adrian believing that good to their cause will come of it giordano in vain warns him against treachery bidding him remember that adrian will hold any falsehood sacred that is used with a heretic it is observable throughout that niccolini is always careful to make his rebellious priest a good catholic and now arnaldo rebukes giordano for some doubts of the spiritual authority of the pope when giordano says      these modern pharisees upon the cross     where christ hung dying once have nailed mankind  arnaldo answers      he will know how to save that rose and conquered  and giordano replies      yes christ arose but freedom cannot break     the stone that shuts her ancient sepulcher     for on it stands the altar  adrian when arnaldo appears before him bids him fall down and kiss his feet and speak to him as to god he will hear arnaldo only as a penitent arnaldo answers                                     the feet     of his disciples did that meek one kiss     whom here thou representest but i hear     now from thy lips the voice of fiercest pride     repent o peter that deniest him     and near the temple art but far from god                                                                    the name of the king     is never heard in rome and if thou are     the vicar of christ on earth well shouldst thou know     that of thorns only was the crown he wore      adrian he gave to me the empire of the earth     when this great mantly i put on and took     the churchs high seat i was chosen to     the word of god did erst create the world     and now mine guides it wouldst thou that the soul     should serve the body thou dost dream of freedom     and makest war on him who sole on earth     can shield man from his tyrants o arnaldo     be wise believe me all thy words are vain     vain sound that perish or disperse themselves     amidst the wilderness of rome i only     can speak the words that the whole world repeats      arnaldo thy words were never freedoms placed between     the people and their tyrants still the church     with the weak cruel with the mighty vile     has been and crushed in pitiless embraces     that emperors and pontiffs have exchanged     man has been ever                                           why seekst thou empire here and great on earth     art mean in heaven ah vainly in thy prayer     thou criest let the heart be lifted up     t is ever bowed to earth                                                              now then if thou wilt     put forth the power that thou dost vaunt repress     the crimes of bishops make the church ashamed     to be a stepmother to the poor and lowly     in all the lombard cities every priest     has grown a despot in shrewd perfidy     now siding with the church now with the empire     they have dainty food magnificent apparel     lascivious joys and on their altars cold     gathers the dust where lies the miter dropt     forgotten from the haughty brow that wears     the helmet and no longer bows itself     before gods face in th empty sanctuaries     but upon the fields of slaughter smoking still     bends oer the fallen foe and aims the blows     o th sacrilegious sword with cruel triumph     insulting oer the prayers of dying men     there the priest rides oer breasts of fallen foes     and stains with blood his coursers iron heel     when comes a brief false peace and wearily     amidst the havoc doth the priest sit down     his pleasures are a crime and after rapine     luxury follows like a thief he climbs     into the fold and that desired by day     he dares amid the dark and violence     is the priests marriage vainly did rome hope     that they had thrown aside the burden vile     of the desires that weigh down other men     theirs is the ungrateful lust of the wild beast     that doth forget the mother nor knows the child      on the altar of christ     who is the prince of pardon and of peace     vows of revenge are registered and torches     that are thrown into hearts of leaguered cities     are lit from tapers burning before god     become thou king of sacrifice ascend     the holy hill of god on these perverse     launch thou thy thunderbolts and feared again     and great thou wilt be tell me adrian     must thou not bear a burden that were heavy     even for angels wherefore wilt thou join     death unto life and make the word of god     that says my kingdom is not of this world     a lie oh follow christs example here     in rome it pleased both god and her     to abase the proud and to uplift the weak     ill kiss the foot that treads on kings      adrian                       arnaldo     i parley not i rule and i become     on earth as god in heaven am judge of all     and none of me i watch and i dispense     terrors and hopes rewards and punishments     to peoples and to kings fountain and source     of life am i who make the church of god     one and allpowerful many thrones and peoples     she has seen tost upon the madding waves     of time and broken on the immovable rock     whereon she sits and since one errless spirit     rules in her evermore she doth not rave     for changeful doctrine but she keeps eternal     the grandeur of her will and purposes       arnaldo     thou movest me to pity in vain thou seekst     to warm thy heart over these ruins groping     among the sepulchers of rome thoult find     no bones to which thou canst say rise ah here     remaineth not one heros dust thou thinkest     that with old names old virtues shall return     and thou desirest tribunes senators     equestrian orders rome a greater glory     thy sovereign pontiff is who doth not guard     the rights uncertain of a crazy rabble     but tribune of the world he sits in rome     and i forbid to kings and peoples cries     i tell thee a greater than the impious power     that thou in vain endeavorest to renew     here built the dying fisherman of judea     out of his blood he made a fatherland     for all the nations and this place that once     a city was became a world the borders     that did divide the nations by christs law     are taen away and this the kingdom is     for which he asked his father in his prayer     the church has sons in every race i rule     an unseen king and rome is everywhere      arnaldo thou errest adrian romes thunderbolts     wake little terror now and reason shakes     the bonds that thou fain wouldst were everlasting       christ calls to her     as of old to the sick man rise and walk     she ll tread on you if you go not before     the world has other truth besides the altars     it will not have a temple that hides heaven     thou wast a shepherd be a father the race     of man is weary of being called a flock  adrians final reply is that if arnaldo will renounce his false doctrine and leave rome the pope will through him give the lombard cities a liberty that shall not offend the church arnaldo refuses and quits adrians presence it is quite needless to note the bold character of the thought here or the nobility of the poetry which niccolini puts as well into the mouth of the pope whom he hates as the monk whom he loves  following this scene is one of greater dramatic force in which the cardinal guido sent to the campidoglio by the pope to disperse the popular assembly is stoned by the people and killed he dies full of faith in the church and the righteousness of his cause and his body taken up by the priests is carried into the square before st peters a throng including many women has followed and now niccolini introduces a phase of the great italian struggle which was perhaps the most perplexing of all the subjection of the women to the priests is what has always greatly contributed to defeat italian efforts for reform it now helps to unnerve the roman multitude and the poet finally makes it the weakness through which arnaldo is dealt his death with a few strokes in the scene that follows the death of guido he indicates the remorse and dismay of the people when the pope repels them from the church door and proclaims the interdict and then follow some splendid lyrical passages in which the pope commands the pictures and images to be veiled and the relics to be concealed and curses the enemies of the church i shall but poorly render this curse by a rhymeless translation and yet i am tempted to give it      the pope today let the perfidious     learn at thy name to tremble     nor triumph oer the ruinous     place of thy vanished altars     oh brief be their days and uncertain     in the desert their wandering footsteps     every tremulous leaflet affright them      the cardinals anathema anathema anathema      pope may their widows sit down mid the ashes     on the hearths of their desolate houses     with their little ones wailing around them      cardinals anathema anathema anathema      pope may he who was born to the fury     of heaven afar from his country     be lost in his ultimate anguish      cardinals anathema anathema anathema      pope may he fly to the house of the alien oppressor     that is filled with the spoil of his brothers with women     destroyed by the pitiless hands that defiled them     there in accents unknown and derided abase him     at portals neer opened in mercy imploring     a morsel of bread      cardinals       be that morsel denied him      pope i hear the wicked cry i from the lord     will fly away with swift and tireless feet     his anger follows me upon the sea     ill seek the desert who will give me wings     in cloudy horror who shall lead my steps     the eye of god maketh the night as day                 o brothers fulfill then                 the terrible duty                 throw down from the altars                 the dimburning tapers     and be all joy and be the love of god     in thankless hearts that know not peter quenched     as is the little flame that falls and dies     here in these tapers trampled under foot   in the first scene of the third act which is a desolate place in the campagna near the sea arnaldo appears he has been expelled from rome by the people eager for the opening of their churches and he soliloquizes upon his fate in language that subtly hints all his passing moods and paints the struggle of his soul it appears to me that it is a wise thing to make him almost regret the cloister in the midst of his hatred of it and then shrink from that regret with horror and there is also a fine sense of night and loneliness in the scene                               like this sand     is life itself and evermore each path     is traced in suffering and one footprint still     obliterates another and we are all     vain shadows here that seem a little while     and suffer and pass let me not fight in vain     o son of god with thine immortal word     yon tyrant of eternity and time     who doth usurp thy place on earth whose feet     are in the depths whose head is in the clouds     who thunders all abroad the world is mine     laws virtues liberty i have attempted     to give thee rome ah only where death is     abides thy glory here the laurel only     flourishes on the ruins and the tombs     i will repose upon this fallen column     my weary limbs ah lower than this ye lie     you latin souls and to your ancient height     who shall uplift you i am all weighed down     by the great trouble of the lofty hopes     of italy still deluded and i find     within my soul a drearer desert far     than this where the air already darkens round     and the soft notes of distant convent bells     announce the coming night i cannot hear them     without a trembling wish that in my heart     wakens a memory that becomes remorse     ah reason soon thou languishest in us     accustomed to such outrage all our lives     thou knowst the cloister thou a youth didst enter     that sepulcher of the living where is war     remember it and shudder the damp wind     stirs this gray hair im near the sea     thy silence is no more sweet on the ear     cometh the faroff murmur of the floods     in the vast desert now no more the darkness     imprisons wholly now less gloomily     lowers the sky that lately threatened storm     less thick the air is and the trembling light     o the stars among the breaking clouds appears     praise to the lord the eternal harmony     of all his work i feel though these vague beams     reveal to me here only fens and tombs     my soul is not so heavily weighed down     by burdens that oppressed it     i rise to grander purposes mans tents     are here below his city is in heaven     i doubt no more the terror of the cloister     no longer assails me  presently giordano comes to join arnaldo in this desolate place and in the sad colloquy which follows tells him of the events of rome and the hopelessness of their cause unless they have the aid and countenance of the emperor he implores arnaldo to accompany the embassy which he is about to send to frederick but arnaldo with a melancholy disdain refuses he asks where are the swiss who accompanied him to rome and he is answered by one of the swiss captains who at that moment appears the emperor has ordered them to return home under penalty of the ban of the empire he begs arnaldo to return with them but arnaldo will not and giordano sends him under a strong escort to the castle of ostasio arnaldo departs with much misgiving for the wife of ostasio is adelasia a bigoted papist who has hitherto resisted the teaching to which her husband has been converted  as the escort departs the returning swiss are seen one of their leaders expresses the fear that moves them when he says that the germans will desolate their homes if they do not return to them moreover the italian sun which destroys even those born under it drains their life and man and nature are leagued against them there what have you known here he asks and his soldiers reply in chorus      the pride of old names the caprices of fate     in vast desert spaces the silence of death     or in misthidden lowlands his wandering fires     no sweet song of birds no heartcheering sound     but eternal memorials of ancient despair     and ruins and tombs that waken dismay     at the moan of the pines that are stirred by the wind     full of dark and mysterious peril the woods     no lifegiving fountains but only bare sands     or some deepbedded river that silently moves     with a wave that is livid and stagnant between     its margins ungladdened by grass or by flowers     and in sterile sands vanishes wholly away     out of huts that by turns have been shambles and tombs     all pallid and naked and burned by their fevers     the peasant folk suddenly stare as you pass     with visages ghastly and eyes full of hate     aroused by the accent thats strange to their ears     oh heavily hang the clouds here on the head     wan and sick is the earth and the sun is a tyrant  then one of the swiss soldiers speaks alone      the unconquerable love of our own land     draws us away till we behold again     the eternal walls the almighty builded there     upon the arid ways of faithless lands     i am tormented by a tender dream     of that sweet rill which runs before my cot     oh let me rest beside the smiling lake     and hear the music of familiar words     and on its lonely margin wild and fair     lie down and think of my beloved ones  there is no page of this tragedy which does not present some terrible or touching picture which is not full of brave and robust thought which has not also great dramatic power but i am obliged to curtail the proof of this and i feel that after all i shall not give a complete idea of the tragedys grandeur its subtlety its vast scope and meaning  there is a striking dialogue between a roman partisan of arnaldo who with his fancy oppressed by the heresy of his cause is wavering in his allegiance and a brescian whom the outrages of the priests have forever emancipated from faith in their power to bless or ban in the world to come then ensues a vivid scene in which a fanatical and insolent monk of arnaldos order leading a number of soldiers arrests him by command of adrian ostasios soldiers approaching to rescue him the monk orders him to be slain but he is saved and the act closes with the triumphal chorus of his friends here is fine occasion for the play of different passions and the occasion is not lost  with the fourth act is introduced the new interest of the german oppression and as we have had hitherto almost wholly a study of the effect of the papal tyranny upon italy we are now confronted with the shame and woe which the empire has wrought her exiles from the different lombard cities destroyed by barbarossa meet on their way to seek redress from the pope and they pour out their sorrows in pathetic and passionate lyrics to read these passages gives one a favorable notion of the liberality or the stupidity of the government which permitted the publication of the tragedy the events alluded to were many centuries past the empire had long ceased to be but the italian hatred of the germans was one and indivisible for every moment of all times and we may be sure that to each of niccolinis readers these mediaeval horrors were but masks for cruelties exercised by the austrians in his own day and that in those lyrical bursts of rage and grief there was full utterance for his smothered sense of present wrong there is a great charm in these strophes they add unspeakable pathos to a drama which is so largely concerned with political interests and they make us feel that it is a beautiful and noble work of art as well as grand appeal to the patriotism of the italians and the justice of mankind  when we are brought into the presence of barbarossa we find him awaiting the arrival of adrian who is to accompany him to rome and crown him emperor in return for the aid that barbarossa shall give in reducing the rebellious citizens and delivering arnaldo into the power of the papacy heralds come to announce adrians approach and riding forth a little way frederick dismounts in order to go forward on foot and meet the pope who advances preceded by his clergy and attended by a multitude of his partisans as frederick perceives the pope and quits his horse he muses                                 i leave thee     o faithful comrade mine in many perils     thou generous steed and now upon the ground     that should have thundered under thine advance     with humble foot i silent steps must trace     but what do i behold toward us comes     with tranquil pride the servant of the lowly     upon a white horse docile to the rein     as he would kings were all about the path     that adrian moves on warriors and people     of either sex all ages in blind homage     mingle press near and fall upon the ground     or one upon another and man whom god     made to look up to heaven becomes as dust     under the feet of pride and they believe     the gates of paradise would be set wide     to any one whom his steed crushed to death     with me thou never hast thine empire shared     thou alone holdst the world he will not turn     on me in sign of greeting that proud head     encircled by the tiara and he sees     like god all under him in murmured prayer     or silence blesses them and passes on     what wonder if he will not deign to touch     the earth i tread on with his haughty foot     he gives it to be kissed of kings i too     must stoop to the vile act  since the time of henry ii it had been the custom of the emperors to lead the popes horse by the bridle and to hold his stirrup while he descended adrian waits in vain for this homage from frederick and then alights with the help of his ministers and seats himself in his episcopal chair while frederick draws near saying aside      i read there in his face his insolent pride     veiled by humility  he bows before adrian and kisses his foot and then offers him the kiss of peace which adrian refuses and haughtily reminds him of the fate of henry frederick answers furiously that the thought of this fate has always filled him with hatred of the papacy and adrian perceiving that he has pressed too far in this direction turns and soothes the emperor                                  i am truth     and thou art force and if thou partst from me     blind thou becomest helpless i remain     we are but one at last                                 caesar and peter     they are the heights of god man from the earth     contemplates them with awe and never questions     which thrusts its peak the higher into heaven     therefore be wise and learn from the example     of impious arnaldo hes the foe     of thrones who wars upon the altar  but he strives in vain to persuade frederick to the despised act of homage and it is only at the intercession of the emperors kinsmen and the german princes that he consents to it when it is done in the presence of all the army and the clerical retinue adrian mounts and says to frederick with scarcely hidden irony                           in truth thou art     an apt and ready squire and thou hast held     my stirrup firmly take then o my son     the kiss of peace for thou hast well fulfilled     all of thy duties  but frederick crying aloud and fixing the sense of the multitude upon him answers                       nay not all o father     princes and soldiers hear i have done homage     to peter not to him  the church and the empire being now reconciled frederick receives the ambassadors of the roman republic with scorn he outrages all their pretensions to restore rome to her old freedom and renown insults their prayer that he will make her his capital and heaps contempt upon the weakness and vileness of the people they represent giordano replies for them                      when will you dream     you germans in your thousand stolid dreams     the fume of drunkennessa future greater     than our romes memories never be her banner     usurped by you in prison and in darkness     was born your eagle that did but descend     upon the helpless prey of roman dead     but never dared to try the ways of heaven     with its weak vision wounded by the sun     ye prate of germany the whole world conspired     and even more in vain to work us harm     before that day when the world being conquered     rome slew herself       of mans great brotherhood     unworthy still ye change not with the skies     in italy the germans fate was ever     to grow luxurious and continue cruel  the soldiers of barbarossa press upon giordano to kill him and frederick saves the ambassadors with difficulty and hurries them away  in the first part of the fifth act niccolini deals again with the rôle which woman has played in the tragedy of italian history the hopes she has defeated and the plans she has marred through those religious instincts which should have blest her country but which through their perversion by priestcraft have been one of its greatest curses adrian is in the vatican after his triumphant return to rome when adelasia the wife of that ostasio count of the campagna in whose castle arnaldo is concealed and who shares his excommunication is ushered into the popes presence she is half mad with terror at the penalties under which her husband has fallen in days when the excommunicated were shunned like lepers and to shelter them or to eat and drink with them even to salute them was to incur privation of the sacraments when a bier was placed at their door and their houses were stoned when king robert of france who fell under the anathema was abandoned by all his courtiers and servants and the beggars refused the meat that was left from his tableand she comes into adrians presence accusing herself as the greatest of sinners the pope asks                         hast thou betrayed     thy husband or from some yet greater crime     cometh the terror that oppresses thee     hast slain him      adelasia haply i ought to slay him      adrian                            what      adelasia i fain would hate him and i cannot      adrian                            what     hath his fault been      ad            oh the most horrible     of all      adr and yet is he dear unto thee      ad i love him yes i love him though hes changed     from that he was some gloomy cloud involves     that face one day so fair and neath the feet     now grown deformed the flowers wither away     i know not if i sleep or if i wake     if what i see be a vision or a dream     but all is dreadful and i cannot tell     the falsehood from the truth for if i reason     i fear to sin i fly the happy bed     where i became a mother but return     in midnights horror where my husband lies     wrapt in a sleep so deep it frightens me     and question with my trembling hand his heart     the fountain of his life if it still beat     then a cold kiss i give him then embrace him     with shuddering joy and then i fly again     for i do fear his loveand to the place     where sleep my little ones i hurl myself     and wake them with my moans and drag them forth     before an old miraculous shrine of her     the queen of heaven to whom ive consecrated     with neverceasing vigils burning lamps     there naked stretched upon the hard earth weep     my pretty babes and each of them repeats     the name of mary whom i call upon     and i would swear that she looks down and weeps     then i cry out have pity on my children     thou wast a mother and the good obtain     forgiveness for the guilty  adrian has little trouble to draw from the distracted woman the fact that her husband is a hereticthat heretic indeed in whose castle arnaldo is concealed on his promise that he will save her husband she tells him the name of the castle he summons frederick who claims ostasio as his vassal and declares that he shall die and his children shall be carried to germany adrian after coldly asking the emperor to spare him feigns himself helpless and adelasia too late awakens to a knowledge of his perfidy she falls at his feet      i clasp thy knees once more and i do hope     thou hast not cheated me ah now i see     thy wicked arts because thou knewest well     my husband was a vassal of the empire     that pardon which it was not thine to give     thou didst pretend to promise me o priest     is this thy pity sorrow gives me back     my wandering reason and i waken on     the brink of an abyss and from this wretch     the mask that did so hide his face drops down     and shows it in its naked hideousness     unto the light of truth  frederick sends his soldiers to secure arnaldo but as to ostasio and his children he relents somewhat being touched by the anguish of adelasia adrian rebukes his weakness saying that he learned in the cloister to subdue these compassionate impulses in the next scene which is on the capitoline hill the roman senate resolves to defend the city against the germans to the last and then we have arnaldo a prisoner in a cell of the castle of st angelo the prefect of rome vainly entreats him to recant his heresy and then leaves him with the announcement that he is to die before the following day as to the soliloquy which follows niccolini says i have feigned in arnaldo in the solemn hour of death these doubts and i believe them exceedingly probable in a disciple of abelard this struggle between reason and faith is found more or less in the intellect of every one and constitutes a sublime torment in the life of those who like the brescian monk have devoted themselves from an early age to the study of philosophy and religion none of the ideas which i attribute to arnaldo were unknown to him and according to müller he believed that god was all and that the whole creation was but one of his thoughts his other conceptions in regard to divinity are found in one of his contemporaries the soliloquy is as follows      aforetime thou hast said o king of heaven     that in the world thou wilt not power or riches     and can he be divided from the church     who keeps his faith in thine immortal word     the light of souls to remain in the truth     it only needs that i confess to thee     all sins of mine o thou eternal priest     thou readst my heart and that which i can scarce     express thou seest a great mystery     is man unto himself conscience a deep     which only thou canst sound what storm is there     of guilty thoughts oh pardon my rebellion     evil springs up within the mind of man     as in its native soil since that day adam     abused thy great gift and created guilt     and if each thought of ours became a deed     who would be innocent i did once defend     the cause of abelard and at the decree     imposing silence on him i too ceased     what fault in me bernard in vain inspired     the potentates of europe to defend     the sepulcher of god mankind his temple     i sought to liberate and upon the earth     desired the triumph of the love divine     and life and liberty and progress this     this was my doctrine and god only knows     how reason struggles with the faith in me     for the supremacy of my spirit oh     forgive me lord these in their war are like     the rivers twain of heaven till they return     to their eternal origin and the truth     is seen in thee and god denies not god     i ought to pray thinking on thee i pray     yet how thy substance by three persons shared     each equal with the other one remains     i cannot comprehend nor give in thee     bounds to the infinite and human names     father of the world that which thou here revealest     perchance is but a thought of thine or this     movable veil that covers here below     all thy creation is eternal illusion     that hides god from us where to rest itself     the mind hath not it palpitates uncertain     in infinite darkness and denies more wisely     than it affirms o god omnipotent     i know not what thou art or if i know     how can i utter thee the tongue has not     words for thee and it falters with my thought     that wrongs thee by its effort soon i go     out of the last doubt unto the first truth     what did i say the intellect is soothed     to faith in christ and therein it reposes     as in the bosom of a tender mother     her son arnaldo that which thou art seeking     with sterile torment thy great teacher sought     long time in vain and at the crosss foot     his weary reason cast itself at last     follow his great example and with tears     wash out thy sins  we leave arnaldo in his prison and it is supposed that he is put to death during the combat that follows between the germans and romans immediately after the coronation of frederick as the forces stand opposed to each other two beautiful choruses are introducedone of romans and one of germans and just before the onset adelasia appears and confesses that she has betrayed arnaldo and that he is now in the power of the papacy at the same time the clergy are heard chanting fredericks coronation hymn and then the battle begins the romans are beaten by the number and discipline of their enemies and their leaders are driven out the germans appear before frederic and adrian with two hundred prisoners and ask mercy for them adrian delivers them to his prefect and it is implied that they are put to death then turning to frederick adrian says      art thou content for i have given to thee     more than the crown my words have consecrated     thy power so let the church and empire be     now at last reconciled the mystery     that holds three persons in one substance nor     confounds them may it make us here on earth     to reign forever image of itself     in unity which is like to that of god   v  so ends the tragedy and so was accomplished the union which rested so heavily ever after upon the hearts and hopes not only of italians but of all christian men so was confirmed that temporal power of the popes whose destruction will be known in history as infinitely the greatest event of our greatly eventful time and will free from the doubt and dread of many one of the most powerful agencies for good in the world namely the catholic church  i have tried to give an idea of the magnificence and scope of this mighty tragedy of niccolinis and i do not know that i can now add anything which will make this clearer if we think of the grandeur of its plan and how it employs for its effect the evil and the perverted good of the time in which the scene was laid how it accords perfect sincerity to all the great actorsto the pope as well as to arnaldo to the emperor as well as to the leaders of the peoplewe must perceive that its conception is that of a very great artist it seems to me that the execution is no less admirable we cannot judge it by the narrow rule which the tragedies of the stage must obey we must look at it with the generosity and the liberal imagination with which we can alone enjoy a great fiction then the patience the subtlety the strength with which each character individual and typical is evolved the picturesqueness with which every event is presented the lyrical sweetness and beauty with which so many passages are enriched will all be apparent to us and we shall feel the esthetic sublimity of the work as well as its moral force and its political significance     giacomo leopardi   i  in the year 1798 at recanati a little mountain town of tuscany was born noble and miserable the poet giacomo leopardi who began even in childhood to suffer the malice of that strange conspiracy of ills which consumed him his constitution was very fragile and it early felt the effect of the passionate ardor with which the sickly boy dedicated his life to literature from the first he seems to have had little or no direction in his own studies and hardly any instruction he literally lived among his books rarely leaving his own room except to pass into his fathers library his research and erudition were marvelous and at the age of sixteen he presented his father a latin translation and comment on plotinus of which saintebeuve said that one who had studied plotinus his whole life could find something useful in this work of a boy at that age leopardi already knew all greek and latin literature he knew french spanish and english he knew hebrew and disputed in that tongue with the rabbis of ancona  the poets father was count monaldo leopardi who had written little books of a religious and political character the religion very bigoted the politics very reactionary his library was the largest anywhere in that region but he seems not to have learned wisdom in it and though otherwise a blameless man he used his son who grew to manhood differing from him in all his opinions with a rigor that was scarcely less than cruel he was bitterly opposed to what was called progress to religious and civil liberty he was devoted to what was called order which meant merely the existing order of things the divinely appointed prince the infallible priest he had a mediaeval taste and he made his palace at recanati as much like a feudal castle as he could with all sorts of baronial bricàbrac an armed vassal at his gate was out of the question but at the door of his own chamber stood an effigy in rusty armor bearing a tarnished halberd he abhorred the fashions of our century and wore those of an earlier epoch his wife who shared his prejudices and opinions fantastically appareled herself to look like the portrait of some gentlewoman of as remote a date halls hung in damask vast mirrors in carven frames and stately furniture of antique form attested throughout the palace the splendor of a race which if its fortunes had somewhat declined still knew how to maintain its ancient state  in this home passed the youth and early manhood of a poet who no sooner began to think for himself than he began to think things most discordant with his fathers principles and ideas he believed in neither the religion nor the politics of his race he cherished with the desire of literary achievement that vague faith in humanity in freedom in the future against which the count monaldo had so sternly set his face he chafed under the restraints of his fathers authority and longed for some escape into the world the italians sometimes write of leopardis unhappiness with passionate condemnation of his father but neither was count monaldos part an enviable one and it was certainly not at this period that he had all the wrong in his differences with his son nevertheless it is pathetic to read how the heartsick frail ambitious boy when he found some article in a newspaper that greatly pleased him would write to the author and ask his friendship when these journalists who were possibly not always the wisest publicists of their time so far responded to the young scholars advances as to give him their personal acquaintance as well as their friendship the old count received them with a courteous tolerance which had no kindness in it for their progressive ideas he lived in dread of his sons becoming involved in some of the many plots then hatching against order and religion and he repressed with all his strength leopardis revolutionary tendencies which must always have been mere matters of sentiment and not deserving of great rigor  he seems not so much to have loved italy as to have hated recanati it is a small village high up in the apennines between loreto and macerata and is chiefly accessible in oxcarts small towns everywhere are dull and perhaps are not more deadly so in italy than they are elsewhere but there they have a peculiarly obscure narrow life indoors outdoors there is a little lounging about the caffè a little stir on holidays among the lower classes and the neighboring peasants a great deal of gossip at all times and hardly anything more the local nobleman perhaps cultivates literature as leopardis father did there is always some abbate mousing about in the local archives and writing pamphlets on disputed points of the local history and there is the parish priest to help form the polite society of the place as if this social barrenness were not enough recanati was physically hurtful to leopardi the climate was very fickle the harsh damp air was cruel to his nerves he says it seems to him a den where no good or beautiful thing ever comes he bewails the common ignorance in recanati there is no love for letters for the humanizing arts nobody frequents his fathers great library nobody buys books nobody reads the newspapers yet this forlorn and detestable little town has one good thing it has a preëminently good italian accent better even he thinks than the romanwhich would be a greater consolation to an italian than we can well understand nevertheless it was not society and it did not make his fellowtownsmen endurable to him he recoiled from them more and more and the solitude in which he lived among his books filled him with a black melancholy which he describes as a poison corroding the life of body and soul alike to a friend who tries to reconcile him to recanati he writes it is very well to tell me that plutarch and alfieri loved chaeronea and asti they loved them but they left them and so shall i love my native place when i am away from it now i say i hate it because i am in it to recall the spot where ones childhood days were passed is dear and sweet it is a fine saying here you were born and here providence wills you to stay all very fine say to the sick man striving to be well that he is flying in the face of providence tell the poor man struggling to advance himself that he is defying heaven bid the turk beware of baptism for god has made him a turk so leopardi wrote when he was in comparative health and able to continue his studies but there were long periods when his ailments denied him his sole consolation of work then he rose late and walked listlessly about without opening his lips or looking at a book the whole day as soon as he might he returned to his studies when he must he abandoned them again at such a time he once wrote to a friend who understood and loved him i have not energy enough to conceive a single desire not even for death not because i fear death but because i cannot see any difference between that and my present life for the first time ennui not merely oppresses and wearies me but it also agonizes and lacerates me like a cruel pain i am overwhelmed with a sense of the vanity of all things and the condition of men my passions are dead my very despair seems nonentity as to my studies which you urge me to continue for the last eight months i have not known what study means the nerves of my eyes and of my whole head are so weakened and disordered that i cannot read or listen to reading nor can i fix my mind upon any subject  illustration giacomo leopardi  at recanati leopardi suffered not merely solitude but the contact of people whom he despised and whose vulgarity was all the greater oppression when it showed itself in a sort of stupid compassionate tenderness for him he had already suffered one of those disappointments which are the rule rather than the exception and his first love had ended as first love always does when it ends fortunatelyin disappointment he scarcely knew the object of his passion a young girl of humble lot whom he used to hear singing at her loom in the house opposite his fathers palace count monaldo promptly interfered and not long afterward the young girl died but the sensitive boy and his biographers after him made the most of this sorrow and doubtless it helped to render life under his fathers roof yet heavier and harder to bear such as it was it seems to have been the only love that leopardi ever really felt and the young girls memory passed into the melancholy of his life and poetry  but he did not summon courage to abandon recanati before his twentyfourth year and then he did not go with his fathers entire goodwill the count wished him to become a priest but leopardi shrank from the idea with horror and there remained between him and his father not only the difference of their religious and political opinions but an unkindness which must be remembered against the judgment if not the heart of the latter he gave his son so meager an allowance that it scarcely kept him above want and obliged him to labors and subjected him to cares which his frail health was not able bear  from recanati leopardi first went to rome but he carried recanati everywhere with him and he was as solitary and as wretched in the capital of the world as in the little village of the apennines he despised the romans as they deserved upon very short acquaintance and he declared that his dullest fellowvillager had a greater share of good sense than the best of them their frivolity was incredible the men moved him to rage and pity the women high and low to loathing in one of his letters to his brother carlo he says of rome as he found it i have spoken to you only about the women because i am at a loss what to say to you about literature horrors upon horrors the most sacred names profaned the most absurd follies praised to the skies the greatest spirits of the century trampled under foot as inferior to the smallest literary man in rome philosophy despised genius imagination feeling namesi do not say things but even namesunknown and alien to these professional poets and poetesses antiquarianism placed at the summit of human learning and considered invariably and universally as the only true study of man this was rome in 1822 i do not exaggerate he writes because it is impossible and i do not even say enough one of the things that moved him to the greatest disgust in the childish and insipid society of a city where he had fondly hoped to find a response to his high thoughts was the sensation caused throughout rome by the dress and theatrical effectiveness with which a certain prelate said mass all rome talked of it cardinals and noble ladies complimented the performer as if he were a balletdancer and the flattered prelate used to rehearse his part and expatiate upon his methods of study for it to private audiences of admirers in fact society had then touched almost the lowest depth of degradation where society had always been corrupt and dissolute and the reader of massimo dazeglios memoirs may learn particulars given with shame and regret indeed and yet with perfect italian frankness which it is not necessary to repeat here  there were however many foreigners living at rome in whose company leopardi took great pleasure they were chiefly germans and first among them was niebuhr who says of his first meeting with the poet conceive of my astonishment when i saw standing before me in the poor little chamber a mere youth pale and shy frail in person and obviously in ill health who was by far the first in fact the only greek philologist in italy the author of critical comments and observations which would have won honor for the first philologist in germany and yet only twentytwo years old he had become thus profoundly learned without school without instructor without help without encouragement in his fathers house i understand too that he is one of the first of the rising poets of italy what a nobly gifted people  niebuhr offered to procure him a professorship of greek philosophy in berlin but leopardi would not consent to leave his own country and then niebuhr unsuccessfully used his influence to get him some employment from the papal governmentcompliments and good wishes it gave him but no employment and no pay  from rome leopardi went to milan where he earned somethingvery littleas editor of a comment upon petrarch a little later he went to bologna where a generous and sympathetic nobleman made him tutor in his family but leopardi returned not long after to recanati where he probably found no greater content than he left there presently we find him at pisa and then at florence eking out the allowance from his father by such literary work as he could find to do in the latter place it is somewhat dimly established that he again fell in love though he despised the florentine women almost as much as the romans for their extreme ignorance folly and pride this love also was unhappy there is no reason to believe that leopardi who inspired tender and ardent friendships in men ever moved any woman to love the florentine ladies are darkly accused by one of his biographers of having laughed at the poor young pessimist and it is very possible but that need not make us think the worse of him or of them either for that matter he is supposed to have figured the lady of his latest love under the name of aspasia in one of his poems as he did his first love under that of sylvia in the poem so called doubtless the experience further embittered a life already sufficiently miserable he left florence but after a brief sojourn at rome he returned thither where his friend antonio ranieri watched with a heavy heart the gradual decay of his forces and persuaded him finally to seek the milder air of naples ranieris father was like leopardis of reactionary opinions and the neapolitan dreading the effect of their discord did not take his friend to his own house but hired a villa at capodimonte where he lived four years in fraternal intimacy with leopardi and where the poet died in 1837  ranieri has in some sort made himself the champion of leopardis fame he has edited his poems and has written a touching and beautiful sketch of his life their friendship which was of the greatest tenderness began when leopardi sorely needed it and ranieri devoted himself to the hapless poet like a lover as if to console him for the many years in which he had known neither reverence nor love he indulged all the eccentricities of his guest who for a sick man had certain strange habits often not rising till evening dining at midnight and going to bed at dawn ranieris sister paolina kept house for the friends and shared all her brothers compassion for leopardi whose family appears to have willingly left him to the care of these friends how far the old unkindness between him and his father continued it is hard to say his last letter was written to his mother in may 1837 some two weeks before his death he thanks her for a present of ten dollarsone may imagine from the gift and the gratitude that he was still held in a strict and parsimonious tutelageand begs her prayers and his fathers for after he has seen them again he shall not have long to live  he did not see them again but he continued to smile at the anxieties of his friends who had too great reason to think that the end was much nearer than leopardi himself supposed on the night of the 14th of june while they were waiting for the carriage which was to take them into the country where they intended to pass the time together and sup at daybreak leopardi felt so great a difficulty of breathinghe called it asthma but it was dropsy of the heartthat he begged them to send for a doctor the doctor on seeing the sick man took ranieri apart and bade him fetch a priest without delay and while they waited the coming of the friar leopardi spoke now and then with them but sank rapidly finally says ranieri leopardi opened his eyes now larger even than their wont and looked at me more fixedly than before i cant see you he said with a kind of sigh and he ceased to breathe and his pulse and heart beat no more and at the same moment the friar felice of the barefoot order of st augustine entered the chamber while i quite beside myself called with a loud voice on him who had been my friend my brother my father and who answered me nothing and yet seemed to gaze upon me his death was inconceivable to me the others were dismayed and mute there arose between the good friar and myself the most cruel and painful dispute  i madly contending that my friend was still alive and beseeching him with tears to accompany with the offices of religion the passing of that great soul but he touching again and again the pulse and the heart continually answered that the spirit had taken flight at last a spontaneous and solemn silence fell upon all in the room the friar knelt beside the dead and we all followed his example then after long and profound meditation he prayed and we prayed with him  in another place ranieri says the malady of leopardi was indefinable for having its spring in the most secret sources of life it was like life itself inexplicable the bones softened and dissolved away refusing their frail support to the flesh that covered them the flesh itself grew thinner and more lifeless every day for the organs of nutrition denied their office of assimilation the lungs cramped into a space too narrow and not sound themselves expanded with difficulty with difficulty the heart freed itself from the lymph with which a slow absorption burdened it the blood which ill renewed itself in the hard and painful respiration returned cold pale and sluggish to the enfeebled veins and in fine the whole mysterious circle of life moving with such great effort seemed from moment to moment about to pause forever perhaps the great cerebral sponge beginning and end of that mysterious circle had prepotently sucked up all the vital forces and itself consumed in a brief time all that was meant to suffice the whole system for a long period however it may be the life of leopardi was not a course as in most men but truly a precipitation toward death  some years before he died leopardi had a presentiment of his death and his end was perhaps hastened by the nervous shock of the terror produced by the cholera which was then raging in naples at that time the body of a neapolitan minister of state who had died of cholera was cast into the common burialpit at naplessuch was the fear of contagion and so rapidly were the dead hurried to the grave a heavy bribe secured the remains of leopardi from this fate and his dust now reposes in a little church on the road to pozzuoli   ii  in the years of boyhood says the neapolitan critic francesco de sanctis leopardi saw his youth vanish forever he lived obscure and achieved posthumous envy and renown he was rich and noble and he suffered from want and despite no womans love ever smiled upon him the solitary lover of his own mind to which he gave the names of sylvia aspasia and nerina therefore with a precocious and bitter penetration he held what we call happiness for illusions and deceits of fancy the objects of our desire he called idols our labors idleness and everything vanity thus he saw nothing here below equal to his own intellect or that was worthy the throb of his heart and inertia rust as it were even more than pain consumed his life alone in what he called this formidable desert of the world in such solitude life becomes a dialogue of man with his own soul and the internal colloquies render more bitter and intense the affections which have returned to the heart for want of nourishment in the world mournful colloquies and yet pleasing where man is the suicidal vulture perpetually preying upon himself and caressing the wound that drags him to the grave the first cause of his sorrow is recanati the intellect capable of the universe feels itself oppressed in an obscure village cruel to the body and deadly to the spirit he leaves recanati he arrives in rome we believe him content at last and he too believes it brief illusion rome bologna milan florence naples are all different places where he forever meets the same man himself read the first letter that he writes from rome in the great things i see i do not feel the least pleasure for i know that they are marvelous but i do not feel it and i assure you that their multitude and grandeur wearied me after the first day to leopardi it is rarely given to interest himself in any spectacle of nature and he never does it without a sudden and agonized return to himself malign and heartless men have pretended that leopardi was a misanthrope a fierce hater and enemy of the human race love inexhaustible and almost ideal was the supreme craving of that angelic heart and never left it during life love me for gods sake he beseeches his brother carlo i have need of love love love fire enthusiasm life and in truth it may be said that pain and love form the twofold poetry of his life  leopardi lived in italy during the long contest between the classic and romantic schools and it may be said that in him many of the leading ideas of both parties were reconciled his literary form was as severe and sculpturesque as that of alfieri himself whilst the most subjective and introspective of the romantic poets did not so much color the world with his own mental and spiritual hue as leopardi it is not plain whether he ever declared himself for one theory or the other he was a contributor to the literary journal which the partisans of the romantic school founded at florence but he was a man so weighed upon by his own sense of the futility and vanity of all things that he could have had little spirit for mere literary contentions his admirers try hard to make out that he was positively and actively patriotic and it is certain that in his earlier youth he disagreed with his fathers conservative opinions and despised the existing state of things but later in life he satirized the aspirations and purposes of progress though without sympathizing with those of reaction  the poem which his chief claim to classification with the poets militant of his time rests upon is that addressed to italy those who have read even only a little of leopardi have read it and i must ask their patience with a version which drops the irregular rhyme of the piece for the sake of keeping its peculiar rhythm and measure        my native land i see the walls and arches     the columns and the statues and the lonely     towers of our ancestors     but not their glory not     the laurel and the steel that of old time     our great forefathers bore disarmèd now     naked thou showest thy forehead and thy breast     o me how many wounds     what bruises and what blood how do i see thee     thou loveliest lady unto heaven i cry     and to the world say say     who brought her unto this to this and worse     for both her arms are loaded down with chains     so that unveiled and with disheveled hair     she crouches all forgotten and forlorn     hiding her beautiful face     between her knees and weeps     weep weep for well thou mayst my italy     born as thou wert to conquest     alike in evil and in prosperous sort       if thy sweet eyes were each a living stream     thou couldst not weep enough     for all thy sorrow and for all thy shame     for thou wast queen and now thou art a slave     who speaks of thee or writes     that thinking on thy glory in the past     but says she was great once but is no more     wherefore oh wherefore where is the ancient strength     the valor and the arms and constancy     who rent the sword from thee     who hath betrayed thee what art or what toil     or what oerwhelming force     hath stripped thy robe and golden wreath from thee     how didst thou fall and when     from such a height unto a depth so low     doth no one fight for thee no one defend thee     none of thy own arms arms for i alone     will fight and fall for thee     grant me o heaven my blood     shall be as fire unto italian hearts       where are thy sons i hear the sound of arms     of wheels of voices and of drums     in foreign fields afar     thy children fight and fall     wait italy wait i see or seem to see     a tumult as of infantry and horse     and smoke and dust and the swift flash of swords     like lightning among clouds     wilt thou not hope wilt thou not lift and turn     thy trembling eyes upon the doubtful close     for what in yonder fields     combats italian youth o gods ye gods     for other lands italian swords are drawn     oh misery for him who dies in war     not for his native shores and his beloved     his wife and children dear     but by the foes of others     for others cause and cannot dying say     dear land of mine     the life thou gavest me i give thee back  this suffers of course in translation but i confess that in the original it wears something of the same perfunctory air his patriotism was the feverflame of the sick mans blood his real country was the land beyond the grave and there is a far truer note in this address to death      and thou that ever from my lifes beginning     i have invoked and honored beautiful death who only     of all our earthly sorrows knowest pity     if ever celebrated     thou wast by me if ever i attempted     to recompense the insult     that vulgar terror offers     thy lofty state delay no more but listen     to prayers so rarely uttered     shut to the light forever     sovereign of time these eyes of weary anguish  i suppose that italian criticism of the present day would not give leopardi nearly so high a place among the poets as his friend ranieri claims for him and his contemporaries accorded he seems to have been the poet of a national mood he was the final expression of that long hopeless apathy in which italy lay bound for thirty years after the fall of napoleon and his governments and the reëstablishment of all the little despots native and foreign throughout the peninsula in this time there was unrest enough and revolt enough of a desultory and unorganized sort but every struggle apparently every aspiration for a free political and religious life ended in a more solid confirmation of the leaden misrule which weighed down the hearts of the people to such an apathy the pensive monotone of this sick poets song might well seem the only truth and one who beheld the universe with the invalids loath eyes and reasoned from his own irremediable ills to a malign mystery presiding over all human affairs and ordering a sad destiny from which there could be no defense but death might have the authority of a prophet among those who could find no promise of better things in their earthly lot  leopardis malady was such that when he did not positively suffer he had still the memory of pain and he was oppressed with a dreary ennui from which he could not escape death oblivion annihilation are the thoughts upon which he broods and which fill his verse the passing color of other mens minds is the prevailing cast of his and he probably with far more sincerity than any other poet nursed his despair in such utterances as this      to himself      now thou shalt rest forever     o weary heart the last deceit is ended     for i believed myself immortal cherished     hopes and beloved delusions     and longings to be deludedall are perished     rest thee forever oh greatly     heart hast thou palpitated there is nothing     worthy to move thee more nor is earth worthy     thy sighs for life is only     bitterness and vexation earth is only     a heap of dust so rest thee     despair for the last time to our race fortune     never gave any gift but death disdain then     thyself and nature and the power     occultly reigning to the common ruin     scorn heart the infinite emptiness of all things  nature was so cruel a stepmother to this man that he could see nothing but harm even in her apparent beneficence and his verse repeats again and again his dark mistrust of the very loveliness which so keenly delights his sense one of his early poems called the quiet after the storm strikes the key in which nearly all his songs are pitched the observation of nature is very sweet and honest and i cannot see that the philosophy in its perversion of the relations of physical and spiritual facts is less mature than that of his later work it is a philosophy of which the first conception cannot well differ from the final expression       see yon blue sky that breaks     the clouds above the mountain in the west     the fields disclose themselves     and in the valley bright the river runs     all hearts are glad on every side     arise the happy sounds     of toil begun anew     the workman singing to the threshold comes     with work in hand to judge the sky     still humid and the damsel next     on his report comes forth to brim her pail     with the freshfallen rain     the noisy fruiterers     from lane to lane resume     their customary cry     the sun looks out again and smiles upon     the houses and the hills windows and doors     are opened wide and on the faroff road     you hear the tinkling bells and rattling wheels     of travelers that set out upon their journey      every heart is glad     so grateful and so sweet     when is our life as now                                           o pleasure child of pain     vain joy which is the fruit     of bygone suffering overshadowèd     and wrung with cruel fears     of death whom life abhors     wherein in long suspense     silent and cold and pale     man sat and shook and shuddered to behold     lightnings and clouds and winds     furious in his offense     beneficent nature these     these are thy bounteous gifts     these these are the delights     thou offerest unto mortals to escape     from pain is bliss to us     anguish thou scatterest broadcast and our woes     spring up spontaneous and that little joy     born sometimes for a miracle and show     of terror is our mightiest gain o man     dear to the gods count thyself fortunate     if now and then relief     thou hast from pain and blest     when death shall come to heal thee of all pain  the bodily deformities which humiliated leopardi and the cruel infirmities that agonized him his whole life long wrought in his heart an invincible disgust which made him invoke death as the sole relief his songs while they express discontent the discord of the world the conviction of the nullity of human things are exquisite in style they breathe a perpetual melancholy which is often sublime and they relax and pain your soul like the music of a single chord while their strange sweetness wins you to them again and again this is the language of an italian critic who wrote after leopardis death when already it had begun to be doubted whether he was the greatest italian poet since dante a still later critic finds leopardis style without relief without lyric flight without the great art of contrasts without poetic leaven hard to read despoil those verses of their masterly polish he says reduce those thoughts to prose and you will see how little they are akin to poetry  i have a feeling that my versions apply some such test to leopardis work and that the reader sees it in them at much of the disadvantage which this critic desires for it yet after doing my worst i am not wholly able to agree with him it seems to me that there is the indestructible charm in it which wherever we find it we must call poetry it is true that its strange sweetness wins you again and again and that this lonely pipe of death thrills and solemnly delights as no other stop has done let us hear it again as the poet sounds it figuring himself a syrian shepherd guarding his flock by night and weaving his song under the eastern moon      o flock that liest at rest o blessèd thou     that knowest not thy fate however hard     how utterly i envy thee     not merely that thou goest almost free     of all this weary pain     that every misery and every toil     and every fear thou straightway dost forget     but most because thou knowest not ennui     when on the grass thou liest in the shade     i see thee tranquil and content     and great part of thy years     untroubled by ennui thou passest thus     i likewise in the shadow on the grass     lie and a dull disgust beclouds     my soul and i am goaded with a spur     so that reposing i am farthest still     from finding peace or place     and yet i want for naught     and have not had till now a cause for tears     what is thy bliss how much     i cannot tell but thou art fortunate                                           or it may be my thought     errs running thus to others destiny     may be to everything     wherever born in cradle or in fold     that day is terrible when it was born  it is the same note the same voice the theme does not change but perhaps it is deepened in this ode      on the likeness op a beautiful woman carven                   upon her tomb      such wast thou now under earth     a skeleton and dust oer dust and bones     immovably and vainly set and mute     looking upon the flight of centuries     sole keeper of memory     and of regret is this fair counterfeit     of loveliness now vanished that sweet look     which made men tremble when it fell on them     as now it falls on me that lip which once     like some full vase of sweets     ran over with delight that fair neck clasped     by longing and that soft and amorous hand     which often did impart     an icy thrill unto the hand it touched     that breast which visibly     blanched with its beauty him who looked on it     all these things were and now     dust art thou filth a fell     and hideous sight hidden beneath a stone     thus fate hath wrought its will     upon the semblance that to us did seem     heavens vividest image eternal mystery     of mortal being today the ineffable     fountain of thoughts and feelings vast and high     beauty reigns sovereign and seems     like splendor thrown afar     from some immortal essence on these sands     to give our mortal state     a sign and hope secure of destinies     higher than human and of fortunate realms     and golden worlds unknown     tomorrow at a touch     loathsome to see abominable abject     becomes the thing that was     all but angelical before     and from mens memories     all that its loveliness     inspired forever faults and fades away        ineffable desires     and visions high and pure     rise in the happy soul     lulled by the sound of cunning harmonies     whereon the spirit floats     as at his pleasure floats     some fearless swimmer over the deep sea     but if a discord strike     the wounded sense to naught     all that fair paradise in an instant falls        mortality if thou     be wholly frail and vile     be only dust and shadow how canst thou     so deeply feel and if thou be     in part divine how can thy will and thought     by things so poor and base     so easily be awakenèd and quenched  let us touch for the last time this pensive chord and listen to its response of hopeless love this poem in which he turns to address the spirit of the poor child whom he loved boyishly at recanati is pathetic with the fact that possibly she alone ever reciprocated the tenderness with which his heart was filled      to sylvia        sylvia dost thou remember     in this that season of thy mortal being     when from thine eyes shone beauty     in thy shy glances fugitive and smiling     and joyously and pensively the borders     of childhood thou didst traverse        all day the quiet chambers     and the ways near resounded     to thy perpetual singing     when thou intent upon some girlish labor     satst utterly contented     with the fair future brightening in thy vision     it was the fragrant month of may and ever     thus thou thy days beguiledst        i leaving my fair studies     leaving my

    unto cold death and an unknown and naked     sepulcher in the distance   iii  these pieces fairly indicate the range of leopardi and i confess that they and the rest that i have read leave me somewhat puzzled in the presence of his reputation this to be sure is largely based upon his prose writingshis dialogues full of irony and sarcasmand his unquestionable scholarship but the poetry is the heart of his fame and is it enough to justify it i suppose that such poetry owes very much of its peculiar influence to that awful love we all have of hovering about the idea of deathof playing with the great catastrophe of our several tragedies and farces and of marveling what it can be there are moods which the languid despair of leopardis poetry can always evoke and in which it seems that the most life can do is to leave us and let us lie down and cease but i fancy we all agree that these are not very wise or healthful moods and that their indulgence does not fit us particularly well for the duties of life though i never heard that they interfered with its pleasures on the contrary they add a sort of zest to enjoyment of course the whole transaction is illogical but if a poet will end every pensive strain with an appeal or apostrophe to deathnot the real death that comes with a sharp quick agony or after long lying in bed after many days or many years of squalid misery and slowly dying hopes and medicines that cease even to relieve at last not this death that comes in all the horror of undertaking but a picturesque and impressive abstraction whose business it is to relieve us in the most effective way of all our troubles and at the same time to avenge us somehow upon the indefinitely ungrateful and unworthy world we abandonif a poet will do this we are very apt to like him there is little doubt that leopardi was sincere and there is little reason why he should not have been so for life could give him nothing but pain  de sanctis whom i have quoted already and who speaks i believe with rather more authority than any other modern italian critic and certainly with great clearness and acuteness does not commit himself to specific praise of leopardis work but he seems to regard him as an important expression if not force or influence and he has some words about him at the close of his history of italian literature which have interested me not only for the estimate of leopardi which they embody but for the singularly distinct statement which they make of the modern literary attitude i should not myself have felt that leopardi represented this but i am willing that the reader should feel it if he can de sanctis has been speaking of the romantic period in italy when he says  giacomo leopardi marks the close of this period metaphysics at war with theology had ended in this attempt at reconciliation the multiplicity of systems had discredited science itself metaphysics was regarded as a revival of theology the idea seemed a substitute for providence those philosophies of history of religion of humanity had the air of poetical inventions that reconciliation between the old and new tolerated as a temporary political necessity seemed at bottom a profanation of science a moral weakness faith in revelation had been wanting faith in philosophy itself was now wanting mystery reappeared the philosopher knew as much as the peasant of this mystery giacomo leopardi was the echo in the solitude of his thought and his pain his skepticism announced the dissolution of this theologicometaphysical world and inaugurated the reign of the arid true of the real his songs are the most profound and occult voices of that laborious transition called the nineteenth century that which has importance is not the brilliant exterior of that century of progress and it is not without irony that he speaks of the progressive destinies of mankind that which has importance is the exploration of ones own breast the inner world virtue liberty love all the ideals of religion of science and of poetryshadows and illusions in the presence of reason yet which warm the heart and will not die mystery destroys the intellectual world it leaves the moral world intact this tenacious life of the inner world despite the fall of all theological and metaphysical worlds is the originality of leopardi and gives his skepticism a religious stamp  every one feels in it a new creation the instrument of this renovation is criticism the sense of the real continues to develop itself the positive sciences come to the top and cast out all the ideal and systematic constructions new dogmas lose credit criticism remains intact the patient labor of analysis begins again socialism reappears in the political order positivism in the intellectual order the word is no longer liberty but justice  literature also undergoes transformation it rejects classes distinctions privileges the ugly stands beside the beautiful or rather there is no longer ugly or beautiful neither ideal nor real neither infinite nor finite there is but one thing only the living     giuseppe giusti  i   giuseppe giusti who is the greatest italian satirist of this century and is in some respects the greatest italian poet was born in 1809 at mossummano in tuscany of parentage noble and otherwise distinguished one of his paternal ancestors had assisted the liberal grand duke pietro leopoldo to compile his famous code and his mothers father had been a republican in 1799 there was also an hereditary taste for literature in the family and giusti says in one of his charming letters that almost as soon as he had learned to speak his father taught him the ballad of count ugolino and he adds i have always had a passion for song a passion for verses and more than a passion for dante his education passed later into the hands of a priest who had spent much time as a teacher in vienna and was impetuous choleric and thoroughly german in principle i was given him to be taught says giusti but he undertook to tame me and he remembered reading with him a plutarch for youth and the lives of the saints but chiefly was as he says so caned contraried and martyred by him that when the priest wept at their final parting the boy could by no means account for the burst of tenderness giusti was then going to florence to be placed in a school where he had the immeasurable good fortune to fall into the hands of one whose gentleness and wisdom he remembered through life drea francioni he says had not time to finish his work but he was the first and the only one to put into my heart the need and love of study oh better far than stuffing the head with latin with histories and with fables endear study even if you teach nothing this is the great task and he afterward dedicated his book on tuscan proverbs which he thought one of his best performances to this beloved teacher  he had learned to love study yet from this school and from others to which he was afterward sent he came away with little latin and no greek but what is more important he began life about this time as a poetby stealing a sonnet his theft was suspected but could not be proved and so he says of his teacher and himself we remained he in his doubt and i in my lie who would have thought from this ugly beginning that i should really have gone on to make sonnets of my own the muses once known the vice grew upon me and from my twelfth to my fifteenth year i rasped and rasped and rasped until finally i came out with a sonnet to italy represented in the usual fashion by the usual matron weeping as usual over her highly estimable misfortunes in school under certain priests who were more chinese than italian and without knowing whether italy were round or square long or short how that sonnet to italy should get into my head i dont know i only know that it was found beautiful and i was advised to hide itthat being the proper thing to do with patriotic poetry in those days  after leaving school giusti passed three idle years with his family and then went to study the humanities at pisa where he found the café better adapted to their pursuit than the university since he could there unite with it the pursuit of the exact science of billiards he represents himself in his letters and verses to have led just the life at pisa which was most agreeable to former governments of italya life of sensual gayety abounding in the small excitements which turn the thought from the real interests of the time and weaken at once the moral and intellectual fiber but how far a man can be credited to his own disgrace is one of the unsettled questions the repentant and the unrepentant are so apt to overaccuse themselves it is very wisely conjectured by some of giustis biographers that he did not waste himself so much as he says in the dissipations of student life at pisa at any rate it is certain that he began there to make those sarcastic poems upon political events which are so much less agreeable to a paternal despotism than almost any sort of lovesongs he is said to have begun by writing in the manner of béranger and several critics have labored to prove the similarity of their genius with scarcely more effect it seems to us than those who would make him out the heinrich heine of italy as they call him he was a political satirist whose success was due to his genius but who can never be thoroughly appreciated by a foreigner or even an italian not intimately acquainted with the affairs of his times and his reputation must inevitably diminish with the waning interest of men in the obsolete politics of those vanished kingdoms and duchies how mean and little were all their concerns is scarcely credible but giusti tells an adventure of his at the period which throws light upon some of the springs of action in tuscany he had been arrested for a supposed share in applause supposed revolutionary at the theater he boldly denied that he had been at the play if you were not at the theater how came your name on the list of the accused demanded the logical commissary perhaps answered giusti the spies have me so much in mind that they see me where i am not here he continues the commissary fell into a rage but i remained firm and cited the count mastiani in proof with whom the man often dinedmastiani being governor in pisa and the head of society at the name of mastiani there seemed to pass before the commissary a long array of stewed and roast eaten and to be eaten so that he instantly turned and said to me go and at any rate take this summons for a paternal admonition ever since the french revolution of 1830 and the sympathetic movements in italy giusti had written political satires which passed from hand to hand in manuscript copies the possession of which was rendered all the more eager and relishing by the pleasure of concealing them from spies so that for a defective copy a person by no means rich would give as much as ten scudi when a swiss printed edition appeared in 1844 half the delight in them was gone the violation of the law being naturally so dear to the human heart that when combined with patriotism it is almost a rapture  but in the midst of his political satirizing giusti felt the sting of one who is himself a greater satirist than any when he will though he is commonly known for a sentimentalist the poet fell in love very seriously and it proved very unhappily as he has recorded in three or four poems of great sweetness and grace but no very characteristic merit this passion is improbably believed to have had a disastrous effect upon giustis health and ultimately to have shortened his life but then the italians always like to have their poets agonizzanti at least like a true humorist giusti has himself taken both sides of the question professing himself properly heartbroken in the poems referred to and in a letter written late in life after he had encountered his faded love at his own home in pescia making a jest of any reconciliation or renewal of the old passion between them  apropos of the heart says giusti in this letter you ask me about a certain person who once had mine whole and sound roots and all i saw her this morning in passing out of the corner of my eye and i know that she is well and enjoying herself as to our coming together again the case if it were once remote is now impossible for you can well imagine that all things considered i could never be such a donkey as to tempt her to a comparison of me with myself i am certain that after having tolerated me for a day or two for simple appearance sake she would find some good excuse for planting me a yard outside the door in many obstinacy increases with the ails and wrinkles but in me thank heaven there comes a meekness a resignation not to be expressed perhaps it has not happened otherwise with her in that case we could accommodate ourselves and talk as long as the evening lasted of magnesia of quinine and of nervines lament not the rising and sinking of the heart but of the barometer talk not of the theater and all the rest but whether it is better to crawl out into the sun like lizards or stay at home behind battened windows goodevening my dear how have you been today eh you know my love the usual rheumatism but for the rest i dont complain did you sleep well last night not so bad and you o little or none at all and i got up feeling as if all my bones were broken my idol take a little laudanum think that when you are not well i suffer with you and your appetite how is it o dont speak of it i cant get anything down my soul if you dont eat youll not be able to keep up but my heart what would you do if the mouthfuls stuck in your throat take a little quassia  but dost thou remember once yes i remember but once was once  and so forth and so forth then some evening if a priest came in we could take a hand at whist with a dummy and so live on to the age of crutches in a passion whose phases are confided to the apothecary rather than to the confessor  illustration giuseppe giusti  giustis first political poems had been inspired by the revolutionary events of 1830 in france and he continued part of that literary force which quite as much as the policy of cavour has educated italians for freedom and independence when the french revolution of 1848 took place and the responsive outbreaks followed all over europe tuscany drove out her grand duke as france drove out her king and still emulous of that wise exemplar put the novelist guerrazzi at the head of her affairs as the next best thing to such a poet as lamartine which she had not the affair ended in the most natural way the florentines under the supposed popular government became very tired of themselves and called back their grand duke who came again with austrian bayonets to support him in the affections of his subjects where he remained secure until the persuasive bayonets disappeared before garibaldi ten years later  throughout these occurrences the voice of giusti was heard whenever that of good sense and a temperate zeal for liberty could be made audible he was an aristocrat by birth and at heart and he looked upon the democratic shows of the time with distrust if not dislike though he never lost faith in the capacity of the italians for an independent national government his broken health would not let him join the tuscan volunteers who marched to encounter the austrians in lombardy and though he was once elected member of the representative body from pescia he did not shine in it and refused to be chosen a second time his letters of this period afford the liveliest and truest record of feeling in tuscany during that memorable time of alternating hopes and fears generous impulses and mean derelictions and they strike me as among the best letters in any language  giusti supported the grand dukes return philosophically with a sarcastic serenity of spirit and something also of the indifference of mortal sickness his health was rapidly breaking and in march 1850 he died very suddenly of a hemorrhage of the lungs   ii  in noticing giustis poetry i have a difficulty already hinted for if i presented some of the pieces which gave him his greatest fame among his contemporaries i should be doing as far as my present purpose is concerned a very unprofitable thing the greatest part of his poetry was inspired by the political events or passions of the time at which it was written and except some five or six pieces it is all of a political cast these events are now many of them grown unimportant and obscure and the passions are for the most part quite extinct so that it would be useless to give certain of his most popular pieces as historical while others do not represent him at his best as a poet some degree of social satire is involved but the poems are principally light brilliant mockeries of transient aspects of politics or outcries against forgotten wrongs or appeals for longsinceaccomplished or defeated purposes we know how dreary this sort of poetry generally is in our own language after the occasion is once past and how nothing but the enforced privacy of a desolate island could induce us to read however ardent our sympathies may have been the lyrics about slavery or the war except in very rare cases the truth is the muse for a lady who has seen so much of life and the ways of the world is an excessively jealous personification and is apt to punish with oblivion a mixed devotion at her shrine the poet who desires to improve and exalt his time must make up his mind to a double martyrdomfirst to be execrated by vast numbers of respectable people and then to be forgotten by all it is a great pity but it cannot be helped it is chiefly your      rogue of canzonets and serenades  who survives anacreon lives but the poets who appealed to their ionian fellowcitizens as men and brethren and lectured them upon their servility and their habits of winebibbing and of basking away the dearest rights of humanity in the sun who ever heard of them i do not mean to say that giusti ever lectured his generation he was too good an artist for that but at least one italian critic forebodes that the figure he made in the patriotic imagination must diminish rapidly with the establishment of the very conditions he labored to bring about the wit of much that he said must grow dim with the fading remembrance of what provoked it the sting lie pointless and painless in the dust of those who writhed under itso much of the poets virtue perishing in their death we can only judge of all this vaguely and for a great part from the outside for we cannot pretend to taste the finest flavor of the poetry which is sealed to a foreigner in the local phrases and racy florentine words which giusti used but i think posterity in italy will stand in much the same attitude toward him that we do now not much of the social life of his time is preserved in his poetry and he will not be resorted to as that satirist of the period to whom historians are fond of alluding in support of conjectures relative to society in the past now and then he touches upon some prevailing intellectual or literary affectation as in the poem describing the dandified desperate young poet of fashion who      immersed in suppers and balls     a martyr in yellow gloves  sings of italy of the people of progress with the rhetoricalities of the modern arcadians and he has a poem called the ball which must fairly as it certainly does wittily represent one of those anomalous entertainments which rich foreigners give in italy and to which all sorts of irregular aliens resort something of the local aristocracy appearing also in a ghostly and bewildered way yet even in this poem there is a political lesson  i suppose in fine that i shall most interest my readers in giusti if i translate here the pieces that have most interested me of all i like best the poem which he calls st ambrose and i think the reader will agree with me about it it seems not only very perfect as a bit of art with its subtly intended and apparently capricious mingling of satirical and pathetic sentiment but valuable for its vivid expression of italian feeling toward the austrians these the italians hated as part of a stupid and brutal oppression they despised them somewhat as a torpidwitted folk but individually liked them for their amiability and good nature and in their better moments they pitied them as the victims of a common tyranny i will not be so adventurous as to say how far the beautiful military music of the austrians tended to lighten the burden of a german garrison in an italian city but certainly whoever has heard that music must have felt for one base and shameful moment that the noise of so much of a free press as opposed his own opinions might be advantageously exchanged for it the poem of st ambrose written in 1846 when the germans seemed so firmly fixed in milan is impersonally addressed to some italian holding office under the austrian government and therefore in the german interest      st ambrose      your excellency is not pleased with me     because of certain jests i made of late     and for my putting rogues in pillory     accuse me of being antigerman wait     and hear a thing that happened recently     when wandering here and there one day as fate     led me by some odd accident i ran     on the old church st ambrose at milan      my comrade of the moment was by chance     the young son of one sandro1one of those     troublesome headsan author of romance     promessi sposiyour excellency knows     the book perhapshas given it a glance     ah no i see god give your brain repose     with graver interests occupied your head     to all such stuff as literature is dead      i enter and the church is full of troops     of northern soldiers of croatians say     and of bohemians standing there in groups     as stiff as dry poles stuck in vineyardsnay     as stiff as if impaled and no one stoops     out of the plumb of soldierly array     all stand with whiskers and mustache of tow     before their god like spindles in a row      i started back i cannot well deny     that being rained down as it were and thrust     into that herd of human cattle i     could not suppress a feeling of disgust     unknown i fancy to your excellency     by reason of your office pardon i must     say the church stank of heated grease and that     the very altarcandles seemed of fat      but when the priest had risen to devote     the mystic wafer from the band that stood     about the altar came a sudden note     of sweetness over my disdainful mood     a voice that speaking from the brazen throat     of warlike trumpets came like the subdued     moan of a people bound in sore distress     and thinking on lost hopes and happiness      t was verdis tender chorus rose aloof     that song the lombards there dying of thirst     send up to god lord from the native roof     oer countless thrilling hearts the song has burst     and here i whom its magic put to proof     beginning to be no longer i immersed     myself amidst those tallowy fellowmen     as if they had been of my land and kin      what would your excellency the piece was fine     and ours and played too as it should be played     it drives old grudges out when such divine     music as that mounts up into your head     but when the piece was done back to my line     i crept again and there i should have staid     but that just then to give me another turn     from those molemouths a hymn began to yearn      a german anthem that to heaven went     on unseen wings up from the holy fane     it was a prayer and seemed like a lament     of such a pensive grave pathetic strain     that in my soul it never shall be spent     and how such heavenly harmony in the brain     of those thickskulled barbarians should dwell     i must confess it passes me to tell      in that sad hymn i felt the bitter sweet     of the songs heard in childhood which the soul     learns from beloved voices to repeat     to its own anguish in the days of dole     a thought of the dear mother a regret     a longing for repose and lovethe whole     anguish of distant exile seemed to run     over my heart and leave it all undone      when the strain ceased it left me pondering     tenderer thoughts and stronger and more clear     these men i mused the selfsame despot king     who rules in slavic and italian fear     tears from their homes and arms that round them cling     and drives them slaves thence to keep us slaves here     from their familiar fields afar they pass     like herds to winter in some strange morass      to a hard life to a hard discipline     derided solitary dumb they go     blind instruments of manyeyed rapine     and purposes they share not and scarce know     and this fell hate that makes a gulf between     the lombard and the german aids the foe     who tramples both divided and whose bane     is in the love and brotherhood of men      poor souls far off from all that they hold dear     and in a land that hates them who shall say     that at the bottom of their hearts they bear     love for our tyrant i should like to lay     theyve our hate for him in their pockets here     but that i turned in haste and broke away     i should have kissed a corporal stiff and tall     and like a scarecrow stuck against the wall  note 1 alessandro manzoni   i could not well praise this poem enough without praising it too much it depicts a whole order of things and it brings vividly before us the scene described while its deep feeling is so lightly and effortlessly expressed that one does not know which to like best the exquisite manner or the excellent sense to prove that giusti was really a fine poet i need give nothing more for this alone would imply poetic power not perhaps of the high epic sort but of the kind that gives far more comfort to the heart of mankind amusing and consoling it giusti composed satires but no poems says a french critic but i think most will not after reading this piece agree with him there are satires and satires and some are fierce enough and brutal enough but when a satire can breathe so much tenderness such generous humanity such pity for the means at the same time with such hatred of the source of wrong and all with an air of such smiling pathos i say if it is not poetry it is something better and by all means let us have it instead of poetry it is humor in its best sense and after religion there is nothing in the world can make men so conscious thoughtful and modest  a certain pensiveness very perceptible in st ambrose is the prevailing sentiment of another poem of giustis which i like very much because it is more intelligible than his political satires and because it places the reader in immediate sympathy with a man who had not only the subtlety to depict the faults of the time but the sad wisdom to know that he was no better himself merely for seeing them the poem was written in 1844 and addressed to gino capponi the lifelong friend in whose house giusti died and the descendant of the great gino capponi who threatened the threatening frenchmen when charles viii occupied florence if you sound your trumpets as a call to arms against the florentines we will ring our bells he said  giusti speaks of the part which he bears as a spectator and critic of passing events and then apostrophizes himself      who art thou that a scourge so keen dost bear     and pitilessly dost the truth proclaim     and that so loath of praise for good and fair     so eager art with bitter songs of blame     hast thou achieved in thine ideals pursuit     the secret and the ministry of art     didst thou seek first to kill and to uproot     all pride and folly out of thine own heart     ere turning to teach other men their part                                           o wretched scorn from which alone i sing     thou weariest and saddenest my soul     o butterfly that joyest on thy wing     pausing from bloom to bloom without a goal     and thou that singing of love for evermore     fond nightingale from wood to wood dost go     my life is as a neverending war     of doubts when likened to the peace ye know     and wears what seems a smile and is     a throe  there is another famous poem of giustis in quite a different mood it is called instructions to an emissary sent down into italy to excite a revolution and give austria a pretext for interference and the supposed speaker is an austrian minister it is done with excellent sarcasm and it is useful as light upon a state of things which whether it existed wholly in fact or partly in the suspicion of the italians is equally interesting and curious the poem was written in 1847 when the italians were everywhere aspiring to a national independence and selfgovernment and their rulers were conceding privileges while secretly leaguing with austria to continue the old order of an italy divided among many small tyrants the reader will readily believe that my english is not as good as the italian       instructions to an emissary      you will go into italy you have here       your passport and your letters of exchange     you travel as a count it would appear       going for pleasure and a little change     once there you play the rodomont the queer       crackbrain good fellow idle gamester strange     spendthrift and madcap give yourself full swing     people are taken with that kind of thing      when you beholdand it will happen so       the birds flock down about the net be wary     talk from a warm and open heart and show       yourself with everybody bold and merry     the norths a dungeon say a waste of snow       the very house and home of january     compared with that fair garden of the earth     beautiful free and full of life and mirth      and throwing in your discourse this word free       just to fill up and as by accident     look round among your listeners and see       if it has had at all the effect you meant     beat a retreat if it fails carelessly       talking of this and that but in the event     some one is taken with it never fear     push boldly forward for the road is clear      be bold and shrewd and do not be too quick       as some are and plunge headlong on your prey     when if the snare shall happen not to stick       your uproar frightens all the rest away     to take your hare by carriage is the trick       make a wide circle do not mind delay     experiment and work in silence scheme     with that wise prudence that shall folly seem  the minister bids the emissary turn me into a jest say im sleepy and begin to dote invent what lies you will i give you cartebianche      of governments down yonder say this too       at the cafés and theaters indeed     for this ive made a little sign for you       upon your passport that the wise will read     for an express command to let you do       whatever you think best and take no heed  then the emissary is instructed to make himself center of the party of extremes and in different companies to pity the country to laugh at moderate progress as a sham and to say that the concessions of the local governments are merely ruses to pacify and delude the peopleas in great part they were though giusti and his party did not believe so the instructions to the emissary conclude with the charge to      scatter republican ideas and say       that all the rich and all the welltodo     use common people hardly better nay       worse than their dogs and add some hard words too     declare that breads the question of the day       and that the communists alone are true     and that the foes of the agrarian cause     waste more than half of all by wicked laws  then he tells him when the storm begins to blow and the pockets of the people feel its effect and the mob grows hungry to contrive that there shall be some sort of outbreak with a bit of pillage      so that the kings down there pushed to the wall     for congresses and bayonets shall call      if you should have occasion to spend spend       the money wont be wasted there must be     policemen in retirement spies without end       shameless and penniless buy you are free     if destiny should be so much your friend       that you could shake a throne or two for me     pour me out treasures i shall be content     my gains will be at least seven cent per cent      or in the event the inconstant goddess frown       let me know instantly when you are caught     a thunderbolt shall burst upon your crown       and you become a martyr on the spot     as minister i turn all upside down       our government disowns you as it ought     and so the cake is turned upon the fire     and we can use you next as we desire      in order not to awaken any fear       in the postoffice t is my plan that you     shall always correspond with liberals here       dont doubt but i shall hear of all you do     s a republican known far and near       i havent another spy thats half as true     you understand and i need say no more     lucky for you if you get me up a war  we get the flavor of this at least the literary flavor the satire and the irony but it inevitably falls somewhat cold upon us because it had its origin in a condition of things which though historical are so opposed to all our own experience that they are hard to be imagined yet we can fancy the effect such a poem must have had at the time when it was written upon a people who felt in the midst of their aspirations some disturbing element from without and believed this to be espionage and austrian interference if the poem had also to be passed about secretly from one hand to another its enjoyment must have been still keener but strip it of all these costly and melancholy advantages and it is still a piece of subtle and polished satire  most of giustis poems however are written in moods and manners very different from this there is sparkle and dash in the movement as well as the thought which i cannot reproduce and in giving another poem i can only hope to show something of his varying manner some foreigner lamartine i think called italy the land of the deadwhereupon giusti responded with a poem of that title addressed to his friend gino capponi      the land of the dead      mongst us phantoms of italians       mummies even from our birth     the very babies nurses       help to put them under earth      t is a waste of holy water       when were taken to the font     they that make us pay for burial       swindle us to that amount      in appearance were constructed       much like adams other sons     seem of flesh and blood but really       we are nothing but dry bones      o deluded apparitions       what do you do among men     be resigned to fate and vanish       back into the past again      ah of a perished people       what boots now the brilliant story     why should skeletons be bothering       about liberty and glory      why deck this funeral service       with such pomp of torch and flower     let us without more palaver       growl this requiem of ours  and so the poet recounts the italian names distinguished in modern literature and describes the intellectual activity that prevails in this land of the dead then he turns to the innumerable visitors of italy      o you people hailed down on us       from the living overhead     with what face can you confront us       seeking health among us dead      soon or late this pestilential       clime shall work you harmbeware     even you shall likewise find it       foul and poisonous graveyard air      o ye grim sepulchral friars       ye inquisitorial ghouls     lay down lay down forever       the ignorant censors tools      this wretched gift of thinking       o ye donkeys is your doom     do you care to expurgate us       positively in the tomb      why plant this bayonet forest       on our sepulchers what dread     causes you to place such jealous       custody upon the dead      well the mighty book of nature       chapter first and last must have     yours is now the light of heaven       ours the darkness of the grave      but then if you ask it       we lived greatly in our turn     we were grand and glorious gino      ere our friends up there were born      o majestic mausoleums       city walls outworn with time     to our eyes are even your ruins       apotheosis sublime      o barbarian unquiet       raze each storied sepulcher     with their memories and their beauty       all the lifeless ashes stir      oer these monuments in vigil       cloudless the sun flames and glows     in the wind for funeral torches       and the violet and the rose      and the grape the fig the olive       are the emblems fit of grieving     t is in fact a cemetery       to strike envy in the living      well in fine o brother corpses       let them pipe on as they like     let us see on whom hereafter       such a death as ours shall strike      mongst the anthems of the function       is not dies irae nay     in all the days to come yet       shall there be no judgment day  in a vein of like irony the greater part of giustis political poems are written and none of them is wanting in point and bitterness even to a foreigner who must necessarily lose something of their point and the tang of their local expressions it was the habi the satirist who at least loved the peoples quaintness and originalityand perhaps this is as much democracy as we ought to demand of a poetit was giustis habit to replenish his vocabulary from the fountains of the popular speech by this means he gave his satires a racy local flavor and though he cannot be said to have written dialect since tuscan is the italian language he gained by these words and phrases the frankness and fineness of dialect  but giusti had so much gentleness sweetness and meekness in his heart that i do not like to leave the impression of him as a satirist last upon the reader rather let me close these meager notices with the beautiful little poem said to be the last he wrote as he passed his days in the slow death of the consumptive it is called      a prayer      for the spirit confused     with misgiving and with sorrow     let me my saviour borrow     the light of faith from thee     o lift from it the burden     that bows it down before thee     with sighs and with weeping     i commend myself to thee     my faded life thou knowest     little by little is wasted     like wax before the fire     like snowwreaths in the sun     and for the soul that panteth     for its refuge in thy bosom     break thou the ties my saviour     that hinder it from thee     francesco dall ongaro   i  in the month of march 1848 news came to rome of the insurrection in vienna and a multitude of the citizens assembled to bear the tidings to the austrian ambassador who resided in the ancient palace of the venetian republic the throng swept down the corso gathering numbers as it went and paused in the open space before the palazzo di venezia at its summons the ambassador abandoned his quarters and fled without waiting to hear the details of the intelligence from vienna the people incited by a number of venetian exiles tore down the doubleheaded eagle from the portal and carried it for a more solemn and impressive destruction to the piazza del popolo while a young poet erased the inscription asserting the austrian claim to the palace and wrote in its stead the words palazzo della dieta italiana  the sentiment of national unity expressed in this legend had been the ruling motive of the young poet francesco dall ongaros life and had already made his name famous through the patriotic songs that were sung all over italy garibaldi had chanted one of his stornelli when embarking from montevideo in the spring of 1848 to take part in the italian revolutions of which these little ballads had become the rallyingcries and if the voice of the people is in fact inspired this poet could certainly have claimed the poets longlost honors of prophecy for it was he who had shaped their utterance he had ceased to assume any other sacred authority though educated a priest and at the time when he devoted the palazzo di venezia to the idea of united italy there was probably no person in rome less sacerdotal than he  francesco dall ongaro was born in 1808 at an obscure hamlet in the district of oderzo in the friuli of parents who were small freeholders they removed with their son in his tenth year to venice and there he began his education for the church in the seminary of the madonna della salute the tourist who desires to see the titians and tintorettos in the sacristy of this superb church or to wonder at the cold splendors of the interior of the temple is sometimes obliged to seek admittance through the seminary and it has doubtless happened to more than one of my readers to behold many little sedate old men in their teens lounging up and down the cool humid courts there and trailing their black priestly robes over the springing mold the sun seldom strikes into that sad close and when the boys form into long files two by two and march out for recreation they have a torpid and melancholy aspect upon which the daylight seems to smile in vain they march solemnly up the long zattere with a pale young father at their head and then march solemnly back again sweet genteel pathetic specters of childhood and reënter their common tomb doubtless unenvied by the hungriest and raggedest street boy who asks charity of them as they pass and hoarsely whispers raven when their leader is beyond hearing there is no reason to suppose that a boy born poet among the mountains and full of the wild and free romance of his native scenes could love the life led at the seminary of the salute even though it included the study of literature and philosophy from his childhood dall ongaro had given proofs of his poetic gift and the reverend ravens of the seminary were unconsciously hatching a bird as little like themselves as might be nevertheless dall ongaro left their school to enter the university of padua as student of theology and after graduating took orders and went to este where he lived some time as teacher of belleslettres  at este his life was without scope and he was restless and unhappy full of ardent and patriotic impulses and doubly restricted by his narrow field and his priestly vocation in no long time he had trouble with the bishop of padua and abandoning este seems also to have abandoned the church forever the chief fruit of his sojourn in that quaint and ancient village was a poem entitled ii venerdì santo in which he celebrated some incidents of the life of lord byron somewhat as byron would have done dall ongaros poems however confess the influence of the english poet less than those of other modern italians whom byron infected so much more than his own nation  from este dall ongaro went to trieste where he taught literature and philosophy wrote for the theater and established a journal in which for ten years he labored to educate the people in his ideas of italian unity and progress that these did not coincide with the ideas of most italian dreamers and politicians of the time may be inferred from the fact that he began in 1846 a course of lectures on dante in which he combated the clerical tendencies of gioberti and balbo and criticised the first acts of pius ix he had as profound doubt of papal liberality as niccolini at a time when other patriots were fondly cherishing the hope of a united italy under an italian pontiff and at rome two years later he sought to direct popular feeling from the man to the end in one of the earliest of his graceful stornelli      pio nono      pio nono is a name and not the man       who saws the air from yonder bishops seat     pio nono is the offspring of our brain       the idol of our hearts a vision sweet     pio nono is a banner a refrain       a name that sounds well sung upon the street      who calls long live pio nono means to call     long live our country and goodwill to all     and country and goodwill these signify     that it is well for italy to die     but not to die for a vain dream or hope     not to die for a throne and for a pope  during these years at trieste however dall ongaro seems to have been also much occupied with pure literature and to have given a great deal of study to the sources of national poetry as he discovered them in the popular life and legends he had been touched with the prevailing romanticism he had written hymns like manzoni and like carrer he sought to poetize the traditions and superstitions of his countrymen he found a richer and deeper vein than the venetian poet among his native hills and the neighboring mountains of slavonia but i cannot say that he wrought it to much better effect the two volumes which he published in 1840 contain many ballads which are very graceful and musical but which lack the fresh spirit of songs springing from the popular heart while they also want the airy and delicate beauty of the modern german ballads among the best of them are two which dall ongaro built up from mere lines and fragments of lines current among the people as in later years he more successfully restored us two plays of menander from the plots and a dozen verses of each one may imitate he says more or less fortunately manzoni byron or any other poet but not the simple inspirations of the people and the pilgrim who comes from rome and the rosettina if one could have them complete as they once were would probably make me blush for my elaborate variations but study which was so well directed and yet so conscious of its limitations could not but be of great value and dall ongaro no doubt owed to it his gift of speaking so authentically for the popular heart that which he did later showed that he studied the peoples thought and expression con amore and in no vain sentiment of dilettanteism or antiquarian research or literary patronage  it is not to be supposed that dall ongaros literary life had at this period an altogether objective tendency in the volumes mentioned there is abundant evidence that he was of the same humor as all men of poetic feeling must be at a certain time of life here are pretty verses of occasion upon weddings and betrothals such as people write in italy here are stanzas from albums such as people used to write everywhere here are didactic lines here are bursts of mere sentiment and emotion in the volume of fantasie published at florence in 1866 dall ongaro collected some of the ballads from his early works but left out the more subjective effusions  i give one of these in which under a fantastic name and in a fantastic form the poet expresses the tragic and pathetic interest of the life to which he was himself vowed      the sister of the moon      shine moon ah shine and let thy pensive light              be faithful unto me     i have a sister in the lonely night              when i commune with thee      alone and friendless in the world am i              sorrows forgotten maid     like some poor dove abandoned to die              by her first love unwed      like some poor floweret in a desert land             i pass my days alone     in vain upon the air its leaves expand             in vain its sweets are blown      no loving hand shall save it from the waste             and wear the lonely thing     my heart shall throb upon no loving breast             in my neglected spring      that trouble which consumes my weary soul             no cunning can relieve     no wisdom understand the secret dole             of the sad sighs i heave      my fond heart cherished once a hope a vow             the leaf of autumn gales     in convent gloom a dim lamp burning low             my spirit lacks and fails      i shall have prayers and hymns like some dead saint             painted upon a shrine     but in loves blessed power to fall and faint             it never shall be mine      born to entwine my life with others born             to love and to be wed     apart from all i lead my life forlorn             sorrows forgotten maid      shine moon ah shine and let thy tender light             be faithful unto me     speak to me of the life beyond the night             i shall enjoy with thee   ii  it will here satisfy the strongest love of contrasts to turn from dall ongaro the sentimental poet to dall ongaro the politician and find him on his feet and making a speech at a public dinner given to richard cobden at trieste in 1847 cobden was then as always the advocate of free trade and dall ongaro was then as always the advocate of free government he saw in the union of the italians under a customsbond the hope of their political union and in their emancipation from oppressive imposts their final escape from yet more galling oppression he expressed something of this and though repeatedly interrupted by the police he succeeded in saying so much as to secure his expulsion from trieste  italy was already in a ferment and insurrections were preparing in venice milan florence and rome and dall ongaro consulting with the venetian leaders manin and tommaseo retired to tuscany and took part in the movements which wrung a constitution from the grand duke and preceded the flight of that prince in december he went to rome where he joined himself with the venetian refugees and with other italian patriots like dazeglio and durando who were striving to direct the popular mind toward italian unity the following march he was as we have seen one of the exiles who led the people against the palazzodi venezia in the mean time the insurrection of the glorious five days had taken place at milan and the lombard cities rising one after another had driven out the austrian garrisons dall ongaro went from rome to milan and thence by advice of the revolutionary leaders to animate the defense against the austrians in friuli one of his brothers was killed at palmanuova and another severely wounded treviso whither he had retired falling into the hands of the germans he went to venice then a republic under the presidency of manin and here he established a popular journal which opposed the union of the struggling republic with piedmont under carlo alberto dall ongaro was finally expelled and passed next to ravenna where he found garibaldi who had been banished by the roman government and was in doubt as to how he might employ his sword on behalf of his country in those days the popes moderately liberal minister rossi was stabbed and count pompeo campello an old literary friend and acquaintance of dall ongaro was appointed minister of war with garibaldis consent the poet went to rome and used his influence to such effect that garibaldi was authorized to raise a legion of volunteers and was appointed general of those forces which took so glorious a part in the cause of italian independence soon after when the pope fled to gaeta and the republic was proclaimed dall ongaro and garibaldi were chosen representatives of the people then followed events of which it is still a pang keen to read the troops of the french republic marched upon rome and after a defense more splendid and heroic than any victory the city fell the pope returned and all who loved italy and freedom turned in exile from rome the cities of the romagna tuscany lombardy and venetia had fallen again under the pope the grand duke and the austrians and dall ongaro took refuge in switzerland  illustration francesco dall ongara  without presuming to say whether dall ongaro was mistaken in his political ideas we may safely admit that he was no wiser a politician than dante or petrarch he was an antipapist as these were and like these he opposed an italy of little principalities and little republics but his dream unlike theirs was of a great italian democracy and in 184849 he opposed the union of the italian patriots under carlo alberto because this would have tended to the monarchy   iii  but it is not so much with dall ongaros political opinions that we have to do as with his poetry of the revolutionary period of 1848 as we find in it the little collection of lyrics which he calls stornelli these commemorate nearly all the interesting aspects of that epoch and in their wit and enthusiasm and aspiration we feel the spirit of a race at once the most intellectual and the most emotional in the world whose poets write as passionately of politics as of love arnaud awards dall ongaro the highest praise and declares him the first to formulate in the common language of italy patriotic songs which current on the tongues of the people should also remain the patrimony of the national literature in his popular songs continues this critic dall ongaro has given all that constitutes true good andnot the least meritnovel poetry meter and rhythm second the expression imbue the thought with harmony and develop its symmetry how enviable is that perspicuity which does not oblige you to reread a single line to evolve therefrom the latent idea and we shall have no less to admire the perfect art which never passing the intelligence of the people is never ignoble in sentiment or idea but always as refined as it is natural  i do not know how i could better approach our poet than by first offering this lyric written when in 1847 the people of leghorn rose in arms to repel a threatened invasion of the austrians      the woman of leghorn      adieu livorno adieu paternal walls       perchance i never shall behold you more     on fathers and mothers grave the shadow falls       my love has gone under our flag to war     and i will follow him where fortune calls       i have had a rifle in my hands before      the ball intended for my lovers breast     before he knows it my heart shall arrest     and over his dead comrades visage he     shall pitying stoop and look whom it can be     then he shall see and know that it is i     poor boy how bitterly my love will cry  the italian editor of the stornelli does not give the closing lines too great praise when he declares that they say more than all the lament of tancred over clorinda in this little flight of song we pass over more tragedy than messer torquato could have dreamed in the conquest of many jerusalems for after all there is nothing so tragic as fact the poem is full at once of the grand national impulse and of purely personal and tender devotion and that fluttering vehement purpose thrilling and faltering in alternate lines and breaking into a sob at last is in every syllable the utterance of a womans spirit and a womans nature  quite as womanly though entirely different is this lament which the poet attributes to his sister for their brother who fell at palmanuova may 14 1848      the sister      palma may 14 1848      and he my brother to the fort had gone       and the grenade it struck him in the breast     he fought for liberty and death he won       for country here and found in heaven rest      and now only to follow him i sigh     a new desire has taken me to die     to follow him where is no enemy     where every one lives happy and is free  all hope and purpose are gone from this womans heart for whom italy died in her brother and who has only these artless halfbewildered words of regret to speak and speaks them as if to some tender and sympathetic friend acquainted with all the history going before their abrupt beginning i think it most pathetic and natural also that even in her grief and her aspiration for heaven her words should have the tint of her time and she should count freedom among the joys of eternity  quite as womanly again and quite as different once more is the lyric which the reader will better appreciate when i remind him how the austrians massacred the unarmed people in milan in january 1848 and how later during the five days they murdered their italian prisoners sparing neither sex nor age1  note 1 many foreigners says emilie dandolo in his restrained and temperate history of i volontarii e bersaglieri lombardi have cast a doubt upon the incredible ferocity of the austrians during the five days and especially before evacuating the city but alas the witnesses are too many to be doubted a croat was seen carrying a babe transfixed upon his bayonet all know of those womens hands and ears found in the haversacks of the prisoners of those twelve unhappy men burnt alive at porta tosa of those nineteen buried in a limepit at the castello whose scorched bodies we found i myself ordered with a detachment after the departure of the enemy to examine the castello and neighborhood was horrorstruck at the sight of a babe nailed to a post      the lombard woman      milan january 1848      here take these gaudy robes and put them by       i will go dress me black as widowhood     i have seen blood run i have heard the cry       of him that struck and him that vainly sued     henceforth no other ornament will i       but on my breast a ribbon red as blood      and when they ask what dyed the silk so red     ill say the lifeblood of my brothers dead     and when they ask how it may cleanséd be     ill say o not in river nor in sea     dishonor passes not in wave nor flood     my ribbon ye must wash in german blood  the repressed horror in the lines      i have seen blood run i have heard the cry       of him that struck and him that vainly sued  is the sentiment of a picture that presents the scene to the readers eye as this shuddering woman saw it and the heart of womans fierceness and hate is in that fragment of drama with which the brief poem closes it is the history of an epoch that epoch is now past however so long and so irrevocably past that dall ongaro commented in a note upon the poem the word german is left as a key to the opinions of the time human brotherhood has been greatly promoted since 1848 german is now no longer synonymous with enemy italy has made peace with the peoples and is leagued with them all against their common oppressors  there is still another of these songs in which the heart of womanhood speaks though this time with a voice of pride and happiness      the decoration      my love looks well under his helmets crest       he went to war and did not let them see     his back and so his wound is in the breast       for one he got he struck and gave them three     when he came back i loved him hurt so best       he married me and loves me tenderly      when he goes by and people give him way     i thank god for my fortune every day     when he goes by he seems more grand and fair     than any crossed and ribboned cavalier     the cavalier grew up with his cross on     and i know how my darlings cross was won  this poem like that of la livornese and la donna lombarda is a vivid picture it is a liberated city and the streets are filled with jubilant people the first victorious combats have taken place and it is a wounded hero who passes with his ribbon on his breast as the fond crowd gives way to him his young wife looks on him from her window with an exultant love unshadowed by any possibility of harm      mi menò a moglie e mi vuol tanto bene  this is country and freedom to herthis is strength which despots cannot breakthis is joy to which defeat and ruin can never come nigh it might be any one of the sarcastic and quickwitted people talking politics in the streets of rome in 1847 who sees the newly elected senatorthe head of the roman municipality and the legitimate mediator between pope and peopleas he passes and speaks to him in these lines the dominant feeling of the moment      the cardinals      o senator of rome if true and well       you are reckoned honest in the vatican     let it be yours his holiness to tell       there are many cardinals and not one man      they are made like lobsters and when they are dead     like lobsters change their colors and turn red     and while they are living with their backward gait     displace and tangle good saint peters net  an impulse of the time is strong again in the following stornelloa cry of reproach that seems to follow some recreant from a beleaguered camp of true comrades and to utter the feeling of men who marched to battle through defection and were strong chiefly in their just cause it bears the date of that fatal hour when the king of naples after a brief show of liberality recalled his troops from bologna where they had been acting against austria with the confederated forces of the other italian states and when every man lost to italy was as an ebbing drop of her lifes blood      the deserter      bologna may 1818      never did grain grow out of frozen earth       from the dead branch never did blossom start     if thou lovest not the land that gave thee birth       within thy breast thou bearst a frozen heart     if thou lovest not this land of ancient worth       to love aught else say traitor how thou art      to thine own land thou couldst not faithful be     woe to the woman that puts faith in thee     to him that trusteth in the recreant woe     never from frozen earth did harvest grow     to her that trusteth a deserter shame     out of the dead branch never blossom came  and this song so fine in its picturesque and its dramatic qualities is not less true to the hope of the venetians when they rose in 1848 and intrusted their destinies to daniele manin      the ring of the last doge      i saw the widowed lady of the sea       crownéd with corals and seaweed and shells     who her long anguish and adversity       had seemed to drown in plays and festivals      i said where is thine ancient fealty fled     where is the ring with which manin did wed     his bride with tearful visage she     an eagle with two beaks tore it from me     suddenly i arose and how it came     i know not but i heard my bridegrooms name     poor widow t is not he yet he may bring     who knowsback to the bride her longlost ring  the venetians of that day dreamed that san marco might live again and the fineness and significance of the poem could not have been lost on the humblest in venice where all were quick to beauty and vividly remembered that the last doge who wedded the sea was named like the new president manin  i think the stornelli of the revolutionary period of 1848 have a peculiar value because they embody in forms of artistic perfection the evanescent as well as the enduring qualities of popular feeling they give us what had otherwise been lost in the passing humor of the time they do not celebrate the battles or the great political occurrences if they deal with events at all is it with events that express some belief or longingrather with what people hoped or dreamed than with what they did they sing the friulan volunteers who bore the laurel instead of the olive during holy week in token that the patriotic war had become a religion they remind us that the first fruits of italian longing for unity were the cannons sent to the romans by the genoese they tell us that the tricolor was placed in the hand of the statue of marcus aurelius at the capitol to signify that rome was no more and that italy was to be but the stornelli touch with most effect those yet more intimate ties between national and individual life that vibrate in the hearts of the livornese and the lombard woman of the lover who sees his bride in the patriotic colors of the maiden who will be a sister of charity that she may follow her lover through all perils of the mother who names her newborn babe costanza in the very hour of the venetian republics fall and i like the stornelli all the better because they preserve the generous ardor of the time even in its fondness and excess  after the fall of rome the poet did not long remain unmolested even in his swiss retreat in 1852 the federal council yielded to the instances of the austrian government and expelled dall ongaro from the republic he retired with his sister and nephew to brussels where he resumed the lectures upon dante interrupted by his exile from trieste in 1847 and thus supported his family three years later he gained permission to enter france and up to the springtime of 1859 he remained in paris busying himself with literature and watching events with all an exiles eagerness the war with austria broke out and the poet seized the longcoveted opportunity to return to italy whither he went as the correspondent of a french newspaper on the conclusion of peace at villafranca this journal changed its tone and being no longer in sympathy with dall ongaros opinions he left it baron ricasoli to induce him to make tuscany his home instituted a chair of comparative dramatic literature in connection with the university of pisa and offered it to dall ongaro whose wide general learning and special dramatic studies peculiarly qualified him to hold it he therefore took up his abode at florence dedicating his main industry to a comparative course of ancient and modern dramatic literature and writing his wonderful restorations of menanders phasma and treasure he was well known to the local american and english society and was mourned by many friends when he died there some ten years ago  as with dall ongaro literature had always been but an instrument for the redemption of italy even after his appointment to a university professorship he did not forget this prime object in nearly all that he afterwards wrote he kept the great aim of his life in view and few of the events or hopes of that dreary period of suspense and abortive effort between the conclusion of peace at villafranca and the acquisition of venice went unsung by him indeed some of his most characteristic stornelli belong to this epoch after savoy and nice had been betrayed to france and while the italians waited in angry suspicion for the next demand of their hated ally which might be the surrender of the island of sardinia or the sacrifice of the genoese province but which no one could guess in the impervious napoleonic silence our poet wrote      the imperial egg      milan 1862      who knows what hidden devil it may be       under yon mute grim bird that looks our way     yon silent bird of evil omenhe       that wanting peace breathes discord and dismay     quick quick and change his egg my italy       before there hatch from it some

id rather a goose even from yon egg should come     if only of the breed that once saved rome  the flight of the grand duke from florence in 1859 and his conciliatory address to his late subjects after villafranca in which by fair promises he hoped to win them back to their allegiance the union of tuscany with the kingdom of italy the removal of the austrian flags from milan garibaldis crusade in sicily the movement upon rome in 1862 aspromonteall these events with the shifting phases of public feeling throughout that time the alternate hopes and fears of the italian nation are celebrated in the later stornelli of dall ongaro venice has long since fallen to italy and rome has become the capital of the nation but the unification was not accomplished till garibaldi who had done so much for italy had been wounded by her kings troops in his impatient attempt to expel the french at aspromonte      to my songs      fly o my songs to varignano fly       like some lost flock of swallows homeward flying     and hail me romes dictator who there doth lie       broken with wounds but conquered not nor dying     bid him think on the april that is nigh       month of the flowers and

   as hope comes back to hearts crushed by regret     nay say not this to his heart neer crushed yet  let us conclude these notices with one of the stornelli which is nonpolitical but which i think we wont find the less agreeable for that reason i like it because it says a pretty thing or two very daintily and is interfused with a certain arch and playful spirit which is not so common but we ought to be glad to recognize it      if you are good as you are fair indeed       keep to yourself those sweet eyes i implore     a little flame burns under either lid       that might in old age kindle youth once more     i am like a hermit in his cavern hid       but can i look on you and not adore      fair if you do not mean my misery     those lovely eyes lift upward to the sky     i shall believe you some saint shrined above     and may adore you if i may not love     i shall believe you some bright soul in bliss     and may look on you and not look amiss  i have already noted the more obvious merits of the stornelli and i need not greatly insist upon them their defects are equally plain one sees that their simplicity all but ceases to be a virtue at times and that at times their feeling is too much intellectualized yet for all this we must recognize their excellence and the skill as well as the truth of the poet it is very notable with what directness he expresses his thought and with what discretion he leaves it when expressed the form is always most graceful and the success with which dramatic picturesque and didactic qualities are blent for a sole effect in the brief compass of the poems is not too highly praised in the epithet of novelty nothing is lost for the sake of attitude the actor is absent from the most dramatic touches the painter is not visible in lines which are each a picture the teacher does not appear for the purpose of enforcing the moral it is not the grandest poetry but is true feeling admirable art     giovanni prati   i  the italian poet who most resembles in theme and treatment the german romanticists of the second period was nearest them geographically in his origin giovanni prati was born at dasindo a mountain village of the trentino and his boyhood was passed amidst the wild scenes of that picturesque region whose dark valleys and snowy cloudcapped heights foaming torrents and rolling mists lend their gloom and splendor to so much of his verse his family was poor but it was noble and he received through whatever sacrifice of those who remained at home the education of a gentleman as the italians understand it he went to school in trent and won some early laurels by his latin poems which the good priests who kept the collegio gathered and piously preserved in an album for the admiration and emulation of future scholars when in due time he matriculated at the university of padua as student of law he again shone as a poet and there he wrote his edmenegarda a poem that gave him instant popularity throughout italy when he quitted the university he visited different parts of the country having the need of frequent change of scenes and impressions but everywhere he poured out songs ballads and romances and was already a voluminous poet in 1840 when in his thirtieth year he began to abandon his teutonic phantoms and hectic maidens and to make italy in various disguises the heroine of his song whether austria penetrated these disguises or not he was a little later ordered to leave milan he took refuge in piedmont whose brave king in spite of diplomatic remonstrances from his neighbors made prati his poeta cesareo or poet laureate this was in 1843 and five years later he took an active part in inciting with his verse the patriotic revolts which broke out all over italy but he was supposed by virtue of his office to be monarchical in his sympathies and when he ventured to florence the novelist guerrezzi who was at the head of the revolutionary government there sent the poet back across the border in charge of a carbineer in 1851 he had the misfortune to write a poem in censure of orsinis attempt upon the life of napoleon iii and to take money for it from the gratified emperor he seems to have remained up to his death in the enjoyment of his office at turin his latest poem if one may venture to speak of any as the last among poems poured out with such bewildering rapidity was satan and the graces which de sanctis made himself very merry over  the edmenegarda which first won him repute was perhaps not more youthful but it was a subject that appealed peculiarly to the heart of youth and was sufficiently mawkish all the characters of the edmenegarda were living at the time of its publication and were instantly recognized yet there seems to have been no complaint against the poet on their part nor any reproach on the part of criticism indeed at least one of the characters was nattered by the celebrity given him so great says pratis biographer in the gallerìa nazionale was the enthusiasm awakened everywhere and in every heart by the edmenegarda that the young man portrayed in it under the name of leoni imagining himself to have become through pratis merit an eminently poetical subject presented himself to the poet in the caffè pedrocchi at padua and returned him his warmest thanks prati also made the acquaintance at the caffè nazionale in turin of his edmenegarda but after the wrinkles had seamed the visage of his ideal and canceled perhaps from her soul the memory of anguish suffered if we are to believe this writer the story of a wifes betrayal abandonment by her lover and repudiation by her husband produced effects upon the italian public as various as profound in this pathetic story of an unhappy love was found so much truth of passion so much naturalness of sentiment and so much power that every sad heart was filled with love for the young poet so compassionate toward innocent misfortune so sympathetic in form in thought in sentiment prom that moment prati became the poet of suffering youth in every corner of italy the tender verses of the edmenegarda were read with love and sometimes frenzied passion the political prisoners of rome of naples and palermo found them a grateful solace amid the privations and heavy tedium of incarceration many sundered lovers were reconjoined indissolubly in the kiss of peace more than one desperate girl was restrained from the folly of suicide and even the students in the ecclesiastical seminaries at milan revolted as it were against their rector and petitioned the archbishop of gaisruk that they might be permitted to read the fantastic romance  illustration giovanni prati  what he was at first prati seems always to have remained in character and in ideals would you know the poet in ordinary of the king of sardinia says marcmonnier go up the great street of the po under the arcades to the left around the caffè florio which is the center of turin if you meet a great youngster of forty years with brown hair wandering eyes long visage lengthened by the imperial prominent nose diminished by the mustachegood head in fine and proclaiming the artist at first glance say to yourself that this is he give him your hand and he will give you his he is the openest of italians and the best fellow in the world it is here that he lives under the arcades do not look for his dwelling he does not dwell he promenades life for him is not a combat nor a journey it is a saunter flânerie cigar in mouth eyes to the wind a comrade whom he meets and passes a pleasant word with a group of men who talk politics and leave you to read the newspapers puis cà et là par hasard une bonne fortune a woman or an artist who understands you and who listens while you talk of art or repeat your verses prati lives so the whole year round from time to time he disappears for a week or two where is he nobody knows you grow uneasy you ask his address he has none some say he is ill others he is dead but some fine morning cheerful as ever he reappears under the arcades he has come from the bottom of a wood or the top of a mountain and he has made two thousand verses he is hardly fortyone years old and he has already written a million lines i have read seven volumes of his and i have not read all  i have not myself had the patience here boasted by m marcmonnier but three or four volumes of pratis have sufficed to teach me the spirit and purpose of his poetry born in 1815 and breathing his first inspirations from that sense of romance blowing into italy with every northern galea son of the italian tyrol the region where the fire meets the snowhe has some excuse if not a perfect reason for being halfgerman in his feeling it is natural that prati should love the ballad form above all and should pour into its easy verse the wild legends heard during a boyhood passed among mountains and mountaineers as i read his poetic tales with a little heartbreak more or less fictitious in each i seem to have found again the sweet german songs that fluttered away out of my memory long ago there is a tender light on the pages a mistier passion than that of the south breathes through the dejected lines and in the ballads we see all our old acquaintance once morethe dying girls the galloping horsemen the moonbeams the familiar inconsequent phantomsscarcely changed in the least and only betraying now and then that they have been at times in the bad company of lara and medora and other dissipated and vulgar people the following poem will give some proof of all this and will not unfairly witness of the quality of prati in most of the poetry he has written      the midnight ride      i      ruello ruello devour the way       on your breath bear us with you o winds as ye swell

was born a poet in the village of san giorgio near verona of parents who endowed their son with the magnificent name of aleardo aleardi his father was one of those small proprietors numerous in the veneto and though not indigent was by no means a rich man he lived on his farm and loved it and tried to improve the condition of his tenants aleardos childhood was spent in the countrya happy fortune for a boy anywhere the happiest fortune if that country be italy and its scenes the grand and beautiful scenes of the valley of the adige here he learned to love nature with the passion that declares itself everywhere in his verse and hence he was in due time taken and placed at school in the collegio note not a college in the american sense but a private school of a high grade of sant anastasia in verona according to the italian system now fallen into disuse of fitting a boy for the world by giving him the training of a cloister it is not greatly to aleardis discredit that he seemed to learn nothing there and that he drove his reverend preceptors to the desperate course of advising his removal they told his father he would make a good farmer but a scholar never they nicknamed him the mole for his dullness but in the mean time he was making underground progress of his own and he came to the surface one day a mole no longer to everybodys amazement but a thing of such flight and song as they had never seen beforein fine a poet he was rather a scapegrace after he ceased to be a mole at school but when he went to the university at padua he became conspicuous among the idle dissolute students of that day for temperate life and severe study there he studied law and learned patriotism political poetry and interviews with the police were the consequence but no serious trouble  one of the offensive poems which he says he and his friends had the audacity to call an ode was this      sing we our country t is a desolate           and frozen cemetery           over its portals undulates           a banner black and yellow           and within it throng the myriad           phantoms of slaves and kings      a man on a wornout tottering           throne watches oer the tombs           the pallid lord of consciences           the despot of ideas           tricoronate he vaunts himself           and without crown is he  in this poem the yellow and black flag is of course the austrian and the enthroned man is the pope of whose temporal power our poet was always the enemy the austrian police says aleardis biographer like an affectionate mother anxious about everything came into possession of these verses and the author was admonished in the way of maternal counsel not to touch such topics if he would not lose the favor of the police and be looked on as a prodigal son he had already been admonished for carrying a cane on the top of which was an old italian pound or lira with the inscription kingdom of italyfor it was an offense to have such words about one in any way so trivial and petty was the cruel government that once reigned over the italians  in due time he took that garland of paper laurel and gilt pasteboard with which the graduates of padua are sublimely crowned and returned to verona where he entered the office of an advocate to learn the practical workings of the law these disgusted him naturally enough and it was doubtless far less to the hurt of his feelings than of his fortune that the government always refused him the post of advocate  in this time he wrote his first long poem arnaldo which was published at milan in 1842 and which won him immediate applause it was followed by the tragedy of bragadino and in the year 1845 he wrote le prime storie which he suffered to lie unpublished for twelve years it appeared in verona in 1857 a year after the publication of his monte circellio written in 1846  illustration aleardo aleardi  the revolution of 1848 took place the austrians retired from the dominion of venice and a provisional republican government under the presidency of daniele manin was established and aleardi was sent as one of its plenipotentiaries to paris where he learnt how many fine speeches the friends of a struggling nation can make when they do not mean to help it the young venetian republic fell aleardi left paris and after assisting at the ceremony of being bombarded in bologna retired to genoa he later returned to verona and there passed several years of tranquil study in 1852 for the part he had taken in the revolution he was arrested and imprisoned in the fortress at mantua thus fulfilling the destiny of an italian poet of those times  all the circumstances and facts of this arrest and imprisonment are so characteristic of the austrian method of governing italy that i do not think it out of place to give them with some fullness in the year named the austrians were still avenging themselves upon the patriots who had driven them out of venetia in 1848 and their courts were sitting in mantua for the trial of political prisoners many of whom were exiled sentenced to long imprisonment or put to death aleardi was first confined in the military prison at verona but was soon removed to mantua whither several of his friends had already been sent all the other prisons being full he was thrust into a place which till now had seemed too horrible for use it was a narrow room dark and reeking with the dampness of the great dead lagoon which surrounds mantua a broken window guarded by several gratings let in a little light from above the day in that cell lasted six hours the night eighteen a mattress on the floor and a can of water for drinking were the furniture in the morning they brought him two pieces of hard black bread at ten oclock a thick soup of rice and potatoes and nothing else throughout the day in this dungeon he remained sixty days without books without pen or paper without any means of relieving the terrible gloom and solitude at the end of this time he was summoned to the hall above to see his sister whom he tenderly loved the light blinded him so that for a while he could not perceive her but he talked to her calmly and even cheerfully that she might not know what he had suffered then he was remanded to his cell where as her retreating footsteps ceased upon his ear he cast himself upon the ground in a passion of despair three months passed and he had never seen the face of judge or accuser though once the prison inspector with threats and promises tried to entrap him into a confession one night his sleep was broken by a continued hammering in the morning half a score of his friends were hanged upon the gallows which had been built outside his cell  by this time his punishment had been so far mitigated that he had been allowed a german grammar and dictionary and for the first time studied that language on the literature of which he afterward lectured in florence he had like most of the young venetians of his day hated the language together with those who spoke it until then  at last one morning at dawn a few days after the execution of his friends aleardi and others were thrust into carriages and driven to the castle there the roll of the prisoners was called to several names none answered for those who had borne them were dead were the survivors now to be shot or sentenced to some prison in bohemia or hungary they grimly jested among themselves as to their fate they were marched out into the piazza under the heavy rain and there these men who had not only not been tried for any crime but had not even been accused of any received the grace of the imperial pardon  aleardi returned to verona and to his books publishing another poem in 1856 called le città italiane marinare e commercianti his next publication was in 1857 rafaello e la fornarina then followed un ora della mia giovinezza le tre fiume and le tre fanciulle in 1858  the war of 1859 broke out between austria and france and italy aleardi spent the brief period of the campaign in a military prison at verona where his sympathies were given an ounce of prevention he had committed no offense but at midnight the police appeared examined his papers found nothing and bade him rise and go to prison after the peace of villafranca he was liberated and left the austrian states retiring first to brescia and then to florence his publications since 1859 have been a canto politico and i sette soldati he was condemned for his voluntary exile by the austrian courts and i remember reading in the newspapers the official invitation given him to come back to verona and be punished but oddly enough he declined to do so   ii  the first considerable work of aleardi was le prime storie primal histories in which he traces the course of the human race through the scriptural story of its creation its fall and its destruction by the deluge through the greek and latin days through the darkness and glory of the feudal times down to our ownfollowing it from eden to babylon and tyre from tyre and babylon to athens and rome from florence and genoa to the shores of the new world full of shadowy tradition and the promise of a peaceful and happy future  he takes this fruitful theme because he feels it to be alive with eternal interest and rejects the wellworn classic fables because      under the bushes of the odorous mint     the dryads are buried and the placid dian     guides now no longer through the nights below     th invulnerable hinds and pearly car     to bless the carian shepherds dreams no more     the valley echoes to the stolen kisses     or to the twanging bow or to the bay     of the immortal hounds or to the fauns     plebeian laughter from the golden rim     of shells dewy with pearl in oceans depths     the snowy loveliness of galatea     has fallen and with her their endless sleep     in coral sepulchers the nereids     forgotten sleep in peace  the poet cannot turn to his theme however without a sad and scornful apostrophe to his own land where he figures himself sitting by the way and craving of the frivolous heartless luxurious italian throngs that pass the charity of love for italy they pass him by unheeded and he cries                               hast thou seen     in the deep circle of the valley of siddim     under the shining skies of palestine     the sinister glitter of the lake of asphalt     those coasts strewn thick with ashes of damnation     forever foe to every living thing     where rings the cry of the lost wandering bird     that on the shore of the perfidious sea     athirsting diesthat watery sepulcher     of the five cities of iniquity     where even the tempest when its clouds hang low     passes in silence and the lightning dies     if thou hast seen them bitterly hath been     thy heart wrung with the misery and despair     of that dread vision                               yet there is on earth     a woe more desperate and miserable     a spectacle wherein the wrath of god     avenges him more terribly it is     a vain weak people of faintheart old men     that for three hundred years of dull repose     has lain perpetual dreamer folded in     the ragged purple of its ancestors     stretching its limbs wide in its countrys sun     to warm them drinking the soft airs of autumn     forgetful on the fields where its forefathers     like lions fought from overflowing hands     strew we with hellebore and poppies thick     the way  but the throngs have passed by and the poet takes up his theme abel sits before an altar upon the borders of eden and looks with an exiles longing toward the paradise of his father where high above all the other trees he beholds      lording it proudly in the gardens midst     the guilty apple with its fatal beauty  he weeps and cain furiously returning from the unaccepted labor of the fields lifts his hand against his brother                          it was at sunset     the air was severed with a mothers shriek     and stretched beside the oerturned altars foot     lay the first corse                          ah that primal stain     of blood that made earth hideous did forebode     to all the nations of mankind to come      the cruel household stripes and the relentless     battles of civil wars the poisoned cup     the gleam of axes lifted up to strike     the prone necks on the block                         the fratricide     beheld that blood amazed and from on high     he heard the awful voice of cursing leap     and in the middle of his forehead felt     gods lightning strike                      and there from out the heart     all stained with guiltiness emerged the coward     religion that is born of loveless fears      and moved and shaken like a conscious thing     the tree of sin dilated horribly     its frondage over all the land and sea     and with its poisonous shadow followed far     the flight of cain                          and he who first     by th arduous solitudes and by the heights     and labyrinths of the virgin earth conducted     this everwandering lost humanity     was the accursed  cain passes away and his children fill the world and the joy of guiltless labor brightens the poets somber verse      the murmur of the works of man arose     up from the plains the caves reverberated     the blows of restless hammers that revealed     deep in the bowels of the fruitful hills     the iron and the faithless gold with rays     of evil charm and all the cliffs repeated     the beetles fall and the unceasing leap     of waters on the paddles of the wheel     volubly busy and with heavy strokes     upon the borders of the inviolate woods     the ax was heard descending on the trees     upon the odorous bark of mighty pines     over the imminent uplands utmost brink     the blonde wildgoat stretched forth his neck to meet     the unknown sound and caught with sudden fear     down the steep bounded and the arrow cut     midway the flight of his aerial foot  so all the wild earth was tamed to the hand of man and the wisdom of the stars began to reveal itself to the shepherds      who in the leisure of the argent nights     leading their flocks upon a sea of meadows  turned their eyes upon the heavenly bodies and questioned them in their courses but a taint of guilt was in all the blood of cain which the deluge alone could purge      and beautiful beyond all utterance     were the earths firstborn daughters phantasms these     that now enamor us decrepit by     the light of that prime beauty and the glance     those ardent sinners darted had beguiled     gods angels even so that the lords command     was weaker than the bidding of their eyes     and there were seen descending from on high     his messengers and in the tepid eyes     gathering their flight about the secret founts     where came the virgins wandering sole to stretch     the nude pomp of their perfect loveliness     caught by some sudden flash of light afar     the shepherd looked and deemed that he beheld     a fallen star and knew not that he saw     a fallen angel whose distended wings     all tremulous with voluptuous delight     strove vainly to lift him to the skies again     the earth with her malign embraces blest     the heavenlyborn and they straightway forgot     the joys of gods eternal paradise     for the brief rapture of a guilty love     and from these nuptials violent and strange     a strange and violent race of giants rose     a chain of sin had linked the earth to heaven     and god repented him of his own work  the destroying rains descended                            and the ocean rose     and on the cities and the villages     the terror fell apace there was a strife     of suppliants at the altars blasphemy     launched at the impotent idols and the kings     there were embraces desperate and dear     and news of suddenest forgivenesses     and a relinquishment of all sweet things     and guided onward by the pallid prophets     the people climbed with lamentable cries     in pilgrimage up the mountains                            but in vain     for swifter than they climbed the ocean rose     and hid the palms and buried the sepulchers     far underneath the buried pyramids     and the victorious billow swelled and beat     at eagles alpine nests extinguishing     all lingering breath of life and dreadfuller     than the yell rising from the battlefield     seemed the hush of every human sound        on the high solitude of the waters naught     was seen but here and there unfrequently     a frail raft heaped with languid men that fought     weakly with one another for the grass     hanging about a cliff not yet submerged     and here and there a drowned mans head and here     and there a file of birds that beat the air     with weary wings  after the deluge the race of noah repeoples the empty world and the history of mankind begins anew in the orient rome is built and the christian era dawns and rome falls under the feet of the barbarians then the enthusiasm of christendom sweeps toward the east in the repeated crusades and then after long years of twilight dante the sun of italian civilization rises and at last comes the dream of another world unknown to the eyes of elder times        but between that and our shore roared diffuse     abysmal seas and fabulous hurricanes     which thought on blanched the faces of the bold     for the dread secret of the heavens was then     the western world yet on the italian coasts     a boy grew into manhood in whose soul     the instinct of the unknown continent burned     he saw in his prophetic mind depicted     the opposite visage of the earth and turning     with joyful defiance to the ocean sailed     forth with two secret pilots god and genius     last of the prophets he returned in chains     and glory  in the new world are the traces as in the old of a restless humanity wandering from coast to coast growing building cities and utterly vanishing there are graves and ruins everywhere and the poets thought returns from these scenes of unstoried desolation to follow again the course of man in the old world annals but here also he is lost in the confusion of mans advance and retirement and he muses      how many were the peoples where the trace     of their lost steps where the funereal fields     in which they sleep go ask the clouds of heaven     how many bolts are hidden in their breasts     and when they shall be launched and ask the path     that they shall keep in the unfurrowed air     the peoples passed obscure as destiny     forever stirred by secret hope forever     waiting upon the promised mysteries     unknowing god that urged them turning still     to some kind starthey swept oer the seaweed     in unknown waters fearless swam the course     of nameless rivers wrote with flying feet     the mountain pass on pathless snows impatient     of rest for aye from babylon to memphis     from the acropolis to rome they hurried        and with them passed their guardian household gods     and faithful wisdom of their ancestors     and the seed sown in mother fields and gathered     a fruitful harvest in their happier years     and companying the order of their steps     upon the way they sung the choruses     and sacred burdens of their countrys songs     and sitting down by hospitable gates     they told the histories of their faroff cities     and sometimes in the lonely darknesses     upon the ambiguous way they found a light     the deathless lamp of some great truth that heaven     sent in compassionate answer to their prayers        but not to all was given it to endure     that ceaseless pilgrimage and not on all     did the heavens smile perennity of life     revirginate with neverceasing change     and when it had completed the great work     which god had destined for its race to do     sometimes a weary people laid them down     to rest them like a weary man and left     their nude bones in a vale of expiation     and passed away as utterly forever     as mist that snows itself into the sea  the poet views this growth of nations from youth to decrepitude and coming back at last to himself and to his own laud and time breaks forth into a lament of grave and touching beauty      muse of an aged people in the eve     of fading civilization i was born     of kindred that have greatly expiated     and greatly wept for me the ambrosial fingers     of graces never wove the laurel crown     but the fates shadowed from my youngest days     my brow with passionflowers and i have lived     unknown to my dear land oh fortunate     my sisters that in the heroic dawn     of races sung to them did destiny give     the virgin fire and chaste ingenuousness     of their lands speech and reverenced their hands     ran over potent strings to me the hopes     turbid with hate to me the senile rage     to me the painted fancies clothed by art     degenerate to me the desperate wish     not in my soul to nurse ungenerous dreams     but to contend and with the sword of song     to fight my battles too  such is the spirit such is the manner of the prime storie of aleardi the merits of the poem are so obvious that it seems scarcely profitable to comment upon its picturesqueness upon the clearness and ease of its style upon the art which quickens its frequent descriptions of nature with a human interest the defects of the poem are quite as plain and i have again to acknowledge the critical acuteness of arnaud who says of aleardi instead of synthetizing his conceptions and giving relief to the principal lines the poet lingers caressingly upon the particulars preferring the descriptive to the dramatic element prom this results poetry of beautiful arabesques and exquisite fragments of harmonious verse and brilliant diction  nevertheless the same critic confesses that the poetry of aleardi is not academically common and pleases by the originality of its very mannerism   iii  like primal histories the hour of my youth is a contemplative poem to which frequency of episode gives life and movement but its scope is less grand and the poet recalling his early days remembers chiefly the events of defeated revolution which give such heroic sadness and splendor to the history of the first third of this century the work is characterized by the same opulence of diction and the same luxury of epithet and imagery as the primal histories but it somehow fails to win our interest in equal degree perhaps because the patriot now begins to overshadow the poet and appeal is often made rather to the sympathies than the imagination it is certain that art ceases to be less and country more in the poetry of aleardi from this time it could scarcely be otherwise and had it been otherwise the poet would have become despicable not great in the eyes of his countrymen  the hour of my youth opens with a picture where for once at least all the brilliant effects are synthetized the poet has ordered here the whole northern world and you can dream of nothing grand or beautiful in those lonely regions which you do not behold in it      ere yet upon the unhappy arctic lands     in dying autumn erebus descends     with the nights thousand hours along the verge     of the horizon like a fugitive     through the long days wanders the weary sun     and when at last under the wave is quenched     the last gleam of its golden countenance     interminable twilight land and sea     discolors and the northwind covers deep     all things in snow as in their sepulchers     the dead are buried in the distances     the shock of warring cyclades of ice     makes music as of wild and strange lament     and up in heaven now tardily are lit     the solitary polar star and seven     lamps of the bear and now the warlike race     of swans gather their hosts upon the breast     of some far gulf and bidding their farewell     to the white cliffs and slender junipers     and seaweed bridalbeds intone the song     of parting and a sad metallic clang     send through the mists upon their southward way     they greet the beryltinted icebergs greet     flamy volcanoes and the seething founts     of geysers and the melancholy yellow     of the icelandic fields and wearying     their lily wings amid the boreal lights     journey away unto the joyous shores     of morning  in a strain of equal nobility but of more personal and subjective effect the thought is completed      so likewise my own soul from these obscure     days without glory wings its flight afar     backward and journeys to the years of youth     and morning oh give me back once more     oh give me lord one hour of youth again     for in that time i was serene and bold     and uncontaminate and enraptured with     the universe i did not know the pangs     of the proud mind nor the sweet miseries     of love and i had never gathered yet     after those fires so sweet in burning bitter     handfuls of ashes that with tardy tears     sprinkled at last have nourished into bloom     the solitary flower of penitence     the baseness of the many was unknown     and civic woes had not yet sown with salt     lifes narrow field ah then the infinite     voices that nature sends her worshipers     from land from sea and from the cloudy depths     of heaven smote the echoing soul of youth     to music and at the first morning sigh     of the poor woodlarkat the measured bell     of homeward flocks and at the opaline wings     of dragonflies in their aërial dances     above the gorgeous carpets of the marsh     at the winds moan and at the sudden gleam     of lamps lighting in some far town by night     and at the dash of rain that april shoots     through the air odorous with the smitten dust     my spirits rose and glad and swift my thought     over the sea of being sped allsails  there is a description of a battle in the hour of my youth which i cannot help quoting before i leave the poem the battle took place between the austrians and the french on the 14th of january 1797 in the chiusa a narrow valley near verona and the fiercest part of the fight was for the possession of the hill of rivoli                       clouds of smoke     floated along the heights and with her wild     incessant echo chiusa still repeated     the harmony of the muskets rival hosts     contended for the poverty of a hill     that scarce could give their number sepulcher     but from that hillcrest waved the glorious locks     of victory and round its bloody spurs     taken and lost with fierce vicissitude     serried and splendid swept and tempested     longhaired dragoons together with the might     of the homeric foot delirious     with fury and the horses with their teeth     tore one another or tossing wild their manes     fled with their helpless riders up the crags     by strait and imminent paths of rock till down     like angels thundersmitten to the depths     of that abyss the riders fell with slain     was heaped the dreadful amphitheater     the rocks dropped blood and if with gasping breath     some wounded swimmer beat away the waves     weakly between him and the other shore     the merciless riflemen from the cliffs above     with their inexorable aim beneath     the waters sunk him  the monte circellio is part of a poem in four cantos dispersed it is said to avoid the researches of the police in which the poet recounts in picturesque verse the glories and events of the italian land and history through which he passes a slender but potent cord of common feeling unites the episodes and the lament for the present fate of italy rises into hope for her future more than half of the poem is given to a description of the geological growth of the earth in which the imagination of the poet has unbridled range and in which there is a success unknown to most other attempts to poetize the facts of science the epochs of darkness and inundation of the monstrous races of bats and lizards of the mammoths and the gigantic vegetation pass and after thousands of years the earth is tempered and purified to the use of man by fire and that               paradise of land and sea forever     stirred by great hopes and by volcanic fires     called italy  takes shape its burning mountains rise its valleys sink its plains extend its streams run but first of all the hills of rome lifted themselves from the waters that day when the spirit of god dwelling upon their face      saw a fierce group of seven enkindled hills     in number like the mystic candles lighted     within his future temple then he bent     upon that mystic pleiades of flame     his luminous regard and spoke to it     thou art to be my rome the harmony     of that note to the nebulous heights supreme     and to the bounds of the created world     rolled like the voice of myriad organstops     and sank and ceased the heavenly orbs resumed     their daily dance and their unending journey     a mighty rush of plumes disturbed the rest     of the vast silence here and there like stars     about the sky flashed the immortal eyes     of choral angels following after him  the opening lines of monte circellio are scarcely less beautiful than the first part of un ora della mia giovinezza but i must content myself with only one other extract from the poem leaving the rest to the reader of the original the fact that every summer the roman hospitals are filled with the unhappy peasants who descend from the hills of the abruzzi to snatch its harvests from the feverish campagna will help us to understand all the meaning of the following passage though nothing could add to its pathos unless perhaps the story given by aleardi in a note at the foot of his page how do you live here asked a traveler of one of the peasants who reap the campagna the abruzzese answered signor we die                                       what time     in hours of summer sad with so much light     the sun beats ceaselessly upon the fields     the harvesters as famine urges them     draw hither in thousands and they wear     the look of those that dolorously go     in exile and already their brown eyes     are heavy with the poison of the air     here never note of amorous bird consoles     their drooping hearts here never the gay songs     of their abruzzi sound to gladden these     pathetic hands but taciturn they toil     reaping the harvest for their unknown lords     and when the weary tabor is performed     taciturn they retire and not till then     their bagpipes crown the joys of the return     swelling the heart with their familiar strain     alas not all return for there is one     that dying in the furrow sits and seeks     with his last look some faithful kinsman out     to give his lifes wage that he carry it     unto his trembling mother with the last     words of her son that comes no more and dying     deserted and alone far off he hears     his comrades going with their pipes in time     joyfully measuring their homeward steps     and when in after years an orphan comes     to reap the harvest here and feels his blade     go quivering through the swaths of falling grain     he weeps and thinks haply these heavy stalks     ripened on his unburied fathers bones  in the poem called the marine and commercial cities of italy le città italiane marinare e commercianti aleardi recounts the glorious rise the jealousies the fratricidal wars and the ignoble fall of venice florence pisa and genoa in strains of grandeur and pathos he has pride in the wealth and freedom of those old queens of traffic and scorn and lamentation for the blind selfishness that kept them venetian florentine pisan and genoese and never suffered them to be italian i take from this poem the prophetic vision of the greatness of venice which according to the patriotic tradition of sabellico saint mark beheld five hundred years before the foundation of the city when one day journeying toward aquileja his ship lost her course among the islands of the lagoons the saint looked out over those melancholy swamps and saw the phantom of a byzantine cathedral rest upon the reeds while a multitudinous voice broke the silence with the venetian battlecry viva san marco the lines that follow illustrate the pride and splendor of venetian story and are notable i think for a certain lofty grace of movement and opulence of diction      there thou shalt lie o saint1 but compassed round     thickly by shining groves     of pillars on thy regal portico     lifting their glittering and impatient hooves     corinths fierce steeds shall bound2     and at thy name the hymn of future wars     from their funereal caves     the bandits of the waves     shall fly in exile3 brought from bloody fields     hard won and lost in faroff palestine     the glimmer of a thousand arab moons     shall fill thy broad lagoons     and on the false byzantines towers shall climb     a blind old man sublime4     whom victory shall behold     amidst his enemies with thy sacred flag     all battlerent unrolled  notes  1 the bones of st mark repose in his church at venice  2 the famous bronze horses of st marks still shine with the gold that once covered them  3 venice early swept the adriatic of the pirates who infested it  4 the doge enrico dandolo who though blind and bowed with eighty years of war was the first to plant the banner of saint mark on the walls of constantinople when that city was taken by the venetians and crusaders   the late poems of aleardi are nearly all in this lyrical form in which the thought drops and rises with ceaseless change of music and which wins the reader of many empty italian canzoni by the mere delight of its movement it is well adapted to the subjects for which aleardi has used it it has a stateliness and strength of its own and its alternate lapse and ascent give animation to the everblending story and aspiration appeal or reflection in this measure are written the three rivers the three maidens and the seven soldiers the latter is a poem of some length in which the poet figuring himself upon a battlefield on the morrow after a combat between italians and austrians wanders among the wounded in search of expiated sins and of unknown heroism he pauses continues his eloquent biographer in the galleria nazionale to meditate on the death of the hungarian polish bohemian croatian austrian and tyrolese soldiers who personify the nationalities oppressed by the tyranny of the house of hapsburg a minister of god praying beside the corpses of two friends pole and hungarian hails the dawn of the magyar resurrection then rises the grand figure of sandor petofi the patriotic poet of hungary whose life was a hymn and whose miraculous reappearance will according to popular superstition take place when hungary is freed from her chains the poem closes with a prophecy concerning the destinies of austria and italy like all the poems of aleardi it abounds in striking lines but the interest instead of gathering strongly about one central idea diffuses itself over halfforgotten particulars of revolutionary history and the sympathy of the reader is fatigued and confused with the variety of the demand upon it  for this reason the three rivers and the three maidens are more artistic poems in the former the poet seeks vainly a promise of italian greatness and unity on the banks of tiber and of arno but finds it by the po where the war of 1859 is beginning in the latter three maidens recount to the poet stories of the oppression which has imprisoned the father of one despoiled anothers house through the taxgatherer and sent the brother of the third to languish the soldierslave of his tyrants in a land where the wife washes the garments of her husband yet stained with italian blood  a very little book holds all the poems which aleardi has written and i have named them nearly all he has in greater degree than any other italian poet of this age or perhaps of any age those qualities which english taste of this time demandsquickness of feeling and brilliancy of expression he lacks simplicity of idea and his style is an opal which takes all lights and hues rather than the crystal which lets the daylight colorlessly through he is distinguished no less by the themes he selects than by the expression he gives them in his poetry there is passion but his subjects are usually those to which love is accessory rather than essential and he cares better to sing of universal and national destinies as they concern individuals than the raptures and anguishes of youthful individuals as they concern mankind the poet may be wrong in this but he achieves an undeniable novelty in it and i confess that i read him willingly on account of it  in taking leave of him i feel that i ought to let him have the last word which is one of selfcriticism and i think singularly just he refers to the fact of his early life that his father forbade him to be a painter and says not being allowed to use the pencil i have used the pen and precisely on this account my pen resembles too much a pencil precisely on this account i am too much of a naturalist and am too fond of losing myself in minute details i am as one who in walking goes leisurely along and stops every moment to observe the dash of light that breaks through the trees of the woods the insect that alights on his hand the leaf that falls on his head a cloud a wave a streak of smoke in fine the thousand accidents that make creation so rich so various so poetical and beyond which we evermore catch glimpses of that grand mysterious something eternal immense benignant and never inhuman or cruel as some would have us believe which is called god     guilio carcano arnaldo fusinato and luigi mercantini   no one could be more opposed in spirit and method to aleardo aleardi than giulio carcano but both of these poets betray love and study of english masters in the former there is something to remind us of milton of ossian who is still believed a poet in latin countries and of byron and in the latter arnaud notes very obvious resemblances to gray crabbe and wordsworth in the simplicity or the proud humility of the theme and the courage of its treatment the critic declares the poets aesthetic creed to be god the family and country and in a beautiful essay on domestic poetry written amidst the universal political discouragement of 1839 carcano himself declares that in the cultivation of a popular and homelike feeling in literature the hope of italy no less than of italian poetry lies he was ready to respond to the impulses of the nations heart which he had felt in his communion with its purest and best life when in later years its expectation gave place to action and many of his political poems are bold and noble but his finest poems are those which celebrate the affections of the household and poetize the pathetic beauty of toil and poverty in city and country he sings with a tenderness peculiarly winning of the love of mothers and children and i shall give the best notion of the poets best in the following beautiful lullaby premising merely that the title of the poem is the italian infantile for sleep      sleep sleep sleep my little girl     mother is near thee sleep unfurl     thy veil oer the cradle where baby lies     dream baby of angels in the skies     on the sorrowful earth in hopeless quest     passes the exile without rest     whereer he goes in sun or snow     trouble and pain beside him go      but when i look upon thy sleep     and hear thy breathing soft and deep     my soul turns with a faith serene     to days of sorrow that have been     and i feel that of love and happiness     heaven has given my life excess     the lord in his mercy gave me thee     and thou in truth art part of me      thou knowest not as i bend above thee     how much i love thee how much i love thee     thou art the very life of my heart     thou art my joy thou art my smart     thy day begins uncertain child     thou art a blossom in the wild     but over thee with his wings abroad     blossom watches the angel of god      ah wherefore with so sad a face     must thy father look on thy happiness     in thy little bed he kissed thee now     and dropped a tear upon thy brow     lord to this mute and pensive soul     temper the sharpness of his dole     give him peace whose love my life hath kept     he too has hoped though he has wept      and over thee my own delight     watch that sweet mother day and night     to whom the exiles consecrate     altar and heart in every fate     by her name i have called my little girl     but on lifes sea in the tempests whirl     thy helpless mother my darling may     only tremble and only pray      sleep sleep sleep my baby dear     dream of the light of some sweet star     sleep sleep and i will keep     thoughtful vigils above thy sleep     oh in the days that are to come     with unknown trial and unknown doom     thy little heart can neer love me     as thy mother loves and shall love thee   ii  arnaldo fusinato of padua has written for the most part comic poetry his principal piece of this sort being one in which he celebrates and satirizes the studentlife at the university of padua he had afterward to make a formal reparation to the students which he did in a poem singing their many virtues the original poem of the student is a rather lively series of pictures from which we learn that it was once the habit of studious youth at padua when freshmen or matricolini to be terrible dandies to swear aloud upon the public ways to pass whole nights at billiards to be noisy at the theater to stand treat for the seniors joyfully to lend these money and to acquire knowledge of the world at any cost later they advanced to the dignity of breaking streetlamps and of being arrested by the austrian garrison for in padua the students were under a kind of martial law sometimes they were expelled they lost money at play and wrote deceitful letters to their parents for more they shunned labor and failed to take degrees but we cannot be interested in traits so foreign to what i understand is our own studentlife generally the comic as well as the sentimental poetry of fusinato deals with incidents of popular life and of course it has hits at the fleeting fashions and passing sensations for example il bloomerismo is satirized  the poem which i translate however is in a different strain from any of these it will be remembered that when the austrians returned to take venice in 1849 after they had been driven out for eighteen months the city stood a bombardment of many weeks contesting every inch of the approach with the invaders but the venetians were very few in number and poorly equipped a famine prevailed among them the cholera broke out and raged furiously the bombs began to drop into the square of st mark and then the venetians yielded and ran up the white flag on the dearly contested lagoon bridge by which the railway traveler enters the city the poet is imagined in one of the little towns on the nearest mainland      the twilight is deepening still is the wave     i sit by the window mute as by a grave     silent companionless secret i pine     through tears where thou liest i look venice mine      on the clouds brokenly strewn through the west     dies the last ray of the sun sunk to rest     and a sad sibilance under the moon     sighs from the broken heart of the lagoon      out of the city a boat draweth near     you of the gondola tell us what cheer     bread lacks the cholera deadlier grows     from the lagoon bridge the white banner blows      no no nevermore on so great woe     bright sun of italy nevermore glow     but oer venetian hopes shattered so soon     moan in thy sorrow forever lagoon      venice to thee comes at last the last hour     martyr illustrious in thy foes power     bread lacks the cholera deadlier grows     from the lagoon bridge the white banner blows      not all the battleflames over thee streaming     not all the numberless bolts oer thee screaming     not for these terrors thy free days are dead     long live venice shes dying for bread      on thy immortal page sculpture o story     othersiniquity venices glory     and three times infamous ever be he     who triumphed by famine o venice oer thee      long live venice undaunted she fell     bravely she fought for her banner and well     but bread lacks the cholera deadlier grows     from the lagoon bridge the white banner blows      and now be shivered upon the stone here     till thou be free again o lyre i bear     unto thee venice shall be my last song     to thee the last kiss and the last tear belong      exiled and lonely from hence i depart     but venice forever shall live in my heart     in my hearts sacred place venice shall be     as is the face of my first love to me      but the wind rises and over the pale     face of its waters the deep sends a wail     breaking the chords shriek and the voice dies     on the lagoon bridge the white banner flies   iii  among the later italian poets is luigi mercantini of palermo who has written almost entirely upon political themesevents of the different revolutions and attempts at revolution in which italian history so abounds i have not read him so thoroughly as to warrant me in speaking very confidently about him but from the examination which i have given his poetry i think that he treats his subjects with as little inflation as possible and he now and then touches a point of naturalnessthe highwater mark of balladry to which modern poets with their affected unaffectedness and elaborate simplicity attain only with the greatest pains and labor such a triumph of mercantinis is this poem which i am about to give it celebrates the daring and selfsacrifice of three hundred brave young patriots led by carlo pisacane who landed on the coast of naples in 1857 for the purpose of exciting a revolution against the bourbons and were all killed in a note the poet reproduces the pledge signed by these young heroes which is so fine as not to be marred even by their dramatic almost theatrical consciousness    we who are here written down having all sworn   despising the calumnies of the vulgar strong in the   justice of our cause and the boldness of our spirits do   solemnly declare ourselves the initiators of the italian   revolution if the country does not respond to our appeal   we without reproaching it will know how to die   like brave men following the noble phalanx of italian   martyrs let any other nation of the world find men   who like us shall immolate themselves to liberty and   then only may it compare itself to italy though she still   be a slave  mercantini puts his poem in the mouth of a peasant girl and calls it      the gleaner of sapri      they were three hundred they were young and strong                 and they are dead     that morning i was going out to glean     a ship in the middle of the sea was seen     a barque it was of those that go by steam     and from its top a tricolor flag did stream     it anchored off the isle of ponza then     it stopped awhile and then it turned again     toward this place and here they came ashore     they came with arms but not on us made war     they were three hundred they were young and strong                 and they are dead      they came in arms but not on us made war     but down they stooped until they kissed the shore     and one by one i looked them in the face     a tear and smile in each one i could trace     they were all thieves and robbers their foes said     they never took from us a loaf of bread     i heard them utter nothing but this cry     we have come to die for our dear land to die     they were three hundred they were young and strong                 and they are dead      with his blue eyes and with his golden hair     there was a youth that marched before them there     and i made bold and took him by the hand     and whither goest thou captain of this band     he looked at me and said oh sister mine     im going to die for this dear land of thine     i felt my bosom tremble through and through     i could not say may the lord help you     they were three hundred they were young and strong                 and they are dead      i did forget to glean afield that day     but after them i wandered on their way     and twice i saw them fall on the gendarmes     and both times saw them take away their arms     but when they came to the certosas wall     there rose a sound of horns and drums and all     amidst the smoke and shot and darting flame     more than a thousand foemen fell on them     they were three hundred they were young and strong                 and they are dead      they were three hundred and they would not fly     they seemed three thousand and they chose to die     they chose to die with each his sword in hand     before them ran their blood upon the land     i prayed for them while i could see them fight     but all at once i swooned and lost the sight     i saw no more with them that captain fair     with his blue eyes and with his
