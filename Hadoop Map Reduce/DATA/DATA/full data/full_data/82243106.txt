82243106	the adventure of the brucepartington plans   by  sir arthur conan doyle     in the third week of november in the year 1895 a dense yellow fog settled down upon london  from the monday to the thursday i doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in baker street to see the loom of the opposite houses  the first day holmes had spent in crossindexing his huge book of references the second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobbythe music of the middle ages  but when for the fourth time after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the windowpanes my comrades impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer  he paced restlessly about our sittingroom in a fever of suppressed energy biting his nails tapping the furniture and chafing against inaction  nothing of interest in the paper watson he said  i was aware that by anything of interest holmes meant anything of criminal interest  there was the news of a revolution of a possible war and of an impending change of government but these did not come within the horizon of my companion  i could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile  holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings  the london criminal is certainly a dull fellow said he in the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him look out this window watson  see how the figures loom up are dimly seen and then blend once more into the cloudbank  the thief or the murderer could roam london on such a day as the tiger does the jungle unseen until he pounces and then evident only to his victim  there have said i been numerous petty thefts  holmes snorted his contempt  this great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that said he  it is fortunate for this community that i am not a criminal  it is indeed said i heartily  suppose that i were brooks or woodhouse or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life how long could i survive against my own pursuit  a summons a bogus appointment and all would be over it is well they dont have days of fog in the latin countriesthe countries of assassination  by jove here comes something at last to break our dead monotony  it was the maid with a telegram  holmes tore it open and burst out laughing  well well  what next said he  brother mycroft is coming round  why not i asked  why not  it is as if you met a tramcar coming down a country lane mycroft has his rails and he runs on them  his pall mall lodgings the diogenes club whitehallthat is his cycle  once and only once he has been here  what upheaval can possibly have derailed him  does he not explain  holmes handed me his brothers telegram      must see you over cadogan west  coming at once       mycroft  cadogan west  i have heard the name  it recalls nothing to my mind  but that mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion  a planet might as well leave its orbit  by the way do you know what mycroft is  i had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the adventure of the greek interpreter  you told me that he had some small office under the british government  holmes chuckled  i did not know you quite so well in those days  one has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state  you are right in thinking that he is under the british government  you would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the british government  my dear holmes  i thought i might surprise you  mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year remains a subordinate has no ambitions of any kind will receive neither honour nor title but remains the most indispensable man in the country  but how  well his position is unique  he has made it for himself there has never been anything like it before nor will be again he has the tidiest and most orderly brain with the greatest capacity for storing facts of any man living  the same great powers which i have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business  the conclusions of every department are passed to him and he is the central exchange the clearinghouse which makes out the balance  all other men are specialists but his specialism is omniscience  we will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the navy india canada and the bimetallic question he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each but only mycroft can focus them all and say offhand how each factor would affect the other  they began by using him as a shortcut a convenience now he has made himself an essential  in that great brain of his everything is pigeonholed and can be handed out in an instant  again and again his word has decided the national policy  he lives in it  he thinks of nothing else save when as an intellectual exercise he unbends if i call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems but jupiter is descending today  what on earth can it mean  who is cadogan west and what is he to mycroft  i have it i cried and plunged among the litter of papers upon the sofa  yes yes here he is sure enough  cadogan west was the young man who was found dead on the underground on tuesday morning  holmes sat up at attention his pipe halfway to his lips  this must be serious watson  a death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one  what in the world can he have to do with it  the case was featureless as i remember it  the young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself  he had not been robbed and there was no particular reason to suspect violence  is that not so  there has been an inquest said i and a good many fresh facts have come out  looked at more closely i should certainly say that it was a curious case  judging by its effect upon my brother i should think it must be a most extraordinary one  he snuggled down in his armchair now watson let us have the facts  the mans name was arthur cadogan west  he was twentyseven years of age unmarried and a clerk at woolwich arsenal  government employ  behold the link with brother mycroft  he left woolwich suddenly on monday night  was last seen by his fiancee miss violet westbury whom he left abruptly in the fog about 730 that evening  there was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action  the next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a platelayer named mason just outside aldgate station on the underground system in london  when  the body was found at six on tuesday morning  it was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward at a point close to the station where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs  the head was badly crushedan injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train  the body could only have come on the line in that way had it been carried down from any neighbouring street it must have passed the station barriers where a collector is always standing  this point seems absolutely certain  very good  the case is definite enough  the man dead or alive either fell or was precipitated from a train  so much is clear to me continue  the trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east some being purely metropolitan and some from willesden and outlying junctions  it can be stated for certain that this young man when he met his death was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state  his ticket of course would show that  there was no ticket in his pockets  no ticket  dear me watson this is really very singular according to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a metropolitan train without exhibiting ones ticket presumably then the young man had one  was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came  it is possible  or did he drop it in the carriage  that is also possible  but the point is of curious interest  i understand that there was no sign of robbery  apparently not  there is a list here of his possessions  his purse contained two pounds fifteen  he had also a checkbook on the woolwich branch of the capital and counties bank  through this his identity was established  there were also two dresscircle tickets for the woolwich theatre dated for that very evening  also a small packet of technical papers  holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction  there we have it at last watson  british governmentwoolwich arsenaltechnical papersbrother mycroft the chain is complete  but here he comes if i am not mistaken to speak for himself  a moment later the tall and portly form of mycroft holmes was ushered into the room  heavily built and massive there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow so alert in its steelgray deepset eyes so firm in its lips and so subtle in its play of expression that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind  at his heels came our old friend lestrade of scotland yardthin and austere  the gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest the detective shook hands without a word mycroft holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair  a most annoying business sherlock said he  i extremely dislike altering my habits but the powers that be would take no denial  in the present state of siam it is most awkward that i should be away from the office  but it is a real crisis  i have never seen the prime minister so upset  as to the admiraltyit is buzzing like an overturned beehive  have you read up the case  we have just done so  what were the technical papers  ah theres the point  fortunately it has not come out  the press would be furious if it did  the papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the brucepartington submarine  mycroft holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance of the subject  his brother and i sat expectant  surely you have heard of it  i thought everyone had heard of it  only as a name  its importance can hardly be exaggerated  it has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets  you may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a brucepartingtons operation  two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention  every effort has been made to keep the secret  the plans which are exceedingly intricate comprising some thirty separate patents each essential to the working of the whole are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal with burglarproof doors and windows  under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office  if the chief constructor of the navy desired to consult them even he was forced to go to the woolwich office for the purpose  and yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of london  from an official point of view its simply awful  but you have recovered them  no sherlock no  thats the pinch  we have not  ten papers were taken from woolwich  there were seven in the pocket of cadogan west the three most essential are gonestolen vanished  you must drop everything sherlock  never mind your usual petty puzzles of the policecourt  its a vital international problem that you have to solve  why did cadogan west take the papers where are the missing ones how did he die how came his body where it was found how can the evil be set right  find an answer to all these questions and you will have done good service for your country  why do you not solve it yourself mycroft  you can see as far as i  possibly sherlock  but it is a question of getting details give me your details and from an armchair i will return you an excellent expert opinion  but to run here and run there to crossquestion railway guards and lie on my face with a lens to my eyeit is not my metier  no you are the one man who can clear the matter up  if you have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list  my friend smiled and shook his head  i play the game for the games own sake said he  but the problem certainly presents some points of interest and i shall be very pleased to look into it  some more facts please  i have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper together with a few addresses which you will find of service  the actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert sir james walter whose decorations and subtitles fill two lines of a book of reference  he has grown gray in the service is a gentleman a favoured guest in the most exalted houses and above all a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion  he is one of two who have a key of the safe  i may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during working hours on monday and that sir james left for london about three oclock taking his key with him  he was at the house of admiral sinclair at barclay square during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred  has the fact been verified  yes his brother colonel valentine walter has testified to his departure from woolwich and admiral sinclair to his arrival in london so sir james is no longer a direct factor in the problem  who was the other man with a key  the senior clerk and draughtsman mr sidney johnson  he is a man of forty married with five children  he is a silent morose man but he has on the whole an excellent record in the public service  he is unpopular with his colleagues but a hard worker  according to his own account corroborated only by the word of his wife he was at home the whole of monday evening after office hours and his key has never left the watchchain upon which it hangs  tell us about cadogan west  he has been ten years in the service and has done good work  he has the reputation of being hotheaded and imperious but a straight honest man  we have nothing against him  he was next sidney johnson in the office  his duties brought him into daily personal contact with the plans  no one else had the handling of them  who locked up the plans that night  mr sidney johnson the senior clerk  well it is surely perfectly clear who took them away  they are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk cadogan west that seems final does it not  it does sherlock and yet it leaves so much unexplained  in the first place why did he take them  i presume they were of value  he could have got several thousands for them very easily  can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to london except to sell them  no i cannot  then we must take that as our working hypothesis  young west took the papers  now this could only be done by having a false key  several false keys  he had to open the building and the room  he had then several false keys  he took the papers to london to sell the secret intending no doubt to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed while in london on this treasonable mission he met his end  how  we will suppose that he was travelling back to woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment  aldgate where the body was found is considerably past the station london bridge which would be his route to woolwich  many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass london bridge  there was someone in the carriage for example with whom he was having an absorbing interview  this interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life  possibly he tried to leave the carriage fell out on the line and so met his end  the other closed the door  there was a thick fog and nothing could be seen  no better explanation can be given with our present knowledge and yet consider sherlock how much you leave untouched  we will suppose for arguments sake that young cadogan west had determined to convey these papers to london  he would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear  instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre escorted his fiancee halfway there and then suddenly disappeared  a blind said lestrade who had sat listening with some impatience to the conversation  a very singular one  that is objection no 1  objection no 2 we will suppose that he reaches london and sees the foreign agent  he must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered  he took away ten  only seven were in his pocket  what had become of the other three  he certainly would not leave them of his own free will  then again where is the price of his treason once would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket  it seems to me perfectly clear said lestrade  i have no doubt at all as to what occurred  he took the papers to sell them  he saw the agent they could not agree as to price  he started home again but the agent went with him  in the train the agent murdered him took the more essential papers and threw his body from the carriage  that would account for everything would it not  why had he no ticket  the ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agents house  therefore he took it from the murdered mans pocket  good lestrade very good said holmes  your theory holds together but if this is true then the case is at an end  on the one hand the traitor is dead  on the other the plans of the brucepartington submarine are presumably already on the continent  what is there for us to do  to act sherlockto act cried mycroft springing to his feet all my instincts are against this explanation  use your powers go to the scene of the crime  see the people concerned  leave no stone unturned  in all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country  well well said holmes shrugging his shoulders  come watson and you lestrade could you favour us with your company for an hour or two  we will begin our investigation by a visit to aldgate station goodbye mycroft  i shall let you have a report before evening but i warn you in advance that you have little to expect  an hour later holmes lestrade and i stood upon the underground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before aldgate station  a courteous redfaced old gentleman represented the railway company  this is where the young mans body lay said he indicating a spot about three feet from the metals  it could not have fallen from above for these as you see are all blank walls therefore it could only have come from a train and that train so far as we can trace it must have passed about midnight on monday  have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence  there are no such signs and no ticket has been found  no record of a door being found open  none  we have had some fresh evidence this morning said lestrade a passenger who passed aldgate in an ordinary metropolitan train about 1140 on monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud as of a body striking the line just before the train reached the station  there was dense fog however and nothing could be seen  he made no report of it at the time  why whatever is the matter with mr holmes  my friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel  aldgate is a junction and there was a network of points  on these his eager questioning eyes were fixed and i saw on his keen alert face that tightening of the lips that quiver of the nostrils and concentration of the heavy tufted brows which i knew so well  points he muttered the points  what of it  what do you mean  i suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this  no they are very few  and a curve too  points and a curve  by jove if it were only so  what is it mr holmes  have you a clue  an ideaan indication no more  but the case certainly grows in interest  unique perfectly unique and yet why not  i do not see any indications of bleeding on the line  there were hardly any  but i understand that there was a considerable wound  the bone was crushed but there was no great external injury  and yet one would have expected some bleeding  would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog  i fear not mr holmes  the train has been broken up before now and the carriages redistributed  i can assure you mr holmes said lestrade that every carriage has been carefully examined  i saw to it myself  it was one of my friends most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own  very likely said he turning away  as it happens it was not the carriages which i desired to examine  watson we have done all we can here  we need not trouble you any further mr lestrade  i think our investigations must now carry us to woolwich  at london bridge holmes wrote a telegram to his brother which he handed to me before dispatching it  it ran thus  see some light in the darkness but it may possibly flicker out meanwhile please send by messenger to await return at baker street a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be in england with full address  sherlock  that should be helpful watson he remarked as we took our seats in the woolwich train  we certainly owe brother mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case  his eager face still wore that expression of intense and highstrung energy which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought  see the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels and compare it with the same hound as with gleaming eyes and straining muscles it runs upon a breasthigh scentsuch was the change in holmes since the morning  he was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in the mousecoloured dressinggown who had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the foggirt room  there is material here  there is scope said he  i am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities  even now they are dark to me  the end is dark to me also but i have hold of one idea which may lead us far  the man met his death elsewhere and his body was on the roof of a carriage  on the roof  remarkable is it not  but consider the facts  is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points  is not that the place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off  the points would affect no object inside the train  either the body fell from the roof or a very curious coincidence has occurred  but now consider the question of the blood  of course there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere  each fact is suggestive in itself  together they have a cumulative force  and the ticket too i cried  exactly  we could not explain the absence of a ticket  this would explain it  everything fits together  but suppose it were so we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death  indeed it becomes not simpler but stranger  perhaps said holmes thoughtfully perhaps  he relapsed into a silent reverie which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in woolwich station  there he called a cab and drew mycrofts paper from his pocket  we have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make said he  i think that sir james walter claims our first attention  the house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns stretching down to the thames  as we reached it the fog was lifting and a thin watery sunshine was breaking through  a butler answered our ring  sir james sir said he with solemn face  sir james died this morning  good heavens cried holmes in amazement  how did he die  perhaps you would care to step in sir and see his brother colonel valentine  yes we had best do so  we were ushered into a dimlit drawingroom where an instant later we were joined by a very tall handsome lightbeared man of fifty the younger brother of the dead scientist  his wild eyes stained cheeks and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household  he was hardly articulate as he spoke of it  it was this horrible scandal said he  my brother sir james was a man of very sensitive honour and he could not survive such an affair it broke his heart  he was always so proud of the efficiency of his department and this was a crushing blow  we had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up  i assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us  he had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police  naturally he had no doubt that cadogan west was guilty  but all the rest was inconceivable  you cannot throw any new light upon the affair  i know nothing myself save what i have read or heard  i have no desire to be discourteous but you can understand mr holmes that we are much disturbed at present and i must ask you to hasten this interview to an end  this is indeed an unexpected development said my friend when we had regained the cab  i wonder if the death was natural or whether the poor old fellow killed himself  if the latter may it be taken as some sign of selfreproach for duty neglected  we must leave that question to the future  now we shall turn to the cadogan wests  a small but wellkept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved mother  the old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us but at her side was a whitefaced young lady who introduced herself as miss violet westbury the fiancee of the dead man and the last to see him upon that fatal night  i cannot explain it mr holmes she said  i have not shut an eye since the tragedy thinking thinking thinking night and day what the true meaning of it can be  arthur was the most singleminded chivalrous patriotic man upon earth  he would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a state secret confided to his keeping  it is absurd impossible preposterous to anyone who knew him  but the facts miss westbury  yes yes i admit i cannot explain them  was he in any want of money  no his needs were very simple and his salary ample  he had saved a few hundreds and we were to marry at the new year  no signs of any mental excitement  come miss westbury be absolutely frank with us  the quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner  she coloured and hesitated  yes she said at last i had a feeling that there was something on his mind  for long  only for the last week or so  he was thoughtful and worried once i pressed him about it  he admitted that there was something and that it was concerned with his official life  it is too serious for me to speak about even to you said he  i could get nothing more  holmes looked grave  go on miss westbury  even if it seems to tell against him go on we cannot say what it may lead to  indeed i have nothing more to tell  once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something  he spoke one evening of the importance of the secret and i have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it  my friends face grew graver still  anything else  he said that we were slack about such mattersthat it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans  was it only recently that he made such remarks  yes quite recently  now tell us of that last evening  we were to go to the theatre  the fog was so thick that a cab was useless  we walked and our way took us close to the office suddenly he darted away into the fog  without a word  he gave an exclamation that was all  i waited but he never returned then i walked home  next morning after the office opened they came to inquire  about twelve oclock we heard the terrible news  oh mr holmes if you could only only save his honour  it was so much to him  holmes shook his head sadly  come watson said he our ways lie elsewhere  our next station must be the office from which the papers were taken  it was black enough before against this young man but our inquiries make it blacker he remarked as the cab lumbered off his coming marriage gives a motive for the crime  he naturally wanted money  the idea was in his head since he spoke about it he nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans  it is all very bad  but surely holmes character goes for something  then again why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony  exactly  there are certainly objections  but it is a formidable case which they have to meet  mr sidney johnson the senior clerk met us at the office and received us with that respect which my companions card always commanded  he was a thin gruff bespectacled man of middle age his cheeks haggard and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been subjected  it is bad mr holmes very bad  have you heard of the death of the chief  we have just come from his house  the place is disorganized  the chief dead cadogan west dead our papers stolen  and yet when we closed our door on monday evening we were as efficient an office as any in the government service  good god its dreadful to think of  that west of all men should have done such a thing  you are sure of his guilt then  i can see no other way out of it  and yet i would have trusted him as i trust myself  at what hour was the office closed on monday  at five  did you close it  i am always the last man out  where were the plans  in that safe  i put them there myself  is there no watchman to the building  there is but he has other departments to look after as well he is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man  he saw nothing that evening of course the fog was very thick  suppose that cadogan west wished to make his way into the building after hours he would need three keys would he not before he could reach the papers  yes he would  the key of the outer door the key of the office and the key of the safe  only sir james walter and you had those keys  i had no keys of the doorsonly of the safe  was sir james a man who was orderly in his habits  yes i think he was  i know that so far as those three keys are concerned he kept them on the same ring  i have often seen them there  and that ring went with him to london  he said so  and your key never left your possession  never  then west if he is the culprit must have had a duplicate  and yet none was found upon his body  one other point  if a clerk in this office desired to sell the plans would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals as was actually done  it would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an effective way  but i suppose either sir james or you or west has that technical knowledge  no doubt we had but i beg you wont try to drag me into the matter mr holmes  what is the use of our speculating in this way when the original plans were actually found on west  well it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking originals if he could safely have taken copies which would have equally served his turn  singular no doubtand yet he did so  every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable  now there are three papers still missing  they are as i understand the vital ones  yes that is so  do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers and without the seven others could construct a brucepartington submarine  i reported to that effect to the admiralty  but today i have been over the drawings again and i am not so sure of it  the double valves with the automatic selfadjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been returned  until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat  of course they might soon get over the difficulty  but the three missing drawings are the most important  undoubtedly  i think with your permission i will now take a stroll round the premises  i do not recall any other question which i desired to ask  he examined the lock of the safe the door of the room and finally the iron shutters of the window  it was only when we were on the lawn outside that his interest was strongly excited there was a laurel bush outside the window and several of the branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped  he examined them carefully with his lens and then some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath  finally he asked the chief clerk to close the iron shutters and he pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre and that it would be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within the room  the indications are ruined by three days delay  they may mean something or nothing  well watson i do not think that woolwich can help us further  it is a small crop which we have gathered let us see if we can do better in london  yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left woolwich station  the clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence that he saw cadogan westwhom he knew well by sightupon the monday night and that he went to london by the 815 to london bridge  he was alone and took a single thirdclass ticket  the clerk was struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner  so shaky was he that he could hardly pick up his change and the clerk had helped him with it  a reference to the timetable showed that the 815 was the first train which it was possible for west to take after he had left the lady about 730  let us reconstruct watson said holmes after half an hour of silence  i am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at  every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond and yet we have surely made some appreciable progress  the effect of our inquiries at woolwich has in the main been against young cadogan west but the indications at the window would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis  let us suppose for example that he had been approached by some foreign agent  it might have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from speaking of it and yet would have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancee  very good  we will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly in the fog caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of the office he was an impetuous man quick in his decisions  everything gave way to his duty  he followed the man reached the window saw the abstraction of the documents and pursued the thief  in this way we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies  this outsider had to take originals so far it holds together  what is the next step  then we come into difficulties  one would imagine that under such circumstances the first act of young cadogan west would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm  why did he not do so could it have been an official superior who took the papers that would explain wests conduct  or could the chief have given west the slip in the fog and west started at once to london to head him off from his own rooms presuming that he knew where the rooms were  the call must have been very pressing since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her  our scent runs cold here and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of wests body with seven papers in his pocket on the roof of a metropolitan train my instinct now is to work from the other end  if mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two tracks instead of one  surely enough a note awaited us at baker street  a government messenger had brought it posthaste  holmes glanced at it and threw it over to me  there are numerous small fry but few who would handle so big an affair  the only men worth considering are adolph mayer of 13 great george street westminster louis la rothiere of campden mansions notting hill and hugo oberstein 13 caulfield gardens kensington the latter was known to be in town on monday and is now reported as having left  glad to hear you have seen some light  the cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety  urgent representations have arrived from the very highest quarter  the whole force of the state is at your back if you should need it  mycroft  im afraid said holmes smiling that all the queens horses and all the queens men cannot avail in this matter  he had spread out his big map of london and leaned eagerly over it well well said he presently with an exclamation of satisfaction things are turning a little in our direction at last  why watson i do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off after all  he slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity  i am going out now  it is only a reconnaissance  i will do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow  do you stay here and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two  if time hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen and begin your narrative of how we saved the state  i felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind for i knew well that he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour unless there was good cause for exultation  all the long november evening i waited filled with impatience for his return  at last shortly after nine oclock there arrived a messenger with a note  am dining at goldinis restaurant gloucester road kensington please come at once and join me there  bring with you a jemmy a dark lantern a chisel and a revolver  sh  it was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim fogdraped streets  i stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat and drove straight to the address given  there sat my friend at a little round table near the door of the garish italian restaurant  have you had something to eat  then join me in a coffee and curacao try one of the proprietors cigars  they are less poisonous than one would expect  have you the tools  they are here in my overcoat  excellent  let me give you a short sketch of what i have done with some indication of what we are about to do  now it must be evident to you watson that this young mans body was placed on the roof of the train  that was clear from the instant that i determined the fact that it was from the roof and not from a carriage that he had fallen  could it not have been dropped from a bridge  i should say it was impossible  if you examine the roofs you will find that they are slightly rounded and there is no railing round them  therefore we can say for certain that young cadogan west was placed on it  how could he be placed there  that was the question which we had to answer  there is only one possible way  you are aware that the underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in the west end  i had a vague memory that as i have travelled by it i have occasionally seen windows just above my head now suppose that a train halted under such a window would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof  it seems most improbable  we must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail whatever remains however improbable must be the truth  here all other contingencies have failed  when i found that the leading international agent who had just left london lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the underground i was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my sudden frivolity  oh that was it was it  yes that was it  mr hugo oberstein of 13 caulfield gardens had become my objective  i began my operations at gloucester road station where a very helpful official walked with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not only that the backstair windows of caulfield gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact that owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways the underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very spot  splendid holmes  you have got it  so farso far watson  we advance but the goal is afar well having seen the back of caulfield gardens i visited the front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown  it is a considerable house unfurnished so far as i could judge in the upper rooms oberstein lived there with a single valet who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence  we must bear in mind that oberstein has gone to the continent to dispose of his booty but not with any idea of flight for he had no reason to fear a warrant and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him  yet that is precisely what we are about to make  could we not get a warrant and legalize it  hardly on the evidence  what can we hope to do  we cannot tell what correspondence may be there  i dont like it holmes  my dear fellow you shall keep watch in the street  ill do the criminal part  its not a time to stick at trifles  think of mycrofts note of the admiralty the cabinet the exalted person who waits for news  we are bound to go  my answer was to rise from the table  you are right holmes  we are bound to go  he sprang up and shook me by the hand  i knew you would not shrink at the last said he and for a moment i saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than i had ever seen  the next instant he was his masterful practical self once more  it is nearly half a mile but there is no hurry  let us walk said he  dont drop the instruments i beg  your arrest as a suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication  caulfield gardens was one of those lines of flatfaced pillared and porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle victorian epoch in the west end of london  next door there appeared to be a childrens party for the merry buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through the night  the fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly shade  holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive door  this is a serious proposition said he  it is certainly bolted as well as locked  we would do better in the area  there is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude give me a hand watson and ill do the same for you  a minute later we were both in the area  hardly had we reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above  as its soft rhythm died away holmes set to work upon the lower door  i saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew open  we sprang through into the dark passage closing the area door behind us  holmes led the way up the curving uncarpeted stair  his little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window  here we are watsonthis must be the one  he threw it open and as he did so there was a low harsh murmur growing steadily into a loud roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness holmes swept his light along the windowsill  it was thickly coated with soot from the passing engines but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places  you can see where they rested the body  halloa watson what is this there can be no doubt that it is a blood mark  he was pointing to faint discolourations along the woodwork of the window  here it is on the stone of the stair also  the demonstration is complete  let us stay here until a train stops  we had not long to wait  the very next train roared from the tunnel as before but slowed in the open and then with a creaking of brakes pulled up immediately beneath us  it was not four feet from the windowledge to the roof of the carriages holmes softly closed the window  so far we are justified said he  what do you think of it watson  a masterpiece  you have never risen to a greater height  i cannot agree with you there  from the moment that i conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof which surely was not a very abstruse one all the rest was inevitable  if it were not for the grave interests involved the affair up to this point would be insignificant  our difficulties are still before us but perhaps we may find something here which may help us  we had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first floor  one was a diningroom severely furnished and containing nothing of interest  a second was a bedroom which also drew blank  the remaining room appeared more promising and my companion settled down to a systematic examination  it was littered with books and papers and was evidently used as a study  swiftly and methodically holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard after cupboard but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere face  at the end of an hour he was no further than when he started  the cunning dog has covered his tracks said he  he has left nothing to incriminate him  his dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or removed  this is our last chance  it was a small tin cashbox which stood upon the writingdesk holmes pried it open with his chisel  several rolls of paper were within covered with figures and calculations without any note to show to what they referred  the recurring words water pressure and pressure to the square inch suggested some possible relation to a submarine holmes tossed them all impatiently aside  there only remained an envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it  he shook them out on the table and at once i saw by his eager face that his hopes had been raised  whats this watson  eh  whats this  record of a series of messages in the advertisements of a paper  daily telegraph agony column by the print and paper  righthand top corner of a page no datesbut messages arrange themselves  this must be the first  hoped to hear sooner  terms agreed to  write fully to address given on card  pierrot  next comes  too complex for description  must have full report stuff awaits you when goods delivered  pierrot  then comes  matter presses  must withdraw offer unless contract completed make appointment by letter will confirm by advertisement  pierrot  finally  monday night after nine  two taps  only ourselves  do not be so suspicious  payment in hard cash when goods delivered  pierrot  a fairly complete record watson  if we could only get at the man at the other end  he sat lost in thought tapping his fingers on the table  finally he sprang to his feet  well perhaps it wont be so difficult after all  there is nothing more to be done here watson  i think we might drive round to the offices of the daily telegraph and so bring a good days work to a conclusion   mycroft holmes and lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next day and sherlock holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day before  the professional shook his head over our confessed burglary  we cant do these things in the force mr holmes said he no wonder you get results that are beyond us  but some of these days youll go too far and youll find yourself and your friend in trouble  for england home and beautyeh watson  martyrs on the altar of our country  but what do you think of it mycroft  excellent sherlock  admirable  but what use will you make of it  holmes picked up the daily telegraph which lay upon the table  have you seen pierrots advertisement today  what  another one  yes here it is  tonight  same hour  same place  two taps  most vitally important your own safety at stake  pierrot  by george cried lestrade  if he answers that weve got him  that was my idea when i put it in  i think if you could both make it convenient to come with us about eight oclock to caulfield gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution  one of the most remarkable characteristics of sherlock holmes was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to advantage  i remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the polyphonic motets of lassus  for my own part i had none of this power of detachment and the day in consequence appeared to be interminable  the great national importance of the issue the suspense in high quarters the direct nature of the experiment which we were tryingall combined to work upon my nerve  it was a relief to me when at last after a light dinner we set out upon our expedition lestrade and mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of gloucester road station  the area door of obersteins house had been left open the night before and it was necessary for me as mycroft holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings to pass in and open the hall door  by nine oclock we were all seated in the study waiting patiently for our man  an hour passed and yet another  when eleven struck the measured beat of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes lestrade and mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a minute at their watches  holmes sat silent and composed his eyelids half shut but every sense on the alert he raised his head with a sudden jerk  he is coming said he  there had been a furtive step past the door  now it returned we heard a shuffling sound outside and then two sharp taps with the knocker holmes rose motioning us to remain seated  the gas in the hall was a mere point of light  he opened the outer door and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it  this way we heard him say and a moment later our man stood before us  holmes had followed him closely and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and holmes standing with his back against it  the man glared round him staggered and fell senseless upon the floor  with the shock his broadbrimmed hat flew from his head his cravat slipped down from his lips and there were the long light beard and the soft handsome delicate features of colonel valentine walter  holmes gave a whistle of surprise  you can write me down an ass this time watson said he  this was not the bird that i was looking for  who is he asked mycroft eagerly  the younger brother of the late sir james walter the head of the submarine department  yes yes i see the fall of the cards he is coming to  i think that you had best leave his examination to me  we had carried the prostrate body to the sofa  now our prisoner sat up looked round him with a horrorstricken face and passed his hand over his forehead like one who cannot believe his own senses  what is this he asked  i came here to visit mr oberstein  everything is known colonel walter said holmes  how an english gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension but your whole correspondence and relations with oberstein are within our knowledge  so also are the circumstances connected with the death of young cadogan west let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance and confession since there are still some details which we can only learn from your lips  the man groaned and sank his face in his hands  we waited but he was silent  i can assure you said holmes that every essential is already known  we know that you were pressed for money that you took an impress of the keys which your brother held and that you entered into a correspondence with oberstein who answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the daily telegraph  we are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on monday night but that you were seen and followed by young cadogan west who had probably some previous reason to suspect you  he saw your theft but could not give the alarm as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in london leaving all his private concerns like the good citizen that he was he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached this very house  there he intervened and then it was colonel walter that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder  i did not  i did not  before god i swear that i did not cried our wretched prisoner  tell us then how cadogan west met his end before you laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage  i will  i swear to you that i will  i did the rest  i confess it it was just as you say  a stock exchange debt had to be paid  i needed the money badly  oberstein offered me five thousand  it was to save myself from ruin  but as to murder i am as innocent as you  what happened then  he had his suspicions before and he followed me as you describe  i never knew it until i was at the very door  it was thick fog and one could not see three yards  i had given two taps and oberstein had come to the door  the young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers oberstein had a short lifepreserver  he always carried it with him  as west forced his way after us into the house oberstein struck him on the head  the blow was a fatal one  he was dead within five minutes  there he lay in the hall and we were at our wits end what to do  then oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window  but first he examined the papers which i had brought  he said that three of them were essential and that he must keep them  you cannot keep them said i  there will be a dreadful row at woolwich if they are not returned  i must keep them said he for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies then they must all go back together tonight said i  he thought for a little and then he cried out that he had it three i will keep said he  the others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man  when he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account  i could see no other way out of it so we did as he suggested  we waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped  it was so thick that nothing could be seen and we had no difficulty in lowering wests body on to the train  that was the end of the matter so far as i was concerned  and your brother  he said nothing but he had caught me once with his keys and i think that he suspected  i read in his eyes that he suspected as you know he never held up his head again  there was silence in the room  it was broken by mycroft holmes  can you not make reparation  it would ease your conscience and possibly your punishment  what reparation can i make  where is oberstein with the papers  i do not know  did he give you no address  he said that letters to the hotel du louvre paris would eventually reach him  then reparation is still within your power said sherlock holmes  i will do anything i can  i owe this fellow no particular goodwill he has been my ruin and my downfall  here are paper and pen  sit at this desk and write to my dictation direct the envelope to the address given  that is right  now the letter  dear sir  with regard to our transaction you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing  i have a tracing which will make it complete  this has involved me in extra trouble however and i must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds  i will not trust it to the post nor will i take anything but gold or notes  i would come to you abroad but it would excite remark if i left the country at present therefore i shall expect to meet you in the smokingroom of the charing cross hotel at noon on saturday  remember that only english notes or gold will be taken  that will do very well  i shall be very much surprised if it does not fetch our man  and it did  it is a matter of historythat secret history of a nation which is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public chroniclesthat oberstein eager to complete the coup of his lifetime came to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a british prison  in his trunk were found the invaluable brucepartington plans which he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of europe  colonel walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his sentence  as to holmes he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the polyphonic motets of lassus which has since been printed for private circulation and is said by experts to be the last word upon the subject  some weeks afterwards i learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at windsor whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tiepin  when i asked him if he had bought it he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission  he said no more but i fancy that i could guess at that ladys august name and i have little doubt that the emerald pin will forever recall to my friends memory the adventure of the brucepartington plans
