miss florence west     first act   scene   the octagon room at sir robert chiltern’s house in grosvenor square  the room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests  at the top of the staircase stands lady chiltern a woman of grave greek beauty about twentyseven years of age  she receives the guests as they come up  over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax lights which illumine a large eighteenthcentury french tapestry—representing the triumph of love from a design by boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall  on the right is the entrance to the musicroom  the sound of a string quartette is faintly heard  the entrance on the left leads to other receptionrooms  mrs marchmont and lady basildon two very pretty women are seated together on a louis seize sofa  they are types of exquisite fragility  their affectation of manner has a delicate charm watteau would have loved to paint them  mrs marchmont  going on to the hartlocks’ tonight margaret  lady basildon  i suppose so  are you  mrs marchmont  yes  horribly tedious parties they give don’t they  lady basildon  horribly tedious  never know why i go  never know why i go anywhere  mrs marchmont  i come here to be educated  lady basildon  ah i hate being educated  mrs marchmont  so do i  it puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes doesn’t it  but dear gertrude chiltern is always telling me that i should have some serious purpose in life  so i come here to try to find one  lady basildon  looking round through her lorgnette  i don’t see anybody here tonight whom one could possibly call a serious purpose the man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time  mrs marchmont  how very trivial of him  lady basildon  terribly trivial  what did your man talk about  mrs marchmont  about myself  lady basildon  languidly  and were you interested  mrs marchmont  shaking her head  not in the smallest degree  lady basildon  what martyrs we are dear margaret  mrs marchmont  rising  and how well it becomes us olivia  they rise and go towards the musicroom  the vicomte de nanjac a young attaché known for his neckties and his anglomania approaches with a low bow and enters into conversation  mason  announcing guests from the top of the staircase  mr and lady jane barford  lord caversham  enter lord caversham an old gentleman of seventy wearing the riband and star of the garter  a fine whig type  rather like a portrait by lawrence  lord caversham  good evening lady chiltern  has my goodfornothing young son been here  lady chiltern  smiling  i don’t think lord goring has arrived yet  mabel chiltern  coming up to lord caversham  why do you call lord goring goodfornothing  mabel chiltern is a perfect example of the english type of prettiness the appleblossom type  she has all the fragrance and freedom of a flower  there is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair and the little mouth with its parted lips is expectant like the mouth of a child  she has the fascinating tyranny of youth and the astonishing courage of innocence  to sane people she is not reminiscent of any work of art  but she is really like a tanagra statuette and would be rather annoyed if she were told so  lord caversham  because he leads such an idle life  mabel chiltern  how can you say such a thing  why he rides in the row at ten o’clock in the morning goes to the opera three times a week changes his clothes at least five times a day and dines out every night of the season  you don’t call that leading an idle life do you  lord caversham  looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes you are a very charming young lady  mabel chiltern  how sweet of you to say that lord caversham  do come to us more often  you know we are always at home on wednesdays and you look so well with your star  lord caversham  never go anywhere now  sick of london society shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor he always votes on the right side  but object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife’s milliner  never could stand lady caversham’s bonnets  mabel chiltern  oh i love london society  i think it has immensely improved  it is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics  just what society should be  lord caversham  hum  which is goring  beautiful idiot or the other thing  mabel chiltern  gravely  i have been obliged for the present to put lord goring into a class quite by himself  but he is developing charmingly  lord caversham  into what  mabel chiltern  with a little curtsey  i hope to let you know very soon lord caversham  mason  announcing guests  lady markby  mrs cheveley  enter lady markby and mrs cheveley  lady markby is a pleasant kindly popular woman with gray hair à la marquise and good lace mrs cheveley who accompanies her is tall and rather slight  lips very thin and highlycoloured a line of scarlet on a pallid face venetian red hair aquiline nose and long throat  rouge accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion  graygreen eyes that move restlessly  she is in heliotrope with diamonds  she looks rather like an orchid and makes great demands on one’s curiosity  in all her movements she is extremely graceful  a work of art on the whole but showing the influence of too many schools  lady markby  good evening dear gertrude  so kind of you to let me bring my friend mrs cheveley  two such charming women should know each other  lady chiltern  advances towards mrs cheveley with a sweet smile then suddenly stops and bows rather distantly  i think mrs cheveley and i have met before  i did not know she had married a second time  lady markby  genially  ah nowadays people marry as often as they can don’t they  it is most fashionable  to duchess of maryborough dear duchess and how is the duke  brain still weak i suppose  well that is only to be expected is it not  his good father was just the same  there is nothing like race is there  mrs cheveley  playing with her fan  but have we really met before lady chiltern  i can’t remember where  i have been out of england for so long  lady chiltern  we were at school together mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley superciliously  indeed  i have forgotten all about my schooldays  i have a vague impression that they were detestable  lady chiltern  coldly  i am not surprised  mrs cheveley  in her sweetest manner  do you know i am quite looking forward to meeting your clever husband lady chiltern  since he has been at the foreign office he has been so much talked of in vienna they actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers  that in itself is fame on the continent  lady chiltern  i hardly think there will be much in common between you and my husband mrs cheveley  moves away  vicomte de nanjac  ah chère madame queue surprise  i have not seen you since berlin  mrs cheveley  not since berlin vicomte  five years ago  vicomte de nanjac  and you are younger and more beautiful than ever how do you manage it  mrs cheveley  by making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming people like yourself  vicomte de nanjac  ah you flatter me  you butter me as they say here  mrs cheveley  do they say that here  how dreadful of them  vicomte de nanjac  yes they have a wonderful language  it should be more widely known  sir robert chiltern enters  a man of forty but looking somewhat younger  cleanshaven with finelycut features darkhaired and darkeyed  a personality of mark  not popular—few personalities are  but intensely admired by the few and deeply respected by the many  the note of his manner is that of perfect distinction with a slight touch of pride  one feels that he is conscious of the success he has made in life  a nervous temperament with a tired look the firmlychiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the romantic expression in the deepset eyes  the variance is suggestive of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect as though thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some violence of willpower  there is nervousness in the nostrils and in the pale thin pointed hands  it would be inaccurate to call him picturesque  picturesqueness cannot survive the house of commons but vandyck would have liked to have painted his head  sir robert chiltern  good evening lady markby  i hope you have brought sir john with you  lady markby  oh i have brought a much more charming person than sir john  sir john’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has become quite unbearable  really now that the house of commons is trying to become useful it does a great deal of harm  sir robert chiltern  i hope not lady markby  at any rate we do our best to waste the public time don’t we  but who is this charming person you have been kind enough to bring to us  lady markby  her name is mrs cheveley  one of the dorsetshire cheveleys i suppose  but i really don’t know  families are so mixed nowadays  indeed as a rule everybody turns out to be somebody else  sir robert chiltern  mrs cheveley  i seem to know the name  lady markby  she has just arrived from vienna  sir robert chiltern  ah yes  i think i know whom you mean  lady markby  oh she goes everywhere there and has such pleasant scandals about all her friends  i really must go to vienna next winter i hope there is a good chef at the embassy  sir robert chiltern  if there is not the ambassador will certainly have to be recalled  pray point out mrs cheveley to me  i should like to see her  lady markby  let me introduce you  to mrs cheveley  my dear sir robert chiltern is dying to know you  sir robert chiltern  bowing  every one is dying to know the brilliant mrs cheveley  our attachés at vienna write to us about nothing else  mrs cheveley  thank you sir robert  an acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship  it starts in the right manner  and i find that i know lady chiltern already  sir robert chiltern  really  mrs cheveley  yes  she has just reminded me that we were at school together  i remember it perfectly now  she always got the good conduct prize  i have a distinct recollection of lady chiltern always getting the good conduct prize  sir robert chiltern  smiling  and what prizes did you get mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  my prizes came a little later on in life  i don’t think any of them were for good conduct  i forget  sir robert chiltern  i am sure they were for something charming  mrs cheveley  i don’t know that women are always rewarded for being charming  i think they are usually punished for it  certainly more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else  at least that is the only way i can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in london  sir robert chiltern  what an appalling philosophy that sounds  to attempt to classify you mrs cheveley would be an impertinence  but may i ask at heart are you an optimist or a pessimist  those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays  mrs cheveley  oh i’m neither  optimism begins in a broad grin and pessimism ends with blue spectacles  besides they are both of them merely poses  sir robert chiltern  you prefer to be natural  mrs cheveley  sometimes  but it is such a very difficult pose to keep up  sir robert chiltern  what would those modern psychological novelists of whom we hear so much say to such a theory as that  mrs cheveley  ah the strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us  men can be analysed women    merely adored  sir robert chiltern  you think science cannot grapple with the problem of women  mrs cheveley  science can never grapple with the irrational  that is why it has no future before it in this world  sir robert chiltern  and women represent the irrational  mrs cheveley  welldressed women do  sir robert chiltern  with a polite bow  i fear i could hardly agree with you there  but do sit down  and now tell me what makes you leave your brilliant vienna for our gloomy london—or perhaps the question is indiscreet  mrs cheveley  questions are never indiscreet  answers sometimes are  sir robert chiltern  well at any rate may i know if it is politics or pleasure  mrs cheveley  politics are my only pleasure  you see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty or to be romantic till one is fortyfive so we poor women who are under thirty or say we are have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy  and philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellowcreatures  i prefer politics  i think they are more    becoming  sir robert chiltern  a political life is a noble career  mrs cheveley  sometimes  and sometimes it is a clever game sir robert  and sometimes it is a great nuisance  sir robert chiltern  which do you find it  mrs cheveley  i  a combination of all three  drops her fan  sir robert chiltern  picks up fan  allow me  mrs cheveley  thanks  sir robert chiltern  but you have not told me yet what makes you honour london so suddenly  our season is almost over  mrs cheveley  oh i don’t care about the london season  it is too matrimonial  people are either hunting for husbands or hiding from them  i wanted to meet you  it is quite true  you know what a woman’s curiosity is  almost as great as a man’s  i wanted immensely to meet you and    to ask you to do something for me  sir robert chiltern  i hope it is not a little thing mrs cheveley  i find that little things are so very difficult to do  mrs cheveley  after a moment’s reflection  no i don’t think it is quite a little thing  sir robert chiltern  i am so glad  do tell me what it is  mrs cheveley  later on  rises  and now may i walk through your beautiful house  i hear your pictures are charming  poor baron arnheim—you remember the baron—used to tell me you had some wonderful corots  sir robert chiltern  with an almost imperceptible start  did you know baron arnheim well  mrs cheveley  smiling  intimately  did you  sir robert chiltern  at one time  mrs cheveley  wonderful man wasn’t he  sir robert chiltern  after a pause  he was very remarkable in many ways  mrs cheveley  i often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs they would have been most interesting  sir robert chiltern  yes he knew men and cities well like the old greek  mrs cheveley  without the dreadful disadvantage of having a penelope waiting at home for him  mason  lord goring  enter lord goring  thirtyfour but always says he is younger a wellbred expressionless face  he is clever but would not like to be thought so  a flawless dandy he would be annoyed if he were considered romantic  he plays with life and is on perfectly good terms with the world  he is fond of being misunderstood  it gives him a post of vantage  sir robert chiltern  good evening my dear arthur  mrs cheveley allow me to introduce to you lord goring the idlest man in london  mrs cheveley  i have met lord goring before  lord goring  bowing  i did not think you would remember me mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  my memory is under admirable control  and are you still a bachelor  lord goring  i    believe so  mrs cheveley  how very romantic  lord goring  oh i am not at all romantic  i am not old enough  i leave romance to my seniors  sir robert chiltern  lord goring is the result of boodle’s club mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  he reflects every credit on the institution  lord goring  may i ask are you staying in london long  mrs cheveley  that depends partly on the weather partly on the cooking and partly on sir robert  sir robert chiltern  you are not going to plunge us into a european war i hope  mrs cheveley  there is no danger at present  she nods to lord goring with a look of amusement in her eyes and goes out with sir robert chiltern  lord goring saunters over to mabel chiltern  mabel chiltern  you are very late  lord goring  have you missed me  mabel chiltern  awfully  lord goring  then i am sorry i did not stay away longer  i like being missed  mabel chiltern  how very selfish of you  lord goring  i am very selfish  mabel chiltern  you are always telling me of your bad qualities lord goring  lord goring  i have only told you half of them as yet miss mabel  mabel chiltern  are the others very bad  lord goring  quite dreadful  when i think of them at night i go to sleep at once  mabel chiltern  well i delight in your bad qualities  i wouldn’t have you part with one of them  lord goring  how very nice of you  but then you are always nice  by the way i want to ask you a question miss mabel  who brought mrs cheveley here  that woman in heliotrope who has just gone out of the room with your brother  mabel chiltern  oh i think lady markby brought her  why do you ask  lord goring  i haven’t seen her for years that is all  mabel chiltern  what an absurd reason  lord goring  all reasons are absurd  mabel chiltern  what sort of a woman is she  lord goring  oh a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night  mabel chiltern  i dislike her already  lord goring  that shows your admirable good taste  vicomte de nanjac  approaching  ah the english young lady is the dragon of good taste is she not  quite the dragon of good taste  lord goring  so the newspapers are always telling us  vicomte de nanjac  i read all your english newspapers  i find them so amusing  lord goring  then my dear nanjac you must certainly read between the lines  vicomte de nanjac  i should like to but my professor objects  to mabel chiltern  may i have the pleasure of escorting you to the musicroom mademoiselle  mabel chiltern  looking very disappointed  delighted vicomte quite delighted  turning to lord goring  aren’t you coming to the musicroom  lord goring  not if there is any music going on miss mabel  mabel chiltern  severely  the music is in german  you would not understand it  goes out with the vicomte de nanjac  lord caversham comes up to his son  lord caversham  well sir what are you doing here  wasting your life as usual  you should be in bed sir  you keep too late hours  i heard of you the other night at lady rufford’s dancing till four o’clock in the morning  lord goring  only a quarter to four father  lord caversham  can’t make out how you stand london society  the thing has gone to the dogs a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing  lord goring  i love talking about nothing father  it is the only thing i know anything about  lord caversham  you seem to me to be living entirely for pleasure  lord goring  what else is there to live for father  nothing ages like happiness  lord caversham  you are heartless sir very heartless  lord goring  i hope not father  good evening lady basildon  lady basildon  arching two pretty eyebrows  are you here  i had no idea you ever came to political parties  lord goring  i adore political parties  they are the only place left to us where people don’t talk politics  lady basildon  i delight in talking politics  i talk them all day long but i can’t bear listening to them  i don’t know how the unfortunate men in the house stand these long debates  lord goring  by never listening  lady basildon  really  lord goring  in his most serious manner  of course  you see it is a very dangerous thing to listen  if one listens one may be convinced and a man who allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a thoroughly unreasonable person  lady basildon  ah that accounts for so much in men that i have never understood and so much in women that their husbands never appreciate in them  mrs marchmont  with a sigh  our husbands never appreciate anything in us  we have to go to others for that  lady basildon  emphatically  yes always to others have we not  lord goring  smiling  and those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in london  mrs marchmont  that is exactly what we can’t stand  my reginald is quite hopelessly faultless  he is really unendurably so at times there is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him  lord goring  how terrible  really the thing should be more widely known  lady basildon  basildon is quite as bad he is as domestic as if he was a bachelor  mrs marchmont  pressing lady basildon’s hand  my poor olivia we have married perfect husbands and we are well punished for it  lord goring  i should have thought it was the husbands who were punished  mrs marchmont  drawing herself up  oh dear no  they are as happy as possible  and as for trusting us it is tragic how much they trust us  lady basildon  perfectly tragic  lord goring  or comic lady basildon  lady basildon  certainly not comic lord goring  how unkind of you to suggest such a thing  mrs marchmont  i am afraid lord goring is in the camp of the enemy as usual  i saw him talking to that mrs cheveley when he came in  lord goring  handsome woman mrs cheveley  lady basildon  stiffly  please don’t praise other women in our presence  you might wait for us to do that  lord goring  i did wait  mrs marchmont  well we are not going to praise her  i hear she went to the opera on monday night and told tommy rufford at supper that as far as she could see london society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies  lord goring  she is quite right too  the men are all dowdies and the women are all dandies aren’t they  mrs marchmont  after a pause  oh do you really think that is what mrs cheveley meant  lord goring  of course  and a very sensible remark for mrs cheveley to make too  enter mabel chiltern  she joins the group  mabel chiltern  why are you talking about mrs cheveley  everybody is talking about mrs cheveley  lord goring says—what did you say lord goring about mrs cheveley  oh i remember that she was a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night  lady basildon  what a horrid combination  so very unnatural  mrs marchmont  in her most dreamy manner  i like looking at geniuses and listening to beautiful people  lord goring  ah that is morbid of you mrs marchmont  mrs marchmont  brightening to a look of real pleasure  i am so glad to hear you say that  marchmont and i have been married for seven years and he has never once told me that i was morbid  men are so painfully unobservant  lady basildon  turning to her  i have always said dear margaret that you were the most morbid person in london  mrs marchmont  ah but you are always sympathetic olivia  mabel chiltern  is it morbid to have a desire for food  i have a great desire for food  lord goring will you give me some supper  lord goring  with pleasure miss mabel  moves away with her  mabel chiltern  how horrid you have been  you have never talked to me the whole evening  lord goring  how could i  you went away with the childdiplomatist  mabel chiltern  you might have followed us  pursuit would have been only polite  i don’t think i like you at all this evening  lord goring  i like you immensely  mabel chiltern  well i wish you’d show it in a more marked way  they go downstairs  mrs marchmont  olivia i have a curious feeling of absolute faintness i think i should like some supper very much  i know i should like some supper  lady basildon  i am positively dying for supper margaret  mrs marchmont  men are so horribly selfish they never think of these things  lady basildon  men are grossly material grossly material  the vicomte de nanjac enters from the musicroom with some other guests  after having carefully examined all the people present he approaches lady basildon  vicomte de nanjac  may i have the honour of taking you down to supper comtesse  lady basildon  coldly  i never take supper thank you vicomte the vicomte is about to retire  lady basildon seeing this rises at once and takes his arm  but i will come down with you with pleasure  vicomte de nanjac  i am so fond of eating  i am very english in all my tastes  lady basildon  you look quite english vicomte quite english  they pass out  mr montford a perfectly groomed young dandy approaches mrs marchmont  mr montford  like some supper mrs marchmont  mrs marchmont  languidly  thank you mr montford i never touch supper  rises hastily and takes his arm  but i will sit beside you and watch you  mr montford  i don’t know that i like being watched when i am eating  mrs marchmont  then i will watch some one else  mr montford  i don’t know that i should like that either  mrs marchmont  severely  pray mr montford do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public  they go downstairs with the other guests passing sir robert chiltern and mrs cheveley who now enter  sir robert chiltern  and are you going to any of our country houses before you leave england mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  oh no  i can’t stand your english houseparties  in england people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast  that is so dreadful of them  only dull people are brilliant at breakfast  and then the family skeleton is always reading family prayers  my stay in england really depends on you sir robert  sits down on the sofa  sir robert chiltern  taking a seat beside her  seriously  mrs cheveley  quite seriously  i want to talk to you about a great political and financial scheme about this argentine canal company in fact  sir robert chiltern  what a tedious practical subject for you to talk about mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  oh i like tedious practical subjects  what i don’t like are tedious practical people  there is a wide difference besides you are interested i know in international canal schemes  you were lord radley’s secretary weren’t you when the government bought the suez canal shares  sir robert chiltern  yes  but the suez canal was a very great and splendid undertaking  it gave us our direct route to india  it had imperial value  it was necessary that we should have control  this argentine scheme is a commonplace stock exchange swindle  mrs cheveley  a speculation sir robert  a brilliant daring speculation  sir robert chiltern  believe me mrs cheveley it is a swindle  let us call things by their proper names  it makes matters simpler  we have all the information about it at the foreign office  in fact i sent out a special commission to inquire into the matter privately and they report that the works are hardly begun and as for the money already subscribed no one seems to know what has become of it  the whole thing is a second panama and with not a quarter of the chance of success that miserable affair ever had  i hope you have not invested in it  i am sure you are far too clever to have done that  mrs cheveley  i have invested very largely in it  sir robert chiltern  who could have advised you to do such a foolish thing  mrs cheveley  your old friend—and mine  sir robert chiltern  who  mrs cheveley  baron arnheim  sir robert chiltern  frowning  ah yes  i remember hearing at the time of his death that he had been mixed up in the whole affair  mrs cheveley  it was his last romance  his last but one to do him justice  sir robert chiltern  rising  but you have not seen my corots yet they are in the musicroom  corots seem to go with music don’t they may i show them to you  mrs cheveley  shaking her head  i am not in a mood tonight for silver twilights or rosepink dawns  i want to talk business motions to him with her fan to sit down again beside her  sir robert chiltern  i fear i have no advice to give you mrs cheveley except to interest yourself in something less dangerous  the success of the canal depends of course on the attitude of england and i am going to lay the report of the commissioners before the house tomorrow night  mrs cheveley  that you must not do  in your own interests sir robert to say nothing of mine you must not do that  sir robert chiltern  looking at her in wonder  in my own interests my dear mrs cheveley what do you mean  sits down beside her  mrs cheveley  sir robert i will be quite frank with you  i want you to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the house on the ground that you have reasons to believe that the commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed or something  then i want you to say a few words to the effect that the government is going to reconsider the question and that you have reason to believe that the canal if completed will be of great international value  you know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind  a few ordinary platitudes will do  in modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude  it makes the whole world kin  will you do that for me  sir robert chiltern  mrs cheveley you cannot be serious in making me such a proposition  mrs cheveley  i am quite serious  sir robert chiltern  coldly  pray allow me to believe that you are not  mrs cheveley  speaking with great deliberation and emphasis  ah but i am  and if you do what i ask you i    will pay you very handsomely  sir robert chiltern  pay me  mrs cheveley  yes  sir robert chiltern  i am afraid i don’t quite understand what you mean  mrs cheveley  leaning back on the sofa and looking at him  how very disappointing  and i have come all the way from vienna in order that you should thoroughly understand me  sir robert chiltern  i fear i don’t  mrs cheveley  in her most nonchalant manner  my dear sir robert you are a man of the world and you have your price i suppose everybody has nowadays  the drawback is that most people are so dreadfully expensive  i know i am  i hope you will be more reasonable in your terms  sir robert chiltern  rises indignantly  if you will allow me i will call your carriage for you  you have lived so long abroad mrs cheveley that you seem to be unable to realise that you are talking to an english gentleman  mrs cheveley  detains him by touching his arm with her fan and keeping it there while she is talking  i realise that i am talking to a man who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling to a stock exchange speculator a cabinet secret  sir robert chiltern  biting his lip  what do you mean  mrs cheveley  rising and facing him  i mean that i know the real origin of your wealth and your career and i have got your letter too  sir robert chiltern  what letter  mrs cheveley  contemptuously  the letter you wrote to baron arnheim when you were lord radley’s secretary telling the baron to buy suez canal shares—a letter written three days before the government announced its own purchase  sir robert chiltern  hoarsely  it is not true  mrs cheveley  you thought that letter had been destroyed  how foolish of you  it is in my possession  sir robert chiltern  the affair to which you allude was no more than a speculation  the house of commons had not yet passed the bill it might have been rejected  mrs cheveley  it was a swindle sir robert  let us call things by their proper names  it makes everything simpler  and now i am going to sell you that letter and the price i ask for it is your public support of the argentine scheme  you made your own fortune out of one canal you must help me and my friends to make our fortunes out of another  sir robert chiltern  it is infamous what you propose—infamous  mrs cheveley  oh no  this is the game of life as we all have to play it sir robert sooner or later  sir robert chiltern  i cannot do what you ask me  mrs cheveley  you mean you cannot help doing it  you know you are standing on the edge of a precipice  and it is not for you to make terms  it is for you to accept them  supposing you refuse—  sir robert chiltern  what then  mrs cheveley  my dear sir robert what then  you are ruined that is all  remember to what a point your puritanism in england has brought you  in old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his neighbours  in fact to be a bit better than one’s neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middleclass  nowadays with our modern mania for morality every one has to pose as a paragon of purity incorruptibility and all the other seven deadly virtues—and what is the result  you all go over like ninepins—one after the other  not a year passes in england without somebody disappearing  scandals used to lend charm or at least interest to a man—now they crush him  and yours is a very nasty scandal you couldn’t survive it  if it were known that as a young man secretary to a great and important minister you sold a cabinet secret for a large sum of money and that that was the origin of your wealth and career you would be hounded out of public life you would disappear completely  and after all sir robert why should you sacrifice your entire future rather than deal diplomatically with your enemy  for the moment i am your enemy  i admit it  and i am much stronger than you are  the big battalions are on my side  you have a splendid position but it is your splendid position that makes you so vulnerable  you can’t defend it  and i am in attack  of course i have not talked morality to you  you must admit in fairness that i have spared you that  years ago you did a clever unscrupulous thing it turned out a great success  you owe to it your fortune and position and now you have got to pay for it  sooner or later we have all to pay for what we do  you have to pay now  before i leave you tonight you have got to promise me to suppress your report and to speak in the house in favour of this scheme  sir robert chiltern  what you ask is impossible  mrs cheveley  you must make it possible  you are going to make it possible  sir robert you know what your english newspapers are like suppose that when i leave this house i drive down to some newspaper office and give them this scandal and the proofs of it  think of their loathsome joy of the delight they would have in dragging you down of the mud and mire they would plunge you in  think of the hypocrite with his greasy smile penning his leading article and arranging the foulness of the public placard  sir robert chiltern  stop  you want me to withdraw the report and to make a short speech stating that i believe there are possibilities in the scheme  mrs cheveley  sitting down on the sofa  those are my terms  sir robert chiltern  in a low voice  i will give you any sum of money you want  mrs cheveley  even you are not rich enough sir robert to buy back your past  no man is  sir robert chiltern  i will not do what you ask me  i will not  mrs cheveley  you have to  if you don’t    rises from the sofa  sir robert chiltern  bewildered and unnerved  wait a moment  what did you propose  you said that you would give me back my letter didn’t you  mrs cheveley  yes  that is agreed  i will be in the ladies’ gallery tomorrow night at halfpast eleven  if by that time—and you will have had heaps of opportunity—you have made an announcement to the house in the terms i wish i shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest thanks and the best or at any rate the most suitable compliment i can think of  i intend to play quite fairly with you  one should always play fairly    when one has the winning cards  the baron taught me that    amongst other things  sir robert chiltern  you must let me have time to consider your proposal  mrs cheveley  no you must settle now  sir robert chiltern  give me a week—three days  mrs cheveley  impossible  i have got to telegraph to vienna tonight  sir robert chiltern  my god what brought you into my life  mrs cheveley  circumstances  moves towards the door  sir robert chiltern  don’t go  i consent  the report shall be withdrawn  i will arrange for a question to be put to me on the subject  mrs cheveley  thank you  i knew we should come to an amicable agreement  i understood your nature from the first  i analysed you though you did not adore me  and now you can get my carriage for me sir robert  i see the people coming up from supper and englishmen always get romantic after a meal and that bores me dreadfully  exit sir robert chiltern  enter guests lady chiltern lady markby lord caversham lady basildon mrs marchmont vicomte de nanjac mr montford  lady markby  well dear mrs cheveley i hope you have enjoyed yourself sir robert is very entertaining is he not  mrs cheveley  most entertaining  i have enjoyed my talk with him immensely  lady markby  he has had a very interesting and brilliant career  and he has married a most admirable wife  lady chiltern is a woman of the very highest principles i am glad to say  i am a little too old now myself to trouble about setting a good example but i always admire people who do  and lady chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life though her dinnerparties are rather dull sometimes  but one can’t have everything can one  and now i must go dear  shall i call for you tomorrow  mrs cheveley  thanks  lady markby  we might drive in the park at five  everything looks so fresh in the park now  mrs cheveley  except the people  lady markby  perhaps the people are a little jaded  i have often observed that the season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of the brain  however i think anything is better than high intellectual pressure  that is the most unbecoming thing there is  it makes the noses of the young girls so particularly large  and there is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose men don’t like them  goodnight dear  to lady chiltern  goodnight gertrude  goes out on lord caversham’s arm  mrs cheveley  what a charming house you have lady chiltern  i have spent a delightful evening  it has been so interesting getting to know your husband  lady chiltern  why did you wish to meet my husband mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  oh i will tell you  i wanted to interest him in this argentine canal scheme of which i dare say you have heard  and i found him most susceptible—susceptible to reason i mean  a rare thing in a man  i converted him in ten minutes  he is going to make a speech in the house tomorrow night in favour of the idea  we must go to the ladies’ gallery and hear him  it will be a great occasion  lady chiltern  there must be some mistake  that scheme could never have my husband’s support  mrs cheveley  oh i assure you it’s all settled  i don’t regret my tedious journey from vienna now  it has been a great success  but of course for the next twentyfour hours the whole thing is a dead secret  lady chiltern  gently  a secret  between whom  mrs cheveley  with a flash of amusement in her eyes  between your husband and myself  sir robert chiltern  entering  your carriage is here mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  thanks  good evening lady chiltern  goodnight lord goring  i am at claridge’s  don’t you think you might leave a card  lord goring  if you wish it mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  oh don’t be so solemn about it or i shall be obliged to leave a card on you  in england i suppose that would hardly be considered en règle  abroad we are more civilised  will you see me down sir robert  now that we have both the same interests at heart we shall be great friends i hope  sails out on sir robert chiltern’s arm  lady chiltern goes to the top of the staircase and looks down at them as they descend  her expression is troubled  after a little time she is joined by some of the guests and passes with them into another receptionroom  mabel chiltern  what a horrid woman  lord goring  you should go to bed miss mabel  mabel chiltern  lord goring  lord goring  my father told me to go to bed an hour ago  i don’t see why i shouldn’t give you the same advice  i always pass on good advice it is the only thing to do with it  it is never of any use to oneself  mabel chiltern  lord goring you are always ordering me out of the room i think it most courageous of you  especially as i am not going to bed for hours  goes over to the sofa  you can come and sit down if you like and talk about anything in the world except the royal academy mrs cheveley or novels in scotch dialect  they are not improving subjects  catches sight of something that is lying on the sofa half hidden by the cushion  what is this  some one has dropped a diamond brooch  quite beautiful isn’t it  shows it to him  i wish it was mine but gertrude won’t let me wear anything but pearls and i am thoroughly sick of pearls  they make one look so plain so good and so intellectual  i wonder whom the brooch belongs to  lord goring  i wonder who dropped it  mabel chiltern  it is a beautiful brooch  lord goring  it is a handsome bracelet  mabel chiltern  it isn’t a bracelet  it’s a brooch  lord goring  it can be used as a bracelet  takes it from her and pulling out a green lettercase puts the ornament carefully in it and replaces the whole thing in his breastpocket with the most perfect sang froid  mabel chiltern  what are you doing  lord goring  miss mabel i am going to make a rather strange request to you  mabel chiltern  eagerly  oh pray do  i have been waiting for it all the evening  lord goring  is a little taken aback but recovers himself  don’t mention to anybody that i have taken charge of this brooch  should any one write and claim it let me know at once  mabel chiltern  that is a strange request  lord goring  well you see i gave this brooch to somebody once years ago  mabel chiltern  you did  lord goring  yes  lady chiltern enters alone  the other guests have gone  mabel chiltern  then i shall certainly bid you goodnight  goodnight gertrude  exit  lady chiltern  goodnight dear  to lord goring  you saw whom lady markby brought here tonight  lord goring  yes  it was an unpleasant surprise  what did she come here for  lady chiltern  apparently to try and lure robert to uphold some fraudulent scheme in which she is interested  the argentine canal in fact  lord goring  she has mistaken her man hasn’t she  lady chiltern  she is incapable of understanding an upright nature like my husband’s  lord goring  yes  i should fancy she came to grief if she tried to get robert into her toils  it is extraordinary what astounding mistakes clever women make  lady chiltern  i don’t call women of that kind clever  i call them stupid  lord goring  same thing often  goodnight lady chiltern  lady chiltern  goodnight  enter sir robert chiltern  sir robert chiltern  my dear arthur you are not going  do stop a little  lord goring  afraid i can’t thanks  i have promised to look in at the hartlocks’  i believe they have got a mauve hungarian band that plays mauve hungarian music  see you soon  goodbye  exit  sir robert chiltern  how beautiful you look tonight gertrude  lady chiltern  robert it is not true is it  you are not going to lend your support to this argentine speculation  you couldn’t  sir robert chiltern  starting  who told you i intended to do so  lady chiltern  that woman who has just gone out mrs cheveley as she calls herself now  she seemed to taunt me with it  robert i know this woman  you don’t  we were at school together  she was untruthful dishonest an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she could win  i hated i despised her  she stole things she was a thief she was sent away for being a thief  why do you let her influence you  sir robert chiltern  gertrude what you tell me may be true but it happened many years ago  it is best forgotten  mrs cheveley may have changed since then  no one should be entirely judged by their past  lady chiltern  sadly  one’s past is what one is  it is the only way by which people should be judged  sir robert chiltern  that is a hard saying gertrude  lady chiltern  it is a true saying robert  and what did she mean by boasting that she had got you to lend your support your name to a thing i have heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudulent scheme there has ever been in political life  sir robert chiltern  biting his lip  i was mistaken in the view i took  we all may make mistakes  lady chiltern  but you told me yesterday that you had received the report from the commission and that it entirely condemned the whole thing  sir robert chiltern  walking up and down  i have reasons now to believe that the commission was prejudiced or at any rate misinformed besides gertrude public and private life are different things  they have different laws and move on different lines  lady chiltern  they should both represent man at his highest  i see no difference between them  sir robert chiltern  stopping  in the present case on a matter of practical politics i have changed my mind  that is all  lady chiltern  all  sir robert chiltern  sternly  yes  lady chiltern  robert  oh it is horrible that i should have to ask you such a question—robert are you telling me the whole truth  sir robert chiltern  why do you ask me such a question  lady chiltern  after a pause  why do you not answer it  sir robert chiltern  sitting down  gertrude truth is a very complex thing and politics is a very complex business  there are wheels within wheels  one may be under certain obligations to people that one must pay  sooner or later in political life one has to compromise every one does  lady chiltern  compromise  robert why do you talk so differently tonight from the way i have always heard you talk  why are you changed  sir robert chiltern  i am not changed  but circumstances alter things  lady chiltern  circumstances should never alter principles  sir robert chiltern  but if i told you—  lady chiltern  what  sir robert chiltern  that it was necessary vitally necessary  lady chiltern  it can never be necessary to do what is not honourable or if it be necessary then what is it that i have loved  but it is not robert tell me it is not  why should it be  what gain would you get money  we have no need of that  and money that comes from a tainted source is a degradation  power  but power is nothing in itself  it is power to do good that is fine—that and that only  what is it then robert tell me why you are going to do this dishonourable thing  sir robert chiltern  gertrude you have no right to use that word  i told you it was a question of rational compromise  it is no more than that  lady chiltern  robert that is all very well for other men for men who treat life simply as a sordid speculation but not for you robert not for you  you are different  all your life you have stood apart from others  you have never let the world soil you  to the world as to myself you have been an ideal always  oh be that ideal still  that great inheritance throw not away—that tower of ivory do not destroy robert men can love what is beneath them—things unworthy stained dishonoured  we women worship when we love and when we lose our worship we lose everything  oh don’t kill my love for you don’t kill that  sir robert chiltern  gertrude  lady chiltern  i know that there are men with horrible secrets in their lives—men who have done some shameful thing and who in some critical moment have to pay for it by doing some other act of shame—oh don’t tell me you are such as they are  robert is there in your life any secret dishonour or disgrace  tell me tell me at once that—  sir robert chiltern  that what  lady chiltern  speaking very slowly  that our lives may drift apart  sir robert chiltern  drift apart  lady chiltern  that they may be entirely separate  it would be better for us both  sir robert chiltern  gertrude there is nothing in my past life that you might not know  lady chiltern  i was sure of it robert i was sure of it  but why did you say those dreadful things things so unlike your real self  don’t let us ever talk about the subject again  you will write won’t you to mrs cheveley and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous scheme of hers  if you have given her any promise you must take it back that is all  sir robert chiltern  must i write and tell her that  lady chiltern  surely robert  what else is there to do  sir robert chiltern  i might see her personally  it would be better  lady chiltern  you must never see her again robert  she is not a woman you should ever speak to  she is not worthy to talk to a man like you no you must write to her at once now this moment and let your letter show her that your decision is quite irrevocable  sir robert chiltern  write this moment  lady chiltern  yes  sir robert chiltern  but it is so late  it is close on twelve  lady chiltern  that makes no matter  she must know at once that she has been mistaken in you—and that you are not a man to do anything base or underhand or dishonourable  write here robert  write that you decline to support this scheme of hers as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme yes—write the word dishonest  she knows what that word means  sir robert chiltern sits down and writes a letter  his wife takes it up and reads it  yes that will do  rings bell  and now the envelope  he writes the envelope slowly  enter mason  have this letter sent at once to claridge’s hotel  there is no answer  exit mason  lady chiltern kneels down beside her husband and puts her arms around him  robert love gives one an instinct to things  i feel tonight that i have saved you from something that might have been a danger to you from something that might have made men honour you less than they do  i don’t think you realise sufficiently robert that you have brought into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere a finer attitude towards life a freer air of purer aims and higher ideals—i know it and for that i love you robert  sir robert chiltern  oh love me always gertrude love me always  lady chiltern  i will love you always because you will always be worthy of love  we needs must love the highest when we see it  kisses him and rises and goes out  sir robert chiltern walks up and down for a moment then sits down and buries his face in his hands  the servant enters and begins pulling out the lights  sir robert chiltern looks up  sir robert chiltern  put out the lights mason put out the lights  the servant puts out the lights  the room becomes almost dark the only light there is comes from the great chandelier that hangs over the staircase and illumines the tapestry of the triumph of love                                   act drop     second act   scene   morningroom at sir robert chiltern’s house  lord goring dressed in the height of fashion is lounging in an armchair  sir robert chiltern is standing in front of the fireplace he is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress as the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room  lord goring  my dear robert it’s a very awkward business very awkward indeed  you should have told your wife the whole thing  secrets from other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life  so at least i am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know better  but no man should have a secret from his own wife  she invariably finds it out  women have a wonderful instinct about things they can discover everything except the obvious  sir robert chiltern  arthur i couldn’t tell my wife  when could i have told her  not last night  it would have made a lifelong separation between us and i would have lost the love of the one woman in the world i worship of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me  last night it would have been quite impossible  she would have turned from me in horror    in horror and in contempt  lord goring  is lady chiltern as perfect as all that  sir robert chiltern  yes my wife is as perfect as all that  lord goring  taking off his lefthand glove  what a pity  i beg your pardon my dear fellow i didn’t quite mean that  but if what you tell me is true i should like to have a serious talk about life with lady chiltern  sir robert chiltern  it would be quite useless  lord goring  may i try  sir robert chiltern  yes but nothing could make her alter her views  lord goring  well at the worst it would simply be a psychological experiment  sir robert chiltern  all such experiments are terribly dangerous  lord goring  everything is dangerous my dear fellow  if it wasn’t so life wouldn’t be worth living    well i am bound to say that i think you should have told her years ago  sir robert chiltern  when  when we were engaged  do you think she would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is such as it is the basis of my career such as it is and that i had done a thing that i suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable  lord goring  slowly  yes most men would call it ugly names  there is no doubt of that  sir robert chiltern  bitterly  men who every day do something of the same kind themselves  men who each one of them have worse secrets in their own lives  lord goring  that is the reason they are so pleased to find out other people’s secrets  it distracts public attention from their own  sir robert chiltern  and after all whom did i wrong by what i did  no one  lord goring  looking at him steadily  except yourself robert  sir robert chiltern  after a pause  of course i had private information about a certain transaction contemplated by the government of the day and i acted on it  private information is practically the source of every large modern fortune  lord goring  tapping his boot with his cane  and public scandal invariably the result  sir robert chiltern  pacing up and down the room  arthur do you think that what i did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up against me now  do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost  i was twentytwo at the time and i had the double misfortune of being wellborn and poor two unforgiveable things nowadays  is it fair that the folly the sin of one’s youth if men choose to call it a sin should wreck a life like mine should place me in the pillory should shatter all that i have worked for all that i have built up  is it fair arthur  lord goring  life is never fair robert  and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not  sir robert chiltern  every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons  what this century worships is wealth  the god of this century is wealth  to succeed one must have wealth  at all costs one must have wealth  lord goring  you underrate yourself robert  believe me without wealth you could have succeeded just as well  sir robert chiltern  when i was old perhaps  when i had lost my passion for power or could not use it  when i was tired worn out disappointed  i wanted my success when i was young  youth is the time for success  i couldn’t wait  lord goring  well you certainly have had your success while you are still young  no one in our day has had such a brilliant success undersecretary for foreign affairs at the age of forty—that’s good enough for any one i should think  sir robert chiltern  and if it is all taken away from me now  if i lose everything over a horrible scandal  if i am hounded from public life  lord goring  robert how could you have sold yourself for money  sir robert chiltern  excitedly  i did not sell myself for money  i bought success at a great price  that is all  lord goring  gravely  yes you certainly paid a great price for it but what first made you think of doing such a thing  sir robert chiltern  baron arnheim  lord goring  damned scoundrel  sir robert chiltern  no he was a man of a most subtle and refined intellect  a man of culture charm and distinction  one of the most intellectual men i ever met  lord goring  ah i prefer a gentlemanly fool any day  there is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine  personally i have a great admiration for stupidity  it is a sort of fellowfeeling i suppose but how did he do it  tell me the whole thing  sir robert chiltern  throws himself into an armchair by the writingtable  one night after dinner at lord radley’s the baron began talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce to an absolutely definite science  with that wonderfully fascinating quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all philosophies the philosophy of power preached to us the most marvellous of all gospels the gospel of gold  i think he saw the effect he had produced on me for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come and see him  he was living then in park lane in the house lord woolcomb has now  i remember so well how with a strange smile on his pale curved lips he led me through his wonderful picture gallery showed me his tapestries his enamels his jewels his carved ivories made me wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived and then told me that luxury was nothing but a background a painted scene in a play and that power power over other men power over the world was the one thing worth having the one supreme pleasure worth knowing the one joy one never tired of and that in our century only the rich possessed it  lord goring  with great deliberation  a thoroughly shallow creed  sir robert chiltern  rising  i didn’t think so then  i don’t think so now  wealth has given me enormous power  it gave me at the very outset of my life freedom and freedom is everything  you have never been poor and never known what ambition is  you cannot understand what a wonderful chance the baron gave me  such a chance as few men get  lord goring  fortunately for them if one is to judge by results  but tell me definitely how did the baron finally persuade you to—well to do what you did  sir robert chiltern  when i was going away he said to me that if i ever could give him any private information of real value he would make me a very rich man  i was dazed at the prospect he held out to me and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless  six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands  lord goring  keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the carpet  state documents  sir robert chiltern  yes  lord goring sighs then passes his hand across his forehead and looks up  lord goring  i had no idea that you of all men in the world could have been so weak robert as to yield to such a temptation as baron arnheim held out to you  sir robert chiltern  weak  oh i am sick of hearing that phrase  sick of using it about others  weak  do you really think arthur that it is weakness that yields to temptation  i tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength strength and courage to yield to to stake all one’s life on a single moment to risk everything on one throw whether the stake be power or pleasure i care not—there is no weakness in that  there is a horrible a terrible courage  i had that courage  i sat down the same afternoon and wrote baron arnheim the letter this woman now holds  he made threequarters of a million over the transaction  lord goring  and you  sir robert chiltern  i received from the baron £110000  lord goring  you were worth more robert  sir robert chiltern  no that money gave me exactly what i wanted power over others  i went into the house immediately  the baron advised me in finance from time to time  before five years i had almost trebled my fortune  since then everything that i have touched has turned out a success  in all things connected with money i have had a luck so extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid  i remember having read somewhere in some strange book that when the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers  lord goring  but tell me robert did you never suffer any regret for what you had done  sir robert chiltern  no  i felt that i had fought the century with its own weapons and won  lord goring  sadly  you thought you had won  sir robert chiltern  i thought so  after a long pause  arthur do you despise me for what i have told you  lord goring  with deep feeling in his voice  i am very sorry for you robert very sorry indeed  sir robert chiltern  i don’t say that i suffered any remorse  i didn’t not remorse in the ordinary rather silly sense of the word  but i have paid conscience money many times  i had a wild hope that i might disarm destiny  the sum baron arnheim gave me i have distributed twice over in public charities since then  lord goring  looking up  in public charities  dear me what a lot of harm you must have done robert  sir robert chiltern  oh don’t say that arthur don’t talk like that  lord goring  never mind what i say robert  i am always saying what i shouldn’t say  in fact i usually say what i really think  a great mistake nowadays  it makes one so liable to be misunderstood  as regards this dreadful business i will help you in whatever way i can of course you know that  sir robert chiltern  thank you arthur thank you  but what is to be done  what can be done  lord goring  leaning back with his hands in his pockets  well the english can’t stand a man who is always saying he is in the right but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong  it is one of the best things in them  however in your case robert a confession would not do  the money if you will allow me to say so is    awkward  besides if you did make a clean breast of the whole affair you would never be able to talk morality again  and in england a man who can’t talk morality twice a week to a large popular immoral audience is quite over as a serious politician  there would be nothing left for him as a profession except botany or the church  a confession would be of no use  it would ruin you  sir robert chiltern  it would ruin me  arthur the only thing for me to do now is to fight the thing out  lord goring  rising from his chair  i was waiting for you to say that robert  it is the only thing to do now  and you must begin by telling your wife the whole story  sir robert chiltern  that i will not do  lord goring  robert believe me you are wrong  sir robert chiltern  i couldn’t do it  it would kill her love for me and now about this woman this mrs cheveley  how can i defend myself against her  you knew her before arthur apparently  lord goring  yes  sir robert chiltern  did you know her well  lord goring  arranging his necktie  so little that i got engaged to be married to her once when i was staying at the tenbys’  the affair lasted for three days    nearly  sir robert chiltern  why was it broken off  lord goring  airily  oh i forget  at least it makes no matter by the way have you tried her with money  she used to be confoundedly fond of money  sir robert chiltern  i offered her any sum she wanted  she refused  lord goring  then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down sometimes the rich can’t do everything after all  sir robert chiltern  not everything  i suppose you are right  arthur i feel that public disgrace is in store for me  i feel certain of it  i never knew what terror was before  i know it now  it is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one’s heart  it is as if one’s heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow  lord goring  striking the table  robert you must fight her  you must fight her  sir robert chiltern  but how  lord goring  i can’t tell you how at present  i have not the smallest idea  but every one has some weak point  there is some flaw in each one of us  strolls to the fireplace and looks at himself in the glass my father tells me that even i have faults  perhaps i have  i don’t know  sir robert chiltern  in defending myself against mrs cheveley i have a right to use any weapon i can find have i not  lord goring  still looking in the glass  in your place i don’t think i should have the smallest scruple in doing so  she is thoroughly well able to take care of herself  sir robert chiltern  sits down at the table and takes a pen in his hand  well i shall send a cipher telegram to the embassy at vienna to inquire if there is anything known against her  there may be some secret scandal she might be afraid of  lord goring  settling his buttonhole  oh i should fancy mrs cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet and air them both in the park every afternoon at fivethirty  i am sure she adores scandals and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can’t manage to have enough of them  sir robert chiltern  writing  why do you say that  lord goring  turning round  well she wore far too much rouge last night and not quite enough clothes  that is always a sign of despair in a woman  sir robert chiltern  striking a bell  but it is worth while my wiring to vienna is it not  lord goring  it is always worth while asking a question though it is not always worth while answering one  enter mason  sir robert chiltern  is mr trafford in his room  mason  yes sir robert  sir robert chiltern  puts what he has written into an envelope which he then carefully closes  tell him to have this sent off in cipher at once  there must not be a moment’s delay  mason  yes sir robert  sir robert chiltern  oh just give that back to me again  writes something on the envelope  mason then goes out with the letter  sir robert chiltern  she must have had some curious hold over baron arnheim  i wonder what it was  lord goring  smiling  i wonder  sir robert chiltern  i will fight her to the death as long as my wife knows nothing  lord goring  strongly  oh fight in any case—in any case  sir robert chiltern  with a gesture of despair  if my wife found out there would be little left to fight for  well as soon as i hear from vienna i shall let you know the result  it is a chance just a chance but i believe in it  and as i fought the age with its own weapons i will fight her with her weapons  it is only fair and she looks like a woman with a past doesn’t she  lord goring  most pretty women do  but there is a fashion in pasts just as there is a fashion in frocks  perhaps mrs cheveley’s past is merely a slightly décolleté one and they are excessively popular nowadays besides my dear robert i should not build too high hopes on frightening mrs cheveley  i should not fancy mrs cheveley is a woman who would be easily frightened  she has survived all her creditors and she shows wonderful presence of mind  sir robert chiltern  oh i live on hopes now  i clutch at every chance i feel like a man on a ship that is sinking  the water is round my feet and the very air is bitter with storm  hush i hear my wife’s voice  enter lady chiltern in walking dress  lady chiltern  good afternoon lord goring  lord goring  good afternoon lady chiltern  have you been in the park  lady chiltern  no i have just come from the woman’s liberal association where by the way robert your name was received with loud applause and now i have come in to have my tea  to lord goring you will wait and have some tea won’t you  lord goring  i’ll wait for a short time thanks  lady chiltern  i will be back in a moment  i am only going to take my hat off  lord goring  in his most earnest manner  oh please don’t  it is so pretty  one of the prettiest hats i ever saw  i hope the woman’s liberal association received it with loud applause  lady chiltern  with a smile  we have much more important work to do than look at each other’s bonnets lord goring  lord goring  really  what sort of work  lady chiltern  oh dull useful delightful things factory acts female inspectors the eight hours’ bill the parliamentary franchise    everything in fact that you would find thoroughly uninteresting  lord goring  and never bonnets  lady chiltern  with mock indignation  never bonnets never  lady chiltern goes out through the door leading to her boudoir  sir robert chiltern  takes lord goring’s hand  you have been a good friend to me arthur a thoroughly good friend  lord goring  i don’t know that i have been able to do much for you robert as yet  in fact i have not been able to do anything for you as far as i can see  i am thoroughly disappointed with myself  sir robert chiltern  you have enabled me to tell you the truth  that is something  the truth has always stifled me  lord goring  ah the truth is a thing i get rid of as soon as possible bad habit by the way  makes one very unpopular at the club    with the older members  they call it being conceited  perhaps it is  sir robert chiltern  i would to god that i had been able to tell the truth    to live the truth  ah that is the great thing in life to live the truth  sighs and goes towards the door  i’ll see you soon again arthur shan’t i  lord goring  certainly  whenever you like  i’m going to look in at the bachelors’ ball tonight unless i find something better to do  but i’ll come round tomorrow morning  if you should want me tonight by any chance send round a note to curzon street  sir robert chiltern  thank you  as he reaches the door lady chiltern enters from her boudoir  lady chiltern  you are not going robert  sir robert chiltern  i have some letters to write dear  lady chiltern  going to him  you work too hard robert  you seem never to think of yourself and you are looking so tired  sir robert chiltern  it is nothing dear nothing  he kisses her and goes out  lady chiltern  to lord goring  do sit down  i am so glad you have called  i want to talk to you about    well not about bonnets or the woman’s liberal association  you take far too much interest in the first subject and not nearly enough in the second  lord goring  you want to talk to me about mrs cheveley  lady chiltern  yes  you have guessed it  after you left last night i found out that what she had said was really true  of course i made robert write her a letter at once withdrawing his promise  lord goring  so he gave me to understand  lady chiltern  to have kept it would have been the first stain on a career that has been stainless always  robert must be above reproach he is not like other men  he cannot afford to do what other men do she looks at lord goring who remains silent  don’t you agree with me  you are robert’s greatest friend  you are our greatest friend lord goring  no one except myself knows robert better than you do  he has no secrets from me and i don’t think he has any from you  lord goring  he certainly has no secrets from me  at least i don’t think so  lady chiltern  then am i not right in my estimate of him  i know i am right  but speak to me frankly  lord goring  looking straight at her  quite frankly  lady chiltern  surely  you have nothing to conceal have you  lord goring  nothing  but my dear lady chiltern i think if you will allow me to say so that in practical life—  lady chiltern  smiling  of which you know so little lord goring—  lord goring  of which i know nothing by experience though i know something by observation  i think that in practical life there is something about success actual success that is a little unscrupulous something about ambition that is unscrupulous always  once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to a certain point if he has to climb the crag he climbs the crag if he has to walk in the mire—  lady chiltern  well  lord goring  he walks in the mire  of course i am only talking generally about life  lady chiltern  gravely  i hope so  why do you look at me so strangely lord goring  lord goring  lady chiltern i have sometimes thought that    perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life  i think that    often you don’t make sufficient allowances  in every nature there are elements of weakness or worse than weakness  supposing for instance that—that any public man my father or lord merton or robert say had years ago written some foolish letter to some one     lady chiltern  what do you mean by a foolish letter  lord goring  a letter gravely compromising one’s position  i am only putting an imaginary case  lady chiltern  robert is as incapable of doing a foolish thing as he is of doing a wrong thing  lord goring  after a long pause  nobody is incapable of doing a foolish thing  nobody is incapable of doing a wrong thing  lady chiltern  are you a pessimist  what will the other dandies say they will all have to go into mourning  lord goring  rising  no lady chiltern i am not a pessimist indeed i am not sure that i quite know what pessimism really means  all i do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity cannot be lived without much charity  it is love and not german philosophy that is the true explanation of this world whatever may be the explanation of the next  and if you are ever in trouble lady chiltern trust me absolutely and i will help you in every way i can  if you ever want me come to me for my assistance and you shall have it  come at once to me  lady chiltern  looking at him in surprise  lord goring you are talking quite seriously  i don’t think i ever heard you talk seriously before  lord goring  laughing  you must excuse me lady chiltern  it won’t occur again if i can help it  lady chiltern  but i like you to be serious  enter mabel chiltern in the most ravishing frock  mabel chiltern  dear gertrude don’t say such a dreadful thing to lord goring  seriousness would be very unbecoming to him  good afternoon lord goring  pray be as trivial as you can  lord goring  i should like to miss mabel but i am afraid i am    a little out of practice this morning and besides i have to be going now  mabel chiltern  just when i have come in  what dreadful manners you have  i am sure you were very badly brought up  lord goring  i was  mabel chiltern  i wish i had brought you up  lord goring  i am so sorry you didn’t  mabel chiltern  it is too late now i suppose  lord goring  smiling  i am not so sure  mabel chiltern  will you ride tomorrow morning  lord goring  yes at ten  mabel chiltern  don’t forget  lord goring  of course i shan’t  by the way lady chiltern there is no list of your guests in the morning post of today  it has apparently been crowded out by the county council or the lambeth conference or something equally boring  could you let me have a list  i have a particular reason for asking you  lady chiltern  i am sure mr trafford will be able to give you one  lord goring  thanks so much  mabel chiltern  tommy is the most useful person in london  lord goring turning to her  and who is the most ornamental  mabel chiltern triumphantly  i am  lord goring  how clever of you to guess it  takes up his hat and cane  goodbye lady chiltern  you will remember what i said to you won’t you  lady chiltern  yes but i don’t know why you said it to me  lord goring  i hardly know myself  goodbye miss mabel  mabel chiltern with a little moue of disappointment  i wish you were not going  i have had four wonderful adventures this morning four and a half in fact  you might stop and listen to some of them  lord goring  how very selfish of you to have four and a half  there won’t be any left for me  mabel chiltern  i don’t want you to have any  they would not be good for you  lord goring  that is the first unkind thing you have ever said to me how charmingly you said it  ten tomorrow  mabel chiltern  sharp  lord goring  quite sharp  but don’t bring mr trafford  mabel chiltern  with a little toss of the head  of course i shan’t bring tommy trafford  tommy trafford is in great disgrace  lord goring  i am delighted to hear it  bows and goes out  mabel chiltern  gertrude i wish you would speak to tommy trafford  lady chiltern  what has poor mr trafford done this time  robert says he is the best secretary he has ever had  mabel chiltern  well tommy has proposed to me again  tommy really does nothing but propose to me  he proposed to me last night in the musicroom when i was quite unprotected as there was an elaborate trio going on  i didn’t dare to make the smallest repartee i need hardly tell you  if i had it would have stopped the music at once  musical people are so absurdly unreasonable  they always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf  then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning in front of that dreadful statue of achilles  really the things that go on in front of that work of art are quite appalling  the police should interfere at luncheon i saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose again and i just managed to check him in time by assuring him that i was a bimetallist  fortunately i don’t know what bimetallism means  and i don’t believe anybody else does either  but the observation crushed tommy for ten minutes  he looked quite shocked  and then tommy is so annoying in the way he proposes  if he proposed at the top of his voice i should not mind so much  that might produce some effect on the public but he does it in a horrid confidential way  when tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor  i am very fond of tommy but his methods of proposing are quite out of date  i wish gertrude you would speak to him and tell him that once a week is quite often enough to propose to any one and that it should always be done in a manner that attracts some attention  lady chiltern  dear mabel don’t talk like that  besides robert thinks very highly of mr trafford  he believes he has a brilliant future before him  mabel chiltern  oh i wouldn’t marry a man with a future before him for anything under the sun  lady chiltern  mabel  mabel chiltern  i know dear  you married a man with a future didn’t you  but then robert was a genius and you have a noble selfsacrificing character  you can stand geniuses  i have no character at all and robert is the only genius i could ever bear  as a rule i think they are quite impossible  geniuses talk so much don’t they such a bad habit  and they are always thinking about themselves when i want them to be thinking about me  i must go round now and rehearse at lady basildon’s  you remember we are having tableaux don’t you  the triumph of something i don’t know what  i hope it will be triumph of me  only triumph i am really interested in at present  kisses lady chiltern and goes out then comes running back  oh gertrude do you know who is coming to see you  that dreadful mrs cheveley in a most lovely gown  did you ask her  lady chiltern  rising  mrs cheveley  coming to see me impossible  mabel chiltern  i assure you she is coming upstairs as large as life and not nearly so natural  lady chiltern  you need not wait mabel  remember lady basildon is expecting you  mabel chiltern  oh i must shake hands with lady markby  she is delightful  i love being scolded by her  enter mason  mason  lady markby  mrs cheveley  enter lady markby and mrs cheveley  lady chiltern  advancing to meet them  dear lady markby how nice of you to come and see me  shakes hands with her and bows somewhat distantly to mrs cheveley  won’t you sit down mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  thanks  isn’t that miss chiltern  i should like so much to know her  lady chiltern  mabel mrs cheveley wishes to know you  mabel chiltern gives a little nod  mrs cheveley sitting down  i thought your frock so charming last night miss chiltern  so simple and    suitable  mabel chiltern  really  i must tell my dressmaker  it will be such a surprise to her  goodbye lady markby  lady markby  going already  mabel chiltern  i am so sorry but i am obliged to  i am just off to rehearsal  i have got to stand on my head in some tableaux  lady markby  on your head child  oh i hope not  i believe it is most unhealthy  takes a seat on the sofa next lady chiltern  mabel chiltern  but it is for an excellent charity in aid of the undeserving the only people i am really interested in  i am the secretary and tommy trafford is treasurer  mrs cheveley  and what is lord goring  mabel chiltern  oh lord goring is president  mrs cheveley  the post should suit him admirably unless he has deteriorated since i knew him first  lady markby  reflecting  you are remarkably modern mabel  a little too modern perhaps  nothing is so dangerous as being too modern one is apt to grow oldfashioned quite suddenly  i have known many instances of it  mabel chiltern  what a dreadful prospect  lady markby  ah my dear you need not be nervous  you will always be as pretty as possible  that is the best fashion there is and the only fashion that england succeeds in setting  mabel chiltern  with a curtsey  thank you so much lady markby for england    and myself  goes out  lady markby  turning to lady chiltern  dear gertrude we just called to know if mrs cheveley’s diamond brooch has been found  lady chiltern  here  mrs cheveley  yes  i missed it when i got back to claridge’s and i thought i might possibly have dropped it here  lady chiltern  i have heard nothing about it  but i will send for the butler and ask  touches the bell  mrs cheveley  oh pray don’t trouble lady chiltern  i dare say i lost it at the opera before we came on here  lady markby  ah yes i suppose it must have been at the opera  the fact is we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that i wonder we have anything at all left on us at the end of an evening  i know myself that when i am coming back from the drawing room i always feel as if i hadn’t a shred on me except a small shred of decent reputation just enough to prevent the lower classes making painful observations through the windows of the carriage  the fact is that our society is terribly overpopulated  really some one should arrange a proper scheme of assisted emigration  it would do a great deal of good  mrs cheveley  i quite agree with you lady markby  it is nearly six years since i have been in london for the season and i must say society has become dreadfully mixed  one sees the oddest people everywhere  lady markby  that is quite true dear  but one needn’t know them  i’m sure i don’t know half the people who come to my house  indeed from all i hear i shouldn’t like to  enter mason  lady chiltern  what sort of a brooch was it that you lost mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  a diamond snakebrooch with a ruby a rather large ruby  lady markby  i thought you said there was a sapphire on the head dear  mrs cheveley smiling  no lady markby—a ruby  lady markby  nodding her head  and very becoming i am quite sure  lady chiltern  has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the rooms this morning mason  mason  no my lady  mrs cheveley  it really is of no consequence lady chiltern  i am so sorry to have put you to any inconvenience  lady chiltern  coldly  oh it has been no inconvenience  that will do mason  you can bring tea  exit mason  lady markby  well i must say it is most annoying to lose anything  i remember once at bath years ago losing in the pump room an exceedingly handsome cameo bracelet that sir john had given me  i don’t think he has ever given me anything since i am sorry to say  he has sadly degenerated  really this horrid house of commons quite ruins our husbands for us  i think the lower house by far the greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called the higher education of women was invented  lady chiltern  ah it is heresy to say that in this house lady markby robert is a great champion of the higher education of women and so i am afraid am i  mrs cheveley  the higher education of men is what i should like to see men need it so sadly  lady markby  they do dear  but i am afraid such a scheme would be quite unpractical  i don’t think man has much capacity for development he has got as far as he can and that is not far is it  with regard to women well dear gertrude you belong to the younger generation and i am sure it is all right if you approve of it  in my time of course we were taught not to understand anything  that was the old system and wonderfully interesting it was  i assure you that the amount of things i and my poor dear sister were taught not to understand was quite extraordinary  but modern women understand everything i am told  mrs cheveley  except their husbands  that is the one thing the modern woman never understands  lady markby  and a very good thing too dear i dare say  it might break up many a happy home if they did  not yours i need hardly say gertrude  you have married a pattern husband  i wish i could say as much for myself  but since sir john has taken to attending the debates regularly which he never used to do in the good old days his language has become quite impossible  he always seems to think that he is addressing the house and consequently whenever he discusses the state of the agricultural labourer or the welsh church or something quite improper of that kind i am obliged to send all the servants out of the room  it is not pleasant to see one’s own butler who has been with one for twentythree years actually blushing at the sideboard and the footmen making contortions in corners like persons in circuses  i assure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send john at once to the upper house  he won’t take any interest in politics then will he  the house of lords is so sensible  an assembly of gentlemen  but in his present state sir john is really a great trial  why this morning before breakfast was half over he stood up on the hearthrug put his hands in his pockets and appealed to the country at the top of his voice  i left the table as soon as i had my second cup of tea i need hardly say  but his violent language could be heard all over the house i trust gertrude that sir robert is not like that  lady chiltern  but i am very much interested in politics lady markby i love to hear robert talk about them  lady markby  well i hope he is not as devoted to blue books as sir john is  i don’t think they can be quite improving reading for any one  mrs cheveley languidly  i have never read a blue book  i prefer books    in yellow covers  lady markby  genially unconscious  yellow is a gayer colour is it not  i used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days and would do so now if sir john was not so painfully personal in his observations and a man on the question of dress is always ridiculous is he not  mrs cheveley  oh no  i think men are the only authorities on dress  lady markby  really  one wouldn’t say so from the sort of hats they wear would one  the butler enters followed by the footman  tea is set on a small table close to lady chiltern  lady chiltern  may i give you some tea mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  thanks  the butler hands mrs cheveley a cup of tea on a salver  lady chiltern  some tea lady markby  lady markby  no thanks dear  the servants go out  the fact is i have promised to go round for ten minutes to see poor lady brancaster who is in very great trouble  her daughter quite a wellbroughtup girl too has actually become engaged to be married to a curate in shropshire  it is very sad very sad indeed  i can’t understand this modern mania for curates  in my time we girls saw them of course running about the place like rabbits  but we never took any notice of them i need hardly say  but i am told that nowadays country society is quite honeycombed with them  i think it most irreligious  and then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father and it is said that when they meet at the club lord brancaster always hides himself behind the money article in the times  however i believe that is quite a common occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of the times at all the clubs in st james’s street there are so many sons who won’t have anything to do with their fathers and so many fathers who won’t speak to their sons  i think myself it is very much to be regretted  mrs cheveley  so do i  fathers have so much to learn from their sons nowadays  lady markby  really dear  what  mrs cheveley  the art of living  the only really fine art we have produced in modern times  lady markby  shaking her head  ah  i am afraid lord brancaster knew a good deal about that  more than his poor wife ever did turning to lady chiltern  you know lady brancaster don’t you dear  lady chiltern  just slightly  she was staying at langton last autumn when we were there  lady markby  well like all stout women she looks the very picture of happiness as no doubt you noticed  but there are many tragedies in her family besides this affair of the curate  her own sister mrs jekyll had a most unhappy life through no fault of her own i am sorry to say she ultimately was so brokenhearted that she went into a convent or on to the operatic stage i forget which  no i think it was decorative artneedlework she took up  i know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life  rising  and now gertrude if you will allow me i shall leave mrs cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour  or perhaps dear mrs cheveley you wouldn’t mind waiting in the carriage while i am with lady brancaster  as i intend it to be a visit of condolence i shan’t stay long  mrs cheveley rising  i don’t mind waiting in the carriage at all provided there is somebody to look at one  lady markby  well i hear the curate is always prowling about the house  mrs cheveley  i am afraid i am not fond of girl friends  lady chiltern rising  oh i hope mrs cheveley will stay here a little  i should like to have a few minutes’ conversation with her  mrs cheveley  how very kind of you lady chiltern  believe me nothing would give me greater pleasure  lady markby  ah no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of your schooldays to talk over together  goodbye dear gertrude  shall i see you at lady bonar’s tonight  she has discovered a wonderful new genius  he does    nothing at all i believe  that is a great comfort is it not  lady chiltern  robert and i are dining at home by ourselves tonight and i don’t think i shall go anywhere afterwards  robert of course will have to be in the house  but there is nothing interesting on  lady markby  dining at home by yourselves  is that quite prudent  ah i forgot your husband is an exception  mine is the general rule and nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general rule exit lady markby  mrs cheveley  wonderful woman lady markby isn’t she  talks more and says less than anybody i ever met  she is made to be a public speaker much more so than her husband though he is a typical englishman always dull and usually violent  lady chiltern  makes no answer but remains standing  there is a pause  then the eyes of the two women meet  lady chiltern looks stern and pale  mrs cheveley seem rather amused  mrs cheveley i think it is right to tell you quite frankly that had i known who you really were i should not have invited you to my house last night  mrs cheveley with an impertinent smile  really  lady chiltern  i could not have done so  mrs cheveley  i see that after all these years you have not changed a bit gertrude  lady chiltern  i never change  mrs cheveley elevating her eyebrows  then life has taught you nothing  lady chiltern  it has taught me that a person who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second time and should be shunned  mrs cheveley  would you apply that rule to every one  lady chiltern  yes to every one without exception  mrs cheveley  then i am sorry for you gertrude very sorry for you  lady chiltern  you see now i was sure that for many reasons any further acquaintance between us during your stay in london is quite impossible  mrs cheveley leaning back in her chair  do you know gertrude i don’t mind your talking morality a bit  morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike  you dislike me  i am quite aware of that  and i have always detested you  and yet i have come here to do you a service  lady chiltern  contemptuously  like the service you wished to render my husband last night i suppose  thank heaven i saved him from that  mrs cheveley  starting to her feet  it was you who made him write that insolent letter to me  it was you who made him break his promise  lady chiltern  yes  mrs cheveley  then you must make him keep it  i give you till tomorrow morning—no more  if by that time your husband does not solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which i am interested—  lady chiltern  this fraudulent speculation—  mrs cheveley  call it what you choose  i hold your husband in the hollow of my hand and if you are wise you will make him do what i tell him  lady chiltern  rising and going towards her  you are impertinent what has my husband to do with you  with a woman like you  mrs cheveley with a bitter laugh  in this world like meets with like  it is because your husband is himself fraudulent and dishonest that we pair so well together  between you and him there are chasms  he and i are closer than friends  we are enemies linked together  the same sin binds us  lady chiltern  how dare you class my husband with yourself  how dare you threaten him or me  leave my house  you are unfit to enter it  sir robert chiltern enters from behind  he hears his wife’s last words and sees to whom they are addressed  he grows deadly pale  mrs cheveley  your house  a house bought with the price of dishonour a house everything in which has been paid for by fraud  turns round and sees sir robert chiltern  ask him what the origin of his fortune is  get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a cabinet secret learn from him to what you owe your position  lady chiltern  it is not true  robert  it is not true  mrs cheveley  pointing at him with outstretched finger  look at him  can he deny it  does he dare to  sir robert chiltern  go  go at once  you have done your worst now  mrs cheveley  my worst  i have not yet finished with you with either of you  i give you both till tomorrow at noon  if by then you don’t do what i bid you to do the whole world shall know the origin of robert chiltern  sir robert chiltern strikes the bell  enter mason  sir robert chiltern  show mrs cheveley out  mrs cheveley starts then bows with somewhat exaggerated politeness to lady chiltern who makes no sign of response  as she passes by sir robert chiltern who is standing close to the door she pauses for a moment and looks him straight in the face  she then goes out followed by the servant who closes the door after him  the husband and wife are left alone  lady chiltern stands like some one in a dreadful dream  then she turns round and looks at her husband  she looks at him with strange eyes as though she were seeing him for the first time  lady chiltern  you sold a cabinet secret for money  you began your life with fraud  you built up your career on dishonour  oh tell me it is not true  lie to me  lie to me  tell me it is not true  sir robert chiltern  what this woman said is quite true  but gertrude listen to me  you don’t realise how i was tempted  let me tell you the whole thing goes towards her  lady chiltern  don’t come near me  don’t touch me  i feel as if you had soiled me for ever  oh what a mask you have been wearing all these years  a horrible painted mask  you sold yourself for money  oh a common thief were better  you put yourself up to sale to the highest bidder  you were bought in the market  you lied to the whole world and yet you will not lie to me  sir robert chiltern  rushing towards her  gertrude  gertrude  lady chiltern  thrusting him back with outstretched hands  no don’t speak  say nothing  your voice wakes terrible memories—memories of things that made me love you—memories of words that made me love you—memories that now are horrible to me  and how i worshipped you  you were to me something apart from common life a thing pure noble honest without stain  the world seemed to me finer because you were in it and goodness more real because you lived  and now—oh when i think that i made of a man like you my ideal the ideal of my life  sir robert chiltern  there was your mistake  there was your error  the error all women commit  why can’t you women love us faults and all why do you place us on monstrous pedestals  we have all feet of clay women as well as men but when we men love women we love them knowing their weaknesses their follies their imperfections love them all the more it may be for that reason  it is not the perfect but the imperfect who have need of love  it is when we are wounded by our own hands or by the hands of others that love should come to cure us—else what use is love at all  all sins except a sin against itself love should forgive  all lives save loveless lives true love should pardon a man’s love is like that  it is wider larger more human than a woman’s  women think that they are making ideals of men  what they are making of us are false idols merely  you made your false idol of me and i had not the courage to come down show you my wounds tell you my weaknesses  i was afraid that i might lose your love as i have lost it now  and so last night you ruined my life for me—yes ruined it  what this woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered to me she offered security peace stability  the sin of my youth that i had thought was buried rose up in front of me hideous horrible with its hands at my throat  i could have killed it for ever sent it back into its tomb destroyed its record burned the one witness against me  you prevented me  no one but you you know it  and now what is there before me but public disgrace ruin terrible shame the mockery of the world a lonely dishonoured life a lonely dishonoured death it may be some day let women make no more ideals of men let them not put them on alters and bow before them or they may ruin other lives as completely as you—you whom i have so wildly loved—have ruined mine  he passes from the room  lady chiltern rushes towards him but the door is closed when she reaches it  pale with anguish bewildered helpless she sways like a plant in the water  her hands outstretched seem to tremble in the air like blossoms in the mind then she flings herself down beside a sofa and buries her face  her sobs are like the sobs of a child                                   act drop     third act   scene   the library in lord goring’s house  an adam room  on the right is the door leading into the hall  on the left the door of the smokingroom  a pair of folding doors at the back open into the drawingroom  the fire is lit  phipps the butler is arranging some newspapers on the writingtable  the distinction of phipps is his impassivity he has been termed by enthusiasts the ideal butler  the sphinx is not so incommunicable  he is a mask with a manner  of his intellectual or emotional life history knows nothing  he represents the dominance of form  enter lord goring in evening dress with a buttonhole  he is wearing a silk hat and inverness cape  whitegloved he carries a louis seize cane  his are all the delicate fopperies of fashion one sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life makes it indeed and so masters it  he is the first welldressed philosopher in the history of thought  lord goring  got my second buttonhole for me phipps  phipps  yes my lord  takes his hat cane and cape and presents new buttonhole on salver  lord goring  rather distinguished thing phipps  i am the only person of the smallest importance in london at present who wears a buttonhole  phipps  yes my lord  i have observed that  lord goring  taking out old buttonhole  you see phipps fashion is what one wears oneself  what is unfashionable is what other people wear  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  putting in a new buttonhole  and falsehoods the truths of other people  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  other people are quite dreadful  the only possible society is oneself  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance phipps  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  looking at himself in the glass  don’t think i quite like this buttonhole phipps  makes me look a little too old  makes me almost in the prime of life eh phipps  phipps  i don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance  lord goring  you don’t phipps  phipps  no my lord  lord goring  i am not quite sure  for the future a more trivial buttonhole phipps on thursday evenings  phipps  i will speak to the florist my lord  she has had a loss in her family lately which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your lordship complains of in the buttonhole  lord goring  extraordinary thing about the lower classes in england—they are always losing their relations  phipps  yes my lord  they are extremely fortunate in that respect  lord goring  turns round and looks at him  phipps remains impassive  hum  any letters phipps  phipps  three my lord  hands letters on a salver  lord goring  takes letters  want my cab round in twenty minutes  phipps  yes my lord  goes towards door  lord goring  holds up letter in pink envelope  ahem  phipps when did this letter arrive  phipps  it was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the club  lord goring  that will do  exit phipps  lady chiltern’s handwriting on lady chiltern’s pink notepaper  that is rather curious i thought robert was to write  wonder what lady chiltern has got to say to me  sits at bureau and opens letter and reads it  ‘i want you  i trust you  i am coming to you  gertrude’  puts down the letter with a puzzled look  then takes it up and reads it again slowly  ‘i want you  i trust you  i am coming to you’  so she has found out everything  poor woman  poor woman   pulls out watch and looks at it  but what an hour to call  ten o’clock  i shall have to give up going to the berkshires  however it is always nice to be expected and not to arrive  i am not expected at the bachelors’ so i shall certainly go there  well i will make her stand by her husband that is the only thing for her to do  that is the only thing for any woman to do  it is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes marriage such a hopeless onesided institution  ten o’clock  she should be here soon  i must tell phipps i am not in to any one else goes towards bell  enter phipps  phipps  lord caversham  lord goring  oh why will parents always appear at the wrong time  some extraordinary mistake in nature i suppose  enter lord caversham delighted to see you my dear father  goes to meet him  lord caversham  take my cloak off  lord goring  is it worth while father  lord caversham  of course it is worth while sir  which is the most comfortable chair  lord goring  this one father  it is the chair i use myself when i have visitors  lord caversham  thank ye  no draught i hope in this room  lord goring  no father  lord caversham  sitting down  glad to hear it  can’t stand draughts  no draughts at home  lord goring  good many breezes father  lord caversham  eh  eh  don’t understand what you mean  want to have a serious conversation with you sir  lord goring  my dear father  at this hour  lord caversham  well sir it is only ten o’clock  what is your objection to the hour  i think the hour is an admirable hour  lord goring  well the fact is father this is not my day for talking seriously  i am very sorry but it is not my day  lord caversham  what do you mean sir  lord goring  during the season father i only talk seriously on the first tuesday in every month from four to seven  lord caversham  well make it tuesday sir make it tuesday  lord goring  but it is after seven father and my doctor says i must not have any serious conversation after seven  it makes me talk in my sleep  lord caversham  talk in your sleep sir  what does that matter  you are not married  lord goring  no father i am not married  lord caversham  hum  that is what i have come to talk to you about sir  you have got to get married and at once  why when i was your age sir i had been an inconsolable widower for three months and was already paying my addresses to your admirable mother  damme sir it is your duty to get married  you can’t be always living for pleasure every man of position is married nowadays  bachelors are not fashionable any more  they are a damaged lot  too much is known about them  you must get a wife sir  look where your friend robert chiltern has got to by probity hard work and a sensible marriage with a good woman  why don’t you imitate him sir  why don’t you take him for your model  lord goring  i think i shall father  lord caversham  i wish you would sir  then i should be happy  at present i make your mother’s life miserable on your account  you are heartless sir quite heartless  lord goring  i hope not father  lord caversham  and it is high time for you to get married  you are thirtyfour years of age sir  lord goring  yes father but i only admit to thirtytwo—thirtyone and a half when i have a really good buttonhole  this buttonhole is not    trivial enough  lord caversham  i tell you you are thirtyfour sir  and there is a draught in your room besides which makes your conduct worse  why did you tell me there was no draught sir  i feel a draught sir i feel it distinctly  lord goring  so do i father  it is a dreadful draught  i will come and see you tomorrow father  we can talk over anything you like  let me help you on with your cloak father  lord caversham  no sir i have called this evening for a definite purpose and i am going to see it through at all costs to my health or yours  put down my cloak sir  lord goring  certainly father  but let us go into another room rings bell  there is a dreadful draught here  enter phipps phipps is there a good fire in the smokingroom  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  come in there father  your sneezes are quite heartrending  lord caversham  well sir i suppose i have a right to sneeze when i choose  lord goring  apologetically  quite so father  i was merely expressing sympathy  lord caversham  oh damn sympathy  there is a great deal too much of that sort of thing going on nowadays  lord goring  i quite agree with you father  if there was less sympathy in the world there would be less trouble in the world  lord caversham  going towards the smokingroom  that is a paradox sir  i hate paradoxes  lord goring  so do i father  everybody one meets is a paradox nowadays  it is a great bore  it makes society so obvious  lord caversham  turning round and looking at his son beneath his bushy eyebrows  do you always really understand what you say sir  lord goring  after some hesitation  yes father if i listen attentively  lord caversham  indignantly  if you listen attentively    conceited young puppy  goes off grumbling into the smokingroom  phipps enters  lord goring  phipps there is a lady coming to see me this evening on particular business  show her into the drawingroom when she arrives you understand  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  it is a matter of the gravest importance phipps  phipps  i understand my lord  lord goring  no one else is to be admitted under any circumstances  phipps  i understand my lord  bell rings  lord goring  ah that is probably the lady  i shall see her myself  just as he is going towards the door lord caversham enters from the smokingroom  lord caversham  well sir am i to wait attendance on you  lord goring  considerably perplexed  in a moment father  do excuse me  lord caversham goes back  well remember my instructions phipps—into that room  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring goes into the smokingroom  harold the footman shows mrs cheveley in  lamialike she is in green and silver  she has a cloak of black satin lined with dead roseleaf silk  harold  what name madam  mrs cheveley  to phipps who advances towards her  is lord goring not here  i was told he was at home  phipps  his lordship is engaged at present with lord caversham madam  turns a cold glassy eye on harold who at once retires  mrs cheveley  to herself  how very filial  phipps  his lordship told me to ask you madam to be kind enough to wait in the drawingroom for him  his lordship will come to you there  mrs cheveley  with a look of surprise  lord goring expects me  phipps  yes madam  mrs cheveley  are you quite sure  phipps  his lordship told me that if a lady called i was to ask her to wait in the drawingroom  goes to the door of the drawingroom and opens it  his lordship’s directions on the subject were very precise  mrs cheveley  to herself  how thoughtful of him  to expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect  goes towards the drawingroom and looks in  ugh  how dreary a bachelor’s drawingroom always looks  i shall have to alter all this  phipps brings the lamp from the writingtable  no i don’t care for that lamp  it is far too glaring  light some candles  phipps  replaces lamp  certainly madam  mrs cheveley  i hope the candles have very becoming shades  phipps  we have had no complaints about them madam as yet  passes into the drawingroom and begins to light the candles  mrs cheveley  to herself  i wonder what woman he is waiting for tonight  it will be delightful to catch him  men always look so silly when they are caught  and they are always being caught  looks about room and approaches the writingtable  what a very interesting room what a very interesting picture  wonder what his correspondence is like takes up letters  oh what a very uninteresting correspondence bills and cards debts and dowagers  who on earth writes to him on pink paper  how silly to write on pink paper  it looks like the beginning of a middleclass romance  romance should never begin with sentiment  it should begin with science and end with a settlement  puts letter down then takes it up again  i know that handwriting  that is gertrude chiltern’s  i remember it perfectly  the ten commandments in every stroke of the pen and the moral law all over the page  wonder what gertrude is writing to him about  something horrid about me i suppose  how i detest that woman  reads it  ‘i trust you  i want you  i am coming to you  gertrude’  ‘i trust you  i want you  i am coming to you’  a look of triumph comes over her face  she is just about to steal the letter when phipps comes in  phipps  the candles in the drawingroom are lit madam as you directed  mrs cheveley  thank you  rises hastily and slips the letter under a large silvercased blottingbook that is lying on the table  phipps  i trust the shades will be to your liking madam  they are the most becoming we have  they are the same as his lordship uses himself when he is dressing for dinner  mrs cheveley  with a smile  then i am sure they will be perfectly right  phipps  gravely  thank you madam  mrs cheveley goes into the drawingroom  phipps closes the door and retires  the door is then slowly opened and mrs cheveley comes out and creeps stealthily towards the writingtable  suddenly voices are heard from the smokingroom  mrs cheveley grows pale and stops  the voices grow louder and she goes back into the drawingroom biting her lip  enter lord goring and lord caversham  lord goring  expostulating  my dear father if i am to get married surely you will allow me to choose the time place and person particularly the person  lord caversham  testily  that is a matter for me sir  you would probably make a very poor choice  it is i who should be consulted not you  there is property at stake  it is not a matter for affection affection comes later on in married life  lord goring  yes  in married life affection comes when people thoroughly dislike each other father doesn’t it  puts on lord caversham’s cloak for him  lord caversham  certainly sir  i mean certainly not air  you are talking very foolishly tonight  what i say is that marriage is a matter for common sense  lord goring  but women who have common sense are so curiously plain father aren’t they  of course i only speak from hearsay  lord caversham  no woman plain or pretty has any common sense at all sir  common sense is the privilege of our sex  lord goring  quite so  and we men are so selfsacrificing that we never use it do we father  lord caversham  i use it sir  i use nothing else  lord goring  so my mother tells me  lord caversham  it is the secret of your mother’s happiness  you are very heartless sir very heartless  lord goring  i hope not father  goes out for a moment  then returns looking rather put out with sir robert chiltern  sir robert chiltern  my dear arthur what a piece of good luck meeting you on the doorstep  your servant had just told me you were not at home how extraordinary  lord goring  the fact is i am horribly busy tonight robert and i gave orders i was not at home to any one  even my father had a comparatively cold reception  he complained of a draught the whole time  sir robert chiltern  ah you must be at home to me arthur  you are my best friend  perhaps by tomorrow you will be my only friend  my wife has discovered everything  lord goring  ah i guessed as much  sir robert chiltern  looking at him  really  how  lord goring  after some hesitation  oh merely by something in the expression of your face as you came in  who told her  sir robert chiltern  mrs cheveley herself  and the woman i love knows that i began my career with an act of low dishonesty that i built up my life upon sands of shame—that i sold like a common huckster the secret that had been intrusted to me as a man of honour  i thank heaven poor lord radley died without knowing that i betrayed him  i would to god i had died before i had been so horribly tempted or had fallen so low burying his face in his hands  lord goring  after a pause  you have heard nothing from vienna yet in answer to your wire  sir robert chiltern  looking up  yes i got a telegram from the first secretary at eight o’clock tonight  lord goring  well  sir robert chiltern  nothing is absolutely known against her  on the contrary she occupies a rather high position in society  it is a sort of open secret that baron arnheim left her the greater portion of his immense fortune  beyond that i can learn nothing  lord goring  she doesn’t turn out to be a spy then  sir robert chiltern  oh spies are of no use nowadays  their profession is over  the newspapers do their work instead  lord goring  and thunderingly well they do it  sir robert chiltern  arthur i am parched with thirst  may i ring for something  some hock and seltzer  lord goring  certainly  let me  rings the bell  sir robert chiltern  thanks  i don’t know what to do arthur i don’t know what to do and you are my only friend  but what a friend you are—the one friend i can trust  i can trust you absolutely can’t i  enter phipps  lord goring  my dear robert of course  oh  to phipps  bring some hock and seltzer  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  and phipps  phipps  yes my lord  lord goring  will you excuse me for a moment robert  i want to give some directions to my servant  sir robert chiltern  certainly  lord goring  when that lady calls tell her that i am not expected home this evening  tell her that i have been suddenly called out of town you understand  phipps  the lady is in that room my lord  you told me to show her into that room my lord  lord goring  you did perfectly right  exit phipps  what a mess i am in  no i think i shall get through it  i’ll give her a lecture through the door  awkward thing to manage though  sir robert chiltern  arthur tell me what i should do  my life seems to have crumbled about me  i am a ship without a rudder in a night without a star  lord goring  robert you love your wife don’t you  sir robert chiltern  i love her more than anything in the world  i used to think ambition the great thing  it is not  love is the great thing in the world  there is nothing but love and i love her  but i am defamed in her eyes  i am ignoble in her eyes  there is a wide gulf between us now  she has found me out arthur she has found me out  lord goring  has she never in her life done some folly—some indiscretion—that she should not forgive your sin  sir robert chiltern  my wife  never  she does not know what weakness or temptation is  i am of clay like other men  she stands apart as good women do—pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy but i love her arthur  we are childless and i have no one else to love no one else to love me  perhaps if god had sent us children she might have been kinder to me  but god has given us a lonely house  and she has cut my heart in two  don’t let us talk of it  i was brutal to her this evening  but i suppose when sinners talk to saints they are brutal always  i said to her things that were hideously true on my side from my standpoint from the standpoint of men  but don’t let us talk of that  lord goring  your wife will forgive you  perhaps at this moment she is forgiving you  she loves you robert  why should she not forgive  sir robert chiltern  god grant it  god grant it  buries his face in his hands  but there is something more i have to tell you arthur  enter phipps with drinks  phipps  hands hock and seltzer to sir robert chiltern  hock and seltzer sir  sir robert chiltern  thank you  lord goring  is your carriage here robert  sir robert chiltern  no i walked from the club  lord goring  sir robert will take my cab phipps  phipps  yes my lord  exit  lord goring  robert you don’t mind my sending you away  sir robert chiltern  arthur you must let me stay for five minutes  i have made up my mind what i am going to do tonight in the house  the debate on the argentine canal is to begin at eleven  a chair falls in the drawingroom  what is that  lord goring  nothing  sir robert chiltern  i heard a chair fall in the next room  some one has been listening  lord goring  no no there is no one there  sir robert chiltern  there is some one  there are lights in the room and the door is ajar  some one has been listening to every secret of my life  arthur what does this mean  lord goring  robert you are excited unnerved  i tell you there is no one in that room sit down robert  sir robert chiltern  do you give me your word that there is no one there  lord goring  yes  sir robert chiltern  your word of honour  sits down  lord goring  yes  sir robert chiltern  rises  arthur let me see for myself  lord goring  no no  sir robert chiltern  if there is no one there why should i not look in that room  arthur you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life’s secret  arthur you don’t realise what i am going through  lord goring  robert this must stop  i have told you that there is no one in that room—that is enough  sir robert chiltern  rushes to the door of the room  it is not enough  i insist on going into this room  you have told me there is no one there so what reason can you have for refusing me  lord goring  for god’s sake don’t  there is some one there  some one whom you must not see  sir robert chiltern  ah i thought so  lord goring  i forbid you to enter that room  sir robert chiltern  stand back  my life is at stake  and i don’t care who is there  i will know who it is to whom i have told my secret and my shame  enters room  lord goring  great heavens his own wife  sir robert chiltern comes back with a look of scorn and anger on his face  sir robert chiltern  what explanation have you to give me for the presence of that woman here  lord goring  robert i swear to you on my honour that that lady is stainless and guiltless of all offence towards you  sir robert chiltern  she is a vile an infamous thing  lord goring  don’t say that robert  it was for your sake she came here  it was to try and save you she came here  she loves you and no one else  sir robert chiltern  you are mad  what have i to do with her intrigues with you  let her remain your mistress  you are well suited to each other  she corrupt and shameful—you false as a friend treacherous as an enemy even—  lord goring  it is not true robert  before heaven it is not true  in her presence and in yours i will explain all  sir robert chiltern  let me pass sir  you have lied enough upon your word of honour  sir robert chiltern goes out  lord goring rushes to the door of the drawingroom when mrs cheveley comes out looking radiant and much amused  mrs cheveley  with a mock curtsey  good evening lord goring  lord goring  mrs cheveley  great heavens    may i ask what you were doing in my drawingroom  mrs cheveley  merely listening  i have a perfect passion for listening through keyholes  one always hears such wonderful things through them  lord goring  doesn’t that sound rather like tempting providence  mrs cheveley  oh surely providence can resist temptation by this time makes a sign to him to take her cloak off which he does  lord goring  i am glad you have called  i am going to give you some good advice  mrs cheveley  oh pray don’t  one should never give a woman anything that she can’t wear in the evening  lord goring  i see you are quite as wilful as you used to be  mrs cheveley  far more  i have greatly improved  i have had more experience  lord goring  too much experience is a dangerous thing  pray have a cigarette  half the pretty women in london smoke cigarettes  personally i prefer the other half  mrs cheveley  thanks  i never smoke  my dressmaker wouldn’t like it and a woman’s first duty in life is to her dressmaker isn’t it  what the second duty is no one has as yet discovered  lord goring  you have come here to sell me robert chiltern’s letter haven’t you  mrs cheveley  to offer it to you on conditions  how did you guess that  lord goring  because you haven’t mentioned the subject  have you got it with you  mrs cheveley  sitting down  oh no  a wellmade dress has no pockets  lord goring  what is your price for it  mrs cheveley  how absurdly english you are  the english think that a chequebook can solve every problem in life  why my dear arthur i have very much more money than you have and quite as much as robert chiltern has got hold of  money is not what i want  lord goring  what do you want then mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  why don’t you call me laura  lord goring  i don’t like the name  mrs cheveley  you used to adore it  lord goring  yes that’s why  mrs cheveley motions to him to sit down beside her  he smiles and does so  mrs cheveley  arthur you loved me once  lord goring  yes  mrs cheveley  and you asked me to be your wife  lord goring  that was the natural result of my loving you  mrs cheveley  and you threw me over because you saw or said you saw poor old lord mortlake trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the conservatory at tenby  lord goring  i am under the impression that my lawyer settled that matter with you on certain terms    dictated by yourself  mrs cheveley  at that time i was poor you were rich  lord goring  quite so  that is why you pretended to love me  mrs cheveley  shrugging her shoulders  poor old lord mortlake who had only two topics of conversation his gout and his wife  i never could quite make out which of the two he was talking about  he used the most horrible language about them both  well you were silly arthur why lord mortlake was never anything more to me than an amusement  one of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds at an english country house on an english country sunday  i don’t think any one at all morally responsible for what he or she does at an english country house  lord goring  yes  i know lots of people think that  mrs cheveley  i loved you arthur  lord goring  my dear mrs cheveley you have always been far too clever to know anything about love  mrs cheveley  i did love you  and you loved me  you know you loved me and love is a very wonderful thing  i suppose that when a man has once loved a woman he will do anything for her except continue to love her  puts her hand on his  lord goring  taking his hand away quietly  yes except that  mrs cheveley  after a pause  i am tired of living abroad  i want to come back to london  i want to have a charming house here  i want to have a salon  if one could only teach the english how to talk and the irish how to listen society here would be quite civilised  besides i have arrived at the romantic stage  when i saw you last night at the chilterns’ i knew you were the only person i had ever cared for if i ever have cared for anybody arthur  and so on the morning of the day you marry me i will give you robert chiltern’s letter  that is my offer  i will give it to you now if you promise to marry me  lord goring  now  mrs cheveley  smiling  tomorrow  lord goring  are you really serious  mrs cheveley  yes quite serious  lord goring  i should make you a very bad husband  mrs cheveley  i don’t mind bad husbands  i have had two  they amused me immensely  lord goring  you mean that you amused yourself immensely don’t you  mrs cheveley  what do you know about my married life  lord goring  nothing but i can read it like a book  mrs cheveley  what book  lord goring  rising  the book of numbers  mrs cheveley  do you think it is quite charming of you to be so rude to a woman in your own house  lord goring  in the case of very fascinating women sex is a challenge not a defence  mrs cheveley  i suppose that is meant for a compliment  my dear arthur women are never disarmed by compliments  men always are  that is the difference between the two sexes  lord goring  women are never disarmed by anything as far as i know them  mrs cheveley  after a pause  then you are going to allow your greatest friend robert chiltern to be ruined rather than marry some one who really has considerable attractions left  i thought you would have risen to some great height of selfsacrifice arthur  i think you should  and the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your own perfections  lord goring  oh i do that as it is  and selfsacrifice is a thing that should be put down by law  it is so demoralising to the people for whom one sacrifices oneself  they always go to the bad  mrs cheveley  as if anything could demoralise robert chiltern  you seem to forget that i know his real character  lord goring  what you know about him is not his real character  it was an act of folly done in his youth dishonourable i admit shameful i admit unworthy of him i admit and therefore    not his true character  mrs cheveley  how you men stand up for each other  lord goring  how you women war against each other  mrs cheveley  bitterly  i only war against one woman against gertrude chiltern  i hate her  i hate her now more than ever  lord goring  because you have brought a real tragedy into her life i suppose  mrs cheveley  with a sneer  oh there is only one real tragedy in a woman’s life  the fact that her past is always her lover and her future invariably her husband  lord goring  lady chiltern knows nothing of the kind of life to which you are alluding  mrs cheveley  a woman whose size in gloves is seven and threequarters never knows much about anything  you know gertrude has always worn seven and threequarters  that is one of the reasons why there was never any moral sympathy between us    well arthur i suppose this romantic interview may be regarded as at an end  you admit it was romantic don’t you  for the privilege of being your wife i was ready to surrender a great prize the climax of my diplomatic career  you decline  very well  if sir robert doesn’t uphold my argentine scheme i expose him voilà tout  lord goring  you mustn’t do that  it would be vile horrible infamous  mrs cheveley  shrugging her shoulders  oh don’t use big words they mean so little  it is a commercial transaction  that is all there is no good mixing up sentimentality in it  i offered to sell robert chiltern a certain thing  if he won’t pay me my price he will have to pay the world a greater price  there is no more to be said  i must go  goodbye  won’t you shake hands  lord goring  with you  no  your transaction with robert chiltern may pass as a loathsome commercial transaction of a loathsome commercial age but you seem to have forgotten that you came here tonight to talk of love you whose lips desecrated the word love you to whom the thing is a book closely sealed went this afternoon to the house of one of the most noble and gentle women in the world to degrade her husband in her eyes to try and kill her love for him to put poison in her heart and bitterness in her life to break her idol and it may be spoil her soul  that i cannot forgive you  that was horrible  for that there can be no forgiveness  mrs cheveley  arthur you are unjust to me  believe me you are quite unjust to me  i didn’t go to taunt gertrude at all  i had no idea of doing anything of the kind when i entered  i called with lady markby simply to ask whether an ornament a jewel that i lost somewhere last night had been found at the chilterns’  if you don’t believe me you can ask lady markby  she will tell you it is true  the scene that occurred happened after lady markby had left and was really forced on me by gertrude’s rudeness and sneers  i called oh—a little out of malice if you like—but really to ask if a diamond brooch of mine had been found that was the origin of the whole thing  lord goring  a diamond snakebrooch with a ruby  mrs cheveley  yes  how do you know  lord goring  because it is found  in point of fact i found it myself and stupidly forgot to tell the butler anything about it as i was leaving  goes over to the writingtable and pulls out the drawers it is in this drawer  no that one  this is the brooch isn’t it holds up the brooch  mrs cheveley  yes  i am so glad to get it back  it was   a present  lord goring  won’t you wear it  mrs cheveley  certainly if you pin it in  lord goring suddenly clasps it on her arm  why do you put it on as a bracelet  i never knew it could he worn as a bracelet  lord goring  really  mrs cheveley  holding out her handsome arm  no but it looks very well on me as a bracelet doesn’t it  lord goring  yes much better than when i saw it last  mrs cheveley  when did you see it last  lord goring  calmly  oh ten years ago on lady berkshire from whom you stole it  mrs cheveley  starting  what do you mean  lord goring  i mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin mary berkshire to whom i gave it when she was married  suspicion fell on a wretched servant who was sent away in disgrace  i recognised it last night  i determined to say nothing about it till i had found the thief i have found the thief now and i have heard her own confession  mrs cheveley  tossing her head  it is not true  lord goring  you know it is true  why thief is written across your face at this moment  mrs cheveley  i will deny the whole affair from beginning to end  i will say that i have never seen this wretched thing that it was never in my possession  mrs cheveley tries to get the bracelet off her arm but fails lord goring looks on amused  her thin fingers tear at the jewel to no purpose  a curse breaks from her  lord goring  the drawback of stealing a thing mrs cheveley is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is  you can’t get that bracelet off unless you know where the spring is  and i see you don’t know where the spring is  it is rather difficult to find  mrs cheveley  you brute  you coward  she tries again to unclasp the bracelet but fails  lord goring  oh don’t use big words  they mean so little  mrs cheveley  again tears at the bracelet in a paroxysm of rage with inarticulate sounds  then stops and looks at lord goring what are you going to do  lord goring  i am going to ring for my servant  he is an admirable servant  always comes in the moment one rings for him  when he comes i will tell him to fetch the police  mrs cheveley  trembling  the police  what for  lord goring  tomorrow the berkshires will prosecute you  that is what the police are for  mrs cheveley  is now in an agony of physical terror  her face is distorted  her mouth awry  a mask has fallen from her  she it for the moment dreadful to look at  don’t do that  i will do anything you want  anything in the world you want  lord goring  give me robert chiltern’s letter  mrs cheveley  stop stop  let me have time to think  lord goring  give me robert chiltern’s letter  mrs cheveley  i have not got it with me  i will give it to you tomorrow  lord goring  you know you are lying  give it to me at once  mrs cheveley pulls the letter out and hands it to him  she is horribly pale  this is it  mrs cheveley  in a hoarse voice  yes  lord goring  takes the letter examines it sighs and burns it with the lamp  for so welldressed a woman mrs cheveley you have moments of admirable common sense  i congratulate you  mrs cheveley  catches sight of lady chiltern’s letter the cover of which is just showing from under the blottingbook  please get me a glass of water  lord goring  certainly  goes to the corner of the room and pours out a glass of water  while his back is turned mrs cheveley steals lady chiltern’s letter  when lord goring returns the glass she refuses it with a gesture  mrs cheveley  thank you  will you help me on with my cloak  lord goring  with pleasure  puts her cloak on  mrs cheveley  thanks  i am never going to try to harm robert chiltern again  lord goring  fortunately you have not the chance mrs cheveley  mrs cheveley  well if even i had the chance i wouldn’t  on the contrary i am going to render him a great service  lord goring  i am charmed to hear it  it is a reformation  mrs cheveley  yes  i can’t bear so upright a gentleman so honourable an english gentleman being so shamefully deceived and so—  lord goring  well  mrs cheveley  i find that somehow gertrude chiltern’s dying speech and confession has strayed into my pocket  lord goring  what do you mean  mrs cheveley  with a bitter note of triumph in her voice  i mean that i am going to send robert chiltern the loveletter his wife wrote to you tonight  lord goring  loveletter  mrs cheveley  laughing  ‘i want you  i trust you  i am coming to you  gertrude’  lord goring rushes to the bureau and takes up the envelope finds is empty and turns round  lord goring  you wretched woman must you always be thieving  give me back that letter  i’ll take it from you by force  you shall not leave my room till i have got it  he rushes towards her but mrs cheveley at once puts her hand on the electric bell that is on the table the bell sounds with shrill reverberations and phipps enters  mrs cheveley  after a pause  lord goring merely rang that you should show me out  goodnight lord goring  goes out followed by phipps  her face it illumined with evil triumph  there is joy in her eyes  youth seems to have come back to her  her last glance is like a swift arrow  lord goring bites his lip and lights his a cigarette                                  act drops     fourth act   scene   same as act ii  lord goring is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his pockets  he is looking rather bored  lord goring  pulls out his watch inspects it and rings the bell  it is a great nuisance  i can’t find any one in this house to talk to  and i am full of interesting information  i feel like the latest edition of something or other  enter servant  james  sir robert is still at the foreign office my lord  lord goring  lady chiltern not down yet  james  her ladyship has not yet left her room  miss chiltern has just come in from riding  lord goring  to himself  ah that is something  james  lord caversham has been waiting some time in the library for sir robert  i told him your lordship was here  lord goring  thank you  would you kindly tell him i’ve gone  james  bowing  i shall do so my lord  exit servant  lord goring  really i don’t want to meet my father three days running it is a great deal too much excitement for any son  i hope to goodness he won’t come up  fathers should be neither seen nor heard  that is the only proper basis for family life  mothers are different  mothers are darlings  throws himself down into a chair picks up a paper and begins to read it  enter lord caversham  lord caversham  well sir what are you doing here  wasting your time as usual i suppose  lord goring  throws down paper and rises  my dear father when one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time not one’s own  lord caversham  have you been thinking over what i spoke to you about last night  lord goring  i have been thinking about nothing else  lord caversham  engaged to be married yet  lord goring  genially  not yet but i hope to be before lunchtime  lord caversham  caustically  you can have till dinnertime if it would be of any convenience to you  lord goring  thanks awfully but i think i’d sooner be engaged before lunch  lord caversham  humph  never know when you are serious or not  lord goring  neither do i father  a pause  lord caversham  i suppose you have read the times this morning  lord goring  airily  the times  certainly not  i only read the morning post  all that one should know about modern life is where the duchesses are anything else is quite demoralising  lord caversham  do you mean to say you have not read the times leading article on robert chiltern’s career  lord goring  good heavens  no  what does it say  lord caversham  what should it say sir  everything complimentary of course  chiltern’s speech last night on this argentine canal scheme was one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the house since canning  lord goring  ah  never heard of canning  never wanted to  and did    did chiltern uphold the scheme  lord caversham  uphold it sir  how little you know him  why he denounced it roundly and the whole system of modern political finance this speech is the turningpoint in his career as the times points out  you should read this article sir  opens the times  ‘sir robert chiltern    most rising of our young statesmen    brilliant orator    unblemished career    wellknown integrity of character    represents what is best in english public life    noble contrast to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians’  they will never say that of you sir  lord goring  i sincerely hope not father  however i am delighted at what you tell me about robert thoroughly delighted  it shows he has got pluck  lord caversham  he has got more than pluck sir he has got genius  lord goring  ah i prefer pluck  it is not so common nowadays as genius is  lord caversham  i wish you would go into parliament  lord goring  my dear father only people who look dull ever get into the house of commons and only people who are dull ever succeed there  lord caversham  why don’t you try to do something useful in life  lord goring  i am far too young  lord caversham  testily  i hate this affectation of youth sir  it is a great deal too prevalent nowadays  lord goring  youth isn’t an affectation  youth is an art  lord caversham  why don’t you propose to that pretty miss chiltern  lord goring  i am of a very nervous disposition especially in the morning  lord caversham  i don’t suppose there is the smallest chance of her accepting you  lord goring  i don’t know how the betting stands today  lord caversham  if she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in england  lord goring  that is just what i should like to marry  a thoroughly sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less than six months  lord caversham  you don’t deserve her sir  lord goring  my dear father if we men married the women we deserved we should have a very bad time of it  enter mabel chiltern  mabel chiltern  oh    how do you do lord caversham  i hope lady caversham is quite well  lord caversham  lady caversham is as usual as usual  lord goring  good morning miss mabel  mabel chiltern  taking no notice at all of lord goring and addressing herself exclusively to lord caversham  and lady caversham’s bonnets    are they at all better  lord caversham  they have had a serious relapse i am sorry to say  lord goring  good morning miss mabel  mabel chiltern  to lord caversham  i hope an operation will not be necessary  lord caversham  smiling at her pertness  if it is we shall have to give lady caversham a narcotic  otherwise she would never consent to have a feather touched  lord goring  with increased emphasis  good morning miss mabel  mabel chiltern  turning round with feigned surprise  oh are you here  of course you understand that after your breaking your appointment i am never going to speak to you again  lord goring  oh please don’t say such a thing  you are the one person in london i really like to have to listen to me  mabel chiltern  lord goring i never believe a single word that either you or i say to each other  lord caversham  you are quite right my dear quite right    as far as he is concerned i mean  mabel chiltern  do you think you could possibly make your son behave a little better occasionally  just as a change  lord caversham  i regret to say miss chiltern that i have no influence at all over my son  i wish i had  if i had i know what i would make him do  mabel chiltern  i am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak natures that are not susceptible to influence  lord caversham  he is very heartless very heartless  lord goring  it seems to me that i am a little in the way here  mabel chiltern  it is very good for you to be in the way and to know what people say of you behind your back  lord goring  i don’t at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back  it makes me far too conceited  lord caversham  after that my dear i really must bid you good morning  mabel chiltern  oh i hope you are not going to leave me all alone with lord goring  especially at such an early hour in the day  lord caversham  i am afraid i can’t take him with me to downing street it is not the prime minster’s day for seeing the unemployed  shakes hands with mabel chiltern takes up his hat and stick and goes out with a parting glare of indignation at lord goring  mabel chiltern  takes up roses and begins to arrange them in a bowl on the table  people who don’t keep their appointments in the park are horrid  lord goring  detestable  mabel chiltern  i am glad you admit it  but i wish you wouldn’t look so pleased about it  lord goring  i can’t help it  i always look pleased when i am with you  mabel chiltern  sadly  then i suppose it is my duty to remain with you  lord goring  of course it is  mabel chiltern  well my duty is a thing i never do on principle  it always depresses me  so i am afraid i must leave you  lord goring  please don’t miss mabel  i have something very particular to say to you  mabel chiltern  rapturously  oh is it a proposal  lord goring  somewhat taken aback  well yes it is—i am bound to say it is  mabel chiltern  with a sigh of pleasure  i am so glad  that makes the second today  lord goring  indignantly  the second today  what conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before i had proposed to you  mabel chiltern  tommy trafford of course  it is one of tommy’s days for proposing  he always proposes on tuesdays and thursdays during the season  lord goring  you didn’t accept him i hope  mabel chiltern  i make it a rule never to accept tommy  that is why he goes on proposing  of course as you didn’t turn up this morning i very nearly said yes  it would have been an excellent lesson both for him and for you if i had  it would have taught you both better manners  lord goring  oh bother tommy trafford  tommy is a silly little ass  i love you  mabel chiltern  i know  and i think you might have mentioned it before i am sure i have given you heaps of opportunities  lord goring  mabel do be serious  please be serious  mabel chiltern  ah that is the sort of thing a man always says to a girl before he has been married to her  he never says it afterwards  lord goring  taking hold of her hand  mabel i have told you that i love you  can’t you love me a little in return  mabel chiltern  you silly arthur  if you knew anything about    anything which you don’t you would know that i adore you  every one in london knows it except you  it is a public scandal the way i adore you i have been going about for the last six months telling the whole of society that i adore you  i wonder you consent to have anything to say to me  i have no character left at all  at least i feel so happy that i am quite sure i have no character left at all  lord goring  catches her in his arms and kisses her  then there is a pause of bliss  dear  do you know i was awfully afraid of being refused  mabel chiltern  looking up at him  but you never have been refused yet by anybody have you arthur  i can’t imagine any one refusing you  lord goring  after kissing her again  of course i’m not nearly good enough for you mabel  mabel chiltern  nestling close to him  i am so glad darling  i was afraid you were  lord goring  after some hesitation  and i’m    i’m a little over thirty  mabel chiltern  dear you look weeks younger than that  lord goring  enthusiastically  how sweet of you to say so    and it is only fair to tell you frankly that i am fearfully extravagant  mabel chiltern  but so am i arthur  so we’re sure to agree  and now i must go and see gertrude  lord goring  must you really  kisses her  mabel chiltern  yes  lord goring  then do tell her i want to talk to her particularly  i have been waiting here all the morning to see either her or robert  mabel chiltern  do you mean to say you didn’t come here expressly to propose to me  lord goring  triumphantly  no that was a flash of genius  mabel chiltern  your first  lord goring  with determination  my last  mabel chiltern  i am delighted to hear it  now don’t stir  i’ll be back in five minutes  and don’t fall into any temptations while i am away  lord goring  dear mabel while you are away there are none  it makes me horribly dependent on you  enter lady chiltern  lady chiltern  good morning dear  how pretty you are looking  mabel chiltern  how pale you are looking gertrude  it is most becoming  lady chiltern  good morning lord goring  lord goring  bowing  good morning lady chiltern  mabel chiltern  aside to lord goring  i shall be in the conservatory under the second palm tree on the left  lord goring  second on the left  mabel chiltern  with a look of mock surprise  yes the usual palm tree  blows a kiss to him unobserved by lady chiltern and goes out  lord goring  lady chiltern i have a certain amount of very good news to tell you  mrs cheveley gave me up robert’s letter last night and i burned it  robert is safe  lady chiltern  sinking on the sofa  safe  oh i am so glad of that  what a good friend you are to him—to us  lord goring  there is only one person now that could be said to be in any danger  lady chiltern  who is that  lord goring  sitting down beside her  yourself  lady chiltern  i  in danger  what do you mean  lord goring  danger is too great a word  it is a word i should not have used  but i admit i have something to tell you that may distress you that terribly distresses me  yesterday evening you wrote me a very beautiful womanly letter asking me for my help  you wrote to me as one of your oldest friends one of your husband’s oldest friends  mrs cheveley stole that letter from my rooms  lady chiltern  well what use is it to her  why should she not have it  lord goring  rising  lady chiltern i will be quite frank with you mrs cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to send it to your husband  lady chiltern  but what construction could she put on it    oh not that not that  if i in—in trouble and wanting your help trusting you propose to come to you    that you may advise me    assist me    oh are there women so horrible as that     and she proposes to send it to my husband  tell me what happened  tell me all that happened  lord goring  mrs cheveley was concealed in a room adjoining my library without my knowledge  i thought that the person who was waiting in that room to see me was yourself  robert came in unexpectedly  a chair or something fell in the room  he forced his way in and he discovered her we had a terrible scene  i still thought it was you  he left me in anger  at the end of everything mrs cheveley got possession of your letter—she stole it when or how i don’t know  lady chiltern  at what hour did this happen  lord goring  at halfpast ten  and now i propose that we tell robert the whole thing at once  lady chiltern  looking at him with amazement that is almost terror you want me to tell robert that the woman you expected was not mrs cheveley but myself  that it was i whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house at halfpast ten o’clock at night  you want me to tell him that  lord goring  i think it is better that he should know the exact truth  lady chiltern  rising  oh i couldn’t i couldn’t  lord goring  may i do it  lady chiltern  no  lord goring  gravely  you are wrong lady chiltern  lady chiltern  no  the letter must be intercepted  that is all  but how can i do it  letters arrive for him every moment of the day  his secretaries open them and hand them to him  i dare not ask the servants to bring me his letters  it would be impossible  oh why don’t you tell me what to do  lord goring  pray be calm lady chiltern and answer the questions i am going to put to you  you said his secretaries open his letters  lady chiltern  yes  lord goring  who is with him today  mr trafford isn’t it  lady chiltern  no  mr montford i think  lord goring  you can trust him  lady chiltern  with a gesture of despair  oh how do i know  lord goring  he would do what you asked him wouldn’t he  lady chiltern  i think so  lord goring  your letter was on pink paper  he could recognise it without reading it couldn’t he  by the colour  lady chiltern  i suppose so  lord goring  is he in the house now  lady chiltern  yes  lord goring  then i will go and see him myself and tell him that a certain letter written on pink paper is to be forwarded to robert today and that at all costs it must not reach him  goes to the door and opens it  oh robert is coming upstairs with the letter in his hand  it has reached him already  lady chiltern  with a cry of pain  oh you have saved his life what have you done with mine  enter sir robert chiltern  he has the letter in his hand and is reading it  he comes towards his wife not noticing lord goring’s presence  sir robert chiltern  ‘i want you  i trust you  i am coming to you gertrude’  oh my love  is this true  do you indeed trust me and want me  if so it was for me to come to you not for you to write of coming to me  this letter of yours gertrude makes me feel that nothing that the world may do can hurt me now  you want me gertrude  lord goring unseen by sir robert chiltern makes an imploring sign to lady chiltern to accept the situation and sir robert’s error  lady chiltern  yes  sir robert chiltern  you trust me gertrude  lady chiltern  yes  sir robert chiltern  ah why did you not add you loved me  lady chiltern  taking his hand  because i loved you  lord goring passes into the conservatory  sir robert chiltern  kisses her  gertrude you don’t know what i feel  when montford passed me your letter across the table—he had opened it by mistake i suppose without looking at the handwriting on the envelope—and i read it—oh i did not care what disgrace or punishment was in store for me i only thought you loved me still  lady chiltern  there is no disgrace in store for you nor any public shame  mrs cheveley has handed over to lord goring the document that was in her possession and he has destroyed it  sir robert chiltern  are you sure of this gertrude  lady chiltern  yes lord goring has just told me  sir robert chiltern  then i am safe  oh what a wonderful thing to be safe  for two days i have been in terror  i am safe now  how did arthur destroy my letter  tell me  lady chiltern  he burned it  sir robert chiltern  i wish i had seen that one sin of my youth burning to ashes  how many men there are in modern life who would like to see their past burning to white ashes before them  is arthur still here  lady chiltern  yes he is in the conservatory  sir robert chiltern  i am so glad now i made that speech last night in the house so glad  i made it thinking that public disgrace might be the result  but it has not been so  lady chiltern  public honour has been the result  sir robert chiltern  i think so  i fear so almost  for although i am safe from detection although every proof against me is destroyed i suppose gertrude    i suppose i should retire from public life  he looks anxiously at his wife  lady chiltern  eagerly  oh yes robert you should do that  it is your duty to do that  sir robert chiltern  it is much to surrender  lady chiltern  no it will be much to gain  sir robert chiltern walks up and down the room with a troubled expression  then comes over to his wife and puts his hand on her shoulder  sir robert chiltern  and you would be happy living somewhere alone with me abroad perhaps or in the country away from london away from public life  you would have no regrets  lady chiltern  oh none robert  sir robert chiltern  sadly  and your ambition for me  you used to be ambitious for me  lady chiltern  oh my ambition  i have none now but that we two may love each other  it was your ambition that led you astray  let us not talk about ambition  lord goring returns from the conservatory looking very pleased with himself and with an entirely new buttonhole that some one has made for him  sir robert chiltern  going towards him  arthur i have to thank you for what you have done for me  i don’t know how i can repay you shakes hands with him  lord goring  my dear fellow i’ll tell you at once  at the present moment under the usual palm tree    i mean in the conservatory     enter mason  mason  lord caversham  lord goring  that admirable father of mine really makes a habit of turning up at the wrong moment  it is very heartless of him very heartless indeed  enter lord caversham  mason goes out  lord caversham  good morning lady chiltern  warmest congratulations to you chiltern on your brilliant speech last night  i have just left the prime minister and you are to have the vacant seat in the cabinet  sir robert chiltern  with a look of joy and triumph  a seat in the cabinet  lord caversham  yes here is the prime minister’s letter  hands letter  sir robert chiltern  takes letter and reads it  a seat in the cabinet  lord caversham  certainly and you well deserve it too  you have got what we want so much in political life nowadays—high character high moral tone high principles  to lord goring  everything that you have not got sir and never will have  lord goring  i don’t like principles father  i prefer prejudices  sir robert chiltern is on the brink of accepting the prime minister’s offer when he sees wife looking at him with her clear candid eyes he then realises that it is impossible  sir robert chiltern  i cannot accept this offer lord caversham  i have made up my mind to decline it  lord caversham  decline it sir  sir robert chiltern  my intention is to retire at once from public life  lord caversham  angrily  decline a seat in the cabinet and retire from public life  never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course of my existence  i beg your pardon lady chiltern  chiltern i beg your pardon  to lord goring  don’t grin like that sir  lord goring  no father  lord caversham  lady chiltern you are a sensible woman the most sensible woman in london the most sensible woman i know  will you kindly prevent your husband from making such a    from taking such    will you kindly do that lady chiltern  lady chiltern  i think my husband in right in his determination lord caversham  i approve of it  lord caversham  you approve of it  good heavens  lady chiltern  taking her husband’s hand  i admire him for it  i admire him immensely for it  i have never admired him so much before he is finer than even i thought him  to sir robert chiltern  you will go and write your letter to the prime minister now won’t you don’t hesitate about it robert  sir robert chiltern  with a touch of bitterness  i suppose i had better write it at once  such offers are not repeated  i will ask you to excuse me for a moment lord caversham  lady chiltern  i may come with you robert may i not  sir robert chiltern  yes gertrude  lady chiltern goes out with him  lord caversham  what is the matter with this family  something wrong here eh  tapping his forehead  idiocy  hereditary i suppose both of them too  wife as well as husband  very sad  very sad indeed and they are not an old family  can’t understand it  lord goring  it is not idiocy father i assure you  lord caversham  what is it then sir  lord goring  after some hesitation  well it is what is called nowadays a high moral tone father  that is all  lord caversham  hate these newfangled names  same thing as we used to call idiocy fifty years ago  shan’t stay in this house any longer  lord goring  taking his arm  oh just go in here for a moment father  third palm tree to the left the usual palm tree  lord caversham  what sir  lord goring  i beg your pardon father i forgot  the conservatory father the conservatory—there is some one there i want you to talk to  lord caversham  what about sir  lord goring  about me father  lord caversham  grimly  not a subject on which much eloquence is possible  lord goring  no father but the lady is like me  she doesn’t care much for eloquence in others  she thinks it a little loud  lord caversham goes out into the conservatory  lady chiltern enters  lord goring  lady chiltern why are you playing mrs cheveley’s cards  lady chiltern  startled  i don’t understand you  lord goring  mrs cheveley made an attempt to ruin your husband  either to drive him from public life or to make him adopt a dishonourable position  from the latter tragedy you saved him  the former you are now thrusting on him  why should you do him the wrong mrs cheveley tried to do and failed  lady chiltern  lord goring  lord goring  pulling himself together for a great effort and showing the philosopher that underlies the dandy  lady chiltern allow me  you wrote me a letter last night in which you said you trusted me and wanted my help  now is the moment when you really want my help now is the time when you have got to trust me to trust in my counsel and judgment  you love robert  do you want to kill his love for you  what sort of existence will he have if you rob him of the fruits of his ambition if you take him from the splendour of a great political career if you close the doors of public life against him if you condemn him to sterile failure he who was made for triumph and success  women are not meant to judge us but to forgive us when we need forgiveness  pardon not punishment is their mission  why should you scourge him with rods for a sin done in his youth before he knew you before he knew himself a man’s life is of more value than a woman’s  it has larger issues wider scope greater ambitions  a woman’s life revolves in curves of emotions  it is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses don’t make any terrible mistake lady chiltern  a woman who can keep a man’s love and love him in return has done all the world wants of women or should want of them  lady chiltern  troubled and hesitating  but it is my husband himself who wishes to retire from public life  he feels it is his duty it was he who first said so  lord goring  rather than lose your love robert would do anything wreck his whole career as he is on the brink of doing now  he is making for you a terrible sacrifice  take my advice lady chiltern and do not accept a sacrifice so great  if you do you will live to repent it bitterly  we men and women are not made to accept such sacrifices from each other  we are not worthy of them  besides robert has been punished enough  lady chiltern  we have both been punished  i set him up too high  lord goring  with deep feeling in his voice  do not for that reason set him down now too low  if he has fallen from his altar do not thrust him into the mire  failure to robert would be the very mire of shame power is his passion  he would lose everything even his power to feel love  your husband’s life is at this moment in your hands your husband’s love is in your hands  don’t mar both for him  enter sir robert chiltern  sir robert chiltern  gertrude here is the draft of my letter  shall i read it to you  lady chiltern  let me see it  sir robert hands her the letter  she reads it and then with a gesture of passion tears it up  sir robert chiltern  what are you doing  lady chiltern  a man’s life is of more value than a woman’s  it has larger issues wider scope greater ambitions  our lives revolve in curves of emotions  it is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses  i have just learnt this and much else with it from lord goring  and i will not spoil your life for you nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me a useless sacrifice  sir robert chiltern  gertrude  gertrude  lady chiltern  you can forget  men easily forget  and i forgive  that is how women help the world  i see that now  sir robert chiltern  deeply overcome by emotion embraces her  my wife my wife  to lord goring  arthur it seems that i am always to be in your debt  lord goring  oh dear no robert  your debt is to lady chiltern not to me  sir robert chiltern  i owe you much  and now tell me what you were going to ask me just now as lord caversham came in  lord goring  robert you are your sister’s guardian and i want your consent to my marriage with her  that is all  lady chiltern  oh i am so glad  i am so glad  shakes hands with lord goring  lord goring  thank you lady chiltern  sir robert chiltern  with a troubled look  my sister to be your wife  lord goring  yes  sir robert chiltern  speaking with great firmness  arthur i am very sorry but the thing is quite out of the question  i have to think of mabel’s future happiness  and i don’t think her happiness would be safe in your hands  and i cannot have her sacrificed  lord goring  sacrificed  sir robert chiltern  yes utterly sacrificed  loveless marriages are horrible  but there is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless marriage  a marriage in which there is love but on one side only faith but on one side only devotion but on one side only and in which of the two hearts one is sure to be broken  lord goring  but i love mabel  no other woman has any place in my life  lady chiltern  robert if they love each other why should they not be married  sir robert chiltern  arthur cannot bring mabel the love that she deserves  lord goring  what reason have you for saying that  sir robert chiltern  after a pause  do you really require me to tell you  lord goring  certainly i do  sir robert chiltern  as you choose  when i called on you yesterday evening i found mrs cheveley concealed in your rooms  it was between ten and eleven o’clock at night  i do not wish to say anything more your relations with mrs cheveley have as i said to you last night nothing whatsoever to do with me  i know you were engaged to be married to her once  the fascination she exercised over you then seems to have returned  you spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and stainless a woman whom you respected and honoured  that may be so  but i cannot give my sister’s life into your hands  it would be wrong of me it would be unjust infamously unjust to her  lord goring  i have nothing more to say  lady chiltern  robert it was not mrs cheveley whom lord goring expected last night  sir robert chiltern  not mrs cheveley  who was it then  lord goring  lady chiltern  lady chiltern  it was your own wife  robert yesterday afternoon lord goring told me that if ever i was in trouble i could come to him for help as he was our oldest and best friend  later on after that terrible scene in this room i wrote to him telling him that i trusted him that i had need of him that i was coming to him for help and advice  sir robert chiltern takes the letter out of his pocket yes that letter  i didn’t go to lord goring’s after all  i felt that it is from ourselves alone that help can come  pride made me think that mrs cheveley went  she stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you this morning that you should think    oh robert i cannot tell you what she wished you to think     sir robert chiltern  what  had i fallen so low in your eyes that you thought that even for a moment i could have doubted your goodness gertrude gertrude you are to me the white image of all good things and sin can never touch you  arthur you can go to mabel and you have my best wishes  oh stop a moment  there is no name at the beginning of this letter  the brilliant mrs cheveley does not seem to have noticed that  there should be a name  lady chiltern  let me write yours  it is you i trust and need  you and none else  lord goring  well really lady chiltern i think i should have back my own letter  lady chiltern  smiling  no you shall have mabel  takes the letter and writes her husband’s name on it  lord goring  well i hope she hasn’t changed her mind  it’s nearly twenty minutes since i saw her last  enter mabel chiltern and lord caversham  mabel chiltern  lord goring i think your father’s conversation much more improving than yours  i am only going to talk to lord caversham in the future and always under the usual palm tree  lord goring  darling  kisses her  lord caversham  considerably taken aback  what does this mean sir you don’t mean to say that this charming clever young lady has been so foolish as to accept you  lord goring  certainly father  and chiltern’s been wise enough to accept the seat in the cabinet  lord caversham  i am very glad to hear that chiltern    i congratulate you sir  if the country doesn’t go to the dogs or the radicals we shall have you prime minister some day  enter mason  mason  luncheon is on the table my lady  mason goes out  mabel chiltern  you’ll stop to luncheon lord caversham won’t you  lord caversham  with pleasure and i’ll drive you down to downing street afterwards chiltern  you have a great future before you a great future  wish i could say the same for you sir  to lord goring but your career will have to be entirely domestic  lord goring  yes father i prefer it domestic  lord caversham  and if you don’t make this young lady an ideal husband i’ll cut you off with a shilling  mabel chiltern  an ideal husband  oh i don’t think i should like that it sounds like something in the next world  lord caversham  what do you want him to be then dear  mabel chiltern  he can be what he chooses  all i want is to be    to be    oh a real wife to him  lord caversham  upon my word there is a good deal of common sense in that lady chiltern  they all go out except sir robert chiltern  he sinks in a chair wrapt in thought  after a little time lady chiltern returns to look for him  lady chiltern  leaning over the back of the chair  aren’t you coming in robert  sir robert chiltern  taking her hand  gertrude is it love you feel for me or is it pity merely  lady chiltern  kisses him  it is love robert  love and only love  for both of us a new life is beginning
