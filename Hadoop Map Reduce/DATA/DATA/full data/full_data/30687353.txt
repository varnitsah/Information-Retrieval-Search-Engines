idolatry  hb     i      oh what land is the land of dream      william blake   i lived then in the great world once in an old roomy house beside a little wood of larches with an aunt of the name of sophia my father and mother died a few days before my fourth birthday so that i can conjure up only fleeting glimpses of their faces by which to remember what love was then lost to me both were youthful at death but my aunt sophia was ever elderly she was keen and just seldom less than kind but a child was to her something of a little animal and it was nothing more in consequence well fed warmly clad and in freedom i grew up almost in solitude between my angels hearkening with how simple a curiosity to that everlasting warfare of persuasion and compulsion terror and delight  which of them it was that guided me before even i could read to the little room dark with holly trees that had been of old my uncles library i know not perhaps at the instant it chanced there had fallen a breathless truce between them and i being solitary my own instinct took me but having once found that pictured haven i had found somewhat of content  i think half my youthful days passed in that low bookwalled chamber the candles i burned through those long years of evening would deck alps hugest fir the dust i disturbed would very easily fill again the measure that some day shall contain my own and the small studious thumbmarks that paced as if my footprints leaf by leaf of that long journey might be the history of lifes experience in littlefrom clearer to clear to fainthow very faint at last  i do not remember ever to have been discovered in this retreat i was by nature prompt at meals and wary to be in bed at my hour however transitory its occupation might be indeed i very well recollect dawn painting the page my eyes dwelt on surprising me with its mystery and stealth in a house as silent as the grave  thus entertained then by insubstantial society i grew up and began to be old before i had yet learned age is disastrous and it was there in that cold bright chamber one snowy twilight first suddenly awoke in me an imperative desire for distant lands  even while little else than a child i had begun to cast my mind to travel i doubt if ever columbus suffered such vexation from an itch to be gone  but whither  now it seemed clear to me after long brooding and musing that however beautiful were these regions of which i never wearied to read and however wild and faithful and strange and lovely the people of the books somewhere the former must remain yet somewhere in immortality serene dwell they whom so many had spent life in dreaming of and writing about  in fact take it for all in all what could these authors have been at if they laboured from dawn to midnight from laborious midnight to dawn merely to tell of what never was and never by any chance could be it was heavenclear to me solitary and a dreamer let me but gain the key i would soon unlock that eden gardendoor somewhere yet i was sure imogens mountains lift their chill summits into heaven over haunted seasands ariel flits at his webbed casement next the stars faust covets youth till the last trump shall ring him out of dream  it was on a blue march morning with all the trees of my aunts woods in a palegreen tumult of wind that quite unwittingly i set out on a journey that has not yet come to an end  there was a hint in the air at my waking i fancied not quite of mere earth the perfume of the banners of flora of the mould where in melting snow the crocus blows i looked from my window and the western clouds drew gravely and loftily in the illimitable air towards the whistling house strange trumpets pealed in the wind even my poor aged aunt sophia had changed with the universal change her great solitary face reminded me of some longforgotten april  and a little before eleven i saddled my uncles old mare rosinante poor female jade to bear a name so glorious and rode out as for how many fruitless seasons i had ridden out down the stony nettlenarrowed path that led for a secret mile or more beneath lindens towards the hills     ii       still thou art blest compared wi me      robert burns   it is to be wondered at that in so bleak a wind i could possibly fall into reverie but the habit was rooted deep in me rosinante was prosaic and trustworthy the country for miles around familiar to me as the palm of my hand yet so deeply was i involved and so steadily had we journeyed on that when at last i lifted my eyes with a great sigh that was almost a sob i found myself in a place utterly unknown to me  but more inexplicable yet not only was the place strange but by some incredible wizardry rosinante seemed to have carried me out of a march morning blue and tumultuous and bleak into the grey sweet mist of a midsummer dawn  i found that we were ambling languidly on across a green and level moor far away whether of clouds or hills i could not yet tell rose cold towers and pinnacles into the last darkness of night above us in the twilight invisible larks climbed among the daybeams singing as they flew a thick dew lay in beads on stick and stalk we were alone with the fresh wind of morning and the clear pillars of the east  on i went heedless curious marvelling my only desire to press forward to the goal whereto destiny was directing me i suppose after this we had journeyed about an hour and the risen sun was on the extreme verge of the gilded horizon when i espied betwixt me and the deep woods that lay in the distance a little child walking  she at any rate was not a stranger to this moorland indeed something in her carriage in the grey cloak she wore in her light insistent step in the old lantern she carried in the shrill little song she or the wind seemed singing for a moment half impelled me to turn aside even rosinante pricked forward her ears and stooped her gentle face to view more closely this light traveller and she pawed the ground with her great shoe and gnawed her bit when i drew rein and leaned forward in the saddle to speak to the child  is there any path here little girl that i may follow i said  no path at all she answered  but how then do strangers find their way across the moor i said  she debated with herself a moment some by the stars and some by the moon she answered  by the moon i cried but at day what then  oh then sir she said they can see  i could not help laughing at her demure little answers why i exclaimed what a worldly little woman and what is your name  they call me lucy gray she said looking up into my face i think my heart almost ceased to beat  lucy gray i repeated  yes she said most seriously as if to herself in all this snow  snow i saidthis is dewdrops shining not snow  she looked at me without flinching how else can mother see how i am lost she said  why said i how else not knowing how to reach her bright belief and what are those thick woods called over there  she shook her head there is no name she said  but you have a namelucy gray and you started outdo you rememberone winters day at dusk and wandered on and on on and on the snow falling in the dark tilldo you remember  she stood quite still her small serious face full to the east striving with faroff dreams and a merry little smile passed over her lips that will be a long time since she said and i must be off home and as if it had been but an apparition of my eyes that had beset and deluded me she was gone and i found myself sitting astride in the full brightness of the suns first beams alone  what omen was this then that i should meet first a phantom on my journey one thing only was clear rosinante could trust to her five wits better than i to mine so leaving her to take what way she pleased i rode on till at length we approached the woods i had descried presently we were jogging gently down into a deep and misty valley flanked by bracken and pines from which issued into the crisp air of morning a most delicious aromatic smell that seemed at least to prove this valley not far remote from araby  i do not think i was disturbed though i confess to having been a little amazed to see how profound this valley was into which we were descending yet how swiftly climbed the sun as if to pace with us so that we should not be in shadow howsoever fast we journeyed i was astonished to see flowers of other seasons than summer by the wayside and to hear in june for no other month could bear such green abundance the thrush sing with a february voice here too almost at my right hand perched a score or more of robins brightdyed warbling elvishly in chorus as if the mayboughs whereon they sat were white with hoarfrost and not buds birds also unknown to me in voice and feather i saw and little creatures in fur timid yet not wild fruits even dangled from the trees as if like the bramble blossom and seed could live here together and prosper  yet why should i be distracted by these things thought i i remembered maundeville and hithlodaye sindbad and gulliver and many another citizen of thule and was reassured a man must either believe what he sees or see what he believes i know no other course why too should i mistrust the bounty of the present merely for the scarcity of the past not i  i rode on and it seemed had advanced but a few miles before the sun stood overhead and it was noon we were growing weary i think of sheer delight rosinante with her mild face beneath its dark forelock gazing this side that side at the uncustomary landscape and i ever peering forward beneath my hat in eagerness to descry some living creature a little bigger than these conies and squirrels to prove me yet in lands inhabited but the sun was wheeling headlong and the stillness of late afternoon on the woods when dusty and parched and heavy we came to a break in the thick foliage and presently to a green gate embowered in box     iii      thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice     to make dreams truth and fables histories      john donne   i dismounted and with the nose of my beast in my bosom stood awhile gazing in the halfdream weariness brings across the valley at the dense forests that covered the hills and while thus standing doubtful whether to knock at the little gate or to ride on it began to open and a great particoloured dog looked out on us there was certainly something unusual in the aspect of this animal for though he lifted on us grave and sagacious eyes he scarcely seemed to see us manifested neither pleasure nor disapproval neither wagged his tail to give us welcome nor yawned to display his armament he seemed a kind of dreamdog a dog one sees without zeal and sees again partly with the eye but most in recollection  thus however we stood stranger horse and dog till a morose voice called somewhere from beyond pilot sir come here pilot semidog or no he knew his master whereupon tying up my dejected rosinante to a ring in the gateway i followed boldly after pilot into that sequestered garden  meanwhile however he had disappeareddown a thick green alley to the left i supposed so i went forward by a clearer path and when i had advanced a few paces met face to face a lady whose dark eyes seemed strangely familiar to me  she was evidently a little disquieted at meeting a stranger so unceremoniously but stood her ground like a small black fearless note of interrogation  i explained at once therefore as best i could how i came to be there described my journey my bewilderment and how that i knew not into what country nor company fate had beguiled me except that the one was beautiful and the other in some delightful way familiar and i begged her to tell me where i really was and how far from home and of whom i was now beseeching forgiveness  her thoughts followed my every word passing upon her face like shadows on the sea i have never seen a listener so completely still and so completely engrossed in listening and when i had finished she looked aside with a transient halfsly smile and glanced at me again covertly so that i could not see herself for seeing her eyes and she laughed lightly  it is indeed a strange journey she replied but i fear i cannot in the least direct you i have never ventured my own self beyond the woods lesti should penetrate too far but you are tired and hungry will you please walk on a few steps till you come to a stone seat my name is rochesterjane rochestershe glanced up between the hollies with a sigh that was all but laughterjane eyre you know  i went on as she had bidden and seated myself before an old white manywindowed house squatting like an owl at noon beneath its green covert in a few minutes the great dog with dripping jowl passed almost like reality and after him his mistress and on her arm her master mr rochester  there seemed a night of darkness in that scarred face and stars unearthly bright he peered dimly at me leaning heavily on janes arm his left hand plunged into the bosom of his coat and when he was come near he lifted his hat to me with a kind of spanish gravity  is this the gentleman jane he enquired  yes sir  hes young he muttered  for otherwise he would not be here she replied  was the gate bolted then he asked  mr rochester desires to know if you had the audacity sir to scale his garden wall jane said turning sharply on me shall i count the strawberries sir she added over her shoulder  jane jane he exclaimed testily i have no wish to be uncivil sir we are not of the worlda mere dark satellite i am dim and suspicious of strangers as this one treacherous eye should manifest ill but ask your name sirthere are yet a few names left once pleasing to my ear  my name is brocken sirhenry brocken i answered  anddid you walk pah theres the mystery god knows how else you could have come unless you are a modern ganymede where thens your aquiline steed sir we have no neighbours herenone to stare and pry and prate and slander  i informed him that i was as ignorant as he what power had spirited me to his house but that so far as obvious means went my old horse was probably by this time fast asleep beside the green gate at which i had entered jane stood on tiptoe and whispered in his ear and nodding imperiously at him withdrew into the house  complete silence fell between us after her departure the woods stood dark and motionless in the yellow evening light there was no sound of wind or water no sound of voices or footsteps only far away the clear scarceaudible warbling of a sleepy bird  well sir mr rochester said suddenly i am bidden invite you to pass the night here there are stranger inhabitants than mr and mrs rochester in these regions you have by some means strayed intowilder denizens by much for youths seraphic finding not for mine sir i vow depart again in the morning if you will we shall neither of us be displeased by then to say farewell i dare say i do not seek company my obscure shell is enough i rose sit downsit down again my dear sir theres no mischief in the truth between two men of any world i suppose assuredly not of this my wife will see to your comfort there hushie now here he floats sit still sit stilli hear his wings it is my four evangels sir  it was a sleek blackbird that had alighted and now set to singing on the topmost twig of a lofty peartree near by and with his first note jane reappeared and while we listened unstirring to that rich undaunted voice i had good opportunity to observe her and not i think without her knowledge not even without her approval  this then was the face that had returned wrath for wrath remorse for remorse passion for passion to that dark egotist jane in the lookingglass yet who thought i could be else than beautiful with eyes that seemed to hide in fleeting cloud a flame as pure as amber the arch simplicity of her gown her small narrow hands the exquisite cleverness of mouth and chin the lovely courage and sincerity of that yetchildish browit seemed even mr rochesters four evangels out of his urgent rhetoric was summoning with reiterated persuasions jane eyre jane eyre jane eyre ja  ne  light faded from the woods a faint wind blew cold upon our faces jane took mr rochesters hand and looked into his face  she turned to me will you come in mr brocken i have seen that your horse is made quite easy he was fast asleep poor fellow as you surmised and i think dreaming for when i proffered him a lump of sugar he thrust his nose into my face and breathed as if i were a peck of corn the candles are lit sir supper is ready  we went in slowly and jane bolted the door but who it is that can be bolted out she said i know not though theres much to bolt in i have stood here mr brocken on darker nights as still as this and have heard what seemed to be the sea breaking far away leagues upon leagues beyond the foreststhe gush forward the protracted heavy retreatlistened till i could have wept to think that it was only my own poor furious heart beating you may imagine then i push the bolts home  but why janewhy cried mr rochester incredulously violent fancies child  why sir it was i say not the sea i heard but a trickling tide one icy tap might stay if it found but entry there  you talk wildly janewildly wildly the airs afloat with listeners so it seems so it seems had i but one clear lamp in this dark face  we sat down in the candlelit twilight to supper it was to me like the supper of a child taken at peace in the clear beams ere he descend into the shadow of sleep  they sat try as i would not to observe them hand touching hand throughout the meal but to me it was as if one might sit to eat before a great mountain ruffled with pines and perpetually clamorous with torrents all that mr rochester said every gesture these were but the ghosts of words and movements behind them gloomy imperturbable withdrawn slumbered a strange smouldering power i began to see how very hotly jane must love him she who loved above all things storm the winds of the equinox the illimitable nightsky  she begged him to take a little wine with me and filled his glass till it burned like a ruby between their hands  it paints both our hands she cried glancing up at him  ay janet he answered but where is yours  and what goal will you make for when you leave us she enquired of me is there anywhere else she added lifting her slim eyebrows  i shall put trust in chance i replied which at least is steadfast in change so long as it does not guide me back i care not how far forward i go  you are right she answered that is a puissant battlecry here and hereafter  mr rochester rose hastily from his chair the candles irk me jane i would like to be alone excuse me sir he left the room  jane lifted a dark curtain and beckoned me to bring the lights she sat down before a little piano and desired me to sit beside her and while she played i know not what but only it seemed old wellremembered airs her mood suggested she asked me many questions  and am i indeed only like that poor mad thing you thought jane eyre she said or did you read between  i answered that it was not her words not even her thoughts not even her poetry that was to me jane eyre  what then is left of me she enquired stooping her eyes over the keys and smiling darkly am i indeed so evanescent a wintry wraith  well i said jane eyre is left  she pressed her lips together i see she said brightly but then was i not detestable too so stubborn so wilful so demented sovain  you were vain i answered because  well she said and the melody died out and the lower voices of her music complained softly on  for a barrier i answered  a barrier she cried  why yes i said a barrier against cant and flummery and coldness and pride and againstwhy against your own vanity too  thats really very cleverpenetrating she said and i really desired to know not because i did not know already but to know i knew all you are a perspicacious observer mr brocken and to be that is to be alive in a world of the moribund but then too how high one must soar at times for one must ever condescend in order to observe faithfully at any rate to observe all one must range at an altitude above all  and so i said you have taken your praise from me  but you are a man and i a woman we look with differing eyes each sex to the other and perceive by contrast elsewhy how else could you forgive my presumption he sees me as an eagle sees the creeping tortoise i see him as the moon the sun never weary of gazing i borrow his radiance to observe him by but i weary you with my garrulous tongue have you no plan at all in your journey tis not the dangers but to me the endless restlessness of such a venturethat oh where shall wisdom be found will you not pausestay with us a few days to consider again this rash journey to each his world it is surely perilous to transgress its fixed boundaries  who knows i cried rather arrogantly perhaps the sorcery that lured me hither may carry me as lightly back but i have tasted honey and covet the hive  she glanced sidelong at me with that stealthy gravity that lay under all her lightness  that delicious rosinante she exclaimed softly and i really believe too i must be the honeyor is it mr rochester ah mr brocken they call it wasphoney when it is so bitter that it blisters the lips she talked on gaily as if she had forgotten i was but a stranger until now yet none the less she perceived presently my eyes ever and again fixed upon the little brooch of faintest gold hair at her throat and flinched and paled playing on in silence  take the whole past she continued abruptly spread it out before you with all its just defeats all its broken faith and overweening hopes its beauty and fear and love and its lossits loss then turn and say this this only this duller heart these duller eyes this contumacious spirit is all that is leftmyself oh who could wish to one so dear a destiny so dark she rose hastily from the piano did i hear mr rochesters step by the window she said  i crossed the room and looked out into the night the brightening moon hung golden in the dark clearness of the sky mr rochester stood motionless napoleonwise beneath the black unstirring foliage and before i could turn jane had begun to sing        you take my heart with tears       i battle uselessly     reft of all hopes and doubts and fears         lie quietly        you veil my heart with cloud       since faith is dim and blind     i can but grope perplexd and bowd         seek till i find        yet bonds are life to me       how else could i perceive     the love in each wild artery         that bids me live  janes was not a rich voice nor very sweet and yet i fancied no other voice than this could plead and argue quite so clearly and with such nimble insistencyneither of bird nor child nor brook because i suppose it was the voice of jane eyre and all that was janes seemed janes only  the music ceased the accompaniment died away but mr rochester stood immobile yeta little darker night in that much deeper when i turned jane was gone from the room i sat down my face towards the still candles as one who is awake yet dreams on the faint scent of the earth through the open window the heavy sombre furniture the daintiness and the alertness in the many flowers and few womanly gewgaws these too i shall remember in a tranquillity that cannot change  a sudden trembling glimmer at the window lit the garden and instantaneously the distant hills lit also the figures of jane and mr rochester beneath the trees they entered the house and once more jane drew the bolts against that phantom fear a tinge of scarlet stood in her cheeks an added lustre in her eyes they were strange lovers these twolike frost upon a cypress tree yet summer lay all around us  i bade them good night and ascended to the little room prepared for me there was a great pincushion on the sprigged and portly toilet table and i laboured till the constellations had changed beyond my window in printing from a box of tiny pins upon that lavendered mound ave ave atque vale  far in the night a dreadful sound woke me i rose and looked out of the window and heard again deep and reverberating pilot baying i know not what light minions of the moon the great bear wheeled faintly clear in the dark zenith but the borders of the east were grey as glass and far away a fierce hound was answering from his echoplace in the gloom as if the dread dog of acheron kept post upon the hills  a light tap woke me in the sunlight and a lighter voice mr rochester took breakfast with us in a gloomy old dressingroom moody and taciturn unpacified by sleep but jane whimsical and deft had tied a yellow ribbon in the darkness of her hair  rosinante awaited me at the little green gate eyeing forlornly the steep valley at her feet and i rode on the gate was shut on me and mr rochester again perhaps at his black ease  i had jogged on with that peculiar gravity age brings to equine hoofs about a mile when the buttress of a thick wall came into view abutting on the lane and perched thereon what at first i deemed a coloured figment of the mist that festooned the branches and clung along the turf but when i drew near i saw it was indeed a child pink and gold and palest blue and she raised changeling hands at me and laughed and danced and chattered like the drops upon a waterfall and clear as if a tiny bell had jingled i heard her cry  and my heart smote me heavily since i had of my own courtesy not remembered adèle     iv      cuckoo jugjug puwe tuwittawoo      thomas nash   it was yet early and refreshing in the chequered shade we plodded earnestly after our gaunt shadow in the dust and ever downward till at last we drew so near to the opposite steep that i could well nigh count its pines  it was about the hour when birds seek shade and leave but few among their fellows to sing that at a stones throw from the foot of the hill i came to where a faint bridlepath diverged and since it was smooth with moss and rosinante haply tired of pebbles since any but the direct road seems ever the more delectable i too turned aside and broke into the woods through which this path meandered  maybe it is because all woods are enchanted that the path seemed more than many miles long often too we loitered or stood head by head to listen or to watch what might be after all only wings mere sunbeams shall i say then that it began to be thorny and where the thorns were pale with roses when at length the knitted boughs gradually drew asunder and i looked down between twitching hairy ears upon a glade so green and tranquil i deemed it must be the garden of the hesperides  and because there ran a very welcome brook of water through this glade i left rosinante to follow whithersoever a sweet tooth might dictate and climbed down into the weedy coolness at the waterbrink  i confess i laughed to see so puckered a face as mine in the clear blue of the flowing water but i dipped my hands and my head into the cold shallows none the less pleasantly and was casting about for a deeper pool where i might bathe unscorned of the noonday when i heard a light laughter behind me and turning cautiously perceived under the further shadow of the glade three ladies sitting  not even vanity could persuade me that they were laughing at anything more grotesque than myself so putting a bold face on matters so humiliating i sauntered as carelessly and loftily as i dared in their direction my courage seemed to abash them a little they gathered back their petticoats like birds about to fly but at hint of a titter they all three began gaily laughing again till their eyes sparkled brighter than ever and their cheeks seemed shadows of the roses above their heads  ladies i began gravely i have left my horse that is very old and very thirsty above in the wood is there any path i may discover by which she may reach the water without offence  is she very old said one  she is very old i said  but is she very thirsty said another  she is perhaps very thirsty i said  perhaps cried they all  because ladies i replied being by nature of a timid tongue and compelled to say something and having nothing apt to say i remembered my old rosinante above in the wood  they glanced each at each and glanced again at me  but there is no path down that is not steep said the fairest of the three  there never was a path not even we fear for a traveller on foot continued the second  i waited in silence a moment forgive me then i said i will offend no longer  but this seemed far from their design  you see being come began the fairest again julia thinks fortune must have brought you are we not all between fortunes finger and thumb  if pinching is to prove anything said the other  and fortune is fickle too added juliathats early wisdom but not quite so fickle as you would wish to show her here we have sat in these mortal glades ever since our poor herrick died and here it seems we are like to sit till he rises again it is all sodubious but since electra has invited you to rest awhile will you not really rest there is shade as deep and fruit to refresh you in a little arbour yonder perhaps even anthea will dip out of her weeping awhile if she hears that  a poor old thirsty horse is tethered in the woods  they rose up together with a prolonged rustling as of a peacock displaying his plumes and i found myself irretrievably their captive  moreover even if they were but sylphs and fantasies of the morning they were fantasies lovely as even their master had portrayed while the dells through which they led me were green and deep and white and golden with buds  it was now i suppose about the middle of the morning yet though the sun was high his heat was that of dawn dawn lingered in the shadows as snow when winter is over and gone and dwelt among the sunbeams dew lay heavy on the grass as the dainty heels of my captresses testified yet they trod lightly upon daisies wideopen to the blue sky while daffadowndillies stooped in a silence broken only by their laughter  we came presently to a little stone summerhouse or arbour enclustered with leaves and flowers of ivy and convolvulus wherein two great dishes of cherries stood and bowls of honeycomb and sillabub  there we sat down but they kept me close too in the midst of the arbour where perhaps i was not so illcontent to be as i should like to profess how then could i else than bob for cherries as often as i dared and prove my wit to conceal my hunger  and now sir traveller said she of the sparkling eyes named dianeme since we have got you safe tell us of all we have never heard or seen  and oh are we forgot cried electra laying a lip upon a cherry  theres not a poet in his teens but warbles of you morn noon and night i answered theres not a lover mad young true and tender but borrows your azure and your rubies and your roses and your stars to deck his sweethearts name with  boys perhaps cried julia softly but men soon forget  youth never i replied  why youth said dianeme herrick was not always young  ay but all men once were young please god i said and youth is the only once thats worth remembrance youth with the heart of youth adores you ladies because when dreams come thick upon them they catch your flying laughter in the woods when the sun is sunk and the stars kindle in the sky then your eyes haunt the twilight you come in dreams and mock the waking you the mystery you the bravery and danger you the longsought you the neverwon memories hopes songs ere the earth is mute you will always be loved believe me o bright ladies till youth fades turns and loves no more and i gazed amazed on cherries of such potency as these  but once sir said julia timidly we were not only loved but told we were loved  where is the pleasure else cried dianeme  besides said electra anthea says if we might but find where styx flows one draughtmy mere palmfulwould be sweeter than all the poetry ever writ save some  it is idle cried dianeme herrick himself admired us most on paper  and ink makes a cross even of a kiss that is very well known said julia  ah said i all men have eyes few see most men have tongues there is but one robin herrick  i will tell you a secret said dianeme  and as if a bird of the air had carried her voice it seemed a hush fell on sky and greenery  we are but fairymoney all she said an envy to see take ustis all dry leaves in the hand herrick stole the honey and the bees he killed blow never so softly on the tinder it flamesand dies  i heard once said electra with but a thought of pride that had i lived a little little earlier i might have been the duchess of malfi  i too flatterer cried julia i toodesdemona slain by a blackamoor to some it is the cold hills and the valleys green and sad and the seabirds wailing she continued in a low strange voice and to some the glens of heather and the mountainbrooks and the rowans but come to an end what are we all this mans eyes will tell ye i would give white and red nectar and snow and roses and all the similes that ever were for  for what said i  i think for robin herrick she said  it was a lamentable confession for that said gravity fled away and electra fetched out a lute from a low cupboard in the arbour and while she played julia sang to a sober little melody i seemed to know of old          sighs have no skill         to wake from sleep     love once too wild too deep          gaze if thou will         thou canst not harm     eyes shut to subtle charm          oh tis my silence         shows thee false     should i be silent else          haste thou then by         shine not thy face     on mine and loves disgrace  whereat dianeme lifted on me so naïve an afflicted face i must needs beseech another song despite my drowsy lids wherefore i heard far away as it were the plucking of the strings and a voice betwixt dream and wake sing          all sweet flowers           wither ever         gathered fresh           or gathered never     but to live when love is gone     grieve grieve lute sadly on          all i had           twas all thou gavst me         that foregone           ah what can save me     if the exórcised spirit fly     nought is left to love me by          take thy stars           my tears then leave me         thine my bliss           as thine to grieve me     take  for then so insidious was the music and not quite of this earth the voice my senses altogether forsook me and i fell asleep  would that i could remember much else but i confess it is the heart remembers not the poor pestered brain that has so many thoughts and but one troubled thinker indeed were i now to be askedwere the fingers cold of these bright ladies were their eyes blue or hazel or brown or haply were dianemes that incomparable dark sparkling grey wore julia azure and electra white and was that our poet wrote our poets only or truly theirs and so even more lovelyi fear i could not tell  i fell asleep and when i awoke no lute was sounding i was alone and the arbour a little house of gloom on the borders of evening i caught up yet one more handful of cherries and stumbled out heavy and dim into a palegreen firmanent of buds and glowworms to seek the poor rosinante i had so heedlessly deserted  but i was gone but a little way when i was brought suddenly to a standstill by another sound that in the hush of the garden in the bright languor after sleep went to my heart it was as if a child were crying  i pushed through a thick and aromatic clump of myrtles and peering between the narrow leaves perceived the cold bright face of a little marble god beneath willows and seated upon a starry bank near by one whom by the serpentry of her hair and the shadow of her lips i knew to be anthea  why are you weeping i said  i was imitating a little brook she said  it is late the bat is up yet you are alone i said  pan will protect me she said  and nought else  she turned her face away none she said i live among shadows there was a world i dreamed where autumn follows summer and after autumn winter here it is always june despite us both  what then would you have i said  ask him she replied  but the little god looking sidelong was mute in his grey regard  why do you not run away what keeps you here  you ask many questions stranger who can escape to live is to remember to dieoh who would forget even had i been weeping and not merely mocking time away would my tears be of lethe at my mouths corners no said anthea why feign and lie all i am is but a memory lovely with regret  she rose and the myrtles concealed her from me and i in the midst of the dusk where the tiny torches burned sadlyi turned to the sightless eyes of that smiling god  what he knew being blind yet smiling i seemed to know then but that also i have forgotten  i whistled softly and clearly into the air and a querulous voice answered me from afarthe voice of a grasshopperrosinantes     v      how should i your true love know     from another one      william shakespeare   but even then she was difficult finding so cunningly had ivy and blackberry and bindweed woven snares for the trespassers foot  but at lastnot far from where we had partedi found her a pillar of smoke in the first shining of the moon she turned large smouldering eyes on me her mane in elf locks her flanks heaving and wet her forelock frizzed like a colts yet she showed only pleasure at seeing me and so evident a desire to unburden the days history that i almost wished i might be balaam awhile and shedapple  it would be idle to attempt to ride through these thick glimmering brakes the darkness was astir and as the moon above the valley brightened casting pale beams upon the folded roses and drooping branches if populous dream did not deceive me a tiny multitude was afoot in the undergrowthsmall horns winding wee tapers burning  presently as with rosinantes nose at my shoulder we pushed slowly forward a nightingale burst close against my ear into so passionate a descant i thought i should be gooseflesh to the end of my days  the heedless tumult of her song seemed to give courage to sounds and voices much fainter soon a lovelit rival in some distant thicket broke into song and far and near their voices echoed above the elfin din of timbrel and fife and huntinghorn i began to wish the moon away that dazzled my eyes yet could not muffle my ears  in the heavyladen boughs dim lanterns burned there indeed when we dipped into the deeper umbrage of some loftier tree i espied the pattering hostscreatures my dianeme might have threaded for a bangle yet breeched and armed and fiercely martial  down too in a watery dell of hartstongue around the root of a swelling fungus a lovely company floated of an insubstantiality subtile as tapersmoke and of a beauty as remote as the babes in childrens eyes  we passed unheeded four bearded hoofs rose and fell upon the moss with all the circumspection snorting rosinante could compass but one might as well go snaring moonbeams as dream to crush such airy beings ever and again a gossamer company would soar like a spider on his magic thread and float with a whisper of remotest music past my ear or some bolder pigmy out of the leaves we brushed in passing skip suddenly across the rusty amphitheatre of my saddle into the further covert  so we wandered on baffled and confused through a hundred pathless glens and dells till already gold had begun to dim the swelling moons bright silver and by the freshness and added sweetness of the air it seemed dawn must be near when on a sudden a harsh preposterous voice broke on my ear and such a seesaw peal of laughter as i have never tittered in sheer fellowship with before or since we stood listening and the voice broke out again  tittanynay tittany youll crack my sides with laughing have again at you love your master and youll wax nimble bottom will learn you all trust time and bottom though in sooth your weeny majesty is something less than natural drive thy

slumbered truly this engarlanded weaver his lids concealing all bright speculation his jowl of vanity foe of the philistine at peace and i might gaze unperceived the moon filled his mossy cubicle with her untrembling beams streamed upon blossoms sweet and heavy as absaloms hair while tiny plumes wafted into the night the scent of thyme and meadowsweet  i know not how long they would have kept me prisoner with their illusive music i dared not move scarce wink for much as immortality may mollify hairiness i had no wish to live too frank  how also would this weaver who slumbered so cacophonously welcome a rival to his realms i say i sat still like echo in the woods when none is calling like too i grant one who ached not a little after jolts and jars and the phantasmal mists of this engendering air but none stirred nor went nor came so resting my hands cautiously on a little witchs guild of toadstools that squatted cold in shade i lifted myself softly and stood alert  and in a while out of that numerous company stepped one whom by his primrose face and mien i took to be mounsieur mustardseed and i followed after him     vi      carecharming sleep       sweetly thyself dispose     on this afflicted prince      john fletcher   away with a blink of his queer green eye over his shoulder he sauntered by a devious path out of the dell forgetful of thorn and brier trickery and wantonness we clambered down after him out of the moonlight into a dark clear alley soundless and solitary amid these enchanted woods  as i have said already another air than that of night was abroad in the greengrey shadows of the woods yet between the lofty and heavyhooded pines scarce a beam of dawn pierced downward  wider swept the avenue but ever dusky and utterly silent deeper moss couched here unfallen moondrops glistened mistletoe palely sprouted from the gnarled boughs nor could i discern though i searched close enough elder or ash tree or bitter rue we journeyed softly on till i lost all count of time lost too all guidance for as a flower falls had vanished mustardseed  far away and ever increasing in volume i heard the trembling crash of some great water falling what narrow isles of sky were visible between the branches lay sunless and still yet already on a mantled pool we journeyed softly by the waterlily was unfolding the swan afloat in beauty  in a dim still light we at last slowly descended out of the darker glade into a garden of grey terraces and flowerless walks even rosinante seemed perturbed by the stillness and solitude of this wild garden she trod with cautious foot and peering eye the green rainworn paths that led us down presently to where beneath the vault of its trees a river flowed  surely i could not be mistaken that here a voice was singing as if out of the black waterdeeps so clear and hollow were the notes i burst through the knotted stalks of the ivy and stooping like some poor travesty of narcissus with shaded face pierced down deepdeep into eyes not my own but violet and unendurable and strangeeyes of the living watersprite drawing my wits from me stilling my heart till i was very near plunging into that crystal oblivion to be fishes evermore  but my fingers still grasped my friends kind elflocks and her goosenose brooded beside mine upon that water of undivulged delight out of the restless silence of the stream floated this longdrawn singing      pilgrim forget in this dark tide     sinks the salt tear to peace at last     here undeluding dreams abide         all sorrow past      nods the wild ivy on her stem     the voiceless bird broods on the bough     the silence and the song of them         untroubled now      free that poor captives flutterings     that struggles in thy tired eyes     solace its discontented wings         quiet its cries      knells now the dewdrop to its fall     the sad wind sleeps no more to rove     rest for my arms ambrosial         ache for thy love  i cannot think how one so meekened with hunger as i resisted that watertroubled hair eyes that yet haunt me that heartalluring voice  no no i said faintly and the words of anthea came unbidden to mind to sleepoh who would forget you plead merely with some old dream of menot all me you know gold is but witchcraft and as for sorrowspread me a magical table in this nettlegarden ill leave all melancholy  i must indeed have been exhausted to chop logic with a waterwitch as well argue with minnows entreat the rustling of ivyleaves it was rosinante wearying i suppose of the reflection of her own mild countenance that drew me back from dream and disaster she turned with arched neck seeking a more wholesome pasture than these deep mosses  leaving her then to her own devices and yet hearkening after the voice of the charmer i came out again into the garden and perceived before me a dark palace with one lofty tower  it seemed strange i had not seen the tower at my first coming into this wilderness it stood with clustered summit and stooping gargoyles appealing as it were to fear in utter silence  though i knew it must be day there was scarcely more than a green twilight around me ever deepening until at last i could but dimly discern the upper windows of the palace and all sound waned but the roar of distant falling water  then it was i found that i was not alone in the garden two little leaden children stood in an attitude of listening on either side of the carved porch of the palace and between them a figure that seemed to be watching me intently  i looked and looked againsaw the greengrey folds the tawny locks the mistletoe the unearthly eyes of this unstirring figure yet when i advanced but one strenuous pace saw noughtonly the little leaden boys and the porch between them  these childish listeners the straggling briers the impenetrable thickets the emerald gloaming the marble stillness of the lofty lichenous tower i took courage could such things be in else than elfland and she who out of beauty and being vanishes and eludes what else could she be than one of elflands denizens from whom a light and credulous heart need fear nothing  i trod like a shadow where the phantom had stood and opened the unused door i was about to pass into the deeper gloom of the house when a hound appeared and stood regarding me with shining eyes in the faint gloaming he was presently joined by one as lightfooted but milkwhite and slimmer and both turned their heads as if in question of their master who had followed close behind them  this personage because of the gloom or the better to observe the intruder on his solitude carried a lantern whose beams were reflected upon himself attired as he was from head to foot in the palest primrose but with a countenance yet paler  there was no hint of enmity or alarm or astonishment in the colourless eyes that were fixed composedly on mine nothing but courtesy in his low voice  back safteback sallow he cried softly to his hounds is this your civility indeed sir he continued to me it was all i could do to dissuade the creatures from giving tongue when you first appeared on the terrace of my solitary gardens i heard too the watersprite she only sings when footsteps stray upon the banks he smiled wanly and his nose seemed even sharper in his pale face and his yellow hair leaner about his shoulders i feared her voice might prove too persuasive and deprive me of the first strange face i have seen these many decades gone  i bowed and murmured an apology for my intrusion just as i might perhaps to some apparition of nightmare that overstayed its welcome  i beseech you sir he replied say no more it may be i deemed you at first a visitor perchance even more welcomeif it be possible yet i know not that either my name is ennuihe smiled againprince ennui you have perchance heard somewhere our sad story this is the perpetual silence wherein lies that oncehappy princess my dear sister sleeping beauty  his voice seemed but an echo amongst the walls and arches of this old house and he spoke with a suave enunciation as if in an unfamiliar tongue  i replied that i had read the everlovely story of sleeping beauty indeed knew it by heart and assured him modestly that i had not the least doubt of a happy endingthat is if the author be the least authority  he narrowed his lids it is a tradition he replied meanwhile the thickets broaden  whereupon i begged him to explain how it chanced that among that festive and animated company i had read of he alone had resisted the wicked godmothers spell  he smiled distantly and bowed me into the garden  that is a simple thing he said  yet for the life of me i could not but doubt all he told me he who could pass spring on to spring summer on to summer in the company of beasts so sly and silent so alert and fleet as these hounds of his could not be quite the amiable prince he feigned to be i began to wish myself in homelier places  it seems that on the morning of the fatal spindle he had gone coursing with this safte and sallow and his horse named twilight and after wearying and heating himself at the sport a little after noon leaving his attendants had set out to return to the palace alone but allured by the cool seclusion of a latticearbour in his path he had gone in and then and there twilight beneath the willows his hounds at his feet had fallen asleep  undisturbed dreamless the unseemly hours sped light of foot he awoke again between sunset and dark the owl astir the silver gnats yet netting the shadows and so returned to the palace  but the spell had fallenking and courtier queen and lady and page and scullion hawk and hound slept a sleep past wakingwhile i roamed and roam yet in a solitary watch beyond all sleeping wherefore sir i only of the most hospitable house in these lands am awake to bid you welcome but as for that a few dwindling and harsh fruits in my orchards and the cold river water that my dogs lap with me are all that is left to offer you for i who never sleep am never hungry and they who never wakei presumenever thirst would sir it were otherwise after such long silence then conceive how strangely falls your voice on ears that have heard only wings fluttering dismal watersongs and the yelp and quarrel and nightvoice of unseen hosts in the forests  he glanced at me with a mild austerity and again lowered his eyes i cannot now but wonder how the rhythm of a voice so soft so monotonous could give such pleasure to the ear i almost doubted my own eyes when i looked upon his yellow on that unmoved sad mad pale face  i had no doubt of his dogs however and walked scarcely at ease beside him while they shadowfooted closely followed us at heel  prince ennui conducted me with shining lantern into a dense orchard thickly undergrown marvellously green with a small hard fruit upon its branches shaped like a medlar of a crisp sweet odour and despite its hardness a delicious taste the interwoven twigs of the stooping trees were thickly nested a veritable wilderness of moonlike and starry flowers ran all to seed amid the nettles and nightshade of this green silence and while i atefor i was hungry enoughprince ennui stood his hand on sallows muzzle lightly thridding the dusky labyrinths of the orchard with his faint green eyes  mine too were not less busy but rather with its lord than with his orchard and the strange thought entered my mind was he in very deed the incarnation of this solitude this silence this lawless abundance somewhere in the green heats of summer had he come forth taken shape exalted himself what but vegetable ichor coursed through veins transparent as his what but the swarming mysteries of these thick woods lurked in his brain as for his hounds theirs was the same stealth the same symmetry the same cold secret unhumanity as his creatures begotten of moonlight on silence they seemed to me with instincts past my workaday wits to conceive  and rosinante i laughed softly to think of her staid bones beside the phantom creature this prince had called up to me at mention of twilight  i ate because i was ravenously hungry but also because while eating i was better at my ease  suddenly out of the stillness like an arrow safte was gone and far away beneath the motionless leaves a faint voice rang dwindling into silence i shuddered at my probable fate  prince ennui glanced lightly when the magic horn at last resounds he said how strange a flight it will be these thorny briers encroach ever nearer on my palace walls i am a captive ever less at ease summer by summer the sun rises shorn yet closer of his beams and now the lingering transit of the moon is but from one wood by a narrow crystal arch to another they will have me yet sir how weary will the sleepy ones be of my uneasy footfall  and even as safte slipped softly back to his watching mate the patter and shrill menace of voices behind him hinted not all was concord between these hidden multitudes and their unseemly prince  the masterstars shone earlier here already sparkling above the tower was a canopy of clearest darkness spread while the leafy fringes of the sky glowed yet with changing fires  we returned to the lawns before the palace porch and with his lantern in his hand the prince signed to me to go in i was not a little curious to view that enchanted household of which i had read so often and with so much delight as a child  in the banquetinghall only the matted windows were visible in the lofty walls prince ennui held his lantern on high and by its flame and the faint light that flowed in from above i could presently see distinct in gloom as many sleepers as even night could desire  here they reclined just as sorcerous sleep had overtaken them but how dimmed how fallen for time that could not change the sleeper had changed with quiet skill all else tarnished dusty withered overtaken yellowed and confounded lay banquet and clothofgold flagon cup fine linen table and stool but in all the ruin like buds of springtime in a bare wood or jewels in ashes slumbered youth and beauty and bravery and delight  i lifted my eyes to the king the gold of his divinity was fallen his splendour quenched but lifes dark scrutiny from his face was gone he made no stir at our light slumbered untreasoned on the lids of his queen were lightlier sealed only withheld beauty as a cloud the sky it hides his courtiers flattered more elusively being sincerely mute and only a little red dust was all the wine left  i seemed to hear their laughter clearer now that the jest was forgotten and to admire better the pomp and the mirth and the grace and the vanity now that time had so far travelled from this little tumult once their triumph  in a kind of furtive bravado i paced the length of the long thronged tables here sat a little prince that captivated me dipping his fingers into his cup with a sidelong glance at his mother there a high officer i know not how magnificent and urgent when awake slumbered with eyes wide open above his discouraged moustaches  simply for vanity of being awake in such a sleepy company i strutted conceitedly to and fro i bent deftly and pilfered a little cockled cherry from between the very fingertips of her whose heart was doubtless like itsquite hard and the bright lips never said a word i sat down rather clownishly i felt beside an aged and simpering chancellor that once had seemed wise but now seemed innocent nibbling a biscuit crisp as scandal for after all the horn would sound childhood had been quite sure of thatneeded not even the authors testimony they were alert to rise scattering all dust victors over time and outrageous fortune  almost with a cry of apprehension i perceived again the solitary prince but he merely smiled faintly you see sir he said how weary must a guardianship be of them who never tire the snow falls and the bright light falls on all these faces yet not even my lady melancholy stirs a dark lid and all these dogdays he glanced at his motionless hounds they raised languidly their narrow heads whimpering softly as if beseeching of their master that longdelayed supperhaplessly me no no sirs said the prince as if he had read their desire as easily as he whom it so much concerned guard guard and hearken this gentleman is not the prince we await sallow not the prince safte and now sirhe turned again to methere is yet one other sleepershe who hath brought so much quietude on a festive house  we climbed the staircase where dim light lay so invitingly and came presently to a little darker chamber green blunt things had pushed and burst through the casement the air smelled faintlysour of brier and was as still as boughs of snow there the notunhappy princess reclined before a lookingglass whither i suppose she had run to view her own alarm when the sharp needle pierced her thumb all alarm was stilled now on her face she one might think of all that company of the sleepy was the only one that dreamed her youthful lips lay a little asunder the heavy beauty of her hair was parted on her forehead her childish hands sidled together like leverets in her lap why i cried aloud almost involuntarily she breathes  and at sound of my voice the hounds leapt back and on a travellers oath i verily believe once and how swiftly and how fearfully and brightly those childish lids unsealed their light as of lilac that lay behind glanced briefly fleetingly on one who had ventured so far and fell again to rest  and when i cried harshly when will that laggard burst through this agelong silence heres dust enough for all to see and all this ruin this inhospitable peace  prince ennui glanced strangely at me  i assure you o suddenly enkindled he said in his suave monotonous voice it is not for my indifference he does not come i would willingly sleep thesemy dear sister all these old fineries and lovejinglers would as fain wake he turned away his treacherous eyes from me maybe the lorelei hath snared him he said smiling  i relished not at all the thought of sleeping in this mansion of sleep yet it seemed politic to refrain from giving offence to fangs apparently so eager to take it accordingly i followed this ennui to a loftier chamber yet that he suggested for me  once there however and his soft footfall passed away i looked about me first to find a means for keeping trespassers from coming in and next to find a means for getting myself out  it was a long and arduous but not a perilous descent from the window by the thickgrown greenery that cumbered the walls but i determined to wait awhile before venturingwait too till i could see plainly where rosinante had made her nightquarters by good fortune i discovered her beneath the greenish moon that hung amid mist above the forest stretching a disconsolate neck at the waterside as if in search of the lorelei  when as it seemed to me it must be nearing dawn though how the hours flitted so swiftly passed my comprehension i very cautiously climbed out of my narrow window and descended slowly to the lawns beneath my foot had scarcely touched ground when ringing and menacing from some dark gallery of the palace above me broke out a distant baying  nothing shall persuade me to tell how fast i ran how feverishly i haled poor rosinante out of sleep and pushed her down into the deeps of that coalblack stream with what agility i clambered into the saddle  yet i could not help commiserating the while the faithful soul who floated beneath me the stream was swift but noiseless the water rather rare than cold yet despite all the philosophy beaming out of her maidenly eyes across the smooth surface of the tide rosinante must have preferred from the bottom of her heart dry land  i too momentarily when i discovered that we were speedily approaching the roaring fall whose reverberations i had heard long since  out of the emerald twilight we floated from beneath the overarching thickets pale beams were striking from the risen sun upon the gliding surface and dwelt in splendour where danger sat charioted beneath a palely gorgeous bow yet i doubt if ever mortal man swept on to defeat at last so rapturously as i  the gloomier trees had now withdrawn from the banks of the river a pale morning sky overcanopied the shimmering forests here rose the solitary tower where echo tarried for the hornblower and straight before us across that level floor beyond a tremulous cloud of foam and light and colour lurked the unseen the unimaginable the everdreamedof death  heedless of lorelei heedless of all save the beauty and terror and glory in which they rode down swept snorting ship and master to doom  the crystal water jargoned past my saddle sky earth and tower like the panorama of a dream wheeled around me light blinded me clamour deafened me foam and the pure wave and cold darkness whelmed over me we surged paused gazed nodded crashedand so an end to ennui     vii      he loves to talk with marineres     that come from a far countree      samuel taylor coleridge   how long my body was the sport of that foaming water i cannot tell but when i again opened my eyes i found first that the sun was shining dazzling clear high above me and next that the delightful noise of running water babbled close against my ear i lay upon a strip of warm sward by the rivers brink near by me grew some ranksmelling waterside plant and overhead the air seemed peopled with larks  i crawled confused and aching to the water and dipped my head and hands into the cold rills this soon refreshed me for the sun had it would seem long been dwelling on that passive corse of mine by the waterside and had parched it to the skin  but it was some little while yet before my mind returned fully to what had passed and so to my loss  i sat looking at the grey noisy water almost incredulous that rosinante could be gone it might be that the same hand as must have drawn myself from drowning had snatched her bridle also out of fates grasp perhaps even now she was seeking her master by the greener pasture of the wide plains around me perhaps the faroff sea was her green sepulchre but many waters cannot quench love i faced friendless and discomfited a region as strange to me as the farther side of the moon  without more ado i rose shook myself and sadly began to go forward but i had taken only a few steps along the banks of the streamfor here was fresh water at leastwhen a sound like distant thunder rolled over these flat green lands towards me increasing steadily in volume  i stood lost in wonder and presently at the distance perhaps of a little less than a mile descried an innumerable herd of horses streaming across these level pastures and at the extremity it seemed of a wide ellipse that had brought them near and now was galloping them away  my heart beat a little faster at this extraordinary spectacle and while i stood in uncertainty gazing after the retreating concourse i perceived a figure running towards me lifting his hands and crying out in a voice sonorous and inhuman he was of a stature much above my own yet so gross in shape and immense of head he seemed at first almost dwarfish he came to a stand twenty paces or so from me on the ridge of a gentle inclination and gazed down on me with wild bright eyes even at this distance i could perceive the almost colourless lustre of his eyes beneath his thick locks of yellow hair when he had taken his fill of me he lifted his head again and cried out to me a few words of what certainly might be english but was neither intelligible nor reassuring  i stood my ground and stared him in the face till i could see nothing but windblown yellow and strange brutal eyes then he advanced a little nearer whereupon i also raised my hand with a gesture like his own and demanded loudly where i was what was this place and who was he his very ears pricked forward he listened so intently he came nearer yet then stayed tossed his head into the air whirled the long leather thong he carried above his head and signing to me to follow set off with so swift and easy a stride as would soon have carried him out of sight had he not turned and perceived how slowly i could follow him  he slackened his pace then and thus running we came in sight at length of what appeared to be a vast wooden shed or barn with one rude chimney and surrounded by a thick fence or stockade many feet high and apparently of immense strength and stability  in the gateway of this fence stood the master of these solitudes his eyes fixed strangely on my coming with an intense i had almost said incredulous interest nor did he cease so to regard me while the creature that had conducted me thither told i suppose where he had found me and poured out with childish zeal his own amazement and delight by this time too his voice had begun to lose its first strangeness and to take a meaning for me and i was presently fully persuaded he spoke a kind of english and that not unpleasingly with a liquid shrill voluminous ease his master listened patiently awhile but at last bade his servant be silent and himself addressed me  i am informed yahoo he said with peculiar deliberation that you have been borne down into my meadows by the river and fetched out thence by my servant be aware then that all these lands from horizon to horizon are mine and my peoples i desire no tidings of what follies may be beyond my boundaries no aid and no amity i admit no trespasser here and will bear with none it appears however that your life has passed beyond your own keeping i may not therefore refuse you shelter and food and to have you conducted in safety beyond my borders have the courtesy then to keep within shelter of these walls till the night be over elsehe gazed out across the verdant undulationselse yahoo i have no power to protect you  he turned once more and regarded me with a lofty yet tender recognition as if little though his speech might profess it he very keenly desired my safety  he then stepped aside and bade me rather sharply enter the gate before him i tried to show none of the mistrust i felt at passing out of these open lands into this repellent yard i glanced at the shockhaired creature alert halfhuman beside me across the limitless savannah around me echoing yet it seemed with the rumour of innumerable hoofs and bowing as it were to odds i went in  on the other hand i felt my host had been frank with me if this was indeed the same lemuel gulliver whose repute my infancy had prized so well i need have no fear of blood and treachery at his hands however primitive and disgusting his household or distorted his intellect might be he who had proved no tyrant in lilliput nor quailed before the enormities of brobdingnag might abhor the sight of me he would not play me false  his servant or whatsoever else he might be i considered not quite so calmly yet even in his broad countenance dwelt a something like bright honesty less malice than simplicity  wherefore i say i ordered down my cowardice and looking both of them as squarely in the face as i knew how passed out of the open into the appalling yard of this wooden house  i say appalling but without much reason perhaps it was the unseemly hugeness of its balks the foul piles of skins the mounds of refuse that lay about within perhaps the allpervading beastly stench the bareness and filthiness under so glassyclear and fierce a sun that revolted me all mans seemliness and affection for the natural things of earth were absent here was only a brutal and bald order as of an intelligence like that of the yellowlocked swiftfooted creature behind me perhaps also it was the mere unfamiliarity of much i saw there that estranged me all lay in neglect cracked and marred with rough usagecoarse strands of a kind of rope strips of hide gaping tubs a huge and rusty brazier and in one corner a great cage many feet square and surmounted with an iron ring  i know not i almost desired sallow at my side and would to heaven rosinantes nose lay in my palm  within the house a woodfire burned in the sun its smoke ascending to the roof and flowing thence through a rude chimney a pot steamed over the fire burdening the air with a savour at first somewhat faint and disgustingperhaps because it was merely strange to me the walls of this lofty room were of rough substantial timber bare and weatherproof the floor was of the colour of earth seemingly earth itself a few rude stools a bench and a fourlegged table stood beside the unshuttered window and from this stretched the beauteous green of the grassland or prairie beyond the stockade  the house then was built on the summit of a gentle mound and doubtless commanded from its upper window the extreme reaches of this sea of verdure  i sat down where mr gulliver directed me and was not displeased with the warmth of the fire despite the sun i was cold after that long watery lullaby and cold too with exhaustion after running so far at the heels of the creature who had found me and i dwelt in a kind of dream on the transparent flames and watched vacantly the seething pot and smelt till slowly appetite returned the smoke of the stuff that bubbled beneath its lid  mr gulliver himself brought me my platter of this pottage and though it tasted of nothing in my experiencea kind of sweet cloying meati was so tired of the fruits to which enterprise had as yet condemned me i ate of it hungrily and heartily yet not so fast as that the young gulliver had not finished his before me and sat at length watching every mouthful i took from beneath his sunenticing thatch of hair ever and again he would toss up his chin with a shrill guffaw or stoop his head till his eyeballs were almost hidden beneath their thick lashes so regarding me for minutes together with a delightful simulation of intelligence yet with that peculiar wistful affection his master had himself exhibited at first sight of me  but when our meal was done mr gulliver ordered him about his business without a murmur with one last long brotherly glance at me he withdrew and presently after i heard from afar his high melancholy cooee and the crack of his thong in the afternoon air as he hastened out to his charges  my companion did not stir only the flames waved silently along the logs the beam of sunlight drew across the floor the crisp air of the pasture flowed through the window what wonder then that sitting on my stool i fell asleep     viii      if i see all yere nine to ane      old ballad   i was awoke by a sustained sound as of an orator speaking in an unknown tongue and found myself in a sunnyshadowy loft whither i suppose i must have been carried in my sleep in a delicious languor between sleeping and waking i listened with imperturbable curiosity awhile to that voice of the unknown indeed i was dozing again when a different sound enormous protracted abruptly aroused me i got up hot and trembling not yet quite my own master to discover its cause  through a narrow slit between the timbers i could view the country beneath me far and wide i saw near at hand the cumbrous gate of the stockade ajar and at a little distance on the farther side mr gulliver and his halfhuman servant standing in front of them was an empty spacea narrow semicircle of which gulliver was the centre and beyondwildeyed dishevelled stretching their necks as if to see inclining their heads as if to hearken ranging in multitude almost to the skys vergestood assembled it seemed to me all the horses of the universe  even in my first sensation of fear admiration irresistibly stirred the superb freedom of their unbridled heads the sunnurtured arrogance of their eyes the tumultuous sealike tossing of crest and tail their keenness and ardour and might and also in simple truth their numbershow could one marvel if this solitary fanatic dreamed they heard him and understood  unarmed bareheaded he faced the brutal discontent of his people words i could not distinguish but there was little chance of misapprehending the haughty anguish with which he threatened pleaded cajoled clear and unfaltering his voice rose and fell he dealt out fearlessly foolishly to that longsnouted littlebrained wildeyed multitude reason beyond their instinct persuasion beyond their savagery love beyond their heed  but even while i listened one thing i knew those sleek malcontents heard toothe spirit of man in that small voice of hisperplexed perhaps and perverted and out of tether but none the less unconquerable and sublime  what less thought i than power unearthly could long maintain that stern impassable barrier of green vacancy between their hoofs and him and i suppose for the very reason that these were beasts of a longsharpened sagacity wildhearted rebellious yet not the slaves of impulse he yet kept himself their king who was in fact their captive  houyhnhnms i heard him cry pahyahoos his voice fell he stood confronting in silence that vast circumference of restless beauty and again broke out inhuman inarticulate immeasurable revolt far across over the tossing host rearing leaping craning dishevelled heads went pealing and eddying that hostile brutal voice  gulliver lifted his hand and a tempestuous silence fell once more yahoos yahoos he bawled again then he turned and passed back into his hideous garden the gate was barred and bolted behind him  thus loosed and unrestrained surged as if the wind drove them that concourse upon the stockade heavy though its timbers were they seemed to stoop at the impact a kind of fury rose in me i lusted to go down and face the mutiny of the brutes bit and saddle and scourge into obedience mans serfs of the centuries i watched on fire the flame of the declining sun upon those sleek vehement creatures of the dust and then i know not by what subtle irony my zeal turned backturned back and faded away into simple longing for my lost friend my peaceful beastofevening rosinante i sat down again in the litter of my bed and earnestly wished myself home wished indeed if i must confess it for the familiar face of my aunt sophia my books my bed if these were this lands horses i thought what men might here be met the unsavouriness the solitude the neighing and tumult and prancing induced in me nothing but dulness at last and disgust  but at length dismissing all such folly at least from my face i lifted the trapdoor and descended the steep ladder into the room beneath  mr gulliver sat where i had left him defeat stared from his eyes lines of insane thought disfigured his face yet he sat stubborn and upright heedless of the uproar heedless even that the late beams of the sun had found him out in his last desolation so i too sat down without speech and waited till he should come up out of his gloom and find a friend in a stranger  but day waned the sunlight went out of the great wooden room the tumult diminished and finally silence and evening shadow descended on the beleaguered house and i was looking out of the darkened window at a star that had risen and stood shining in the sky when i was startled by a voice so low and so different from any i had yet heard that i turned to convince myself it was indeed mr gullivers  and the people of the yahoos traveller he said do they still lie and flatter and bribe and spill blood and lust and covet are there yet in the country whence you come the breadless bellies the sores and rags and lamentations of the poor ay yahoo and do vicious men rule and attain riches and impious women pomp and flatteryhypocrites pandars envious treacherous proud he stared with desolate sorrow and wrath into my eyes  words in disorder flocked to my tongue i grew hot and eager yet by some instinct held my peace the fluttering of the dying flames the starry darkness silence itself what were we who sat together transient shadows both phantom unfathomable mysterious as these  i fancied he might speak again once he started raised his arm and cried out as if acting again in dream some frenzy of the past and once he wheeled on me extraordinary eyes as if he halfrecognised some idol of the irrevocable in my face these were momentary however gloom returned to his forehead vacancy to his eyes  i heard the outer gate flung open and a light strange footfall so we seated ourselves all three for a while round the smouldering fire mr gullivers servant scarcely took his eyes from my face and a little to my confusion his first astonishment of me had now passed away and in its stead had fallen such a gentleness and humour as i should not have supposed possible in his wild countenance he busied himself over his strips of skin but if he caught my eye upon his own he would smile out broadly and nod his great hairy head at me till i fancied myself a child again and he some vast sweetheart of my nurse  when we had supped sitting together in the great room i climbed the ladder into the loft and was soon fast asleep but from dreams distracted with confusion i awoke at the first shafts of dawn i stood beside the narrow window in the wall of the loft and watched the distant river change to silver the bright green of the grass appear  this seemed a place of few and timorous birds and of fewer trees but all across the dews of the grasses lay a tinge of powdered gold as if yellow flowers were blooming in abundance there i saw no horses no sign of life heard no sound but the cadent wail of the ashgrey birds in their flights and when i turned my eyes nearer home and compared the distant beauty of the forests and their radiant clouds with the nakedness and desolation here i gave up looking from the window with a determination to be gone as soon as possible from a country so uncongenial  moreover mr gulliver it appeared had returned during the night to his first mistrust of my company he made no sign he saw me and left his uncouth servant to attend on me for him indeed i began to feel a kind of affection springing up he seemed so eager to befriend me and whose is the heart quite hardened against a simple admiration i rose very gladly when after having stuffed a wallet with food he signed to me to follow him i turned to mr gulliver and held out my hand  i wish sir i might induce you to accompany me i said some day we would win our way back to the country we have abandoned i have known and loved your name sir since first i browsed on picturesbeing measured for your first coat in lilliput by the little tailorsstraddling the pinnacled city ay sir and when the farmers picked you up twixt finger and thumb from among their cornstalks  i had talked on in hope to see his face relax but he made no sign he saw or heard me i very speedily dropped my hand and went out but when my guide and i had advanced about thirty yards from the stockade i cast a glance over my shoulder towards the house that had given me shelter it rose sadcoloured and solitary between the green and blue but if it was not fancy mr gulliver stood looking down on me from the very window whence i had looked down on him and there i do not doubt he stayed till his fellowyahoo had passed across his inhospitable lands out of his sight for ever  i was glad to be gone and did not at first realise that the least danger lay before us but soon observing the extraordinary vigilance and caution my companion showed i began to watch and hearken too evidently our departure had not passed unseen far away to left and to right of us i descried at whiles now a few now many swiftmoving shapes but whether they were advancing with us or gathering behind us in hope to catch their tyrant alone and unaware i could not properly distinguish  once for a cause not apparent to me my guide raised himself to his full height and thrusting back his head uttered a most piercing cry after that however we saw no more for a while of the beasts that haunted our journey  all morning till the sun was high and the air athrob with heat and stretched like a great fiddlestring to a continuous shrill vibration we went steadily forward and when at last i was faint with heat and thirst my companion lifted me up like a child on to his back and set off again at his great easy stride it was useless to protest i merely buried my hands in his yellow hair to keep my balance in such a camellike motion  a little after noon we stayed to rest by a shallow brook beneath a cluster of trees scented though not in blossom like an english hawthorn there we ate our meal or rather i ate and my companion watched running out ever and again for a wider survey and returning to me like a faithful dog to shout snatches of his inconceivable language at me  sometimes i seemed to catch his meaning bidding me take courage have no fear he would protect me and once he shaded his eyes and pointed afar with extreme perturbation whining or murmuring while he stared  again we set off from beneath the sweetscented shade and now no doubt remained that i was the object of very hostile evolutions sometimes these smoothhooved battalions would advance cloudlike to within fifty yards of us and snorting ruffle their manes and wheel swiftly away only once more in turn to advance and stand with heads exalted gazing wildly on us till we were passed on a little but my guide gave them very little heed did they pause a moment too long in our path or gallop down on us but a stretch or two beyond the limit his instinct had set for my safety he whirled his thong above his head and his yell resounded and like a shadow upon wheat the furious companies melted away  evidently these were not the foes he looked for but a subtler a more indomitable it was at last i conjectured at scent or sight or rumour of these that he suddenly swept me on to his shoulders again and with a great sneeze or bellow leapt off at a speed he had as yet given me no hint of  looking back as best i could i began to discern somewhat to the left of us a numerous herd in pursuit sorrel in colour and of a more magnificent aspect than those forming the other bands it was obvious too despite their plunging and rearing that they were gaining on usdrew indeed so near at last that i could count the foremost of them and mark not quite callously their power and fleetness and symmetry even the suns gold upon their reddish skins  then in a flash my captor set me down toppled me over in plain words into the thick herbage and turning rushed bellowing undeviating towards their leaders till it seemed he must inevitably be borne down beneath their brute weight and sofarewell to summer but almost at the impact the baffled creatures reared neighing fearfully in consort and at the gibberish hurled back on them by their flamedeyed master broke in rout and fled  whereupon unpausing he ran back to me only just in time to rescue me from the nearer thunder yet of those who had seized the very acme of their opportunity to beat out my brains  it was a long and arduous and unequal contest i wished very heartily i could bear a rather less passive part but this fearless creature scarcely heeded me used me like a helpless child half tenderly half roughly displaying ever and again over his shoulder only a fleeting glance of the shallow glories of his eyes as if to reassure me of his power and my safety  but the latter those distant savannahs will bear witness seemed forlorn enough my eyes swam with weariness of these crested earthdisdaining battalions i sickened of the heat of the sun the incessant sidelong jolting the amazing green but on we went fleet and stubborn into everthickening danger how feeble a quarry amid so many hunters  two things grew clearer to me each instant first that every movement and feint of our pursuers was of design not a beast that wheeled but wheeled to purpose while the main body never swerved thundered superbly on toward the inevitable end and next i perceived with even keener assurance that my guide knew his country and his enemy and his own power and aim as perfectly and consummately knew toothis was the end  far distant in front of us there appeared to be a break in the level green a fringe of bushes rougher ground for this refuge he was making and from this our mutinous houyhnhnms meant to keep us  there was no pausing now not a glance behind his every effort was bent on speed speed indeed it was the wind roared in my ears yet above its surge i heard the neighing and squealing the everapproaching shudder of hoofs my eyes distorted all they looked on i seemed now floating twenty feet in air now skimming within touch of ground now that sorrel squadron behind me swelled and nodded now dwindled to an extreme minuteness of motion  then of a sudden a last shrill paean rose high the hosts of our pursuers paused billowlike reared and scatteredmy poor yahoo leapt clear  for an instant once again in this wild journey i was poised as it were in space then fell with a crash still clutched sure and whole to the broad shoulders of my rescuer  when my first confusion had passed away i found that i was lying in a dense green glen at the foot of a cliff for some moments i could think of nothing but my extraordinary escape from destruction within reach of my hand lay the creature who had carried me huddled and motionless and to left and to right of me and one a little nearer the base of the cliff five of those sorrel horses that had been chief of our pursuers one only of them was alive and he also broken and unable to riseunable to do else than watch with fierce untamed glazing eyes a bloody froth at his muzzle every movement and sign of life i made  i myself though bruised and bleeding had received no serious injury but my yahoo would rise no more his master was left alone amidst his people i stooped over him and bathed his brow and cheeks with the water that trickled from the cliffs close at hand i pushed back the thick strands of matted yellow hair from his eyes he made no sign even while i watched him the life of the poor beast near at hand welled away he whinnied softly and dropped his head upon the bracken i was alone in the unbroken silence  it seemed a graceless thing to leave the carcasses of these brave creatures uncovered there so i stripped off branches of the trees and gathered bundles of fern and bracken with which to conceal awhile their bones from wolf and fowl and him whom i had begun to love i covered last desiring he might but return if only for a moment to bid me his strange farewell  this done i pushed through the undergrowth from the foot of the sunny cliffs and after wandering in the woods came late in the afternoon tired out to a ruinous hut here i rested refreshing myself with the unripe berries that grew near by  i remained quite still in this mouldering hut looking out on the glens where fell the sunlight some homely bird warbled endlessly on in her retreat lifted her small voice till every hollow resounded with her content silvery butterflies wavered across the suns pale beams sipped and flew in wreaths away the infinite hordes of the dust raised their universal voice till listening it seemed to me their tiny babel was after all my own old faroff english sweet of the husk  fate leads a man through danger to his delight me she had led among woods nameless though many of the cups and stars and odours of the flowers were to me unfamiliar the little shapes that gamboled in fur and feather before my face here dwelt mummy of all earths summers some old ghost of me sipper of sap coucher in moss quieter than dust  so sitting so rhapsodising i began to hear presently another soundthe rich juicy munchmunch of jaws a little blunted maybe which yet it seemed could never cry enough to these sweet succulent grasses i made no sign waited with eyes towards the sound and pulses beating as if for a sweetheart and soon placid unsurprised at her extreme ease loomed into sight who but my oxheaded rosinante in these dells cropping her delightful way along in search of her drowned master  i could but whistle and receive the slow soft scrutiny of her familiar eyes i fancied even her bland face smiled as might elderliness on youth she climbed near with bridle broken and trailing thrust out her nose to me and so was mine again  sunlight left the woods wind passed through the upper branches so with rain in the air i went forward once more not quite so headily perhaps yet i hope with undiminished courage like all earths travellers before me who have deemed truth potent as modesty and themselves worth scanning print after     ix      a  shop of rarities      george herbert   a little before darkness fell we struck into a narrow road traversing the wood this though apparently not much frequented would at least lead me into lands inhabited so turning my face to the west that i might have light to survey as long as any gleamed in the sky i trudged on but i went slow enough rosinante was lame i like a stranger to my body it was so bruised and tumbled  the night was black and a thin rain falling when at last i emerged from the interminable maze of lanes into which the woodroad had led me and glad i was to descry what seemed by the many lights shining from its windows to be a populous village a gay village also for song came wafted on the night air rustic and convivial  hereabouts i overtook a figure on foot who when i addressed him turned on me as sharply as if he supposed the elms above him were thick with robbers or that mine was a voice out of the unearthly hailing him  i asked him the name of the village we were approaching with small dark eyes searching my face in the black shadow of night he answered in a voice so strange and guttural that i failed to understand a word he shook his fingers in the air pointed with the cudgel he carried under his arm now to the gloom behind us now to the homely galaxy before us and gabbled on so fast and so earnestly that i began to suppose he was a little crazed  one word however i caught at last from all this jargon and that often repeated with a little bow to me and an uneasy smile on his white facemishrush mishrush but whether by this he meant to convey to me his habitual mood or his own name i did not learn till afterwards i stopped in the heavy road and raised my hand  an inn i cried in his ear i want lodging suppera tavern an inn as if addressing a child or a natural  he began gesticulating again evidently vain of having fully understood me indeed he twisted his little head upon his shoulders to observe rosinante gauntly labouring on ameame he cried with a great effort  i nodded  ah he cried piteously  he led me after a few minutes journey into the cobbled yard of a brightpainted inn on whose signboard a rising sun glimmered faintly gold and these letters standing close above itthe worlds end  mr mishrush seemed not a little relieved at nearing company after his lonely walk triumphant too at having guided me hither so cunningly he lifted his nimble cudgel in the air and waved it conceitedly to and fro in time to the song that rose beyond the window fauow er wurfauow er wur he cried delightedly again and again in my ear eager apparently for my approval so we stood then beneath the starless sky listening to the rich choragium of the worlds end they sang in unison sang with a kind of forlorn heat and enthusiasm and when the song was ended and the roar of applause over night like a darkened water whelmed silently in engulfed it to the echo      follow the world       she bursts the grape     and dandles man       in her green lap     she moulds her creature       from the clay     and crumbles him       to dust away         follow the world      one draught one feast       one wench one tomb     and thou must straight       to ashes come     drink eat and sleep       why fret and pine     death can but snatch       what neer was thine         follow the world  it died away i say and an ostler softly appeared out of the shadow into his charge then i surrendered rosinante and followed my inarticulate acquaintance into the noise and heat and lustre of the inn  it was a numerous company there assembled but their voices fell to a man on the entry of a stranger they scrutinised me not uncivilly but closely seeking my badge as it were by which to recognise and judge me ever after  mr mistrust as i presently discovered my guides name indeed to be was volubly explaining how i came into his company they listened intently to what so far as i could gather might be houyhnhnmish or doubledutch and then as if to show me to my place forthwith a great fleshy fellow that sat close beside the hearth this summer evening continued in a loud voice the conversation i had interrupted  whereupon mr mistrust with no little confidence commended me in dumb show to the landlady of the inn a mrs nature if i understood him aright this person was still comely though of uncertain age wore cherry ribbons smiled rather vacantly from vague wonderful indescribable eyes that seemed to change colour like the chameleon according to that they dwelt on  i am afraid as much to my amusement as wonder i discovered that this landlady of so much apparent bonhomie was a deafmute if victuals or drink or bed were required one must chalk it down on a little slate she carried at her girdle for the purpose indeed the absence of two of her three chief senses had marvellously sharpened the remaining one her eyes were on all vaguely dwelling lightly gone inscrutable strangely fascinating she moved easily and soundlessly as fat women may and i doubt if ever mug or pot of any of that talkative throng remained long empty except at the tipplers reiterated request  she laid before me an excellent supper on a little table somewhat removed beside a curtained window and while i ate i watched and listened not at all displeased with my entertainment  the room in which we sat was lowceiled and cheerful but rather close after the rainy nightair gay pictures beautified the walls here a bottle a cheese grapes a hare a gobletin a clear brown light that made the guests mouth water to admire here a fine gentleman toasting a simpering chambermaid above the chimneypiece a bloated old man in vineleaves that might be silenus and over against the door of the parlour what i took to be a picture of potiphars wife she looked out of the paint so bold and beauteous and craftily birds and fishes in cases stared glassilyowl and kestrel jack and eel and gudgeon all was clean and comfortable as a hospitable inn can be  but they who frequented it interested me much moreas various and animated a gathering as any i have seen yet in some peculiar manner they seemed one and all not to the last tittle quite of this world they were so to speak more earthy too definite too true to the mould like figures in a bleak bright light viewed out of darkness certainly not one of them was at first blush prepossessing yet who finds much amiss with the fox at last though all he seems to have be cunning  near beside me however sat retired a man a little younger and more at his ease than most of the many there and as busy with his eyes and ears as i his name i learned presently was reverie and from him i gathered not a little information regarding the persons who talked and sipped around us  he told me at whiles that his house was not in the village but in a valley some few miles distant across the meadows that he sat out these bouts of argument and slander for the sheer delight he had in gathering the myriad strands of that strange rope opinion that he lived heart soul and hope wellnigh alone that he deeply mistrusted this place and the company we were in yet not for its mistresss sake who was at least faithful to her instincts candid to the candid made no favourites and eventually compelled order he told me also that if friends he had he deemed it wiser not to name them since the least sibilant of the sound of the voice incites to treachery and in conclusion that of all men he was acquainted with one at least never failed to right his humour and that one was yonder flabby pallid fellow with the velvet collar to his coat and the rings on his fingers and the gold hair named pliable who sat beside mr stubborn on the settle by the fire  when then i had finished my supper i drew in my chair a little closer to mr reveries and having scribbled my wants on the landladys slate turned my attention to the talk  at the moment when i first began to listen attentively they seemed to be in heated dispute concerning the personal property of a certain mr christian who was either dead or had inexplicably disappeared mr obstinate i gathered had taken as his right this christians easychair a gentleman named smoothman most of his other goods for a debt while a parson decorum had appropriated as heretical his books and various peculiar mss  but there now remained in question a trifling sum of money which a mr liar loudly demanded in payment of an affair of honour this however he seemed little likely to obtain seeing that an elderly uncle by marriage of christians whose name was office was as eager and affable and frank about the sum as he was bent on keeping it and rattled the contents of his breeches pocket in sheer bravado of his means to go to law for it  he left a bare pittance the merest pittance he said what could there be of any account christian despised money professed to despise it that alone would prove my wretched nephew queer in the headdespised money  tush friend cried obstinate from his corner whether the money is yours or neighbour liarsand it is as likely as not neithersthat talk about despising moneys what but a silly lie twas all sour grapessour grapes he had cunning enough for envy and pride enough for shame and at last there was naught but cunning left wherewith to patch up a clout for him and his shame to be gone in i watched him set out on his pestilent pilgrimage crazed and stubborn and not a groat to call his own  yet i have heard say he came of a moneyed stock said pliable the sects of privy opinion were rare wealthy people and they so tis said were his kinsmen truth is for aught i know christian must have been in some degree a very liberal rascal with all his faults he tittered  oh he was liberal enough said mr malice suavely why even on setting out he emptied his wifes purse into a blind beggars hathis that used to bleat cast thy breadcast thy bread upon the waters whensoever he spied christian stepping along the street they say he added burying his clever face in his mug the heavenly jerusalem lieth down by the weir  but we must not contemn a man for his poverty neighbours said liar gravely composing his hairless face christians was a character of beautiful simplicitybeautiful how many rickety children did he leave behind him  a shrill voice called somewhat i could not quite distinguish for at that moment a youth rose abruptly near by and went hastily out  obstinate stared roundly thou hast a piercing voice friend liar  i did but seek the truth said liar  but whether or no christian believed in itverily he seemed to believe in it was it not so neighbour obstinate enquired pliable stroking his leg  believed in what my friend said obstinate in a dull voice  about mount zion and the crowns of glory and the harps of gold and such like said pliable uneasilyat least it is said so so tis said  believed retorted a smooth young man who seemed to feel the heat and sat by the staircase door thats an easy taskto believe sir ask any pretty minikin  and id make bold to enquire of yonder liveloose said a thick monotonous voice a mr dulls so reverie informed me if mebbe he be referring to one of his own or that fellow sloths devilish fairy tales i know one yet hell eat again some day  at which remark all laughed consumedly save dull  well one thing christian had and none can deny it said pliable a little hotly and that was imagination i shant forget the tales he was wont to tell what say you superstition  mr superstition lifted dark rather vacant eyes on pliable yes yes he said flame and sigh and lamentation my god my god gentlemen  ooay ooay yelped the voice of mistrust startled out of silence  ooay whistled malice under his breath  tush tush broke in obstinate again and snapped his fingers in the air and what is this precious imagination whither doth it conduct a man but to beggary infamy and the madhouse look ye to it friend pliable tis a devouring flame give it but wind and leisure the fairest house is ashes  ashes ashes mocked one called cruelty who had more than once taken my attention with his peculiar contortionstalking of ashes what of lovethelog faithful master tonguestump what of lovethelog faithful  at which liveloose was so extremely amused the tears stood in his eyes for laughing  i looked round for mistrust and easily recognised my friend by his harelike face and the rage in his little active eyes but unfortunately as i turned to enquire somewhat of reverie liveloose suddenly paused in his merriment with open mouth and the whole company heard my question but who was lovethelog faithful  i was at once again the centre of attention and mr obstinate rose very laboriously from his settle and held out a great hand to me  im pleased to meet thee he said with a heavy bow theres a dear heart with my good neighbour superstition yonder who will present a very fair account of that misguided young man madam wanton heres a young gentleman that never heard tell of our old friend lovethelog  a shrill peal of laughter greeted this sally  why faithful was a young gentleman sir explained the woman civilly enough who preferred his supper hot  oh madam wanton my dear my dear cried a longnosed woman nearly helpless with amusement  i saw superstition gazing darkly at me he shook his head as i was about to reply so i changed my retort who then was mr christian i enquired simply  at that the house shook with the roar of laughter that went up     x       large draughts of intellectual day      richard crashaw   believe me neighbours said malice softly when this uproar was a little abated there is nought so strange in the question it meaneth only that this young gentleman hath not enjoyed the pleasure of your company before will it amaze you to learn my friends that christian is like to be immortal only because you talk him out of the grave one brief epitaph gentlemen would let him rot  nay but ill tell the gentleman who christian was and with pleasure cried a lucid rather sallow little man that had sat quietly smiling and listening my name let me tell you is atheist sir and christian was formerly a very near neighbour of an old friend of my familysmr sceptic they lived sirat least in those daysopposite to one another  he is a great talker whispered reverie in my ear but the company evidently found his talk to their taste they sat as still and attentive around him as though before an extemporary preacher  well sir continued atheist being in a sense neighbours christian in his youth would often confide in my friend though assuredly sceptic never sought his confidences and it seemeth he began to be perturbed and troubled over the discovery that it is impossibleat least in this plain worldto eat your cake yet have it and by some ill chance he happened at this time on a mouldy old folio in my friends house that had been the property of his maternal grandmotherthe subtlest old tome you ever set eyes on though somewhat too dark and extravagant and heady for a sober man of the world like me twas called the bible sira collection of legends and fables of all times tongues and countries threaded together mighty ingeniously i grant and in as plausible a style as any i know if a little lax and flowery in parts  well christian borroweth the book of my friendnever to return it and being feeble and credulous partly by reason of his simple wits and partly by reason of the sad condition a froward youth had reduced him to he accepts the whole bookfrom apple to vialsfor truth in fact he ate the little book as one of the legendary kings it celebrates had done before him  ay broke in cruelty wildly and has ever since gotten the gripes  atheist inclined his head putting it coarsely gentlemen such was the case he said and away at his wits end he hasteneth waning and shivering to a great bog or quagmirethat my friend pliable will answer toand plungeth in tis the same story repeated he could be temperate in nought i knew the bog well but i knew the steppingstones better believe me i have traversed the narrow way this same christian took seeking the harps and pearls and the elixir vitæ these many years past the book inciteth ye to it it sets a mans heart on firethats weak enough to read itwith its pomp and rhetoric and faraway promises and lofty counsels oh fine words who is not their puppet i climbed difficulty i snapped my fingers at the grinning lions i passed cautiously through the valley of the shadowwild scenery sir i visited that prince of bubbles also giant despair in his draughty castle andthough boasting be far from mefetched livelooses halfbrother out of a certain charnelhouse near by  thus far sir i went but i have not yet found the world so barren of literature as to write a book about it i have not yet found the world so barren of ingratitude as to seek happiness by stabbing in the back every friend i ever had i have not yet forsaken wife and children neighbours and kinsmen home ease and tenderness for a whim a dream a passing qualm no sir tis this christians ignorant hardnessofheart that is his bane knowing little he prateth much he would pinch and contract the universe to his own fantastical pattern he is tedious he is pragmatical andi affirm it in all sympathy and sorrowhe is crazed malice haply is a little sharp at times and neighbour obstinate dealeth full weight with his opinions but this christian flowntoglory as the urchins say pinks with a bludgeon he cannot endure an honest doubt he distorteth a mere difference of opinion into a roaring tophet and because he is helpless solitary despised in the world because he is impotent to refute and too stubborn to hear and suffer people a little higher and weightier a leetle wiser than hewhy beyond the grave he must set his hope in vengeance beyond the gravebliss for his own shade fire and brimstone eternal woe for theirs ay and tis not but for a season will he vex us but for ever and for ever and for everif he knoweth in the least what he meaneth by the phrase and this he calls charity  yes sirs beyond the grave he would condemn us beyond the gravea place of peace whereto i deem there are not many here but will be content at length to come and i not least content when my duty is done my children provided for and my last suspicion of fear and folly suppressed  to conclude sirand beshrew me gentlemen how time doth fly in talkthis christian goeth his way we each in accord with his caprice and conscience go ours we envy him not his vapours his terrors or his shameless greed of reward why then doth he envy us our wealth our success our gaiety our content he raves he is haunted what is man but as grass and the flower of grass come the sickle he is clean gone i can but repeat it sir our poor neighbour was crazed tis christian in a word  a sigh a murmur of satisfaction and relief rose from the company as if one and all had escaped by mr atheists lucidity out of a very real peril  i thanked him for his courtesy and in some confusion turned to reverie with the remark that i thought i now recollected to have heard christians name but understood he had indeed arrived at last at the celestial city for which he had set out  celestial twaddle sir cried mr obstinate hoarsely he went stark staring mad and now is dust as we shall soon all be thats certain  then cruelty rose out of his chair and elbowed his way to the door he opened it and looked out  i would he said i had known of this christian before he started step you down to vanity fair sir stranger if the mood take you and well show you as pretty a persuasion against pilgrimage as ever you saw he opened his mouth where he stood between me and the stars  theres many more he added with difficulty as if his rage was too much for him he spat into the air and went out  presently after liveloose rose up smiling softly and groped after him  a little silence followed their departure  you must tell your friend mr reverie said atheist goodhumouredly that mr cruelty says more than he means to my mind he is mistakentoo energetic but his intentions are good  hes a staunch dependable fellow said obstinate patting down the wide cuffs he wore  but even at that moment a stranger softly entered the inn out of the night his face was of the grey of ashes and he looked once round on us all with a still appalling glance that silenced the words on my lips  we sat without speechobstinate yawning atheist smiling lightly superstition nibbling his nails reverie with chin drawn a little back pliable bolt upright like a green and white wand mistrust blinking his little thin lids but all with eyes fixed on this stranger who deemed himself it seemed among friends  he turned his back on us and sipped his drink under the heedless deep untroubled gaze of mrs nature and passed out softly and harmlessly as he had come in  reverie stood up like a man surprised and ill at ease he turned to me i know him only by repute by hearsay he said with an effort he is a stranger to us all indeed sirto all  obstinate with a very flushed face thrust his hand into his breeches pocket nay sir he said my purse is yet here what more would you have  at which pliable laughed turning to the women  i put on my hat and followed reverie to the door  excuse me sir i said but i have no desire to stay in this house overnight and if you would kindly direct me to the nearest way out of the village i will have my horse saddled now and be off  and then i noticed that superstition stood in the light of the doorway looking down on us  theres christians way he said as if involuntarily  lodge with me tonight reverie answered and in the morning you shall choose which way to go you will  i thanked him heartily and turned in to find rosinante  the night was now fine but moist and sultry and misty in the distance it was late too for few candles gleamed beneath the moonlight from the windows round about the smooth villagegreen even as we set out i leading rosinante by her bridle and superstition on my left hand out of heavenly leo a bright star wheeled fading as it fell and soon high hedges hid utterly the worlds end behind us out of sight and sound  i observed when the trees had laid their burdened branches overhead and the thickflowered bushes begun to straiten our way that this mr superstition who had desired to accompany us was of a very different courage from that his manner at the inn seemed to profess  he walked with almost as much caution and ungainliness as mistrust his deep and shining eyes busily searching the gloom to left and right of him indeed those same dark eyes of his reminded me not a little of mrs natures they were so full of what they could not tell  he was on foot my new friend reverie like myself led his horse a pale lovely creature with delicate nostrils and deepsmouldering eyes  you must think me very bold to force my company on you said superstition awkwardly turning to reverie but my house is never so mute with horror as in these moody summer nights when thunder is in the air see there he cried  as if the distant sky had opened the large bright harmless lightning quivered and was gone revealing on the opposing hills forest above forest unutterably dark and still  surely i said that is not the way christian took  they say reverie answered the valley of the shadow of death lies between those hills  but atheist i said that acid little man did he indeed walk there alone  i have heard muttered superstition putting out his hand tis fear only that maketh afraid atheist has no fear  but what of cruelty i said and liveloose  why answered superstition cruelty works cunningest when he is afraid and liveloose never talks about himself none the less theres not a tree but casts a shadow i met once an earnest yet very popular young gentleman of the name of science who explained almost everything on earth to me so clearly and patiently and fatherly i thought i should evermore sleep in peace but we met at noon believe me sir i would have followed christian and his friend hopeful very willingly long since for as for cruelty and obstinate and all that clumsy rabble i heed them not indeed my cousin mistrust did go and as you see returned with a caution and a poor young schoolfellow of mine jack ignorance came to an awful end but it is because i owe partly to christian and not all to myself this horrible solitude in which i walk that i dare not risk a deeper it would be i feel sure and so i very willingly beheld faithful burned it restored my confidence and here sir he added almost with gaiety lives my friend mrs simple a widow she enjoys my company and my old fables and we keep the blinds down against these mountains and candles burning against the brighter lightnings  so saying superstition bade us goodnight and passed down a little bylane on our left towards a country cottage like a dreaming bower of roses beneath the moon  but reverie and i continued on as if the moon herself as patiently pursued us and byandby we came to a house called gloom whose gardens slope down with plashing fountains and glimmering banks of flowers into the shadow and stillness of a broad valley named beneath the hills of silence peace     xi      his soul shall taste the sadness of her might     and be among her cloudy trophies hung      john keats   even as we entered the gates of mr reveries house beneath embowering chestnuts there advanced across the moonlit spaces to meet us a figure on foot like ourselves leading his horse he was in armour yet unarmed his steel glittered cold and blue his fingers hung ungauntleted and on his pale face dwelt a look never happy warrior wore yet he seemed a man mars lends to venus out of war to unhappy idleness the disillusionment of age was in his face yet he was youthful i suppose scarce older than mercutio and once perhaps as light of wit  he took my hand in a grasp cold and listless and smiled from mirthless eyes  yet there was something strangely taking in this solitary knightatarms she for whom he does not fight i thought must have somewhat of the immortals to grace her warrior with and if it were only shadows that beset him and obscured his finer heart shadows they were of myrtle and rhododendron with voices shrill and small as the sparrows and eyes of the nexttomorning stars  indeed these gardens whispered and the wind at play in the air seemed to bear faraway music dying and falling  we entered the house and sat down to supper in a low room open to the night reverie recounted our evenings talk i wish he said turning to his friend you would accompany mr brocken and me one night to the worlds end to hear these fellows talk such arrogance such assurance such bigotry and blindness and foxinessyet on my word a kind of gravity with it all as if the scarecrows had some real interest in the devils tares they guard come now let it be a bargain between us and leave this endless search awhile  but the solitary knight shook his head they would jeer me out of knowledge he said why reverie the children cease their play when i pass and draw their tops and marbles out of the dust and gaze till i am hid from sight  it is fancy only fancy replied reverie children stare at all things new to them in the world how else could they recognise and learn againhow else forget but as for this rabbles mockery there is a shebear left called oblivion which is their mistress and will some day silence every jeer  the solitary knight shook his head again eyeing me solemnly as if in hope to discern in my face the sorcery that held himself in thrall  the few wax tapers gave but light enough to find the way from goblet to mouth as for reveries wine i ask no other for it had the poppys scarlet and overcame weariness so subtly i almost forgot these were the hours of sleep we spent in waking forgot too as if of the lotus all thought of effort and hope  after all thought i as i sipped effort is the flaw that proves men mortal while as for hope who would seek a seed that floats on every wind and smothers the world with weeds that bear no fruit it was in fact fare very different from the ale and cheese of the worlds end  but you yourself i said to mr reverie presently in all the talk at the inn you kept a very scrupulous silencediscreet enough i own but now what truly was this christian of whom we heard so much and why may i ask do his neighbours slander the dead you yourselves did you ever meet with him i turned from one to the other of my companions as they glanced uneasily each at each  well sir said reverie rather deliberately i have met him and talked with him i often think of him in spite of myself yet he was a man of little charm he certainly had a remarkable gift for estranging his friends he was a foe to the most innocent compromise for myself i found not much humour in him no eye for grace or art and a limited imagination that was yet his absolute master nevertheless as you hint these fellows no more than i can forget him nor you he turned to the other  christian he replied i remember him we were friends a little while faithful i knew also faithful was to the last my friend ah reverie thenhow many years agothere was a child we loved all three do you remember i see the low green wall cool from how many a summers shadows the clusters of green apples on the bough and in the early morning we would go carrying tornoff branches and shouting our songs through the fields till we came to the shadow and the hush of the woods ay reverie and we would burst in on silence each his heart beating and play there and perhaps it was hopeful who would steal away from us and the others play on or perhaps you into the sunlight that maddened the sheltered bird to flit and sing in the orchard where the little child we loved playednot yet sad but how much beloved not yet weary of passing shadows and simple creatures and boys rough gifts and cold hands but iwith me it was ever evening when the blackbird bursts harshly away then it was so still in the orchard and in the curved bough so solitary that the nightingale cowering would almost for fear begin to sing and stoop to the bending of the bough her sidelong eyes in shade while the stars began to stand in the stations above us ever bright and all the night was peace then would i dream ondream of the face i loved innocence o innocence  it was a strange outburst his voice rose almost to a chant full of a forlorn music but even as he ceased we heard in the following silence above the plashing of the restless fountains beyond far and faint a wild and stranger music welling and i saw from the porch that looks out from the house called gloom la belle dame sans merci pass riding with her train who rides in beauty beneath the huntress heedless of disguise across from far away like leaves of autumn skirred the dappled deer the music grew timbrel and pipe and tabor as beneath the glances of the moon the little company sped transient as a rainbow elusive as a dream i saw her maidens bound and sandalled with all their everlasting flowers and advancing soundless unreal the silver wheels of that unearthly chariot amid the fauns on on they gamboled hoof in yielding turf blowing reed melodies mocking water their lips laid sidelong their eyes aleer along the smoothness of their flutes  and when i turned again to my companions with i know not what old folly in my eyes i know not what unanswerable cry in my heart reverie alone was at my side i seemed to see the long fringes of the lake the sedge withered the grey waters restless in the bonds of the wind tuneless and chill all these happy gardens swept bare and flowerless and the far hills silent in the unattainable dawn  she pipes he follows said reverie she sets the tune he dances yet sir on my soul i believe it is the childish face of that same innocence we kept tryst with long ago he pursues on and on through what sad labyrinths we who dream not so wildly cannot by taking thought come to guess                                       the next two days passed serenely and quietly at reveries we read together rode walked and talked together and listened in the evening to music for a sister of reveries lived not far distant who visited him while i was there and took supper with us delighting us with her wit and spirit and her youthful voice  but though reverie more than once suggested it i could not bring myself to return to the worlds end and its garrulous company whether it was the moist grey face of mr cruelty i most abhorred or stubborns sluglike eye or the tonguestump of my afflicted guide i cannot say  moreover i had begun to feel a very keen curiosity to see the way that had lured christian on with such graceless obstinacy they had spoken of remorse poverty pride worldfailure even insanity even vice but these appeared to me only such things as might fret a man to set violently out on not to persist in such a course or likelier yet to abandon hope to turn back from heights that trouble or confusion set so far and made seem dreams  how could i help too being amused to think how vastly strange these fellows considered a mans venturing whither his star beckoned though that star were only power only fame only beauty only peace what wonder they were many  not far from this place reverie informed me were pitched the booths of vanity fair this by his account was a place one ought to visit if only for the satisfaction of leaving it behind but i have heard more animated accounts of it elsewhere  as for reverie himself he seemed only desirous to contemplate never to taste to win or to handle he needed but refuse reality to what shocked or teased him to find it harmless and entertaining he was a dreamer whom the heat and shout of battle could not offend  perhaps he perceived my restlessness to be gone for he himself suggested that i should stay till the next morning and then if i so pleased he would see me a mile or two on my way  for the pitiless lady he said smiling takes many disguises sometimes of the sun sometimes of evening sometimes of night and i would at least save you from the fate that has made my poor friend a phantom before he is a shade     xii      the many men so beautiful     and they all dead did lie      st coleridge   so reverie as he had promised rode out with me a few miles to see me on my way above the gloom and stillness of the valley the scene began to change again i was glad as i could be to view once more the tossing cornfields and the wind at play with shadow near and far woods and pastures smoked beneath the sun i know not through how many arches of the elms and green folds of the meadows i kept watch on the chimneys of a farmhouse above its trees  but reverie the further we journeyed the less he said i almost chafed to see his heedless eyes turned upon some inward dream while here like life itself stood cloud and oak warbled bird and brook beneath the burning sun i saw again in memory the silver twilight of the moon and the crazy face of loves warrior haunter of shade let him but venture into the open i thought hear again the distant lowing of the oxen the rooks cawing in the elms see again the flocks upon the hillside  i suppose this was her home my heart had turned to this was my dust nights was his for me the wild rose and the fields of harvest for him closed petals the chantry of the night wind phantom lutes and voices and as if he had overheard my thoughts reverie turned at the crossways  you will come back again he said they tell me in distant lands men worship time set up a shrine to him in every street and treasure his emblem next their hearts there they say even the lover babbles of hours and the dreamer measures sleep with a pendulum well my house is secluded and the world is far and to me time is naught return sir then when it pleases you besides he added smiling faintly there is always company at the worlds end  the crisp sunbeams rained upon his pale and delicate horse its equalplaited mane on the darkness of his cloak that dreamdelighted face here smouldered gold here flushed crimson and here the curved damaskening of his bridle glistened and gleamed he was a strange visitant to the open day between the green hedges beneath the enormous branching of the elms and there i bade him farewell  some day perhaps i shall return as he has foretold for it is ever easy to find again the house of reverieto them who have learned the way  on i journeyed then following as i had been directed the main road to vanity fair but whether it is that the fair is more difficult to arrive at than to depart from or is really a hard days journey even from the gay parlour of the worlds end it already began to be evening and yet no sign of bunting or booth or clamour or smoke  and it was at length to a noiseless fair far from all vanity that i came at sunsetthe cypresses of a solitary graveyard i was tired out and desired only rest so dismounting and leading rosinante i turned aside willingly into its peace  it seemed i had entered a new earth the lane above had wandered on in the gloaming of its hedges and overarching trees here all the clouds of sunset stood caught up in burning gold even as i paused dazzled a moment by the sudden radiance from height to height the wild bright rose of evening ran not a tottering stone black wellnigh shapeless with age not a green bush but seemed to dwell unconsumed in its own fire above this desolate ground the trees that grew around mewillow and yew thorn and poplarwere but flaming cages for the wild birds that perched in their branches  above these sounddulled mansions trod lightly as if of thought rosinantes gilded shoes i wandered on in a strange elation of mind filled with a desperate desire ever to remember how flamed this rose between earth and sky how throbbed this jargon of delight and turning as if in hope to share my enthusiasm a childish peal of laughter showed me i was not alone  beneath a canopy of holly branches and yew two children sat playing the nearer childs hair was golden glistening round his face of roses and he it was who had laughed tumbling on the sward but the face of the further child was white almost as crystal and the dark hair that encircled his head with its curved lines seemed as it were the shadow of the gold it showed beside these children it was plain had been running and playing across the tombs but now they were stooping together at some earnest sport to me even if they had seen me they as yet paid no heed  i passed slowly towards them deeming them at first of solitudes creation my eyes dazzled so with the sun but as i approached so the branches beneath which they played gradually disparted and i saw not far distant from them one sitting who evidently had these jocund boys in charge  i could not but hesitate awhile as i surveyed them these were no mortal children playing naked amid the rose of evening nor she who sat veiled and beautiful beneath the ruinous tombs i turned with sudden dismay to depart from their presence unobserved as i had entered but the children had now espied me and came running filled with wonder of rosinante and the stranger beside her  they stayed at a little distance from us with dwelling eyes and parted lips then the fairer and as it seemed to me elder of the brothers stooped and plucked a few blades of grass and proffered them half fearfully to the beast that amazed him but the other gave less heed to rosinante fixed the filmy lustre of his eyes on me his wonderful young face veiled with that wisdom which is in all children and of an immutable gravity  but by this time she who it seemed had the charge of these children had followed them with her eyes to her then leaving rosinante in an ecstasy of timidity before such godlike boys i addressed myself  so might a traveller lost beneath strange stars address unanswering night she however raised a compassionate face to me and listened with happy seriousness as to a child returned in safety at evening from some foolhardy venture yet there seemed only a deeper youthfulness in her face for all its eternity of brooding on her beauteous children narrow leaves of olive formed her chaplet the darker winecolours of the sea changed in her eyes there was no sense of gloom or sorrowfulness in her company i began to see how the same still breast might bear celestial children so diverse as these whose names she told me presently were sleep and death  i looked at the two children at play ah now i said almost involuntarily the golden boy who has caught my horses bridle in his hand is not he sleep and he who considers his brothers boldnessthat one is death  she smiled with lovely vanity and told me how strange of heart young children are how they will alter and vary never the same for long together but led by indiscoverable caprices and obedient to some further will she smiled and said how that sometimes when the birds hush suddenly from song sleep would creep tenderly and sadly to her knees and death clasp her roguishly as if in some secret with the beams of morning so would they change one to the likeness of the other but sleep was perhaps of the gentler disposition a little obstinate and headstrong at times indeed beyond all cajolery yet very sweet of impulse and ardent to make amends but deaths caprices baffled even her he seemed now so pitiless and unlovely of heart and now as if possessed passionate and swift and now would break away burning from her arms in an infinite tenderness  but best she loved them when there came a transient peace to both and looking upon them laid embraced in the shadowcasting moonbeam not even she could undoubtingly touch the brow of each beneath their likened hair and say this is the elder and this the dreamless younger of the boys  seeing too my eyes cast upon the undecipherable letters of the tomb by which we sat she told me how that once near before dawn she had awoke in the twilight to find their places empty where the children had lain at her side and had sought on at last to find them even here weeping and quarrelling and red with anger little by little and with many tears she had gleaned the cause of their quarrelhow that like very children they had run a race at cockcrow and all these stones and the slender bones and ashes beneath to be the prize and how that running both had come together to the goal set and both had claimed the victory  yet both seem happy now to share it i said or how else were they comforted nor did i consider before she told me that they will run again when they be grown men sleep and death in just such a thick darkness before dawn and one called love will then run with them who is very vehement and fleet of foot and never turns aside nor falters he who then shall win may ask a different prize for truth to tell she said only children can find delight for long in dust and ruin  at that moment death himself came hastening to his mother and taking her hand turned to the enormous picture of the skies as if in some faint apprehension but sleep saw nothing amiss lay at full length among the coolrooted flowers while rosinante grazed beside him  i told her also in turn of my journey and that although transient or everlasting solace of all restlessness and sorrow and toowild happiness may be found in them yet men think not often on these divine children  as for this one i said looking down into the pathless beauty of deaths grey eyes some fear some mock some despise him some violently some without complaint pursue most men would altogether dismiss and forget him he is but a child no older than the sea no stranger than the mountains pure and cold as the watersprings yet to the bolster of fever his vision flits and pain drags a heavy net to snare him and silence is his echoing gallery and the gold of sleep his final veil they shall play on and see lady flame has left the clouds the birds are at rest the earth breathes in and it is day and exhales her breath and it is night let them then play secret and innocent between her breasts comfort her with silence above the tempest of her heart but iwhat am ia traveller footsore and far  and then it was that i became conscious of a warm sly youthful hand in mine and turned half in dread to see only happy sleep laughing under his glistening hair into my eyes i strove in vain against his sorcery rolled foolish orbs on that pure starry face and then i smelled as it were rain and heard as it were tempestuous foresttreesfell asleep among the tombs     xiii      i warmed both hands before the fire of life      walter savage landor   surely some hueless poppy blossomed in the darkness of those ruins or the soulless ashes of the dead breathe out a drowsy influence never have i slept so heavily yet never perhaps beneath so cold a tester sunbeams streaming between the crests of the cypresses awoke me i leapt up as if a hundred sentinels had shoutedwhere none kept visible watch  an odour of a languid sweetness pervaded the air there was no wind to stir the dewbesprinkled trees the old scarred gravestones stood in a thick sunshine afloat with bees but rosinante had preferred to survey sunshine out of shade in lush grass i found her the picture of age foot crookd and head dejected  yet she followed me uncomplaining along these narrow avenues of silence and without more ado turned her trivial tail on death and his dim flocks and wellnigh scampered me off into the vivid morning soon afterwards with hunger in the saddle we began to climb a road almost precipitous and stony in the extreme often enough we breathed ourselves as best we could in the still sultry air and rested on the sundappled slopes but at length we came out upon the crest and surveyed in the first splendour of day a region of extraordinary grandeur  beneath a clear sky to the east stood a range of mountains cold and changeless beneath their snows at my feet a great river flowed broken here and there with isles in the bright flood the dark champaign that flanked its shores was of an unusual verdure mystery and peril brooded on those distant ravines the vapours of their fardescending cataracts in such abysmal fastnesses as these the hyrcan tiger might hide his surly generations this was an air for the sundisdaining eagle a country of transcendent brightness its flowers strangely pure and perfect its waters more limpid its grazing herds its birds its cedar trees the masters of their kind  yet not on these nearer glories my eyes found rest but with a kind of heartache i gazed as it were towards home upon the distant waters of the sea here on the crest of this green hill was silence there too was profounder silence on the seas untrampled floor whence comes that angel out of nought whispering into the ear strange syllables i know not but so seemed i to standa shattered instrument in the world past all true music oer which none the less the invisible lutemaster stooped could i but catch could i but in words express the music his bent fingers intended the mystery the peacewell then i should indeed journey solitary on the face of the earth a changeling in its cities  i half feared to descend into a country so diverse from any i had yet seen hitherto at least i had encountered little else than friendliness but heredoves in eyries i stood twisting my fingers in rosinantes mane debating and debating and she turned her face to me and looked with age into my eyes and i know not how woke courage in me again  on then i said on the height and the gentle beast leaned forward and coughed into the valley what might indeed be yea  so we began to descend down we went alone yet not unhappy until in a while i discovered about a hundred yards in advance of me another traveller on the road ambling easily along at an equal pace with mine i know not how far i followed in his track debating whether to overtake and to accost him or to follow on till a more favourable chance offered  but chanceavenger of all shillyshallysettled the matter offhand for my traveller after casting one comprehensive glance towards the skies suddenly whisked off at a canter that quickly carried him out of sight  a chill wind had begun to blow lifting in gusts dust into the air and whitening the treetops as suddenly calm succeeded a cloud of flies droned fretfully about my ears and i watched advancing leaguehigh transfigured with sunbeams the enormous gloom of storm the sun smote from a silvery haze upon its peaks and gorges wind far above the earth moaned and fell only to sound once more in the distance in a mournful trumpeting lightnings played along the desolate hills the sun was darkened a vast flight of snowy arrowwinged birds streamed voiceless beneath his place and day withdrew its boundaries spread to the nearer forests a bright amphitheatre fitful with light whereof it seemed to me rosinante with her poor burden was the centre and the butt i confess i began to dread lest even my mere surmise of danger should engage the piercing lightnings as if in the mystery of life storm and a timorous thought might yet be of a kin  we hastened on at the most pathetic of gallops nor seemed indeed the beauteous lightning to regard at all that restless mote upon the cirque of its entranced fairness in an instantaneous silence i heard a tiny beat of hoofs in instantaneous gloom recognised almost with astonishment my own shape bowed upon the saddle it was a majestic entry into a kingdom so farfamed  the storm showed no abatement when at last i found shelter from far away i had espied in the immeasurable glare a country barn beneath trees arrived there i almost fell off my horse into as incongruous and lighthearted a company as ever was seen  in the midst of the floor of the barn upon a heap of hay sat a fool in motley blowing with all his wind into a pipe it was a cunning tune he played too rich and heady and so seemed the company to find it dancerssome thirty or morecapering round him with all the abandon heart can feel and heel can answer to as for pose he whose horse now stood smoking beside my own first drew my attentiona smooth smallbearded solemn man a little beyond his prime he lifted his toes with such inimitable agility postured his fingers so daintily conducted his melonbelly with so much elegance and exhaled such a warm joy in the sport that i could look at nothing else at first for delight in him  but there were slim maids too among the plumper and ruddier like crocuses like lilac like whey with all their fragrance and freshness and lightness such eyes adazzle dancing with mine such nimble and discreet ankles such gimp english middles and such a gay delight in the mere grace of the lilting and tripping beneath rafters ringing loud with thunder that pan himself might skip across a hundred furrows for sheer envy to witness  as for the jolly rustics that were jogging their wits away with such delightful gravity but little time was given me to admire them ere i also was snatched into the ring and found brown eyes dwelling with mine and a hand like lettuces in the dogdays round and about we skipped in the golden straw amidst treasuries of hay puffing and spinning and the quiet lightnings quivered between the beams and the monstrous ah of the thunder submerged the pipes sweetness till at last all began to gasp and blow indeed and the nodding fool to sip and sip as if in extremis over his mouthpiece then we rested awhile with a medley of shrill laughter and guffaws while the rain streamed lightninglit upon the trees and tore the clouds to tatters  with some little circumstance my traveller picked his way to me and with a grave civility bowed me a sort of general welcome whereupon ensued such wit and banter as made me thankful when the opening impudence of a kind of jig set the heels and the petticoats of the company tossing once more we danced the lightning out and piped the thunder from the skies and by then i was so faint with fasting and so deep in love with at least five young country faces that i scarcely knew head from heels still less when a long draught of a kind of thin sweet ale had mounted to its sphere  away we all trooped over the flashing fields noisy as jays in the fresh sweet air some to their mowing some to their milking but more indeed i truly suspect to that exquisite nirvana from which the tempests travail had aroused them i waved my hand striving in vain to keep my eyes on one blest beguiling face of all that glanced behind them but she gone i turned into the rainy lane once more with my new acquaintance discreeter but not less giddy it seemed than i  we had not far to gopast a meadow or two a low green wall a black fishpooland soon the tumbledown gables of a house came into view my companion waved his open fingers at the crooked casements and peered into my face  ah he said we will talk we will talk you and i i view it in your eye sirclear and full and profoundsuch ever goes with eloquence tis my delight what are we else than beastsbeasts that perish i never tire i never wearygive me to dance and to sing but ever to talk then am i at ease heaven is just enter sirenter  he led me by a shady alley into his orchard and thence to a stable where we left rosinante at hobanob with his mare over a friendly bottle of hay and we ourselves passed into the house and ascended a staircase into an upper chamber this chamber was raftered its walls hung with an obscure tapestry its floor strewn with sand and its lozenged casement partly shuttered against the blaze of sunshine that flowed across the forests far away to the west  my friend eyed me brightly and busily as a starling you danced fine sir he said oh it is a pleasure to me ay and now i come to consider it methought i did hear hoofs behind me that might yet be echo no but i did not think twas but my ear cried to his dreaming master ever dreaming god help at last the awakening but well met well met i say again i am cheered and you but just in time nay i would not have missed him for a ransom sosothis leg that leg up nowhands over down we go lackaday i am old bones for such freaks once memento mori say i and smell the shower the sweeter for it be seated sir bench or stool wheresoever youd be youre looking peaked that burden rings in my skull like a bagpipe tootatootie tootatoot och sad days  we devoured our meal of cold meats and pickled fish fruit and junket and a kind of harsh cheese as if in contest for a wager and copious was the thin spicy wine with which we swam it home ever and again my host would desist to whistle or croon with a packed mouth in the dismallest of tenors a stave or two of the tune we had danced to bobbing head and foot in sternest time then a great vacancy would overspread his face turned to the window as suddenly to gather to a cheerful smile and light irradiated once more on me then down would drop his chin over his plate and away go finger and spoon among his victuals in a dance as brisk and wholehearted as the other  he took me out again into his garden after supper and we walked beneath the trees  tis bliss to be a bachelor sir he said gazing on the resinous trunk of an old damson tree i gorge i guzzle i am merry am melancholy studious harmonical drowsyand none to scold or deny me for the rest why youth is vain yet youth had pleasureinnocence and delight i chew the cud of many a peaceful acre ay i have nibbled roses in my time but now what now i have lived so long far from courts and courtesy grace and fashion and am so much my own close and indifferent friendwhy he is happy who has solitude for housemate company for guest i say it i say it i marry daily wives of memorys fashioning and dream at peace  it seemed an old bone he picked with destiny  theres much to be said i replied as profoundly as i could  the air he now lulled youth asleep with was a very cheerless threnody but he brightened once more at praise of his delightful orchard  you like it sir you speak kindly sir it is my all root and branch how many a summers moons have i seen shine hereon i know itthere is bliss to comemiraculous paradise for men even dull as i yet twill be strange to mewithout my house and orchard age tends to earth sir till even an odour may awake the deada branch in the air call with its fluttering a face beyond time to vanquish dear soul soul i cry forget thy dust forget thy vaunting ashesand speak in vain sos life  and when we had gone in again and candles had been lit in his fresh and narrow chamber seeing a viol upon a chest i begged a little music  he quite eagerly with a boyish peal of laughter complied and sat down with a very solemn face his brows uplifted and sang between the candles to a pathetic air this doggerel      theres a dark tree and a sad tree     where sweet alice waits unheeded     for her lover longtime absent     plucking rushes by the river      let the bird sing let the buck sport     let the sun sink to his setting     not one star that stands in darkness     shines upon her absent lover      but his stone lies neath the dark tree     cold to bosom deaf to weeping     and tis gathering moss she touches     where the locks lay of her lover  a dolesome thing he said but my mother was wont to sing it to the virginals cold to bosom he reiterated with a plangent cadence i remember them all sir from the cradle i had a gift for music and then with an ample flirt of his bow he broke all beams and smiles into this ingenuous ditty          the goodman said         tis time for bed     come mistress get us quick to pray         call in the maids         from out the glades       where they with lovers stray       with love and love do stray          nay master mine         the night is fine     and times enough all dark to pray         tis april buds         bedeck the woods       where simple maids away       with love and love do stray          now we are old

       to pray till nine     then called come maids true maids away         kiss and begone         ha done ha done       until another day       with love and love to stray          oh it were best         if so to rest     went man and maid in peace away         the throes a heart         may make to smart       unless love have his way       in april woods to stray        in april woods to stray  and that finished with another burst of laughter he set very adroitly to the mimicry of beasts and birds upon his frets never have i seen a face so consummately the actions his every fibre answered to the call his eyebrows twitched like an orators his very nose was plastic  hst he cried softly hither struts chanticleer cockadiddledoo crowed the wire now prithee dame partlett and down bustled a hen from an egg like cinnamon a cat with kittens mewed along the string anxious and tender  a woodpecker he cried directing momentarily a sedulous clear eye on me and lo inviolable quietness and the smooth beechboughs and thus he said sitting closer the martlets were wont to whimper about the walls of the castle of inverness the castle of macbeth  macbeth i repeatedmacbeth  ay he said it was his seat while yet a simple soldierflocks and flocks of them wheeling hither thither in the evening air crying and calling  i listened in a kind of confusion  and duncan i said  he eyed me with immense pleasure and nodded with brilliant eyes on mine  what looking man was he i said at last as carelessly as i dared  the king you meanof scotland  he magnanimously ignored my confusion and paused to build his sentence  duncan he said the question calls him straight to mind a leanlocked womanish countenance sickly yet never sick timid yet most obdurate more sly than politic an ignis fatuus sir in a world of soldiers his eye wandered twas a marvellous sanative air crisp and pure but for him one draught and outer darkness i myself viewed his royal entry from the gallerypacing urbane to slaughter and i uttered a sigh to see him why sir do you sigh to see the king cried one softly that stood by i sigh my lord i answered to the instant at sight of a monarch even duncans match  he looked his wildest astonishment at me  not id have you remembernot that twas blood i did foresee to kill in blood a man and he a king so near to natural death  foul foul  and macbeth i said presentlymacbeth  he laid down his viol with prolonged care  his was a soul sir nobler than his fate i followed him not without love from boyhooda youth almost too fine of spirit shrinking from all violence overnicely eloquent yet chary of speech and of a dark profundity of thought the questions he would patterunanswerable searching earth and heaven through and who now was it told me the traitor judass hair was redyet not red his but of a reddish chestnut fine and bushy children have played their harmless hands at hideandseek therein o sea of many winds  for come gloom on the hills floods discolouring mist breathe but some grandams tale of darkness and blood and doubleness in his hearing all changed flame kindled a fevered unrest drove him out and ambition that spotted hound of hell strained at the leash towards the pit  so runs the worldthe ardent and the lofty we are beyond earths story as tis told sir alls shallower than the heart of man indeed twas one more shattered altar to hymen  hymen i said  he brooded long and silently clipping his small beard and while he was so brooding a mouse a moth dusti know not what stirred the listening strings of his viol to sound and woke him with a start  i vowed sir then to dismiss all memory of such unhappy deeds from mindnever to speak again that broken ladys name oh i have seen sad endspride abased splendour dismantled courage to terror come guilt to a crying guilelessness  guilelessness i said lady macbeth at least was past all changing  the doctor stood up and cast a deep scrutiny on me which yet perhaps was partly on himself  perceive sir he said this tablebroader longer splendidly burdened and all adown both sides the board thanes and their ladies lords and gentlemen guests bidden to a royal banquet twas then in that bleak and dismal countrythe palace of forres torches flared in the hall to every man a servant or two we sat in pomp  he paused again and gravely withdrew behind the tapestry  and presently he cried therefrom suiting his action to the word to the blast of hautboys enters the king in state thus with his attendant lords and with all that rich and familiar courtesy of which he was master in his easier moods he passed from one to another greeting with supple dignity on his way till he came at last softly to the place prepared for him at table and suddenlyshall i ever forget it sirit seemed silence ran like a flame from mouth to mouth as there he stood thus marblestill his eyes fixed in a leaden glare and he raised his face and looked once round on us all with a forlorn astonishment and wrath like one with a deathwoundi never saw the like of such a face  whereat beseeching us to be calm and pay no heed the queen laid her hand on his and called him and his orbs rolled down once more upon the empty place and stuck as if at grapple with some horror seen within he muttered aloud in peevish altercationonce more to heave up his frame to sigh and shake himself and lo  the violstrings rang to his lo  lo sir the unseen had conquered his lip sagged into his beard he babbled with open mouth and leaned on his lady with such an impotent and slavish regard as i hope never to see again man pay to woman we thought no more of supper after that  but what do i the doctor laid a cautioning finger on his mouth  the company was dispersed the palace gloomy with night and they were black nights at forres and on the walls i heard the sentinels replying in the woods last glow i entered and stood in his selfsame station before the empty stool and even as i stood thus my hair creeping my will concentred gazing with every cord at stretch fell a light light footfall behind me he glanced whitely over his shoulder  sir it was the queen come softly out of slumber on my own unquiet errand  the doctor strode to the door and peered out like a man suspicious or guilty of treachery it was indeed a house of broken silences and there in the doorway he seemed to be addressing his own saddened conscience  with all my skill and all a leal mans gentleness i solaced and persuaded and made an oath and conducted her back to her own chamber unperceived how weak is sleep it was a habit sir contracted in childhood long dormant that evil had woke again the past awaits us all so run times sands till mercys globe is empty and   he stooped and whispered it across to me  a child a comparative child shrunk to an anatomy her beauty changed ghostly of youth and all its sadness baffled by a word slave to a doctors nod none knew but i and at the last one of her ladiesa gentle faithful and fearful creature nor she till far beyond all mischief  wild deeds are done but to have blood on the hands a cry in the ears and one same glassy face eye to eye that nothing can dim nor even slumber pacifydreams dreams intangible enorm forefend them god from me  he stood a moment as if he were listening then turned smiling irresolutely and eyed me aimlessly he seemed afraid of his own house askance at his own furniture yet though i scarce know why i felt he had not told me the whole truth something fidelity had yet withheld from vanity i longed to enquire further i put aside how many burning questions awhile     xiv      and if we gang to sea master     i fear well come to harm      old ballad   by and by less anxious talk soothed him indeed it was he who suggested one last bright draught of air beneath his trees before retiring down we went again with some unnecessary clatter and here were stars between the fruited boughs silvery capella and the twins and low on the skys moonlit border venus excellently bright  he asked me whither i proposed going if i needs must go besought there and then in the ambrosial nightair the history of my wanderingsa mere nine days wonder and told me how he himself much feared and hated the sea  he questioned me also with not a little subtilty and doubledealing too i fancied regarding my own country and of things present and things real in fact nothing i think so much flattered his vanityunless it was my wonder at dame partletts clucking on his violstringsas to learn himself was famous even so far as to ages yet unborn he gazed on the simple moon with limpid amiable eyes and caught my fingers in his  how then could i even so much as hint to enquire which century indeed was his who had no need of any how could i abash that kindly vanity of his by adding also that however famous he must needs be to all eternitynameless  we conversed long and earnestly in the coolness he very frankly counselled me not to venture unconducted further into this country the land of tragedy was broad and though on this side it lay adjacent to the naïve and civil people of comedy on the further in the shadow of those bleak unfooted mountains lurked unnatural horror and desolation and cruelty beyond all telling  he very kindly offered me too if i was indeed bent on seeking the sea an old boat still seaworthy that lay in a creek in the river near by from which he was wont to fish as for rosinante he supposed a rest would be by no means unwelcome to so faithful a friend he himself rode little being indolent and a happier host than guest and when i returned here she should be stuffed with dainties awaiting me  to this i cordially and gratefully agreed and also even more cordially to remain with him the next day and the next night after that to take my watery departure  so it was and a courteous versatile and vivacious companion i found him rare tales he told me too of better days than these and rarest of his own nevermorereturning youth he loved his childhood talked on of it with an artless zeal his eyes a nest of singingbirds how contrite he was for spirit lost and daring withheld and hope discomfited how simple and urbane concerning his present lowly demands on life on love and on futurity all this too with such packed winks and mirth and mourning that i truly said goodnight for the second time to him with a rather melancholy warmth since tomorrow  who can face unmoved that viewless sphinx moreover the sea is wide has fishes in plenty but never too many coraled grottoes once poor mariners     xv      tis now full tide tween night and day      john webster   on the stroke of two next morning the doctor conducted me down to the creek in the riverbank where he kept his boat there was little light but of the stars in the sky nothing stirring she floated dim and monstrous on the softlyrunning water a navy in germ and could have sat without danger thirty men like me we stood on the bank side by side eyeing her vacancy and i can answer for myself nightthoughts rose up in us at sight of her was it indeed only wind in the reeds that sighed around us only the restless water insistently whispering and calling only of darkness were these forbidding shadows  i looked up sharply at the doctor from such pensive embroidery and found him as far away as i he nodded and smiled and we shook hands on the bank in the thick mist  theres biscuits and a little meat wine and fruit he said in an undertone god be with you sir i sadly mistrust the future  tis ever my way at parting  we said goodbye again to the dreamcry of some little fluttering creature of the rushes and well before dawn i was floating midstream my friend a memory rosinante in clover and my travels so far as this brief narrative will tell nearly ended  i saw nothing but a few longhaired grazing cattle on my voyage that eyed me but cursorily i passed unmolested among the waterfowl between the neversilent rushes beneath a sky refreshed and sweetened with storm the boat was enormously heavy and made slow progress when too the tide began to flow i must needs push close in to the bank and await the ebb but towards evening of the third day i began to approach the sea  i listened to the wailing of its longwinged gulls snuffed with how broadnostrilled a gusto that savour not even pinewoods can match nor any wild flower disguise and heard at last the sound that stirs beneath all musicthe deeps loudfalling billow  i pushed ashore climbed the sandy bank and moored my boat to an ash tree at the waterside and after scrambling some little distance over dunes yet warm with the sun i came out at length and stood like a greek before the sea  here my bright river disembogued in noise and foam far to either side of me stretched the faint gold horns of a bay and beyond me almost violet in the shadow of its waves the shipless sea  i looked on the breaking water with a divided heart its light salt airs its solitary beauty its illimitable reaches seemed tidings of a region i could remember only as one who remembering that he has dreamed remembers nothing more larks rose singing behind me in a calm golden light my eager river quarrelled with its peace here indeed was solitude  it was in searching sea and cliff for the least sign of life that i thought i descried on the furthest extremity of the nearer of the horns of the bay the spires and smouldering domes of a little city if i gazed intently they seemed to vanish away yet still to shine above the azure if raising my eyes i looked again  so caring not how far i must go so long as my path lay beside these breaking waters i set out on the firm white sands to prove this city the mirage i deemed it  what wonder then my senses fell asleep in that vast lullaby and out of a daydream almost as deep as that in which i first set out i was suddenly aroused by a light tapping sound distinct and regular between the roaring breakers  i lifted my eyes to find the city i was seeking evanished away indeed but nearer at hand a child was playing upon the beach whose spade among the pebbles had caused the birdlike noise i had heard  so engrossed was she with her building in the sand that she had not heard me approaching she laboured on at the margin of the cliffs shadow where the seabirds cried answering echo in the rocks so solitary and yet so intent so sedate and yet so eager a little figure she seemed in the long motionlessness of the shore by the dark heedlessness of the sea i hesitated to disturb her  who of all times children could this be playing uncompanioned by the sea and at a little distance betwixt me and her in the softlymounded sand her spade had already scrawled in large ungainly capitals the answerannabel lee the little flounced black frock the tresses of black hair the small beautiful dark facethis then was annabel lee and that bright phantom city i had seenthat was the vanishing mockery of her kingdom  i called her from where i stoodannabel lee she lifted her head and shook back her hair and gazed at me startled and intent i went nearer  you are a very lonely little girl i said  i am building in the sand she answered  a castle  she shook her head  it was in dreams she said flushing darkly  what kind of dream was it in then  oh i often dream it and i build it in the sand but theres never time the sea comes back  was the tide quite high when you began i asked for now it was low  just that much from the stones she said i waited for it ever so long  it has a long way to come yet i said you will finish it this time i dare say  she shook her head and lifted her spade  oh no it is much bigger more than twice and i havent the seaweed or the shells and it comes back very very quickly  but where is the little boy you play with down here by the sea  she glanced at me swiftly and surely and shook her head again  he would help you  he didnt in my dream she said doubtfully she raised long stealthy eyes to mine and spoke softly and deliberately besides there isnt any little boy  none annabel lee i said  why she answered i have played here years and years and years and there are only the gulls and terns and cormorants and that she pointed with her spade towards the broken water  you know all their names then i said  some i know she answered with a little frown and looked far out to sea then turning her eyes she gazed long at me searchingly forlornly on a stranger i am going home now she said  i looked at the house of sand and smiled but she shook her head once more  it never could be finished she said firmly though i tried and tried unless the sea would keep quite still just once all day without going to and fro and then she added with a flash of angerthen i would not build  well said i when it is nearly finished and the water washes up and up and washes it away here is a flower that came from fairyland and that dear heart is none so far away  she took the purple flower i had plucked in ennuis garden in her slim cold hand  its amaranth she said and i have never seen so old a little look in a childs eyes  and all the flowers names too i said  she frowned again its amaranth she said and ran off lightly and so deftly among the rocks and in the shadow that was advancing now even upon the foam of the sea that she had vanished before i had time to deter or to pursue her i sought her awhile until the dark rack of sunset obscured the light and the seas voice changed then i desisted  it was useless to remain longer beneath the looming caves among the stones of so inhospitable a shore i was a stranger to the tides and it was clear highwater would submerge the narrow sands whereon i stood  yet i cannot describe how loth i was to leave to nights desolation the shapeless house of a child what fate was this that had set her to such profitless labour on the uttermost shores of tragedy what history lay behind past or as it were never to come what gladness too high for earth had nearly once been hers her seamound took strange shapes in the gloomlight foliage of stone dark heaviness of granite wherein rumour played of all that restless rustling small cries vast murmurings from those green meadows old as night  i turned even ran away at last i found my boat in the gloaming where i had left her safe and sound except that all the doctors good things had been nosed and tumbled by some hungry beast in my absence i stood and thought vacantly of crusoe and pig and guns but what use to delay i got in  if it were true as the excellent doctor had informed me that seamen reported islands not far distant from these shores chance might bear me blissfully to one of these and if not true  i turned a rather startled face to the water and made haste not to think fortune pierces deep and baits her hooks with sceptics away i went bobbing mightily over the waves that leapt and wrestled where sea and river met these safely navigated i rowed the great creature straight forward across the sea my face towards dwindling land my prow to scorpio     xvi      art thou pale for weariness      percy bysshe shelley   the constellations of summer wheeled above me and thus between water and starry sky i tossed solitary in my boat the faint lustre of the sultry night hung like a mist from heaven to earth far away above the countries i had left perhaps for ever the quiet lightnings played innocently in the heights  i rowed steadily on guiding myself by some much ruddier star on the horizon the pale phosphorescence on the wave the simple sounds as of fish stirring in the waterthe beauty and wonder of nights dwellingplace seemed beyond content of mortality  i leaned on my oars in the midst of the deep sea and seemed to hear as it were the mighty shout of space faint and enormous beams of light trembled through the sky and once i surprised a shadow as of wings sweeping darkly across star on to glittering star shaking the air stilling the sea with the cold dews of night  so rowing so resting i passed the mark of midnight weariness began to steal over me between sleep and wake i heard strange cries across the deep the thin silver of the old moon ebbed into the east a chill mist welled out of the water and shrouded me in faintest gloom wherefore battling no more against such influences i shipped my oars made my prayer in the midst of this dark womb of life and screening myself as best i could from the airs that soon would be moving before dawn i lay down in the bottom of the boat and fell asleep  i slept apparently without dream and woke as it seemed to the sound of voices singing some old music of the sea a scent of a fragrance unknown to me was eddying in the wind i raised my head and saw with eyes halfdazed with light an island of cypress and poplar green and still above the pure glass of its encircling waters straight before me beyond greenbearded rocks dripping with foam a little stone house or temple with columns and balconies of marble stood hushed upon the cliff by the waterside  all now was soundless they that sang whether nereids or sirens had descended to dimmer courts the seamews floated on the water the white dove strutted on the ledge only the nightingales sang on in the thick arbours  i pushed my boat between the rocks towards the island bright and burning though the beams of the sun were here seemed everlasting shadow and though at my gradual intrusion at splash or grating of keel the startled cormorant cried in the air and with one cry woke many yet here too seemed perpetual stillness  how could i know what eyes might not be regarding me from bowers as thick and secluded as these yet this seemed an isle in some vague fashion familiar to me to these same watery steps of stone to this same mooringring surely i had voyaged before in dream or other life i glanced into the water and saw my own fantastic image beneath the reflected gloom of cypresses and knew at least though i a shadow might be this also was an island in a sea of shadows far from all land its marbles might be reared yet they were warm to my touch and these were nightingales and those strutting doves beneath the little arches  so very gradually and glancing to and fro into these unstirring groves i came presently to the entrance court of the solitary villa on the cliffside here a threadlike fountain plashed in its basin the one thing astir in this cool retreat here too grew orange trees with their unripe fruit upon them  but i continued and venturing out upon the terrace overlooking the sea saw again with a kind of astonishment the doctors green unwieldy boat beneath me and the emerald of the nearer waters tossing above the yellow sands  here i had sat awhile lost in ease when i heard a footstep approaching and the rhythmical rustling of drapery and knew eyes were now regarding me that i feared yet much desired to meet  oh me said a clear yet almost languid voice how comes any man so softly  turning i looked in the face of one how long a shade  i strove in vain to hide my confusion this lady only smiled the deeper out of her baffling eyes  if you could guess she said presently how my heart leapt in me as if poor creature any oars of earth could bring it ease you would think me indeed as desolate as i am to hear the bird scream traveller i hastened from the gardens as if the black ships of the greeks were come to take me but such is long ago tell me now is the world yet harsh with men and sad with women burns yet that madness mirth calls life or truly does the puny busytongued race sleep at last nodding no more at me  i told as best i could how chance had fetched me told too that earth was yet pestered with men and heavenly with women and the madness mirth calls life flickers yet i said and the little race tosses on in nightmare  ah she replied so ever run travellers tales i too once trusted to seem indifferent but you if shadow deceives me not may yet return i only to the shades whence earth draws me meanwhile she said looking softly at the fountain playing in the clear gloom beyond rest and grow weary again for there flock more questions to my tongue than spines on the blackthorn the gardens are green with flowers traveller let us talk where rosemary blows  following her i thought of the mysterious beauty of her eyes her pallor her slimness and that faint smile which hovered between ecstasy and indifference and away went my mind to one whom the shrewdest and tenderest of my own countrymen called once criseyde  she led me into a garden all of fainthued flowers there bloomed no scarlet here nor blue nor yellow but white and lavender and purest purple here also like torches of the sun stood poplars each by each in the windless air and the impenetrable darkness of cypresses beneath them  here too was a fountain whose waters leapt no more mossy and timeworn i could not but think of those other gardens of my journeyjanes ennuis dianemes and yet none like this for the shingley murmur of the sea and the calmness of morning  but surely i said this must be very far from troy  far indeed she said  far also from the hollow ships  far also from the hollow ships she replied  yet said i in the country whence i come is a saying where the treasure is  alack there gloats the miser said criseyde but i traveller have no treasure only a patchwork memory and thats a great grief  well then forget why try in vain i said  she smiled and seated herself leaning a little forward looking upon the ground  soothfastness must she said very gravely raising her long black eyebrows yet truly it must be a forlorn thing to be remembered by one who so lightly forgets so then i say to teach myself to be truelook now criseyde yonder fine manyhearted poplarthat is paris and all that bank of marriageivythat is marriageable helen green and cold and the waterless fountainthat truly is diomed and the faded flower that nods in shadow why that must be me even me criseyde  and this thick rosemarybush that smells of exile who then is that i said  she looked deep into the shadow of the cypresses that she said i think i have forgot again  but i said diomed now was he quite so silentnot one trickle of persuasion  why she said i think twas the fountain was diomed i know not and as for persuasion he was a man forked vain and absolute as all let the waterless stone be sudden diomedyou will confuse my wits mariner where then were i she smiled stooping lower you have voyaged far she said  from childhood to this side regret i answered rather sadly  tis a sad end to a sweet tale she said were it but truly told but yet and yet and yetyou may return and life heals every every wound i must look on the ground and make amends tis this same making amends men now call purgatory they tell me  amends i said to whom for what  welaway said she with a narrow fork between her brows to most men and to all women for being that criseyde she gazed half solemnly at some picture of reverie  but which criseyde i said she who was every winds or but one perfect summers  she glanced strangely at me ask of the night that burns so many stars she said alls done all passes yet my poor busy uncle pandar had no such changes nor hector nor  men change not they love and love againone same tune of a myriad verses  all i said  she tossed lightly a little dust from her hand  nayall she replied but what is that to me mine only to see charon on the wave pass light over and return man of the green world prithee die not yet awhile tis dull being a shade see these cold palms yet my heart beats on  for what i said  criseyde folded her hands and leaned her cheek sidelong upon the stone  for what i repeated  for what but idle questions she said for a travellers vanity that deems looking loveboys into a womans eyes her sweeter entertainment than all the heroes of troy oh for a house of nought to be at peace in oh gooseish swan oh brittle vows tell me voyager is it not sothat men are merely angry boys with beards and womenrepeat not ye who know never yet set i these steadfast eyes on a man that would not steal the moon for taperwould she but come down she turned an arch face to me and what is to be faithful  i said ito be faithful  it is she said to rise and never set o sun of utter weariness it is to kindle and never be quenched o fretting fire of midsummer it is to be snared and always sing o shrilling bird of dulness it is to come not go smile not sigh wake never sleep couldst thou love so many nots to a silk string  what then is to change to be fickle i said  ah to be fickle she said is showers after drought seas after sand to cry unechoed to be thirsty the pitcher broken andask now this pitiless darkness of the eyesto be remembered though lethe flows between nay you shall watch even hope away ere another comes like me to mope and sigh and play at swords with memory  she rose to her feet and drew her hands across her face and smiling sighed deeply and i saw how inscrutable and lovely she must ever seem to eyes scornful of mean mens idolatries  and you will embark again she said softly and in how small a ship on seas so mighty and whither next will fate entice you to what new sorrows  who knows i said and to what further peace  she laughed lightly speak not of mockeries she said and fell silent  she seemed to be thinking quickly and deeply for even though i did not turn to her i could see in imagination the restless sparkling of her eyes the stillness of her ringless hands then suddenly she turned  stranger she said drawing her finger softly along the cold stone of the bench there yet remain a few bright hours to morning who knows seeing that felicity is with the bold did i cast off into the seawho knows whereto id come tis but a little way to being happya touch of the hand a lifting of the brows a shuddering silence had i but mans courage yet this is a solitary place and the gods are revengeful  i cannot say how artlessly ran that voice in this still garden by some strange power persuading me on turning all doubt aside calming all suspicion  there is honeycomb here and the fruit is plenteous yes she said and all travellers are violent mencatch and kill meatthat i know however doleful tis but a little sigh from day to day in these cool gardens and rest is welcome when the heart pines not listen now i will go down and you shall show medid one have the wit to learn and courage to remembershow me how sails your wonderful little ship tell me too where on the seas horizon to one in exile earth lies with all its pleasant thingsyet thinks so bitterly of a woman  tell me i said tell me but one thing of a thousand whom would you seek did a traveller direct you and a boat were at your need  she looked at me pondering weaving her webs about me lulling doubt and banishing fear  one could not missa hero she said flaming  that then shall be our bargain i replied with wrath at my own folly tell me this precious heros name and though all the dogs of the underworld come to course me you shall take my boat and leave me hereonly this heros name a pedlars bargain  she lowered her lids it must be diomed she said with the least sigh  it must be i said  nay then antenor or truly thersites she said happily the silvertongued  goodbye then i said  goodbye she replied very gently why how could there be a vow between us i go and return you await meme criseyde traveller the lonelyhearted that is the little all o muchsurrendering stranger would that longago were nowbefore all chaffering  again a thousand questions rose to my tongue she looked sidelong at the dry fountain and one and all fell silent  it is harsh endless labour beneath the burning sun storms and whirlwinds go about the sea and the deep heaves with monsters  oh sweet danger she said mocking me  i turned from her without a word like an angry child and made my way to the steps into the sea pulled round my boat into a little haven beside them and shewed her oars and tackle and tiller all the toil and peril the wild chances  why she cried while i was yet full of the theme i will go then at once and tomorrow troy will come  i looked long at her in silence her slim beauty the answerless riddle of her eyes the agelong subtilty of her mouth and gave no more thought to all life else  day was already waning i filled the waterkeg with fresh water put fruit and honeycomb and a pillow of leaves into the boat proffered a trembling hand and led her down  the suns beams slanted on the foamless sea glowed in a flame of crimson on marble and rock and cypress the birds sang endlessly on of evening endlessly too it seemed to me of dangers my heart had no surmise of  criseyde turned from the dark green waves truly it is a solitary country pathless she said to one unpiloted and stood listening to the hollow voices of the water and suddenly as if at the consummation of her thoughts she lifted her eyes on me darkly with unimaginable entreaty  what do you seek else i cried in a voice i scarcely recognised oh you speak in riddles  i sprang into the boat and seized the heavy oars something like laughter or as it were the clapper of a scarer of birds echoed among the rocks at the rattling of the rowlocks as if invisible hands withdrew it from me the island floated back  i turned my prow towards the last splendour of the sun a chill breeze played over the sea a shadow crossed my eyes  buoyant was my boat how light her cargoan oozing honeycomb ashy fruits a few branches of drooping leaves closing flowers and solitary on the thwart the wraith of lifes unquiet dream  so fell night once more and made all dim and only the cold light of the firmament lit thoughts in me restless as the sea on which i tossed whose moon was dark yet walked in heaven beneath the distant stars    printed and bound by hazell watson  viney ld london and aylesbury
