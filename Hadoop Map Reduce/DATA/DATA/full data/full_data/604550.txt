confederacy was broken is one of the most stirring pages of the campaigns which begun by clive ended in the firm establishment of our great empire in the indian peninsula when the struggle began the mahrattas were masters of no small portion of india their territory comprising the whole country between bombay and delhi and stretching down from rajputana to allahabad while in the south they were lords of the district of cuttack thereby separating madras from calcutta the jealousies of the great mahratta leaders holkar and scindia who were constantly at war with each other or with the peishwa at poona greatly facilitated our operations and enabled us although at the cost of much blood to free a large portion of india from a race that was a scourgefaithless intriguing and crafty cruel and reckless of life the mahrattas conquering race as they were yet failed in the one virtue of courage they could sweep the land with hordes of wild horsemen could harry peaceful districts and tyrannize over the towns they conquered but they were unable to make an effective stand against british bayonets and british sabres they were a race of freebooters and even the most sentimental humanitarian can feel no regret at the overthrow of a power that possessed no single claim to our admiration and weighed like an incubus upon the peoples it oppressed the history of the mahrattas as written by grant duff whose account i have throughout followed is one long record of perfidy murder and crime of all sorts    chapter 1 a faithful nurse   on a swell of ground in the wild country extending from bombay to the foot of the ghauts stood a small camp in the centre was a large pavilion the residence for the time of major lindsay an officer whose charge was to keep the peace in the district it was no easy matter the inhabitants wild and lawless lived in small villages scattered about the rough country for the most part covered with forest and subject to depredations by the robber bands who had their strongholds among the hills major lindsay had with him a party of twenty troopers not for defencethere was little fear of attack by the natives of the concanbut to add to his authority to aid in the collection of the small tax paid by each community and to deter the mountain robbers from descending on to the plain he generally spent the cool season in going his rounds while during the hot weather his headquarters were at bombay  he had with him his wife and infant child the child was some three months old and was looked after by an ayah who had been in major lindsays service ten years for three elder children had been born to himall however dying from the effects of the climate before reaching the age of five the ayah had nursed each in succession and had become greatly attached to the family especially to her youngest charge she had come to speak english well but with the child she always talked in her native tongue as the major saw the advantage it would prove to the boy when he grew up to be able to speak fluently one at least of the native languages  the nurse was a mahratta she had been in the service of the british resident at poona and when he was recalled had entered that of major lindsay at that time a captain who acted as secretary to the resident  a young officer from bombay had just ridden out to spend a day or two with the major and was sitting with him at the entrance to the tent  the news from the army he said is most unsatisfactory as you know to the astonishment of everyone colonel egerton was appointed to the command in spite of the fact that he was so infirm as to be altogether unfit for active service and mostyn our late resident at poona and carnac accompanied him as deputies of the council  that is altogether a bad arrangement the major said it has always been a great disadvantage for a general to be accompanied by civilians with power to thwart his combinations against mostyns appointment no one could raise any objection as having been for some years at poona he understands the mahrattas and indeed is much liked by them so that in any negotiations he would have far more chance of success than a stranger but carnac is hot headed and obstinate with a very high idea of his own importance and it is certain that there will be difficulties between him and egerton  i am sorry to say major that these anticipations were very speedily verified as you know the advance party landed at aptee on november 23rd and seized the roads over the gorge and on the 25th the main body disembarked at panwell no sooner had they got there than there was a quarrel between egerton and carnac most unfortunately mostyn who would have acted as mediator was taken ill on the very day after landing and was obliged to return to bombay and i hear there is hardly any chance of his recovery the army did not reach the top of the ghauts till the 23rd of decemberinstead of at the latest three days after landingand actually spent eleven days before it arrived at karlee only eight miles in advance of the bhore ghauts of course this encouraged the enemy and gave plenty of time for them to assemble and make all their arrangements and when we last heard they were harassing our march for the past two days no news has arrived and there seems to be little doubt that the mahrattas have closed in round their rear and cut off all communications  it is monstrous that they should march so slowly the whole thing has been a hideous blunder and the idea of encumbering a force of four thousand men with something like thirty thousand camp followers and with a train of no less than nineteen thousand bullocks to say nothing of other draught animals is the most preposterous thing i ever heard of in fact the whole thing has been grossly mismanaged  i dont say that the conduct of the mahrattas has not for some time been doubtful if not threatening it is well known that the governor general and the council at calcutta have most strongly disapproved of the whole conduct of the council at bombay indeed no explanation has ever been given as to why they took up the cause of rugoba the scoundrel who grasped the crown and who was privy to if he did not instigate the murder of his nephew the young peishwa  he was not unopposed for nana furnuwees and hurry punt two of the leading mahratta ministers formed a regency under gunga bye the widow of the murdered peishwa while matters were undecided the bombay council opened communications with rugoba who they thought was likely to be successful and promised to assist him if he would advance a considerable sum of money and cede to the company salsette the small islands contiguous to bombay and bassein which had been captured from the portuguese by the mahrattasan altogether inexcusable arrangement as the mahrattas were at peace with us and rugoba was not in a position to hand the islands over that matter however was settled by sending an expedition which captured salsette and tannah in 1775 four years ago since then rugoba has become a fugitive and without a shadow of reason is making war against the whole force of the mahratta confederacy who although divided amongst themselves and frequently engaged in the struggles for supremacy have united against usfor they say that scindia holkar and hurry punt are in command of their army to send four thousand men of whom less than six hundred are europeans against the whole mahratta power is a desperate step  i know we have fought and won against greater odds many times in the history of india but our forces have always been well led marched with the smallest amount of baggage possible and made up for inferiority in numbers by speed activity and dash here on the contrary we have a force hampered to an unheardof degree by baggage and camp followers with an invalid at its head controlled by two civilians and moving at a rate which in itself testifies to divided councils and utter incompetency on the part of its commander it is almost impossible even to hope for success under such conditions  the lookout is certainly bad the younger officer agreed however before now the fighting powers of the british soldier have made up for the blunders of his commanders and we may hope that this will be the case now  if a disaster happen the major said we shall have the mahrattas down at the gates of bombay and as soon as i hear a rumour of itand news travels wonderfully fast among the nativesi shall return to the city  oh i dont think you need fear anything of that sort major besides this is not on the direct line between the ghauts and the city and even if they find they cannot push on i should say our force would be able to secure their retreat the mahratta horse will never be able to break our squares but of course in that case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage animals  i agree with you that the mahrattas would doubtless hang on the skirts of our force and follow them down the bhore ghaut and so would not come anywhere near us but they might detach flying parties to burn and plunder as is their custom brave as they are the mahrattas do not fight for the love of fighting but simply from the hope of plunder and of enlarging their territories  well we may hope in a day or two to hear that a battle has been fought and that a victory has been won not that one victory would settle the matter for the mahratta force consists almost entirely of cavalry and as we have only a handful they would if beaten simply ride off and be ready to fight again another day if we had pushed on and occupied poona directly we landedwhich should have been easy enough if the baggage train had been left behind for it is but forty miles from panwell to the mahratta capitalthe position would have been altogether different the mahrattas would not have had time to collect their forces and we should probably have met with no opposition and once in poona could have held it against the whole mahratta force besides it is certain that some of the chiefs seeing that rugoba was likely to be made peishwa would have come to the conclusion that it would be best for them to side with him  of course the baggage should all have been left at panwell and in that case the force could have entered poona three days after landing instead of delaying from the 25th of november until today the 7th of january and even now at their present rate of advance they may be another fortnight before they arrive at poona i dont think there has been so disgraceful a business since we first put foot in india  at any rate i shall send mary and the child down to bombay tomorrow it is all very well to have her with me when everything is peaceable but although i do not think there is any actual risk it is as well that in turbulent times like these with nothing but a force under such incompetent leading between us and a powerful and active enemy she should be safe at bombay  just before daybreak next morning there was a sudden shout from one of the sentries who had for the first time been posted round the camp the warning was followed by a fierce rush and a large body of horse and foot charged into the camp the escort were for the most part killed as they issued from their tents the major and his friend were shot down as they sallied out sword in hand the same fate befell mrs lindsay  then the mahrattas proceeded to loot the camp the ayah had thrust the child underneath the wall of the tent at the first alarm a mahratta seized her and would have cut her down had she not recognized him by the light of the lamp which hung from the tent ridge  why cousin sufder she exclaimed do you not know me  he loosed his hold and stood back and gazed at her  why soyera he exclaimed is it you it is more than ten years since i saw you  it is my cousin he said to some of his companions who were standing round my mothers sisters child  dont be alarmed he went on to the woman no one will harm you i am one of the captains of this party  i must speak to you alone sufder  she went outside the tent with him  you have nothing to fear he said you shall go back with us to jooneer i have a house there and you can stay with my wife besides there are many of your people still alive  but that is not all sufder i was ayah to the major and his wifewhom your people have just killed and whom i loved dearlyand in my charge is their child he is but a few months old and i must take him with me  it is impossible sufder replied no white man woman or child would be safe in the deccan at present  no one would see his face the woman said i would wrap him up and will give out that he is my own child as soon as we get up the ghauts i would stain his face and skin and no one would know that he was white if you will not let me do it tell your men to cut me down i should not care to live if the child were gone as well as his father and mother you cannot tell how kind they were to me you would not have me ungrateful would you sufder  well well the man said good naturedly though somewhat impatiently do as you like but if any harm comes of it mind it is not my fault  thankful for the permission soyera hurried round to the back of the tent picked up the child and wrapped it in her robe and then when after firing the place the mahrattas retired she fell in behind them and followed them in the toilsome climb up the mountains keeping so far behind that none questioned her once or twice sufder dropped back to speak to her  it is a foolish trick of yours he said and i fear that trouble will come of it  i dont see why it should she replied the child will come to speak mahratta and when he is stained none will guess that he is english in time i may be able to restore him to his own people  the other shook his head  that is not likely he said for before many weeks we shall have driven them into the sea  then he must remain a mahratta she said until he is able to make his way to join the english in madras or calcutta  you are an obstinate woman and always have been so else you would not have left your people to go to be servant among the whites however i will do what i can for you for the sake of my mothers sister and of our kinship  on the way up the hills soyera stopped several times to pick berries when they halted she went aside and pounded them and then boiled them in some water in a lotaa copper vesselsufder lent her for the purpose and dyed the childs head and body with it producing a colour corresponding to her own  the party which was composed of men from several towns and villages broke up the next morning  have you money sufder asked her as she was about to start alone on her journey  yes my savings were all lodged for me by major lindsay with some merchants at bombay but i have twenty rupees sewn up in my garments  as to your savings soyera you are not likely to see them again for we shall make a clean sweep of bombay however twenty rupees will be useful to you and would keep you for three or four months if you needed but as you are going to my wife you will not want them  take this dagger when you show it to her she will know that you come from me but mind she is like most women given to gossip therefore i warn you not to let her into the secret of this childs birth for if you did so half the town would know it in the course of a day or two  now i must go back with my men to join a party who are on their way to fight the english i should have gone there direct but met the others starting on this marauding expedition which was so much to the taste of my men that i could not restrain them from joining i shall see you at jooneer as soon as matters are finished with the english then i shall after staying a few days there rejoin scindia in whose service i am  soyera started on her way at the villages through which she passed she was questioned as to where she came from and replied that she had been living down near bombay but now that the english were going to fight the mahrattas she was coming home having lost her husband a few months before  as the road to jooneer diverged widely from that to poona she was asked no questions about the war all were confident that the defeat of the english was certain now that scindia and holkar and the government of the peishwa had laid aside their mutual jealousies and had joined for the purpose of crushing the whites  on arriving after two days journey at jooneer she went to the address that sufder had given her but was coldly received by his wife  as it is sufders order of course i must take you in she said but when he returns i shall tell him that i do not want another woman and child in the house why do you not go to your own people as you are sufders cousin you must be the sister of ramdass why should you not go to him  i will gladly do so if you will tell me where he lives  he has a small farm you must have passed it as you came along it is about a mile from here  i will go to him at once soyera said  no no the woman exclaimed that will never do you must stop a day or two here sufder would be angry indeed were he to find that you did not remain here and would blame me for it i should be willing enough for you to stay a week or a month that is a different thing from becoming an inmate of the house  i will wait till tomorrow for i have made a long two days journey from the top of the ghauts and as i am not accustomed to walking my feet are sore in the morning i will go and see my brother i did not so much as know that he was alive i feel sure he will take me in willingly for he is but two years older than myself and was always kind to me  accordingly the next morning she retraced her steps and had no difficulty in finding the farm of ramdass choosing the time when he would be likely to be in for his dinner soyera walked up to the door of the house which was standing open  as she stood there hesitating ramdass came out he was a man of some forty years of age with a pleasant and kindly face he looked at her enquiringly  do you not know me ramdass she asked  why tis soyera he exclaimed and so you have come back after all these yearsthirteen is it not since you went away  welcome back little sister and he raised his voice and called anundee  a young woman two or three and twenty years of age came to the door  wife he said this is my sister soyera of whom you have often heard me speak  soyera this is my wife we have been married six years but come in and let us talk things over  you have come home for good i hope he said so you too have married and as you come alone with your child have i suppose had the misfortune to lose your husband  yes i was alone in the world and came hither not knowing whether you were alive or dead but feeling sure of a welcome if i found you  and you were not mistaken he said heartily  anundee you will i am sure join me in the welcome and willingly give my sister and her child a place in our home  assuredly it will be pleasant for me when you are in the fields to have some one to talk to and perhaps to help me about the house  soyera saw that she was speaking sincerely  thank you anundee you may be sure that i shall not be idle i have been accustomed to work and can take much off your hands and will look after your two children for two boys three or four years old were standing before her staring at the newcomer  that will be pleasant soyera indeed sometimes they hinder me much in my work  i am accustomed to children anundee as i was for years nurse to english children and know their ways  well now let us to dinner ramdass broke in i am hungry and want to be off again there is much to do in the fields  the woman took a pot off the embers of a wood fire and poured its contents into a dish the meal consisted of a species of pulse boiled with ghee with peppers and other condiments added  and how did you like being among the english soyera  i liked it very well the woman said they are very kind and considerate to nurses and although they get angry when the gorrawallah or other men neglect their duty they do not punish them as a mahratta master would do they are not double faced when they say a thing they mean it and their word can always be trusted as a people no doubt they are anxious to extend their dominion but they do not wish to do so for personal gain they are not like the princes here who go to war to gain territory and revenue it was reasonable that they should wish to increase their lands for they are almost shut up in bombay with salsette and the other islands occupied by us who may any day be their enemies  her brother laughed  it seems to me soyera that you have come to prefer these english people to your own countrymen  i say not that ramdass you asked me how i liked them and i have told you you yourself know how the tax collectors grind down the people how scindia and holkar and the peishwa are always fighting each other do you know that in bombay the meanest man could not be put to death unless fairly tried while among the mahrattas men are executed on the merest excuse or if not executed are murdered  that is true enough ramdass said none of the three princes would hesitate to put to death anyone who stood in his way and it seems strange to me that even the brahmins who would not take the life even of a troublesome insect yet support the men who have killed scores of other people but it is no use grumbling the thing has always been and i suppose always will be it is not only so in the deccan but in the nizams dominions in mysore and so far as i know in oude and delhi it seems so natural to us that the powerful should oppress the weak and that one prince should go to war with another that we hardly give the matter a thought but though as you say the english in bombay may rule wisely and dislike taking life they are doing now just as our princes dothey are making war with us  that is true but from what i have heard when the english sahibs were speaking together it is everything to them that a prince favourable to them should rule at poonah for were holkar and scindia to become all powerful and place one of their people on the seat of the peishwa the next step might be that a great mahratta force would descend the ghauts capture bombay and slay every white man in it  but they are a mere handful ramdass said how can they think of invading a nation like ours  because they know at least they believe that scindia holkar and the peishwa are all so jealous of each other that they will never act together then you see what they have done round madras and bengal and few as they are they have won battles against the great princes and lastly my mistress has told me that although there are but few here there are many at home and they could if they chose send out twenty soldiers for every one there is here  besides it is not these alone who fight the natives enlist under them and aid them in their conquests and this shows at least that they are well treated and have confidence in the good faith of the english  it is all very well soyera to talk that way but i would as willingly believe that the stars will fall from the sky as that these englishmen who simply live in bombay because we suffer them to do so should ever conquer the mahrattas as they have subdued other portions of india where as everyone knows the people are not warlike and have always been conquered without difficulty  look at our power at delhi the emperor is a puppet in our hands and it is the same in all the districts on the plain of the great river the rajpoots fear us and even the pindaries would not dare carry their raids into our country that a small body of merchants and soldiers should threaten us seems to me altogether absurd  well brother we will not argue about it time will show as a woman of the mahrattas i trust that day will never come but as one who knows the english i have my fears of one thing i am sure that were they masters here the cultivators would be vastly better off than they are at present  ramdass laughed  what do you think of my sisters opinions anundee  i do not know what to think the young woman said but soyera has seen much and is a wise woman and what she says are no idle words to us it seems impossible when we know that the mahrattas can place a hundred thousand horsemen in the field but i own that from what we know of the english it might be better for people like us to have such masters  and now soyera ramdass said when he returned from his work in the evening tell us more about yourself first how did you learn where i was living  i learned it from the wife of our cousin sufder  how did you fall in with him  well i must tell you something i had meant to keep it entirely to myself but i know that you and anundee will keep my secret  assuredly we will i am not a man to talk of other peoples affairs and as to anundee you can trust her with your life  well in the first place i deceived you or rather you deceived yourself when you said i see that you have been married but the children were here and so i could not explain the infant is not mine it is the son of my dear master and mistress both of whom were killed three days ago by bandsof which sufder commanded onewho attacked them suddenly by night  what is the child white ramdass asked in a tone of alarm  it is not white because i have stained the skin but it is the child of english parents i will tell you how it happened  and she related the instances of the attack upon the little camp the death of her master and mistress another white officer and all their escort told how she had hidden the child under the cover of the tent how sufder had saved her life and her subsequent conversation with him regarding the child  now what do you intend to do with him soyera  i intend to bring him up as my own i shall keep his skin stained and no one can suspect that he is not mine  then you do not think of restoring him to his people  not until he grows up he has neither father nor mother and to whom could i hand him now moreover if as you say our people intend to drive the english from bombay his fate would be certain when i am by myself with him i shall talk to him in english as soon as he is old enough to understand that he must not speak in that language to others then when he joins his own people he will be able to converse with them in the ten years i have spent in english service i have come to speak their language well though i cannot teach him the knowledge of the english i can do much to fit him to take his place as an englishman when the time comes  it is a risky business her brother said but i do not say that it cannot be carried out at any rate since you have so decided to keep him i can see no better plan  two days later sufder came in  so you got here safely soyera  yes i had no trouble but i did not expect you back so soon  the matter is all settled though i think we were wrong to grant any terms to the english we had them in our power and should have finished the matter straight off  delay and inactivity the natural consequences of utter incompetence and of divided councillors had occurred colonel egerton in consequence of sickness had resigned the command and had been succeeded by lieutenant colonel cockburn on the 9th of january they were within eighteen miles of poona and they had still three weeks provisions with them two or three skirmishes had taken place but without any result yet mr carnac without having suffered any reverse and now within a days march of the capital proposed that a retreat should be made at once  the proposal was combated by captain hartley a gallant young officer and mr holmes of the civil service cockburn being called upon for his opinion said he had no doubt the army could penetrate to poona but that it would be impossible for it to protect its enormous baggage train mr carnac however persisted in his opinion in spite of the prayers of rugoba and at eleven oclock on the night of the 11th of january the heavy guns were thrown into a large pool a quantity of stores burnt and the force began its retreat in face of enemies estimated differently at from fifty to a hundred thousand men  against such vigilant foes there was but little hope indeed that the movement would be unnoticed and at two oclock in the morning a party of horse attacked the advance guard cockburn sent forward two companies of europeans to support them but the mahrattas had succeeded in plundering part of the baggage  in a very short time the rear was also attacked this was covered by some six companies of sepoys with two guns commanded by captain hartley these received the charge of the enemys horse and foot with great steadiness and several times took the offensive and drove their assailants back  when morning broke the little force found themselves altogether surrounded by the whole army of the mahrattas hartleys sepoys were now sorely pressed but still maintained their position and were reinforced by five companies of europeans and two more companies of sepoys with this support hartley beat off every attack at ten oclock he received orders from colonel cockburn to retreat but the officer who carried the message returned begging that he would allow captain hartley to await a more favourable opportunity cockburn agreed to this but sent major frederick to take command of the rear with orders to retire on the main body this movement he effected without serious loss and joined the rest of the force at the village of wurgaom  it was already crowded with camp followers and the wildest confusion reigned the enemys horse took advantage of this and charged through the baggage and the troops were unable to act with effect being mixed up with the crowd of fugitives however they soon extricated themselves drove off the enemy and placed the guns in commanding positions round the village at four oclock the enemy retired  early the next morning the mahratta artillery opened fire on the village some of the sepoy troops now became dispirited but hartleys men stood firm and the mahrattas did not venture to attack the loss on the previous day was found to amount to three hundred and fiftytwo killed wounded or missing including many who had deserted during the night among the killed and wounded were fifteen european officers whose loss was a great misfortune for although the sepoys fight well under their european officers they lose heart altogether if not so led  mr palmer the secretary of the committee was now sent to negotiate with the enemy the first demand made was the surrender of rugoba which the committee would have agreed to but rugoba had privately arranged to surrender to scindia the next demand was that the committee should enter on a treaty for the surrender of the greater part of the territory of the bombay government together with the revenue of broach and surat these terms were so hard that even the craven committee who were entirely responsible for the disaster hesitated to accept them  cockburn was asked whether a retreat was wholly impracticable and he declared that it was so captain hartley protested against this opinion and showed how a retreat could be managed his opinion was altogether overruled and mr holmes was sent with powers to conclude the treatywhich however the committee never intended to observe  scindia took the principal part in arranging the details superseding the authority of nana furnuwees the peishwas minister scindias favour was purchased by a private promise to bestow upon him the english share of broach besides a sum of fortyone thousand rupees as presents to his servants  for their share in this miserable business mr carnac colonel egerton and colonel cockburn were dismissed from the companys service and captain hartley was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel the governor of bombay refused to ratify the treaty on the ground that the officials with the expedition had no power whatever to enter into any arrangement without the matter being previously submitted to and approved by the government fortunately at this moment a force that had been despatched from bengal under colonel goddard to support rugoba was nearing the scene of action and that officer learning the danger to which bombay was exposed took the responsibility and marching from hoosingabad avoided a body of twentytwo thousand horse which had been despatched from poona to cut him off and reached surat without encountering any opposition  this welcome reinforcement materially altered the situation and bombay lay no longer at the mercy of the mahrattas there was now goddards force and the army that had fallen back from poona and what was still more important scindia had by his secret convention deserted the confederacy and it was morally certain that neither the peishwa nor holkar would send his forces against bombay leaving to scindia the power of grasping the supreme authority in the deccan during their absence  in 1779 general goddard who was now in command at bombay entered into negotiations with nana furnuwees these were carried on for some months but were brought to a conclusion by nana declaring that the surrender of salsette and the person of rugoba who was again a fugitive in bombay were preliminaries to any treaty bombay received a reinforcement of a european regiment a battalion of sepoys and a hundred artillerymen from madras but before they arrived goddards force had captured dubhoy and a treaty had been effected  the town of ahmedabad was to be handed over to our ally futteh sing but it declined to surrender and was taken by assault the storming party being commanded by lieutenant colonel hartley  scindia had as usual changed sides and was now operating in conjunction with nana and he and holkar with twenty thousand horse marched to baroda goddard advanced to give battle but scindia to gain time opened negotiations  goddard however was not to be duped the negotiations were broken off and he advanced against the mahrattas their horse as usual charged but were driven back by the artillery fire and routed by a regiment of bengal cavalry scindia however encamped a short distance off but when goddard again advanced to the attack retired  goddard however was not to be drawn into pursuit he captured some small forts and sent colonel hartley to relieve kallan which was being besieged by the mahrattas hartley surprised their camp pursued them for some miles and killed a great number while lieutenant welsh who had been sent forward to relieve suratwhich was threatened by a large mahratta forcedefeated these killed upwards of a hundred and captured their guns while one of scindias detachments on the banks of the nerbuddah was routed by a detachment of bengal sepoys under major forbes  on the other side of india great successes had been gained by a bengal force under the command of captain popham who attacked and routed a body of plundering mahrattas captured by assault the strong fort of lahar and not only carried by surprise the fortress of gwalior regarded by the natives as impregnable but took it without the loss of a single man  in december general goddard laid siege to bassein he and hartley whose force was covering the siege were attacked on the 11th of that month by twenty thousand cavalry and infantry these however were defeated after making several desperate charges and on the following day another battle took place in which the mahrattas were totally routed and their general killed after which bassein surrendered    chapter 2 a strange bringing up   the war went on during the following year but in 1782 peace was concluded in 1784 the mahrattas joined the nizam and the british in an alliance having for its object the overthrow of mysore which state first under hyder ali and afterwards under his son tippoo was a source of danger to all the allies  in the meantime harry lindsay who was now called puntojee had been living quietly on the farm of ramdass and no suspicion whatever had been excited in the minds of the neighbours or of any of the people of jooneer that he was aught but what he seemedthe son of soyera once a week he was restained and even his playmates the two sons of ramdass believed that he was like themselves a young mahratta they knew that sometimes their aunt talked to the child for hours in a strange language but she led them to believe it was the dialect of bombay which she thought it might be useful for him to learn  the child was shrewd and intelligent and strictly obeyed soyeras instructions never on any account to talk in that language with her except when they were alone for she said that if he did so some great misfortune would happen to him  thus at six he was able to speak english and mahratta with equal facility as soon as his hair began to grow it had also been dyed for its colour was fair and would at once have excited attention he was a sturdy boy and had never known a days illness  four more years passed and soyera then revealed to him the fact that she was not as he supposed his mother but that he was of english parents and related to him the manner in which they had come by their death and how she had saved him  the language which you are speaking she said is english i spoke truly when i said it was the language in use in bombay for it is the tongue of the white men there now you will understand why i wanted you not to speak in it to anyone but myself and why i have stained your skin once a week at present we are at peace with the english but there may be war again at any time and in that case were it known that you are white your life would not be safe for a moment or you might be thrown into some dungeon where you would perish miserably  she then explained to him why she had not attempted to take him down to bombay and restore him to his countrymen she had always hoped the time would come when she could do so but until he grew up to manhood it was necessary that he should stay with her for being without friends in bombay he would as a boy be unable to earn his living  the boy was greatly affected at the news there were things that he had never been able to understand especially why soyera should consider it necessary to wash him with dye so often when neither his cousins nor the other children of his acquaintance were so treatedas far as he knew for as he had been strictly charged never to speak of the process which he considered an infliction he had never asked questions of others he had never therefore for a moment suspected that he was not like those around him he knew that he was stronger than other boys of his own age more fond of exercise and leader in all their games but he had accepted this as a natural accident the fact that he belonged to the race that were masters of southern india and had conquered and slain the nabob of bengal was a gratification to him but at present the thought that he might some day have to join them and leave all those he loved behind far overpowered this feeling  i shall never become english if you do not go with me he said you saved my life and have been a mother to me why should i go away from your side to people that i know nothing of whose ways would be all strange to me  it is right that you should do so puntojeei will not call you by your proper name harry lindsay lest it should slip out before others your life should be spent among your own people who i think will some day rule over all india they are a great people with learning of many things unknown here from whom i always received the greatest kindness they are not like the mahrattas always quarrelling among themselves they are not deceitful and they are honourable you should be proud to belong to them and i have no doubt some day you will be so though at present it is natural that knowing no place but this you should not like the thought of leaving  harry lindsay whose spirits had hitherto been almost inexhaustible and who had never been happy when sitting quiet was greatly impressed with what he had heard and for some time he withdrew himself almost entirely from the sports of his friends hiding himself in the groves from their importunities and thinking over the strange position in which he was placed  soyera at last remonstrated with him  if i had thought you would take this matter to heart puntojee i should not have told you about it i did so because i thought you could scarcely be stained much longer without demanding the reason for what must have seemed so strange a thing  i do not want you to withdraw yourself from your playmates or to cease from your games your doing so will if it continues excite talk your friends will think that a spell has fallen upon you and will shun you i want you to grow up such as your father wasstrong and brave and skilful in armsand to do this you must be alert and active it may well be that you should not join your countrymen until you are able to play the part of a man which will not be for ten years yet but you know that my cousin sufder has promised that as soon as you are able to carry arms he will procure a post for you under scindia  there you will learn much and see something of the world whereas if you remain here you would grow up like other cultivators and would make but a bad impression among your countrymen when you join them sufder himself has promised to teach you the use of arms and as all say he is very skilful you could have no better master  at any rate i wish you to resume your former habits to exercise your body in every way so that you may grow up so strong and active that when you join your countrymen they will feel you are well worthy of them they think much of such things and it is by their love for exercise and sport that they so harden their frames that in battle our bravest peoples cannot stand against them  but the mahrattas are strong mother  yes they can stand great fatigues living as they do so constantly on horseback but like all the people of india they are not fond of exercise save when at war that is the difference between us and the english these will get up at daybreak go for long rides hunt the wild boar or the tigers in the jungles of the concan or the bears among the ghauts exercise to them is a pleasure and we in the service of the english have often wondered at the way in which they willingly endure fatigues when they might pass their time sitting quietly in their verandahs but i came to understand that it was to this love of theirs for outdoor exercise that they owed their strength and the firmness of their courage none can say that the mahrattas are not brave but although they will charge gallantly they soon disperse if the day goes against them  so also with the soldiers of tippoo they overran arcot and threatened madras tanjore and the carnatic were all in their hands and yet the english never lost their firmness and little by little drove tippoos troops from the lands they had conquered and it may be that ere long tippoo will be a fugitive and his dominions divided among those whom he has provoked  is it not wonderful that while not very many years ago the whites were merely a handful living on sufferance in calcutta madras and bombay they are now masters of southern india and half of bengal and even venture to engage a great empire like that of the mahrattas stretching from the sea on the west to delhi and holding the mastery over all central india there must be something extraordinary about these men why you would scarce believe it but i have seen often and wondered always when they have an entertainment instead of sitting quietly and having dancing girls to posture for their amusement they dance themselves with their womennot a mere movement of the body and hands such as you see among our dancers but violent dancing exhausting themselves till the perspiration streams from their facesand this both men and women regard as amusement so puntojee if you are to take your place among your countrymen again you must accustom yourself to fatigues and strengthen your body in every way or you will be regarded with contempt as one who although of their blood has grown degenerate and unworthy of them  i will do so the boy said you shall not complain of me again hitherto i have played for amusement and because i liked to exercise my limbs and to show the others that i could run faster and was stronger than they were but in future i shall have a motive in doing so and will strive to be worthy of my father  from that time harry lindsay devoted himself to exercises he learnt from sufder when he visited his native town and from old soldiers when he was away to use a sword and dagger to hurl a light spear accurately to shoot straight with a musket that sufder had picked up on the field of battle at karlee and also with the pistol he rose at daybreak and walked for miles before coming in to his morning meal and exercised the muscles of his arms not only by the use of the sword but by holding heavy stones at arms length  soyera although still retaining her own religion had carefully instructed him in that of the english with which she had during her service become fully acquainted  i am only a servant an ignorant woman and it is not for me to decide which religion is the best and i have never thought of giving up that of my people but the religion of the christians is much simpler than ours they believe in one god only and in his son who like buddha was a great saint and went about doing good i will tell you all i know of him for my mistress frequently spoke to me of him and hoped i think that in time i should accept him as she did when you join your people it is as necessary that you should be of their religion as of their race and so in time harry learned at least the elements of christianity  as usual he had been at the age of six marked like soyera with three perpendicular lines on the foreheadthe sign of the worshippers of vishnu  you are twelve years old now harry soyera said to the boy one day now i must do what i have concluded after a talk with ramdass and sufder is the best thing for you we have agreed that it will be better that you should not join your countrymen and claim to be the son of major lindsay until you are a man i do not know what they would do with you they might send you back to england but i cannot say what would become of you there but we have agreed that when you do join them you must be like other young english gentlemen and not be looked down upon as one who though he has a white skin is but a mahratta peasant  in the first place you must learn to speak english  but i do speak english harry said in surprise  yes such english as i do but that is not as the white sahibs speak it we who have learned it speak the right word but not in the right way i have seen young white ladies when they first came out here and came to the house of your mother sometimes smile and scarcely understand what i said to them it is not like that that you must talk englishgood enough for an ayah not good enough for a sahibso we have decided sufder ramdass and i that you must go down to bombay and learn to talk proper english  we have thought much how this shall be done and have settled that our thinking here is no good i must wait till i get to bombay where i can get advice from people i know  will you stay there with me soyera  i cannot say what will be best she answered gravely i must wait till i get there ramdass will go down with me it is a good time for him to go the harvest work is done he can be spared for a month he would like to go he has never seen bombay we shall go in the wagon  the distance from jooneer to bombay was but about eighty miles and the journey was performed in five days and ramdass took down a light load of maize whose sale would pay the expenses of their journey soyera rode and slept on the maize except in two villages where she was able to procure a lodging for the night ramdass and harry walked by the bullocks and slept at night by the roadside wrapped in their blankets  on arriving at bombay they put up at a khan in the native town and the next morning leaving ramdass and harry to wander about and look at the wonders of the city soyera went to the shop of a parsee merchant who was in the habit of supplying the canteen of the troops contracted for supplies of forage and other matters and carried on the business of a native banker she had often been to his place with mrs lindsay and had from the time that she entered her service deposited her savings with him she had in the first place asked her master to keep them for her but he had advised her to go to jeemajee  the parsee was himself in his shop she went up to him  you do not remember me sahib she said i was the ayah of major lindsay i was often here with the memsahib  i remember you now he said i do not often forget those i have known yes your master and mistress were killed at their little camp on the concan nothing was heard of you if i remember rightly i have some money of yours in my hands have you the receipts  i have them sahib but it is not for that that i come to see you i wish to ask your advice on a private matter  the parsee looked a little surprised  come in here with me he said leading the way to his private room behind the shop  now what is it he asked as he closed the door behind them  it was believed sahib that major lindsays infant boy was killed at that time like all others in the camp it was not so i saved him it is about him that i want to speak to you  the parsee thought for a moment  yes there was a child its body was not found and was supposed to have been eaten by the jackals is it alive still  yes sahib i have brought him up as my own his skin has been always stained and none but my brotherwith whom i livehis wife and one other know that he is english i love him as my own child i have taught him english as i speak it but i want him in time to be an english sahib and for that he must learn proper english  but why have you not brought him down here the parsee said  who would have looked after him and cared for him sahib as i his nurse have done who could have taken him what would have become of him i am a poor woman and do not know how these things would be i said to myself  it will be better that he should live with me till he is old enough to go down as a young man and say to the governor  i am the son of major lindsay i can talk mahratti like a native i can ride and use my sword i can speak english well i can be useful  then perhaps for his fathers sake the governor will say  i will make you an officer if there are troubles in the deccan you will be more useful than those sahibs who do not know the language  i can do all that for him but i cannot teach him to speak as english sahibs speak and that is why i have come to you you have twelve hundred rupees of mine in your hands for i laid out nothing while i was in the sahibs service and my mistress was very kind and often gave me presents my brother ramdass had five hundred rupees saved and this he has given to me for he too loves the boy thus there are seventeen hundred rupees and this i would pay for him to be for two years with someone where he would learn to speak english as sahibs do so that none can say this white boy is not english  then he will go back for two or three years to jooneer he will learn to use his arms and to ride and to be a man until he is of an age to come down and say  i am the son of major lindsay  but if you were to tell this at once the parsee said they would doubtless send him home to england to be educated  and what would he do there sahib he would have no friends none to care for him and while his mahratti tongue would be of great service to him here it would be useless to him in his own country  do not say that my plan cannot be carried out sahib for twelve years i have thought it over i have taught him all that i could so far and convinced myself that it would be the best the boy loves me and is happy he would be miserable among strangers who would laugh at his english and would make him unhappy  jeemajee sat for some time in thought  i am not sure that your plan is not the best he said and after saving his life and caring for him at the risk of your own for all these years you have assuredly a better right than any other to say what shall be done now i will think over what you have asked of me it is not very easy to find just such a home as you want but i should consider the sum you offer is sufficient to induce many englishmen living here to take him but it is not everyone from whom he would learn english as you would wish him to do or who could teach him the manners of white officers  come to me tomorrow evening but you must not expect that i shall be able to answer you then i must think it over and make enquiries  it was three days indeed before anything came of soyeras visits to the parsee trader then he said  i think that i have found out just the place of which you are in search i spoke to a friend yesterday and he at once mentioned one whom i wonder i had not thought of at once some years ago a cadet who came out here with a young wife died shortly after his arrival as he had only been four years in the service the pension of his wife was but a small one she did not go back to england as widows generally do i know not why except that i once heard two officers speaking of her they said that they believed her family had quarrelled with her for her marriage and that she was too proud to go back again she had two girls who must be about the age of this boy her pension was not sufficient for her to live upon comfortably and she opened a little school for the children of officers here  there are not many you know for they are generally sent home to england when they are quite young but she has always had four or five sometimes eight or ten they come to her every morning and go home in the middle of the day and she sees no more of them  after i had heard this i went to her i supply her with many things for she gets her books and other things from me i said to her  i have a white boy whose father and mother are dead he is twelve years old there are reasons why i cannot tell you who they were but i can say that the boys father was an english officer he has been brought up by natives and speaks english in the way that natives speak it those who have brought him up desire that he should learn to talk english well and learn to have good manners so that some day when he goes to england people should not say of him  this is not an english gentleman or he would not speak like that  i said that i had interested myself in the matter and knew that it was right and had come to her to ask her if she would take him into her house which was very comfortable and well furnished and everything as it should be  she asked questions i told her enough to interest her and said that when the time came it was hoped that he would be able to obtain employment under the governmentperhaps in the army as his father had been i said that those who brought him up were ready to make great sacrifices for his sake but that they could not pay for him for more than two years and that as the boy knew so much english they hoped this would be enough i asked how much if she agreed to take him she would charge she said that she would think it over and would call here tomorrow and tell me whether she would take him  she will be here at three i think you had better come at that hour i am sure that she would like to speak to you i do not see why you should not say that you had been his ayah and had saved his life and brought him up many officers have been killed and indeed i do not see why you should not tell her the whole story it will interest her more in the boy but of course before you tell her you must ask her to promise not to repeat it  soyera went on the following day she found that jeemajee was already with a lady in his private room she waited until the door was opened and the merchant beckoned her in  this is the woman who has brought the child up mrs sankey he said as i have told you she was his ayah and has behaved most nobly  turning to soyera he said  naturally mrs sankey asked why you had not come forward before i told her your reasons and she thinks that perhaps you have acted for the best for him at any rate she has consented to take the boy for two years and i am to pay her for you the sum that you have named  in reality mrs sankey asked a thousand rupees a year but the parsee with the generosity for which his race is distinguished had agreed to pay the extra three hundred rupees himself  before it is quite settled mrs sankey said i should like to see the boy as mr jeemajee has told you i have two daughters about the same age i must therefore be guided in my decision by my impression of him  i will bring him to see you in three or four days soyera said his stain is already faded a good deal and i shall be able to get it off by that time i have to get english clothes for him  i am greatly obliged to you for saying that you will take him if he pleases you that i think he will do i have taught him manners as well as i could he is as anxious as i am to improve himself and will i am sure give you no more trouble than he can help  i will see that he is properly clothed mrs sankey jeemajee remarked i knew his father and have a great interest in him  mrs sankey chatted for some little time to soyera gave her her card with her address on malabar hill and then left  soyera began to thank the parsee for his introduction but he said  it was a little thing to do and as i knew his father it was only right that i should help as far as i could will you bring me tomorrow morning the measurement of the boys height size around his shoulders and waist the lengths of his arms and legs you need trouble yourself no further about it i shall take that matter upon myself come three days later for his clothes  goodbye i have other matters to see about and without waiting for any thanks from soyera he at once went into his shop and began to talk to his assistant  many were the scrubbings harry had to undergo during the next few days and his hair and face were nearly restored to their proper colour when soyera returned one evening with a coolie carrying a trunk of some size it contained the whole outfit for a boy one dark suit and four of white nankeen with a stock of shirts underclothing and shoes soyera showed harry how these garments with which he was wholly unacquainted should be put on  they fit you capitally she said when she surveyed him and you look like a little english sahib  they feel very tight and uncomfortable he said  they are sure to do so at first but you will soon get over that now ramdass will take you out for a walk for two or three hours so that you can get accustomed to them i should not like you to look awkward when you go with me to mrs sankeys tomorrow  the interview next day was altogether satisfactory the carriage and bearing of the natives of india is easier and more graceful than that of europeans and the knowledge harry had possessed for some years that he belonged to a conquering race the injunctions of soyera his strength and activity and his unquestioned leadership among the boys with whom he played had given something of confidence to his manner mrs sankey was greatly taken with him and he at once became an inmate of her house  he remained there for two years and became so great a favourite that mrs sankey insisted on his staying with her without charge for three or four months after the time for which she had received payment for him he had worked hard and earnestly and now spoke english as well and accurately as any english boy of his own age he had after being there a year made the acquaintance of several boys of his own age the sons of officers or officials they knew him only as the orphan son of an english gentleman in government employ and he was often asked to the houses of their parents and none suspected that he had been brought up among natives  at the end of his term sufder came down for him jeemajee who had remained his steady friend arranged that he should go to his house and there resume his native dress and stain in this garb he felt even stranger and more uncomfortable than he had done when he first put on european clothes but this was not long in wearing off and by the time he reached jooneer he was again at home in it he took with him at mrs sankeys suggestion a number of english books by authors she recommended so that he could by reading and learning some of them by heart retain his knowledge of the language  for the next three months he spent his whole time in practising with sword pistol and gun under the tuition of an old soldier in jooneer who had been a noted swordsman in his time he was already far stronger than the sons of ramdass although these were now young men anxious to at once exercise his muscles and gain in skill he now attached himself to a famous shikaree who seeing the boys strength and courage took him as an assistant when he went on excursions among the hills here harry learned to dig pits for the capture of tigers to smear leaves with a sticky substance obtained from a plant resembling mistletoe so that when a tiger or bear trod upon them and finding them sticking to his feet paused and rubbed these on his head until he became blinded and bewildered with a mass of sticky foliage a wellplaced shot would stretch him dead  illustration for a year he worked with the shikaree  for a year he worked with the shikaree sometimes they hunted simply for the value of the skins but more often they were sent for by villagers who were suffering from the depredations of tigers or leopards and who were willing to pay for having them killed harry lindsay acquired quite a reputation in jooneer and the surrounding country for the shikaree spoke freely of his bravery intelligence and skill with his arms his width of shoulders and the strength of his muscles caused him to be regarded as a prodigy and it was generally considered that when he grew up he would become a great fighter and attain wide renown as a leader of bands in the service of holkar or the peishwa  when he was sixteen sufder who had watched his progress with great approval said to him  you are scarce a man in years yet puntojee but you are strong skilful with your weapons and far more of a man than many ten years older than yourself it is time that you should see something of war since the death of scindia a few months back and the succession of his nephew doulut who is about your own age things have become even more unsettled than before scindia was a great man and although at times worsted by his rivals always managed to repair his fortunes and to add to his power but whether the young scindia will keep the wide territory that his uncle won is doubtful holkar although at times he and scindia united as when the english marched against poona has been his rival and enemy  the peishwa has sometimes been in alliance with one of these great princes sometimes with the other his minister nana furnuwees is a man of commanding talent had it not been for him it is probable that scindia and holkar would long since have become altogether independent but he has always contrived to play one off against the other and by securing the services of the secondary chiefs such as the rajah of nagpore and the rajah of kolapoore to hold the balance of power but he is an old man and at his death there is no saying how things will go  matters are complicated too by the fact that scindia has now in his service sixteen battalions of drilled infantry commanded by french officers and these have proved so valuable in the various sieges he has undertaken that holkar has been obliged to imitate his example there are many who think that the introduction of infantry will in the end prove disastrous to the power of the mahrattas whose strength has hitherto lain in their cavalry which could perform long journeys strike a blow and be off again and so were more than a match for the infantry of other indian princes but with infantry all this will be altered for the marches must be no longer or faster than they can journey the order of battles too will be changed altogether and we shall depend more upon foot while our horse until now almost invincible will become of secondary importance  however that is not the question at present the first thing to be considered is to which of the three great leaders you are to attach yourself as you know i was for many years in scindias service but at his death the position was changed scindia knew that i was active and capable had he lived i should soon have gained much promotion however his chief minister took a dislike to me and i felt that now the maharajah was gone doulut would be easily swayed by the counsels of those around him and that instead of promotion i should be more likely to lose my command and perhaps be put out of the way therefore i left douluts service and have entered that of the young peishwa who at the advice of nana furnuwees has given me the command of a troop of a hundred men  years ago i gained nanas goodwill by apprising him of the hostile intentions of the rajah of nagpore when he promised me that should i at any time leave scindias service he would give me as good a position as i held there in that of the peishwa the young prince is but twentyone and i will ask nana to present you to him as one who in time will become a valuable officer and it is likely that mahdoo rao will receive you well when he hears that though so young you have gained great credit as a slayer of wild beasts and that as he will see for himself you promise to grow into a strong man and a brave soldier  nana furnuwees is a man who by his conciliating manner gains the confidence of all who come under his influence and it is wholly due to him that the authority of the peishwa has not been entirely overthrown by scindia and holkar he is a reader of mens minds and has always surrounded himself with friends of discernment and courage and i think you would be likely if you remained in the peishwas service to rise to a very much higher rank than i should ever do being myself but a rough soldier with a heavy hand  holkar at present is fast becoming altogether imbecile he is worn out both in mind and body and i should not advise anybody to join him therefore the choice rests between doulut rao scindia and the peishwa as far as i can see there is an equal chance of your seeing service with either  i can choose without hesitation harry said had you still been in the army of scindia i would have joined it too but as you have now entered that of the peishwa who is the lawful ruler of the mahrattas though overshadowed by scindia and holkar i should certainly choose his service  in any case i would rather be with you you have taught me the use of arms and to you i owe it that i was not killed when an infant therefore i would assuredly rather fight under your orders than take service with holkar or scindia  as to their quarrels i know nothing ramdass has often told me as much as he knew of these matters but it all seemed to me to be confusion and the only thing i could understand was that they were always intriguing against each other instead of putting all their forces in the field and fighting it out fairly and so deciding who was to be the chief lord of the mahrattas  although but a soldier puntojee i cannot but see that this constant antagonism between the three principal leaders of the mahrattas is unfortunate in the last degree we are wasting the strength that if properly employed might bring all india into subjection and when trouble really comes we shall be a divided people instead of acting under one head and with one mind however it is not for us soldiers to meddle with these things but to do our duty to the chief under whom we serve  well if such be your choice i will present you to nana furnuwees i am glad that you have chosen that service for in the first place being young he may take a liking to you and you may obtain rapid promotion and still more because i should prefer to have you with me  hitherto harry had worn only the scanty clothing in use by the peasantry and the small cultivators but sufder now bought him clothes such as were worn by youths of a superior class soyera had offered no objection to his departure and indeed sufder had spoken to her on the subject before he had broached it to harry  tis hard upon me to give you up she said to the lad but i have always known that it must be so and indeed for the last year i have seen little of you the change will be good for you you will learn the manner of war and take an interest in the intrigues and troubles that are constantly going on and of which we hear little  when you rejoin your countrymen a few years hence i shall go with you you need my testimony to show that you are the son of major lindsay and i can be useful to you in managing your household but at present it is best that i should stay here a young soldier would not care to have his mother looking after him and it is for your good that you should go your own way and besides you will have the counsels of sufder to aid you i should be out of place and for the present i am happy here with my good brother and sisterinlaw the latter of whom would miss me sorely moreover poona is but two days ride from here and you will no doubt be able sometimes to come over and see us  i have done what little i could for you you are now old enough to make your own way the bird that has taught its nestling to fly does not try to keep it in the nest when it is once able to take care of itself  i can never be sufficiently grateful for all that you have done for me harry said earnestly you have been more than a mother to me and wherever i go i shall not be happy unless you are with me though i see it is best this time that i should go alone but assuredly when i join my people and have a home of my own it would not seem like a home to me if you did not share it  two days later harry mounted a horse that ramdass had given him and started with sufder for poona on arriving there they rode to the little camp half a mile out of the town where sufders troop was stationed  you dont carry your tents with you when you are on service in the field  not when on an expedition where haste is needed for we should make but poor progress if we were hampered by luggage when on a distant expedition we take tents  this is a standing camp and there are a score like it round the town they always remain in the same position sometimes one troop occupies them sometimes another when we go on an expedition we leave them when we come back if they are still unoccupied we again take possession if they have been allotted to another troop a vacant one is found for us  only one regiment of horse and two of foot are in the city where they have lines of huts we differ from the rest of the army being always on service the others are only called out when there is occasion for them each under its own chief and in case of necessity the peishwa can put thirty thousand horsemen in the field besides those of the rajahs in alliance with him  the next morning sufder in his best attire went with harry into the city the latter for the first time carrying a sword dagger and pistols in his cummerbund or sash without being questioned they entered the chamber were nana was giving audience to all who waited upon him on business  sufder took his place at the lower end of the chamber moving forward as one after another applicant was disposed of until at length his turn arrived the minister who knew that he was a brave soldier who had enjoyed the confidence of the late scindia acknowledged his deep salutation with a friendly nod  what can i do for you sufder  i desire nothing your excellency save that i may be permitted to present to you one of my family the son of a relation of mine who although still young i may venture to recommend to you as one possessing great courage and intelligence i have myself given him lessons in the use of his arms and he has had other instructors and done credit to them for the past year he has been working with a famous shikaree and has killed many tigers that were a scourge to the villages near the ghauts together with many bears and leopards and his master reported that his fearlessness was great and that as a marksman his skill was equal to his own he was most unwilling that he should leave him but i considered it was time for him to enter the army in which i believe he will soon distinguish himself  how old is he the minister asked  he is as yet but sixteen but as your highness may see he is as strong as most men having devoted himself to exercises of all sorts since he was a child  he is indeed cast in a strong mould and his face pleases me  and so you would enter the service of his highness the peishwa  that is my desire your excellency  you are young to serve as an officer and for the present you had best remain with sufders troop in the meantime i will see what suitable post can be found for you  with an expression of thanks sufder and harry left the audience hall  it is a good beginning puntojee the soldier said as they left the ministers palace nana furnuwees was evidently pleased with you and i think he will give you special employment at the same time serving one master here is not without its dangernana especially powerful as he is has enemies as powerful for he has always stood in the way of the ambition of scindia  that evening an officer brought from nana an order conferring upon harry the appointment of an assistant officer in sufders troop with the usual pay and allowances and three days later an order came for him to attend the audience of the minister on arrival he was told by the officer of the chamber that he was not to present himself at public audience but that nana would speak to him privately he was therefore taken to an inner chamber where an hour later nana joined him  i think by your face puntojee that you can be trusted and i have decided to place you in the service of his highness the peishwa what position you will hold there must depend upon yourself and him i shall simply recommend you as one of whom i have heard much good it would be as well for you not to mention your age but let him suppose that as you look you are about the same age as himself he is amiable and kindly and your position will be a pleasant one  i am anxious to prevent evil advisers from obtaining influence over him he is young and unsuspicious and much harm might thus come to the state it is then for the general interest that he should be surrounded by those whom i can trust so that if any plotters are endeavouring to poison his mind their plans may be thwarted i have of course officers about his person who are thoroughly trustworthy but these are much older than himself and he chafes somewhat at what he wrongly considers his tutelage but indeed as he is but twentyone and wholly unversed in matters of state it is needful that the management of affairs should rest in the hands of those who have long controlled it  scindia would be the first to take advantage of any imprudence he is already by far the most powerful of the mahratta princes his possessions are of immense extent he holds the emperor at delhi in the palm of his hand he can put one hundred thousand horse into the field and has large numbers of infantry including sixteen battalions drilled by french officers and commanded by de boigne and although doulut rao is but twenty and as yet we know but little of his disposition he is of course surrounded by the advisers of his uncle and may be expected to pursue the same policy his uncle gained great ascendency over the peishwa and his death was a fortunate circumstance still it is certain that the prince until his powers are matured will yield to the advice of those to whom the conduct of affairs is entrusted  now i am going to the palace and have requested a private audience with mahdoo rao and i will take you with me  followed by a train of officers with whom harry fell in the minister proceeded to the palace his train remained in the public hall and nana went into the peishwas private apartment in a few minutes an official came in and called puntojee and harry at once followed him to an inner room where the peishwa and his minister were alone harry bowed to the ground  this prince is the young man of whom i have spoken to you he bears an excellent character for his skill in arms and has killed many tigers and other beasts it was but the other day that you complained that you had no one of your own age to whom you could talk freely and i have selected this young officer as one who i thought would be agreeable to you  i thank you heartily nana in truth i sometimes need a companion and i think by his face that this officer will be an agreeable one to what post think you had i best appoint him  as he is a famous shikaree i should say that it would be suitable were you to make him director of the chase  but i never go hunting  that is true but in time when your occupations of state lessen you might do so nana said and indeed even at present there is nothing to prevent your hunting sometimes in the royal preserves where there must be an abundance of game of all sorts  so let it be then the peishwa said in truth i care not for the killing of beasts unless they do harm to the villagers but it is right that there should be someone to direct the men who have charge of the preserves and as an official you will have the right of entry here at all times and will be frequently about my person and i will confer with you about other things as well as the chase you will of course have an apartment assigned to you  you will arrange about the emoluments nana  you had better go to my house and wait for me there nana said and harry bowing deeply to the prince and his minister left the palace  he did not deceive himself as to the reason for which nana had thus placed him in a position in which he was likely to be frequently in the company of the young prince he intended him to act as a spy this he was firmly determined not to do in any matter save in thwarting any designs scindia might have that was a public duty  by this time he had learnt much of the events that were passing ramdass and the other ryots of his acquaintance regarded nana furnuwees as the guardian of the country for many years it was his wisdom and firmness alone that had thwarted the designs of scindia whose advent to supreme authority would have been regarded as a grave misfortune by all the cultivators of the deccan scindias expenses in keeping up so great an army were enormous and the exactions of his tax gatherers ground to the dust the cultivators and peasantry of his own wide dominions and harry was therefore ready to give nana a faithful support in all public matters he knew that the minister had many enemies even among the rajahs in the peishwas dominion and in those round it for they regarded him with reason as a curb upon their private ambitions and for years intrigues had been going on for his overthrow  on the other hand harry was much pleased with mahdoo rao who was a most amiable and kindly young man while determined then to do all that he could in support of nana he decided that he would on no account give him any report that would be unfavourable to the peishwa his interview with the minister on the return of the latter was a short one  here the latter said is a purse of five hundred rupees with which to obtain garments suitable for one in attendance on the peishwa your emolument will be two hundred rupees a month i shall issue orders to the men employed in the forests and preserves to report to you and have requested the chamberlain to allot an apartment to you in the palace and to tell off two servants to be in attendance on you  you understand that your mission as far as i am concerned is to give me early warning if any of those favourable to scindiayou shall be furnished with a list of their namesare endeavouring to obtain an undue influence over the prince who is of an altogether unsuspicious character and would be likely to fall an easy victim to bad counsels  you can depend upon my doing so harry said i have been taught to regard scindia as an enemy to the public peace and shall use all diligence in carrying out your excellencys orders  and leaving the minister harry went to sufder and told him what had happened  in truth puntojee you were born under a lucky star i never dreamt that nana furnuwees would have thus introduced you to the peishwa now lad you have a fine career opened to you it will need caution but as scindias ancestor was but a slipper bearer and rose to the highest rank and honour so it is open to you to win a great position if you steer clear of the dangers that attend all who play a part in public affairs i foresee that you will become a favourite with the prince but remember to put your trust in nana he is at present the greatest power in the land and has been so for many years but unlike most who have attained such authority he is liked by the people for he uses his power well and for the good of the state  you see even now the young peishwa is by no means secure on the musnud the adherents of rugoba who was undoubtedly the lawful ruler of the deccan still live and may one day raise the flag of revolt in favour of his sons bajee rao and chimnajee appa who with amrud rao his adopted son are all in close custody in the hill fort of sewneree under two of nanas officers  there is a general feeling of pity for these young men even among those who regard their imprisonment as necessaryfor were they free a civil war would assuredly break out againand the feeling is increased by the fact that bajee rao is a youth of extraordinary accomplishments he is graceful in person with a handsome countenance and a charming manner and although but nineteen he is an excellent horseman skilled in the use of the bow and considered to be the finest swordsman in the country he is deeply read in all our religious books and in all the country there is no one of his age so learned  all these things however only add to the necessity for his being kept in prison a youth so gifted and as many people consider the lawful heir to the throne would speedily be joined by all the enemies of nana and might not only drive the minister into exile but dethrone mahdoo rao such being the case no one can blame nana for keeping them in confinementat any rate until mahdoo rao has been master for some years and has proved that he is able to maintain his position  now lad i will go into the town with you and purchase dresses fit for an official of the palace  i quite see that i have been most fortunate in obtaining such a position sufder but i own i should have preferred to remain with you and learn to do service as a soldier  that you may learn later on sufder said having the confidence of the peishwa you may soon obtain military rank as well as civil and if war breaks out may hold a position vastly better than you could hope to attain to as the mere chief of a troop  it seems very ridiculous sufder that i should be thus put forward without any merit of my own while you who have fought in many battles are still only commander of your troop  i have no desire for more sufder replied i am a soldier and can do my duty as ordered but i have no head for intrigues and i consider the risks of a battle are quite sufficient without those of being put out of the way for mixing myself up in plots  again your rise is not altogether undeserved you have by your exercises attained the strength of manhood early and your experience as a tiger hunter has fitted you for the post for which you are appointed just as your diligence in exercise in arms will be of good service to you if you come to hold military command but you must be circumspect and above all things do not forget to use the dye with which soyera has furnished you hitherto your white skin has done you no harm but were it discovered here that you are english it would at once be imagined that you were a spy and little time would be given you to explain how matters stand  i will certainly be careful as to that and now that i am to have a private apartment i shall be able to apply the dye without the fear of being interrupted as might have been the case in camp  on the following day harry having obtained clothes suitable to his position betook himself to the palace where one of the officers of the chamberlain conducted him to his apartment and assigned to him two men appointed to his service    chapter 3 a change in affairs   harry lindsays duties were little more than nominal the reports sent in to him by those in charge of the royal preserves could scarcely be considered as satisfactory as they stated that owing to the fact that for years there had been no hunting there the tigers had greatly increased in number and had thinned down the stags and indeed in some cases had so destroyed other game that they were driven to escape from the enclosures and to ravage the villages but beyond receiving these reports and riding over occasionally to the preserves harry had little to do save to take part in any court ceremonies and when called upon to do so to accompany the peishwa in his walks in the palace garden he therefore determined to learn to read and write in mahratta and for two or three hours a day a man of the weynsh or mercantile class came in to teach him so careful was nana furnuwees in preventing scindias adherents from approaching the prince that harry had nothing whatever to report on this head  one day when mahdoo rao who had taken a great liking to him was walking in the garden chatting familiarly to him of his life in the country and his adventures with tigers and other wild beasts he said  have you seen my cousin bajee rao  no your highness i have never seen him  you have heard of him of course and nothing but good  that is so prince it seems that both in sports and learning he is wonderfully well instructed  i should like to see him the prince said i admire what i have heard of him greatly and it is hard that he should be shut up in prison and yet he is scarcely more a prisoner than i am  harry was struck with dismay  but your highness is in no way a prisoner  i am not shut up in a fortress the young prince said but i am no more my own master than bajee rao is nana furnuwees treats me as if i were a child he is i know devoted to me but that makes it no more pleasant i can go where i like but it is always with my retinue i cannot choose my own friends  your highness will forgive me if i say that it is for your own safety and for the peace of the country that your minister watches over you so jealously and doubtless he thinks that having been the chief adviser to your family for so many years having guarded it so successfully from those who would have lessened your authority for the present it is of the greatest importance that he should continue to guide the state  i am at least very glad that he allows me a companion of my own age to whom i can talk freely  on all subjects your highness excepting state matters nana presented me because i was ignorant of the court and knew nothing whatever of intrigues and was not likely to take any part in them therefore your highness i pray you but to speak upon ordinary matters be assured i am your devoted servant but the courtiers would grow suspicious were you to talk of state matters with me these things speedily become known and i should fall under nanas displeasure  perhaps you are right the peishwa admitted in a tone of melancholy no doubt whatever passes in this house is known to my minister and indeed it is his duty to make himself so acquainted still i feel it hard that i should not have one friend to whom i can speak  the time will come prince when you will be able to do so and doubtless there will be at hand those who will dare to have your confidence  the prince was silent but after this he abstained from any remarks to harry concerning the state he had indeed for some time been in correspondence with bajee rao who had gained the confidence of one of those appointed to look after him and though there was nothing save expressions of friendship on the part of both princes nana was furious when he found out from his spies what was going on  the news came as a shock to the minister nana had been the greatest enemy of the house of rugoba and the discovery of this correspondence and the friendship between the two young men so threatened his authority that after ordering that bajee rao and his brothers should be more strictly confined than before he visited the peishwa and upbraided him bitterly for having entered upon a friendship with the head of a party which had harassed his family and had brought innumerable troubles on the state then he sent a message to harry bidding him to come at once  how is it puntojee he said sternly that you have altogether failed to justify the faith i put in you and have already assisted mahdoo rao to enter into relations with my enemy bajee rao  harry was thunderstruck at this sudden attack  my lord you must have been misinformed i know nothing of any such correspondence and if it really went on i think the peishwa would have taken me into his confidence  do you mean to say that mahdoo has not spoken to you about his cousin  no sir i do not say so for some four months ago he spoke in terms of admiration for bajee rao but he did not pursue the subject and never afterwards alluded to it  the minister looked at him fixedly  i believe you he said you do not look like a doublefaced man but as one who would tell the truth whatever were the consequences moreover i felt that if you had known of mahdoo raos intentions and had not reported them to me you would on receiving my message have endeavoured to make your escape i have of course enquired and found that you spent your afternoon as usual with your scribe and that you afterwards rode out to sufders camp and there talked for half an hour sitting outside the tent and conversing on ordinary matters and then you returned here to the palace these proceedings go far to assure me that you were ignorant of the discovery that had been made that a correspondence had been going on between mahdoo and bajee still i thought you might have known of the correspondence though not of the discovery but now i am quite convinced that you were altogether ignorant of what was going on  the scene with nana and the knowledge that he had brought upon his cousins even stricter confinement than before acted most painfully upon the mind of the young peishwa already embittered by the restraint in which he was being held he now shut himself up in his room and absolutely refused to leave it his absence from the durbars was put down to illness nana paid no great attention to him believing that the young prince would speedily recover himself  this however was not the case for settled melancholy took possession of him on the 22nd of october he appeared at the duddera a high ceremonial went among his troops and in the evening received his chiefs and the representatives from the great rajahs but three days later he threw himself from a terrace in front of his palace broke two of his limbs and so seriously injured himself that he died two days afterwards having almost in his last breath expressed to nana his strong desire that bajee rao should succeed him on the musnud  the consternation of the minister was unbounded it seemed that by this sudden and unexpected blow the whole of his plans were overthrown and that not only his position but his very life was in danger  he sent for harry two hours after the peishwas death  answer me frankly he said can i depend upon you absolutely and have you had no communication of any kind from my enemies  you can depend upon me my lord everyone knows that you have saved the state a score of times and will i doubt not do the same again  i have the will the minister said gravely but whether i have the power is another thing i sent off a messenger to the general purseram bhow bidding him gather as many troops as possible and march hither and i shall send letters to the rajah of nagpore and scindia holkar being in poona i have already seen and as he has always supported me against rugoba he is as anxious as i am as to the succession  i shall now send you with a duplicate letter to purseram bhow for since the terrible accident to mahdoo rao whom i loved dearly for his amiable character it is probable that the adherents of bajee rao have been active and that my every movement is watched and attempts may be made to stop any messengers that i may send out take sufders troop with you if you are stopped fight your way through whatever their force it is a matter of supreme importance that this letter should reach the general  it shall reach him my lord harry said as he took it in five minutes i shall be on my way  going to his room he changed his attire mounted his horse and rode to sufders camp the men were all ready as nana had sent an order to sufder to prepare instantly for a journey  so it is you puntojee the captain said as he rode up the orderly did not tell me whom i was to escort nor our destination in which direction do we ride  i am bearer of a letter to purseram bhow  then i know the direction and giving orders to his men he rode off at once by the side of harry  this is a terrible business puntojee  i am greatly grieved indeed for no one could have been kinder to me than mahdoo rao  yes yes sufder said that is all very well but the serious side of the matter is that just as everything seemed settled we may be entering upon another civil war more terrible than the last of course i am sorry for the young peishwa but i doubt whether he was in any way fit to rule over the mahrattas kindness of heart goes for nothing with a people like ours split up into many factions led by many chiefs and ever ready for war it needs a strong as well as an able man to hold in check all the parties in the state  scindia was the sort of man to rule us he was strong in every way was troubled with no scruples would strike down without mercy any who opposed him he took great care of his troops and they were always ready to follow him that is the man we want on the musnud not a young prince of whom we can only say that he was kindly  and why did nana choose you  i am a second string to his bow he sent off a messenger as soon as he heard of mahdoo raos accident but fearing he might be intercepted on the way he has chosen me as being a person no one would be likely to suspect of being his messenger on so important a matter  it is important indeed puntojee there is no saying what may be the result of the peishwas death there is no doubt that scindia and holkar will for once be in complete accord with nana furnuwees and will combine in any plan to keep rugobas son from succeeding still there are many of the friends of rugoba who will be ready to declare for his son and moreover there are the stories that have been so widely circulated as to bajees personal appearance and his many accomplishmentsthese will gain for him a great number of partisans  the journey was performed without interruption at one time a body of some fifty horsemen made their appearance on rising ground near the road but drew off when they saw how strong was the party and after a ride of sixty miles they arrived at purseram bhows camp harry dismounted in front of the generals tent and entering handed him the letter  what is your news the latter asked before opening it  there is none general beyond what the letter sent to you three hours before i left will have prepared you to hear i only bear a copy of that letter in case the first should not have reached you  it is well that the precaution was taken for in truth the messenger has not arrived  it is possible that he may have been murdered on the way sir for we saw a party of fifty horsemen on the road whose intentions seemed to be hostile but as i had sufders troop of a hundred men with me they drew off  but what is the news then that is so important that steps are taken to stop messengers that bear it  harry related what had taken place the old officer giving many ejaculations of regret and horror at the news of mahdoo raos death  tis a terrible misfortune indeed he said and is like to throw the whole country into disorder again  he opened the despatch now and glanced through it he called some of his officers who were gathered near the tent and ordered them to cause the trumpets to be sounded for all the troops to be in readiness to march at once leaving only a small body of infantry to pack up the tents and follow at a more leisurely pace with the baggage  an hour later two regiments of cavalry started infantry men being taken up behind the troopers and late the next day they arrived at poona scindia and the rajah of berar had also been sent for in haste and as soon as they arrived a council was held as to the choice that should be made of a successor  all were opposed to the selection of bajee rao for he would have been brought up by his mother with the deepest enmity towards those who had successfully combined against his father it was therefore proposed that the widow of mahdoo rao should adopt a son in whose name the government should be carried on  it was not until two months had been spent in negotiations that the matter was finally settled one of scindias ministers named balloba alone opposed the course decided upon and bajee rao opened communications with him and succeeded in winning him over to his cause having done this he addressed scindia offering him a very large addition to his territory and payment of all his expenses if he would assist him to gain his rightful position as balloba had great influence over the young scindia the offer was accepted  the arrangement was made so secretly that nana furnuwees had received no intimation whatever of what was going on until the agreement had been concluded purseram bhow was again summoned to poona and with his usual energy made a march of one hundred and twenty miles in fortyeight hours  the position was a difficult one indeed at one blow the plans that had been so carefully laid by nana were shattered scindia who had but a month or two before formed one of the confederacy had now gone round to the side of bajee rao who regarded the minister as his greatest enemy holkar was not to be depended upon and in poona there were many adherents of the son of rugoba the council held by nana purseram and two or three other great officers was long and at times stormy but it was finally agreed that the sole way out of the perilous position caused by scindias desertion was to anticipate him and to release bajee rao and declare him peishwa  purseram started at once to the fort where the brothers were confined harry who was now deeply interested in the course of events was one of nanas officers who accompanied purseram on hearing the generals errand the officer in command of the fort at once sent for bajee his brother chimnajee and amrudwho was the adopted son of rugoba and who stood on an equal footing with regard to the succession bajee rao listened calmly to the proposals made to him in nanas name asked several questions and demanded guarantees but was evidently disposed to accept the proposals if assured that they were made in good faith  amrud strongly urged him to decline the offer but bajee upon purseram taking the most solemn oath known to the hindoos in proof of his sincerity accepted the offer and with his brother chimnajee rode with purseram to poona amrud being left behind in the fort as purseram considered that he would continue to exercise his influence over bajee in a direction hostile to nanas interest  as soon as the party arrived at the capital an interview took place between bajee and nana when in the presence of many of the great officers both swore to forget all enmities and injuries and bajee promised to retain nana at the head of his administration  that same evening the minister sent for harry  puntojee he said i have a commission for you i know that you are loyal to me and that i can depend upon you i wish you to go at once to scindias camp which is now on the bank of the godavery and ascertain how he takes the news doubtless balloba his prime minister will be furious at finding that instead of bajee becoming a mere creature of scindias i have placed him on the musnud and retain my place as his chief minister i can employ you for this business better than most others for the greater part of my officers are personally known to those of scindia while you have scarce been seen by them i have also a high idea of your shrewdness and i have no doubt that you will in some way be able to gain the information that i requireindeed it will probably be the public talk of the camp if you should find an opportunity of entering into negotiations with any influential person in scindias court i authorize you to do so in my name and to agree to any reasonable demands that he may make either for a payment in money or in estates scindias character is wholly unformed and though today he may be guided by balloba tomorrow he may lean on someone else  you can go in any guise you think fit either as a trooper or as a camp follower in either case you had better take sufder and twenty men with you and leave them in concealment within a few miles of the camp so that in case of necessity you can join them and his men can act as messengers and bring your reports to me  as it was now a year since harry had first gone to poona and he had during that time worked diligently he could now both read and write the mahratta language and was thus able to send in written reports instead of being obliged to rely upon oral messages which might be misdelivered by those who carried them or possibly reported to others instead of to the minister whereas reading and writing were known to but few of the mahrattas outside the brahmin class  sufder expressed himself much pleased when he heard that he was to accompany harry  i am sick of this life of inactivity he said why we have had no fighting for the past five years and we shall forget how to use our arms unless there is something doing i would willingly accompany you into scindias camp but i am far too well known there to hope to escape observation however i will pick out twenty of my best men so that if there should be a skirmish we shall be able to hold our own of course i shall choose men who have good horses for we may have to ride for it  harry himself was very well mounted for mahdoo rao had given him two excellent horses and as he had when out with sufders troop tried them against the best of those of the sowars he felt sure that he could trust to them in case of having to ride for his life the trooper who looked after them had become much attached to him and he determined to take him with him into scindias camp one of sufders other men looking after the horses  after a consultation with sufder he decided on adopting the costume of a petty trader or pedlar carrying garments scarfs and other articles used by soldiers of these he laid in a store and three hours after his interview with nana started with his escort the trooper leading his spare horse on which his packs were fastened and his own man riding a country pony the distance to scindias camp was under a hundred miles and they took three days in accomplishing it it was important that the horses should not be knocked up as their lives might depend upon their speed  when within ten miles of their destination they halted in a grove near the moola river here harry changed his clothes and assumed those of a small merchant then he mounted the pony a portion of the packs was fastened behind him and the rest carried by his servant  scindias camp lay around toka a town on the godavery at the foot of a range of hills on arriving there he went to the field bazaar where a large number of booths occupied by traders and country peasants were erected the former principally sold arms saddlery and garments the latter the produce of their own villages choosing an unoccupied piece of ground harry erected a little shelter tent composed of a dark blanket thrown over a ridge pole supported by two others giving a height of some four feet in the centre the pony was picketed just behind this in front of it a portion of the wares was spread out and harry began the usual loud exhortations to passers by to inspect them  having thus established himself he left wasil in charge explaining to him the prices that he was to ask for each of the articles sold and then started on a tour through the camp here and there pausing to listen to the soldiers he picked up scraps of news and learned that there was a general expectation that the army would march in a day or two towards poonait being rumoured that scindia and his minister balloba had been outwitted by nana furnuwees and that balloba had made no secret of his anger but vowed vengeance against the man who had overthrown plans which it had been surely believed would have resulted in scindias obtaining supreme control over the deccan  returning to his little tent he wrote a letter to nana telling him what he had gathered and giving approximately the strength of scindias force adding that from what he heard the whole were animated with the desire to avenge what they considered an insult to their prince this note he gave to wasil who at once started on foot to join sufder who would forward it by four troopers to poona  the next morning he returned and after purchasing provisions from the countrymen and lighting a fire for cooking them he assisted harry at his stall the latter was standing up exhibiting a garment to a soldier who was haggling with him over the price when a party of officers rode by at their head was one whose dress showed him to be a person of importance and whom harry at once recognized as balloba having often noticed him during the negotiations at poona as his eye fell upon harry he checked his horse for a moment and beckoned to him to come to him  come here weynsh he said using the term generally applied to the commercial caste  illustration harry went up to him and salaamed  harry went up to him and salaamed  how comes it the minister asked that so fine a young fellow as you are is content to be peddling goods through the country when so well fitted by nature for better things you should be a soldier and a good one for so young a man i have never seen a greater promise of strength  it seems to me that your face is not unknown to me where do you come from  from jooneer your excellency where my people are cultivators but having no liking for that life i learned the trade of a shopkeeper and obtained permission to travel to your camp and to try my fortune in disposing of some of my masters goods  as jooneer was but some sixty miles from toka the explanation was natural enough and as the former town lay near to the main road from scindias dominions in candeish it afforded an explanation of ballobas partial recognition of his face  and as a merchant you can read and write i suppose the latter went on  yes your highness sufficiently well for my business  well think it over you can scarcely find your present life more suitable to your taste than that of a cultivator and the army is the proper place for a young fellow with spirit and with strength and muscles such as you have if you like to enlist in my own bodyguard and your conduct be good i will see that you have such promotion as you deserve  your excellency is kind indeed harry said humbly before i accept your kind offer will you permit me to return to jooneer to account for my sales to my employer and to obtain permission of my father to accept your offer which would indeed be greatly more to my taste than the selling of goods  it is well balloba said and then broke off  ah i know now why i remember your face tis the lightness of your eyes which are of a colour rarely seen but somehow or other it appears to me that it was not at jooneer but at poona that i noticed your face  i was at poona with my master when your highness was there harry said  that accounts for it  the minister touched his horses flanks with his heel and rode on with a thoughtful look on his face harry at once joined wasil  quick wasil there is no time to be lost throw the saddle on to the pony and make your way out of the camp at once pitch all the other things into the tent and close it if you leave them here it will seem strange balloba has seen me at poona and it is likely enough that as he thinks it over he will remember that it was in a dress altogether different from this go at once to sufder if you get there before me tell him to mount at once and ride fast to meet me  two minutes later everything was prepared and wasil mounting the pony rode off while harry moved away among the tents in a quiet spot behind one of these he threw off his upper garments and stood in the ordinary undress of a hindoo peasant having nothing on but a scanty loincloth he had scarcely accomplished this when he heard the trampling of horses and saw past the tent four troopers ride up to the spot he had just left  where is the trader who keeps this tent one of them shouted he is a spy and we have orders to arrest him  harry waited to hear no more but walked in the opposite direction taking care to maintain a leisurely stride and to avoid all appearance of haste then going down to the road by the side of which the bazaar was encamped he mingled with the crowd there presently one of the troopers dashed up  has anyone seen a man in the dress of a trader and he roughly described the attire of which harry had rid himself  there was a general chorus of denial from those standing round and the trooper again galloped on  harry continued his walk at a leisurely pace stopping occasionally to look at articles exposed for sale until he reached the end of the bazaar then he made across the country trumpets were blowing now in the camp and he had no doubt that balloba had ordered a thorough search to be made for him he did not quicken his pace however until well out of sight but then he broke into a swinging trot for he guessed that when he was not found in the camp parties of cavalry would start to scour the country he had gone some four miles when looking behind him he saw about twenty horsemen far back along the road  the country here was flat and open with fields irrigated by canals running from the moola and affording no opportunity for concealment hitherto he had been running well within his powers but he now quickened his pace and ran at full speed he calculated that wasil would have at least half an hours start of him and that as he would urge the pony to the top of his speed he would by this time have joined sufder and he was sure that the latter would not lose an instant before starting to meet him he had hesitated for a moment whether he should break into a quiet walk and allow the troopers to overtake him relying upon the alteration of his costume but he reflected that balloba might have foreseen that he would change his disguise and have ordered the arrest of a young man with curiously light eyes  harry had always attempted to conceal this feature as far as possible by staining his eyelashes a deep black but when he looked up the colour of his eyes could hardly fail to strike anyone specially noticing them  his constant exercise as a boy had given him great swiftness of foot and the year passed as a shikaree had added to his endurance and speed and divested of clothing as he was he felt sure that the horsemen who were more than a mile in his rear when he first caught sight of them would not overtake him for some time he was running as he knew for life for he was certain that if caught balloba would have him at once put to death as a spy although hardy and of great endurance the mahratta horses which were small in size were not accustomed to being put to the top of their speed except for a short charge and the five miles that they had galloped already must have to some extent fatigued them  after running at the top of his speed for about a mile he looked back the party was still a long distance in his rear again he pressed forward but his exertions were telling upon him and before he had gone another half mile the mahrattas had approached within little more than half that distance  far ahead he thought he could perceive a body of horsemen but these were nearly two miles away and he would be overtaken before they could reach him therefore he turned suddenly off and took to one of the little banks dividing one irrigated field from another as soon as the horsemen reached the spot where he had left the road they too turned off but harry who was now husbanding his strength saw a sudden confusion among them  the little bank of earth on which he was running was but a foot wide and was softened by the water which soaked in from both sides it could bear his weight well enough but not that of a mounted man only one or two had attempted to follow it the others had plunged into the field here their horses at once sank up to the knees some endeavoured to force the animals on others to regain the road they had quitted the two horsemen on the bank were making better progress but their horses hoofs sank deeply in the soft earth and their pace in spite of the exertions of the riders was but a slow one  harry turned when he came to the end of the field and followed another bank at right angles and was therefore now running in the right direction he was more than keeping his lead from the foremost of his pursuers some of the others galloped along the road parallel to him but ahead  the horsemen he had first seen were now within a mile on they came at the top of their speed and the troopers on the road halted not knowing whether this body were friends or foes while those on the bank reined in their horses and rode back to join their comrades harry continued to run till he came to another bank leading to the road and following this he arrived there just as sufder galloped up with his party one of the troopers leading his horse they gave a shout of welcome as he came up  i thought it must be you sufder said from the way you ran rather than from your attire shall we charge those fellows  i think not harry said in the first place scindia has not as yet declared war against nana and bajee in the second there may be more men coming on behind therefore it will be best to leave them alone though if they attack us we shall of course defend ourselves  i think that is their intention puntojee see they have gathered together i suppose they darent go back and say that you have escaped  give me either your sword or spear  the latter was part of the regular equipment of the mahratta horsemen sufder handed him his sword and as the pursuers advanced towards them at a canter which speedily became a gallop he took his place by the side of sufder and the latter giving the word the band dashed forward to meet their opponents  the combat was a short one sufders followers were all picked men and were better mounted than scindias troopers these made special efforts to get at harry but the latters skill with the sword enabled him to free himself from his most pressing opponents sufder laid about him stoutly and his men seconding him well half their opponents were speedily struck to the ground and the rest turning their horses fled at full speed sufders men would have followed but he shouted to them to draw rein  enough has been done and well done he said if scindia means war nothing will be said about this fight but if he does not complaints will doubtless be laid against us and it is better that we should be able to say that we fought only in self defence and that when the attack ceased we allowed them to ride off unmolested though we might easily enough have slain the whole of them  on arriving at the grove where the troop had halted harry at once resumed his own clothes for although in his early days he had been accustomed to be slightly clad he felt ill at ease riding almost naked here too he found wasil who had ridden with such speed that his pony was too much exhausted for him to ride back with the rest he received his master with the greatest joy for he had feared he would be captured before leaving the camp  they continued their journey to jooneer where they halted for the night sufder went to his house and harry rode out to the farm    chapter 4 a british resident   as harry drew rein at the farm soyera ran out followed by her brother and anundee with cries of joy at his unexpected return it was nearly fifteen months since she had last seen him though he had when opportunity offered sent messages to her assuring her that he was well and hoped ere long to be able to come over to see her  i should scarce have known you she said in those fine clothes of yours you sent word that you were an officer in the peishwas service but i hardly thought that you could be so much changed you have grown a great deal and are now much taller than ramdasss sons  the worthy farmer and anundee were also delighted to see him  how long are you going to stay the former asked  only till tomorrow at daybreak i have to ride forward with all haste to poona for i have been on a mission for nana furnuwees  surely it is not so important that you cannot stay a few hours puntojee  it is of importance you may have known that nana has placed bajee rao on the musnud and he has installed himself as his minister thereby defeating the plans of balloba and scindia who will probably come along here with their whole force in a day or two  late that evening when the others had retired to bed soyera and harry had a long talk together  have you thought harry she asked after speaking for some time about his doings and position at court of joining your people again there is peace between the peishwas court and the english there is a british resident at poona and as you have now gained a certain rank there you could go to him with a much better face than if you had come direct from here as a peasant then it would probably have been supposed that you were an impostor that you were english of course could be seen by your skin but it might have been thought that i had adopted some english child and was now trying to pass it off as the son of an officer  i think mother that i had best continue for some time as i am you see i have at present nothing in common with the english except their blood were another war to break out between the mahrattas and bombay i would at once declare myself to the resident here and go down to bombay but even then my position would be a doubtful one and unless i were to enlist in their army i do not see how i should maintain myself  moreover you must remember that i have now a deep interest in matters here nana furnuwees has treated me with much kindness and placed his confidence in me he has many enemies as i have told you scindia is about to advance against poona and it is probable that he may succeed in driving nana into exile or imprisoning him for life and establishing balloba or some other person devoted to his interest as minister in which case scindia would be absolutely supreme nothing would persuade me to desert nana who has for many years alone withstood the ambition of scindias party i do not say for a moment that my aid would be of the slightest use to him but at any rate he shall see that i am not ungrateful for his kindness and will be faithful to him in his misfortunes as he has been kind to me when in power  that is right soyera said the cause of nana is the cause of all in this part of the deccan for we should be infinitely worse off were scindia to lay hands on us but there is an alternative by which you could at once remain faithful to nana and prepare your way for joining the english when you considered that the time for doing so had arrived  what is that soyera  you might go to the english resident and tell him who you are and how you have been brought up say that at present you wish to remain in the service of nana who has been a good friend to you and with whom your sympathies like those of nearly all the cultivators in the peishwas dominions accord say that you hope when the time comes to return to your countrymen and that in the meantime you will give him any information in your power as to what is going on subject only to your friendship for nana thus by making yourself useful to the resident you may prepare your way for joining your countrymen and at the same time be able to remain with nana until either he is victorious over his enemies or his cause is really lost  the plan is an excellent one harry said and i will certainly adopt it undoubtedly the feeling among the english must be in favour of bajee rao and nana as bajee is the son of rugoba he is their natural ally moreover they would object most strongly to see scindia become master of the whole mahratta power which he would probably use against them at the first opportunity it would as you say greatly facilitate my obtaining a fair position among the english and i might also be able to do nana a service of course i have seen the english resident many times in the streets of poona and more than once on special occasions at mahdoo raos court as it is his business to know something of all connected with the palace it is probable that he may have heard of me at any rate it would be easier to explain to him my position than it would be to go down as a stranger to bombaywhere i should be ignorant as to whom i should first approach and how to declare myselfa matter i have very often thought over  the next morning the troop started at daybreak and riding fast reached poona by noon harry went at once to report what he had seen to nana  i received your letter yesterday the minister said and the news was indeed bad purseram bhow has offered to go out to give battle to scindia but my forces would have no chance not only is scindias army much larger but he has the infantry regiments commanded by foreign officers and against these my infantry could not prevail it would be madness to risk fighting under such circumstances the wheel may turn and ere long i may be in a position to thwart the schemes of scindia and balloba  nana had never been conspicuous for personal courage though his moral courage and his ability to meet any storm were unbounded he was now an old man and dreaded the shock of battle when the chances appeared to be so much against him he could not depend upon the support of bajee who had already shown himself willing to side with the strongest and to make terms for himself without the slightest regard for those who had befriended him  but if your excellency does not think of fighting what course will you pursue  i shall leave the country at once he said if i stop here i know that balloba who is my personal enemy will have me put to death i only need time to recover from this sudden misfortune and it would be madness for me to wait here and to fall into the power of my enemies  purseram bhow is greatly offended because i will not allow him to fight but i who have for so many years done my best to prevent civil war in this countrya war which however it ended would break up the mahratta powerwould not bring its horrors upon poona it is against me that balloba is marching and if i retire bloodshed will be altogether averted  will you accompany me puntojee he asked almost wistfully  assuredly i will do so sir and i think that i can answer for sufder who has i know a great regard for your excellency as to myself i have little hope that i should escape unharmed if balloba arrive here before i leave he detected me even in my disguise in his camp and i had a narrow escape for a party of his cavalry pursued me and would probably have caught me had not sufder with his band met me and defeated them with a loss of half their number you may be sure that balloba will learn who was in command and sufders life would be no safer than my own  may i ask when your excellency is going to leave poona  scouts were sent out yesterday as soon as your letter was read and directly scindias army gets in motion i shall receive news when i do i shall leave the horses will be saddled in readiness and i shall be at the edge of the ghauts by the time scindia arrives here you can tell sufder to come at once he knows the disposition of the captains of the various troops and will be able to tell me who can be depended upon  sufder was indeed outside the palace having told harry that he would wait until he had learned the result of his interview with nana harry briefly related to him his conversation with the minister  i think he is right he said purseram bhow is a stout fighter and is as brave as a lion but scindias force would be double that which he could gather at such a short notice and nana does right not to risk everything on the chance of a single fight he is a wily old fox and has got safely through dangers which would have crushed an ordinary man you will see that before long he will be back again and reinstated in power  at any rate i will accompany him after that thrashing we gave ballobas horsemen my head would not be safe here an hour after his arrival  on the road harry had informed him of the decision at which he had arrived upon soyeras advice and sufder agreed that it would certainly be a wise step accordingly when the latter entered the palace harry went straight to the british residency he sent in his native name to mr malet and asked for an interview and was at once shown in  you wish to speak to me sir the resident said in the mahratta language i think i have seen you at mahdoo raos court  i have seen your excellency there harry replied in the same language  then seeing that the resident spoke the language with difficulty he went on in english  it is a matter chiefly personal to myself  the resident looked at him in surprise for it was the first time he had heard a mahratta speaking english  i am the son of major lindsay who with his wife and escort was murdered by a party of mahrattas seventeen years ago at the time when the english army was advancing against poona i was saved by the fidelity of an ayah who had been in the family for ten years a cousin of hers was fortunately one of the leaders of the party who attacked the camp and with his connivance she carried me off and made her way back to her family near jooneer she stained my skin as you see and allowed it to be supposed that she had married in bombay and that i was her own child  she has brought me up with the intention of my rejoining my countrymen as soon as i became a man for she did not see how until then i could earn my living among strangers she taught me as much as she knew of the language and religion of the english and when i was twelve took me down to bombay and left me for some two years and a half in the house of mrs sankey a lady who taught some of the children of officers there when i left bombay i was able to speak english as well as other english boys of my age  my nurse had from the earliest time i can remember encouraged me in taking part in all sports and games and when i was but eight a soldier a cousin of hers began to teach me my first exercise in arms i continued to work at this until i went down to bombay and on my return spent all my time for some months in riding and shooting after this i was for a year with a famous shikaree and took part in the killing of many tigers and other wild beasts this was fortunate for when through this relation of my nurse i was introduced to nana furnuwees and by him to mahdoo rao the latter was pleased to take a fancy for me and appointed me to the charge of the game preserves  at the present moment i have just returned from a mission in disguise to scindias camp nana has shown me great kindness my intention is to remain with him until he has passed through his present difficulties which are very serious after that i hope to be able to go to bombay and to obtain a commission in the companys service  i remember well the circumstances of the murder of major lindsay and his wife for i was in bombay at the time it was a matter of deep regret to us all for he was greatly liked but at the time everyone was excited over the infamous treaty of wurgaum i remember that when a party was sent out on our receiving the news of the attack the bodies of the major and his wife were found as also those of his servants and sowars but it was reported that no trace could be discovered of the infant or of his ayah it was thought possible that they had escaped and hopes were entertained that the woman might have carried off her charge i have no doubt as to the truth of your story  is your nurse still alive  she is sir as is also the man who assisted her his name is sufder and he commands a troop of the peishwas cavalry both will testify at the right time to the truth of my statement  i can the more readily believe it the resident said inasmuch as in spite of your colour i can perceive a certain likeness to major lindsay whom i knew intimately  my intention in coming to see you now sir was to offer to furnish any information to you concerning the movements and plans of nana furnuwees so far as such information could do him no harm  i heard that there had been discussions between nana and purseram bhow the latter wishing to give battle to scindia but i think that nana is right in refusing to sanction this for from all i hear scindias army is very much the stronger  it is sir and i should say that purserams army could hardly be depended upon to fight under such circumstances  what is nana going to do  he is going to retire as soon as scindias army is fairly in motion  he is in an awkward position mr malet said but he has reinstated himself several times when it seemed that everything was lost i have great respect for his abilities and he is the only man who can curb the ambition of scindia and his ministers scindias entire supremacy would be most unwelcome to us for indeed it is only owing to the mutual jealousy of the three great chiefs of the mahratta nation that we have gained successes were the whole power in one hand we should certainly lose surat and probably bassein and salsette and have to fight hard to hold bombay  i shall be very glad to receive any reports you can supply me with for it is next to impossible to obtain anything like trustworthy information here we only hear what it is desired that we should know and all these late changes have come as a complete surprise to me for what news i do obtain is more often than not false unfortunately truth is a virtue almost unknown among the mahrattas they have a perfect genius for intrigue and consider it perfectly justifiable to deceive not only enemies but friends  and when do you think of declaring yourself mr lindsay  i shall remain with nana so long as there is the slightest chance of his success unless indeed the course of affairs should lead to the english intervening in these troubles then in case they declare against nana i should feel it my duty to leave him at once  i do not think there is any probability of that our policy has been to support him as the peishwas minister against either scindia or holkar i shall of course report your appearance to the authorities at bombay and i am sure there will be a disposition to advance your views for the sake of your father and moreover your knowledge of the language of the mahrattaswhich is of course perfect or you could not have maintained your deception so longwill of itself be a strong recommendation in your favour  after thanking mr malet for his kindness harry returned to sufders camp and gave him an account of his interview with the resident  that is satisfactory indeed puntojee it shows the wisdom of the step you took now as to our affairs here i have mentioned the names of five captains of troops all of whom can i think be relied upon however i am now going out to see them and have only been waiting for your return six hundred men is but a small body but it is a beginning and i have no doubt that others will join nana later on but i am not sufficiently sure of their sentiments to open the matter to them and it is essential that no suspicion of nanas intention to leave the town should get about there might be a riot in the city and possibly some of the captains who have not received the promotion which they regard as their due might try to gain scindias favour by arresting him  on the following day a messenger arrived from nana requesting sufder to place himself with his troop and such other captains as he could rely upon on the road a mile west of poona he himself would leave the town quietly with a small body of his friends and join them there sufder at once sent off five of his men with orders to the captains whom he had seen on the previous afternoon and within an hour six hundred men were gathered at the point indicated half an hour later a party of horsemen were seen coming along and furnuwees soon rode up accompanied by several of his strongest adherents  the officers were gathered at the head of their troops nana drawing rein said to them  thanks for your fidelity i shall not forget it and hope when the time comes to reward it as it deserves  he motioned to harry to join him  scindias army was to march this morning he said and his horsemen will be here by tomorrow evening at latest  they rode to satara where nana had arranged to stop until he received news from purseram bhow as to the course of events at poona and two days later a messenger rode in with news that scindia had arrived near poona and had had a friendly interview with bajee rao balloba had seen purseram and had pretended great friendship for him but the old soldier was by no means deceived by his protestations  if we had only to do with scindia nana said matters could be easily arranged but the young rajah is only a puppet in his ministers hands  several days passed and then another letter came from purseram it said that balloba had resolved to oppose bajee rao and to have both a minister and a peishwa of his own nomination and that he proposed to him that mahdoo raos widow should adopt chimnajee as her son that bajee should be placed in confinement and that he purseram bhow should be his minister he asked nanas advice as to what course he should take he stated that balloba had said he was greatly influenced in the methods he proposed by the hope of rendering them in some degree acceptable to nana  as the latter had only placed bajee rao on the musnud as a means of checkmating scindia he advised purseram to accept the offer but pointed out the absolute necessity for his retaining bajee in his own custody purseram omitted to follow this portion of the advice and a formal reconciliation took place by letter between balloba and nana the latter was invited to proceed at once to poona but on finding that purseram had allowed balloba to retain bajee in his hands he suspected that the whole was a scheme to entice him into the power of his enemy and he therefore made excuses for not going  bajee ignorant of the plot that had been planned went to scindias camp to remonstrate against a heavy demand for money on account of the expenses to which scindia had been put and to his astonishment he was then and there made a prisoner chimnajee positively refused to become a party to the usurpation of his brothers rights but he was compelled by threats to ascend the musnud on the day after his installation purseram bhow wrote proposing that nana should come to poona to meet balloba and to assume the civil administration of the new peishwas government while the command of the troops and all military arrangements should remain as they stood  in reply nana requested that purseram should send his son hurry punt to settle the preliminaries but instead of coming as an envoy hurry punt left poona with over five thousand chosen horse this naturally excited nanas suspicions which were strengthened by a letter from rao phurkay who was in command of the peishwas household troops warning him to seek safety without a moments delay  now that he saw that half measures were no longer possible nana ceased to be irresolute and when his fortunes seemed to all men to be desperate commenced a series of successful intrigues that astonished all india he had quietly increased his force during the weeks of waiting since he had left poona he had ample funds having carried away with him an immense treasure accumulated during his long years of government there was no time to be lost and as soon as he received the letter of warning he left the town of waee and made for the concan  as soon as he reached the ghauts he set the whole of his force to block the passes by rolling great stones down into the roads in addition strong barricades were constructed and a force of two hundred men left at each point to defend them the infantry he had recruited he threw into the fort of raygurh and added strongly to its defences  balloba had proposed that nana should be followed without delay and offered some of scindias best troops for the purpose but purseram acting in accordance with the advice of some of nanas friends raised an objection he had now however resolved to break altogether with the minister whose timidity at the critical moment was considered by him as a proof that he could never again be formidable and he accordingly gave up nanas estates to scindia and took possession of his houses and property in poona for his own use after remaining for a few days waiting events and sending off many messengers nana sent for harry  i have a mission for you he said it is one that requires daring and great intelligence and i know no one to whom it could be better committed than to you you see that owing to the turn events have taken bajee rao and myself are natural allies we have both suffered at the hands of balloba he is a prisoner in scindias camp though as i understand free to move about in it i privately received a hint that bajee himself recognizes this but doubtless he believes that i am powerless to help either myself or him  in this he is mistaken i have been in communication with holkar who is alarmed at the everincreasing power of scindia and he will throw his whole power into the scale to aid me the rajahs of berar and kolapoore have engaged to aid me for the same reason and the nizam will sign the treaty that was agreed upon between us some time since rao phurkay has engaged to bring the peishwas household troops over when the signal is given  more than that i have through ryajee a patal who is an enemy of balloba opened negotiations with scindia himself offering him the estates of purseram bhow and the fort of surrenuggar with territory yielding ten lakhs on condition of his placing balloba in confinement reestablishing bajee rao on the musnud and returning with his troops to his own territory  i have no doubt that when bajee rao hears this he will be glad enough to throw himself heartily into the cause i may tell you that he is apparently a guest rather than a prisoner and that he has a camp of his own in the centre of that of scindia and therefore when you have once made your way into his encampment you will have no difficulty in obtaining a private interview with him it is necessary that he should have money and silver would be too heavy for you to carry but i will give you bags containing a thousand gold mohurs which will enable him to begin the work of privately raising troops  i will undertake the business sir the only person i fear in the smallest degree is balloba himself i must disguise myself so that he will not recognize me  without delay harry mounted his horse placed the two bags of money that had been handed to him in the wallets behind his saddle exchanged his dress for that of one of sufders troopers and then started for poona which he reached the next day he did not enter the town but put up at a cultivators two miles distant from it  i want to hire a cart with two bullocks he said to the man can you furnish one  as i do not know you i should require some money paid down as a guarantee that they will be returned  that i can give you but i shall leave my horse here and that is fully worth your waggon and oxen however i will leave with you a hundred rupees i may not keep your waggon many days  after it was dark harry went to the town and purchased some paints and other things that he required for disguise having used these he went to the house of the british resident and on stating who he was he was shown in mr malet did not recognize in the roughlydressed countryman the young officer who had called upon him before  i am harry lindsay and being in poona called upon you to give you some information  i recognize you by your voice the resident said but i fear that there is nothing of importance that you can tell me now that nana furnuwees is homeless and bajee rao is no longer peishwa  nana is not done with yet sir  why he is a fugitive with a handful of troops under him  but he has his brains sir which are worth more than an army and believe me if all goes well it will not be long before he is back in poona as minister to the peishwa  minister to chimnajee  no sir minister to bajee rao  i would that it were so mr malet said but since one is a fugitive and the other a prisoner i see no chance whatever of such a transformation  i will briefly tell you sir what is preparing bajee feeling certain that he will ere long be sent to a fortress has communicated with nana imploring him to aid him  if he has turned to nana for support he is either mad or acting as ballobas tool  on the contrary sir i think that his doing so shows that he recognizes nanas ability and feels that ere long he may become a useful ally already nana has been at work holkar who naturally views with intense jealousy scindias entire control of the territory of the peishwa has already agreed to put his whole army in the field rao phurkay will rebel with the household troops and what is vastly more important scindia has embraced nanas offer of a large sum of money and a grant of territory to arrest balloba and to replace bajee on the musnud in addition to this he has won over the rajah of berar has incited the rajah of kolapoore to attack the district of purseram bhow and has obtained the nizams approbation of a treaty that had already been settled between nana and the nizams general the basis of which is that bajee is to be reestablished with nana himself as minister and on the other hand the territory formerly seized by the peishwa to be restored  my mission here is to inform bajee rao of the plans that have been prepared and to obtain from him a solemn engagement that nana shall be reappointed as his minister on the success of his plans  mr malet listened to harry with increasing astonishment  this is important news indeed he said marvellous and of the highest importance to me already i have been asked by the council of bombay to give my opinion as to whether it is expedient to render any assistance to nana furnuwees it is to them almost as important as to nana that scindia should not obtain supreme power i have replied that i could not recommend any such step for that nanas cause seemed altogether lost and that any aid to him would be absolutely useless and would only serve scindia with a pretext for declaring war against us of course what you have told me entirely alters the situation it will not be necessary for the council to assist nana but they can give him fair words and even if balloba should win the day he will have no ground for accusing us of having aided nana  it is impossible to overlook the value of your communication mr lindsay and i can promise you that you will not find the government of bombay ungrateful for it will relieve them of the anxiety which the progress of events here has caused them  on leaving the residency harry returned to the farm where he had left his horse and early next morning put on his disguise again painted lines round his eyes touched some of the hairs of his eyebrows with white paint mixed some white horsehair with the tuft on the top of his head and dropped a little juice of a plant resembling belladonnaused at times by ladies in the east to dilate the pupils of their eyes and make them dark and brilliantin his eyes  soyera had told him of this herb when he related to her how balloba had detected him by the lightness of his eyes he was greatly surprised at the alteration it effected in his appearance and felt assured that even balloba himself would not again recognize him  he bought a dozen sacks of grain from the farmer and placing these in the bullock cart started for scindias camp he had during the night buried the gold for he thought that until he knew his ground and could feel certain of entering bajee raos camp unquestioned it would be better that there should be nothing in the cart were he searched to betray him he carried in his hand the long staff universally used by bullock drivers and passing through poona arrived an hour later at the camp which was pitched some three miles from the city  as large numbers of carts with forage and provisions arrived daily in the camp for the use of the troops no attention whatever was paid to him and on enquiring for the encampment of bajee raoone of whose officers had he said purchased the grain for his horses and those of his officers and escorthe soon found the spot which was on somewhat rising ground in the centre of the camp it was much larger than he had expected to find it as beyond being prevented from leaving bajee had full liberty and was even permitted to have some of his friends round him and two or three dozen troopers of his household regiment  in charge of these was a young officer who was well known to harry during the time of mahdoo rao seeing him standing in front of a tent harry stopped the cart opposite to him and leaving it went up to him  where shall i unload the cart he asked  i know nothing about it the officer said who has ordered it the supply will be welcome enough for we are very short of forage  then changing his tone harry said  you do not know me nujeef i am your friend puntojee  impossible the other said incredulously  it is so i am not here for amusement as you may guess but am on a private mission to bajee rao will you inform him that i am here i dare not say whom i come from even to you but can explain myself fully to him  i will let him know certainly puntojee but there is little doubt that balloba has his spies here and it will be necessary to arrange that your meeting shall not be noticed do you sit down here by your cart as if waiting for orders where to unload it i will go across to bajees tent and see him  nujeef accordingly went over to the rajahs tent and returned in a quarter of an hour  bajee will see you he said first unload your grain in the lines of our cavalry place some in front of your bullocks and leave them there then cross to the tent next to bajees it is occupied by one of his officers who carries the purse and makes payments should you be watched it would seem that you are only going there to receive the price of the grain bajee himself will slip out of the rear of his tent and enter the next in the same way the officer is at present absent so that you can talk without anyone having an idea that you and bajee are together  harry carried out the arrangement and after leaving his bullocks made his way to the spot indicated he found the young rajah had gone there  and you are puntojee the latter said i saw you but a few times but rao phurkay has often mentioned your name to me as being one who stood high in the confidence of my cousin mahdoo nujeef tells me that you have a private communication to make to me and indeed i can well believe that you would not thus disguise yourself unless the business was important  it is your highness nana furnuwees has received your message he reciprocates your expressions of friendship and has sent me here to let you know that the time is approaching when your deliverance from balloba can be achieved  he then delivered the message with which he had been entrusted bajees face became radiant as he went on  this is news indeed he said that phurkay was faithful to me i knew but i thought that he was the only friend i had left truly nana furnuwees is a great man and i will gladly give the undertaking he asks for that in the event of his succeeding in placing me on the musnud he shall be my minister with the same authority and power that he had under mahdoo  i have at the farmhouse where i am stopping a thousand gold mohurs which nana has sent to enable you to begin your preparations but he urges that you should be extremely careful for as you see by what i have told you he has ample power to carry out the plan without any assistance from yourself and it is most important that nothing shall be done that can arouse the suspicions of balloba until all is ready for the final stroke i have not brought it with me today as i knew not how vigilant they might be in camp and it was possible that my sacks of grain might be examined as however i passed in without question i will bring it when i next come which will be in two days  i suppose there is no objection to my telling phurkay what is being done  none at all your highness he has not yet been informed though communications have passed between him and nana but although the latter was well convinced of his devotion he thought it safer that no one should know the extent of the plot until all was in readiness  two days later harry made another journey to the camp and this time with the bags of money hidden among the grain in one of the sacks he saw bajee rao as before and received from him a paper with the undertaking required by nana the sack containing the money was put down where bajees horses were picketed and was there opened by a confidential servant who carried the bags into the tent which was close by  as he was leaving the camp harry had reason to congratulate himself on the precautions that he had taken for he met balloba riding along with a number of officers harry had with his change of costume assumed the appearance of age he walked by the side of the bullocks stooping greatly and leaning on his staff and the minister passed without even glancing at him  harry on his return paid the farmer for the hire of his cart the latter was well pleased for in addition to the money so earned he had charged a good price for the two waggon loads of grain harry then put off the peasants dress and resumed that of a trooper and rode back to raygurh where he reported to nana the success of his mission    chapter 5 down to bombay   harrys stay with nana was a short one as in three days he was again sent to poona this time he was to take up his abode at a large house occupied by two of the leaders of bajees party the rajah having told him that he would request them to entertain him if he should again come to poona he was the bearer of fifty thousand rupees principally in gold which he was to give to them for the use of bajee he had no message this time for the prince personally nana having said to him  i want you to let me know how matters are going on the young man may do something rash and if ballobas suspicions are in any way excited he may send him to some distant fortress which would seriously upset my plans for i should have to retain chimnajee in power as representative of his brother  we know that he was placed on the musnud greatly in opposition to his wishes and he certainly hailed with pleasure the prospect of bajees release still it would not be the same thing for me a minister of the peishwa can rule without question by the people but acting only as minister to a representative of the peishwa he would be far more severely criticised and it is certain that to raise money for paying scindia the sum that has been agreed upon extra taxation must be put on the odium resulting from which would fall upon me  the two officers received harry cordially he had personally known them both and as nanas representative they would have treated him with much honour had it not been pointed out to them that this might be fatal to their plans for did balloba hear that some strange officer was being so treated by them he would be sure to set at once about finding out who he was and what he was doing there  matters are going on well they said the old general manajee phurkay who was one of rugobas devoted adherents is now staying in bajees camp and is enlisting men for his service  where are they being assembled  in bajees camp he is not interfered with there  it appears to be a very rash proceeding harry said it is true that bajee has apparent liberty and can have with him in his camp many of his friends but a gathering of armed men can scarcely escape the eye of so keen an observer as balloba  illustration harry    saw a party of soldiers coming along the road  a few days later harry being out one evening saw a party of soldiers coming along the road from the direction of scindias camp this was unusual for in order to prevent plundering the orders were stringent that none of scindias troops should enter poona he hurried back to the house and acquainted the two leaders with what he had seen they were inclined to laugh at his apprehension but when a body of horsemen were seen coming down the street they issued orders for the doors to be closed and barricaded there were some twenty men in the house and when the officer who commanded the detachment summoned them to open the door and to deliver the two nobles to him he was met by a decided refusal from the chiefs themselves from an upper window  the officer then ordered his men to dismount and break open the door but when they attempted to do so they were met by a fire of musketry from every window many fell and the officer seeing that the house could not be taken except by a force much larger than that at his command rode off at full speed with the survivors to scindias camp  no sooner had they gone than the horses were brought out from the stables and the two officers with ten of their troopers rode off at full speed harry refused to accompany them as he wished to see what had really happened in order to carry the news to nana he therefore rode out to the farmhouse where he had before stayed left his horse there and returned to poona  here he heard that rao phurkay had been seized and that bajee raos encampment was surrounded by troops who suffered none to enter or leave it the next morning he went over there and found that as the supply of water had been cut off the garrison had surrendered all being allowed to depart with the exception of bajee over whom a strong guard had been placed  before they left manajee phurkay gave them all directions to gather in the neighbourhood of waee they did so and were joined at once by the two chiefs nana promptly sent them a supply of money telling them to take up their position at the salpee ghaut where they were speedily joined by ten thousand men and openly declared for bajee rao  in the meantime balloba believing that the whole plot was the work of bajee rao determined to despatch him as a prisoner to a fortress in the heart of scindias dominions he sent him off with a strong escort under the charge of an officer named sukaram ghatgay who although having command only of a troop of one hundred horse belonged to an ancient and honourable family  balloba could hardly have made a worse choice ghatgay had a daughter who was reported to be of exceptional beauty and the young scindia had asked her father for her hand ghatgay an ambitious and enterprising man had given no decided answer not from any real hesitation for he saw how enormous would be the advantage to himself of such an alliance but in order to increase scindias ardour by pretended opposition and so to secure the best terms possible for himself the reason he gave would appear natural to any mahratta of good blood as none of these would have given a daughter of their house to one who however high in rank had ancestors belonging to a low caste  upon the way bajee who was aware of scindias wishes and was most anxious to obtain his goodwill urged ghatgay to give him his daughter in marriage and after much pretended hesitation the latter agreed to do soon condition that bajee would authorize him to promise scindia a large sum of money as soon as he again ascended the musnud and that he would get the prince to appoint him his prime minister which post would be vacant at the overthrow of balloba this being arranged bajee rao pretended that he was seriously ill and ghatgay therefore halted with his escort on the banks of the paira  taking with him his disguise as a countryman harry as soon as he learned that ghatgay had started with bajee mounted and followed him and travelled at some little distance in rear of the party until they halted then he went to the house of a cultivator left his horse there and exchanged his dress as fighting man for that of a countryman  there was no occasion for him now to disguise his age or darken his eyes and as before he hired a cart bought some grain for forage some sacks of rice and other things and boldly entered ghatgays camp as the prices he asked were low ghatgay purchased the whole contents of his cart when this was cleared harry left his cattle and wandered about saying that he and the animals needed an hours rest  presently he passed bajee rao who was standing listlessly at the door of a tent  i am puntojee harry said as he passed i followed you with the horse that i might help you to escape  stay and talk to me here the young prince said it will seem that i am only passing my time in asking you questions about the country  i wanted to ascertain the road by which you will travel after crossing the river i have money with me and will endeavour to raise a force of forty or fifty men with which to make a sudden attack upon your camp after nightfall i will bring a good horse with me if you will run out when you hear the uproar i will ride up with the spare horse you will leap on to its back and we can gallop off  you are a brave fellow puntojee and i thank you heartily for your offer but happily i stand in no need of it i have gained ghatgay over and he will linger here until we hear that balloba has been arrested and that nana furnuwees is approaching poona believe me i shall never forget your offer or the fidelity that has prompted it and when i am established as peishwa you shall if it pleases you have any post at court you may desire  i thank you much prince but i am an officer of nana and know that in acting as i have done i am acting in his interest as well as yours i am glad that the necessity for making an attack upon the camp is obviated i might have had considerable trouble in raising a sufficient force for such a purpose for even the most reckless would hesitate to fall on one of scindias officers and in the next place although i doubt not that i should have been able to carry you off ghatgay would as soon as he had beaten off the attacking party have set out in pursuit and raised the whole country and the difficulty of reaching the western ghauts would have been immense  i hope to see your highness at poona  so saying he strolled carelessly back to the bullock cart waited till the animals had finished their feed and then drove off again returned the cart to its owner and started again for poona  on his arrival there he went to the residency and informed mr malet that bajee had gained over the officer who was escorting him and was ready to come back to poona as soon as the blow was struck  it will be struck soon mr malet said all is in readiness i sent your report on to the council urging that as it seemed likely that bajee rao would soon be on the musnud they should express their readiness to recognize him i received a despatch only yesterday saying that they perfectly agreed with me and had already sent off a messenger to nana stating their willingness to recognize bajee as lawful heir to the late peishwa  things are working well the nizams general has been ordered to watch purseram bhow who is raising troops for the purpose of aiding in crushing bajees supporters holkar and scindias troops also are in readiness to move and after the fete of the dussera the regular battalions in the peishwas service commanded by mr boyd will march to the neera bridge and a brigade of scindias regulars will move against raygurh  it is evident that neither balloba nor purseram has the slightest suspicion of what is going on or they would never have despatched troops from here i certainly have felt very uneasy since bajee was carried away for he is a necessary figure and should be here as soon as nana arrives otherwise there would be no recognized head it would have been hopeless to try to deliver him once imprisoned in one of the strong fortresses in scindias dominions and the latter could have made any terms for himself that he chose to dictate  your news has relieved me of this anxiety and i think it probable that everything will now be managed without bloodshed and that we may for a time have peace here  the next morning harry rode off and rejoined nana who thanked him warmly for the manner in which he had carried out his mission and especially for his offer to attempt to rescue bajee from his captors  it would have been the greatest misfortune he said had he been carried far away i should have been obliged to recognize his brother chimnajee and scindia having bajee in his hands would have kept up a constant pressure and might probably have marched to poona to restore him which he would certainly have succeeded in doing for the feeling of the population would have been all in favour of the lawful heir  as a token of my satisfaction here is an order upon my treasurer for fifty thousand rupees  all being ready scindia on the 27th of october suddenly arrested balloba and sent a body of his troops with those of the nizams general for the purpose of seizing purseram bhow the latter receiving news of what had happened in good time and taking with him chimnajee fled to a fortress but was quickly pursued and obliged to surrender bajee rao was brought back to beema eighteen miles from poona his brother amrud and rao phurkay were also released  nana joined his army at the salpee ghaut and scindias infantry under mr boyd marched for the capital which nana refused to enter however until he had received a formal declaration from bajee that he intended no treachery against him this pledge was given and a treaty was at the same time entered into by the nizam and scindia both agreeing to establish bajee rao on the musnud and reinstate nana as his prime minister these matters being settled nana returned to poona from which he had been absent for nearly a year and resumed the duties of prime minister  a fortnight later bajee rao was solemnly invested as peishwa one of his first acts was to send for harry to whom he gave a robe of honour and thirty thousand rupees in money in token of his gratitude for the risk he had run in communicating with him and for his daring proposal to rescue him from the hands of his escort  on the day after nanas reentry into the capital harry received a note from mr malet asking him to call  i expect colonel palmer to relieve me of my duties here in the course of a day or two i need scarcely say i shall be glad to be released from a work which is surrounded with infinite difficulty and which constantly upsets all human calculations nana is in power again but another turn of the wheel may take place at any moment and he may again be an exile or possibly a prisoner  it seems to me that it would be well for you to accompany me to bombay the remembrance of your services will be fresh and they cannot but be recognized by the council that body is frequently changed and in two or three years time there will be fresh men who will know nothing of what has happened now and be indisposed to rake up old reports and letters or to reward past services especially as the whole position here may have altered half a dozen times before that  i will gladly do so sir and thank you very heartily for your kindness i will ride over to jooneer tomorrow and bring my old nurse down with me and i have no doubt sufder will be willing to accompany us he has rendered good services to nana and the latter will i am sure grant him leave of absence for as long as may be necessary  i think it would certainly be best to take them both down if possible they could make affidavits in bombay that would place it beyond doubt that you are major lindsays son it is morally certain that there are relatives of your father and mother still living in england i do not say that you require any assistance from them but when you return home as everyone does two or three times in the course of his indian service it would be pleasant to find friends there and it would be well that your position should be established beyond all question  i will gladly go down with you soyera said when harry laid the matter before her i am happy and contented here but should be glad to see bombay again it was my home for ten years i am very glad you have made up your mind to go for it is time that you should take your place among your countrymen and the recommendation of the resident at the court of poona is as good a one as you could wish for  i should say that you had better give up at once staining your skin i can see that you have not used the dye for some days and it would be as well to recover your proper colour before mr malet introduces you to the council at bombay  i will ride down to the town harry said and engage a gharry a native carriage to carry you to poona when we get there i shall learn what route mr malet will take and how fast he will travel and shall then see which will be the best for youto go down in a gharry or to be carried in a dhoolie a palanquin  but all this will cost money harry  i am well provided with funds harry said for the nana and bajee rao have both made me handsome presents for the services i rendered them there is therefore no reason why we should not travel in comfort  they arrived at poona two days later and harryhaving ascertained that the new resident would not arrive until the next day and that he would probably wish mr malet to defer his departure for at least two days in order to give him his experience of the factions and intrigues there and of the character of all those who were likely to influence eventsrode to see nana who had not yet returned to poona  i have come your excellency he said to tell you that it is my wish to retire from the public service  the minister looked greatly surprised  why puntojee he said this sounds like madness young as you are you have secured powerful protectors both in the peishwa and myself and you may hope to reach a high office in the state as you grow older  i do not know though he went on speaking to himself rather than to the lad that high office is a thing to be desired it means being mixed up in intrigues of all kinds being the object of jealousy and hatred and running a terrible risk of ruin at every change in the government here  then he turned again to harry  and what are you thinking of doing  i will speak frankly to your highness i am not a mahratta as you and everyone else suppose i am the son of english parents  and he then went on to give an account of the killing of his father and mother and of how he was saved by soyera and brought up as her son until such times as he might with advantage go down to bombay nana listened with great interest  it is a strange tale he said when harry brought the story to a conclusion and explains things which have at times surprised me in the first place the colour of your eyes always struck me as peculiar then your figure is not that of my countrymen there are many as tall as you but they have not your width of shoulders and strong build lastly i have wondered how a young mahratta should be endowed with so much energy and readiness be willing to take heavy responsibilities on his shoulders and to be so full of resource  now that you have told me your story i think you are right to go down and join your own people everything is disturbed and nothing is certain from day to day here i was a fugitive but a short time ago and ere long i may again be an exile  moreover no one can tell what may happen to him your people are quarrelling with tippoo as they quarrelled with his father hyder and i think that before long it is possible they will overthrow him and take possession of his territory  were the various powers of india united this could not be so but the english will always find some ready to enter into an alliance with them and will so enlarge their dominions the mahrattas may laugh at the idea of their being overthrown by such small armies as those the english generals command but our constant dissensions and the mutual jealousy between holkar scindia the peishwa the rajah of berar and others will prevent our ever acting together it may be that we shall be conquered piecemeal  i have watched very closely all that has taken place in southern india and in bengal i have seen a handful of traders gradually swallowing up the native powers and it seems to me that it may well be that in time they may become the masters of all india were i to say as much to any of our princes they would scoff at my prediction but it has been my business to learn what was passing elsewhere and i have agents at madras and calcutta and their reports are ever that the power of the english is increasing a few years ago it seemed that the french were going to carry all before them but they like our native princes have gone down before the english who seem moreover to get on better than the french with the natives and to win their respect and liking  well young sir i shall be sorry to lose you because while i and with good reason was seldom able to trust and to give my absolute confidence to any of those around me i have always felt that i could wholly rely on you during the past year i have seen much of you and have freely told my plans to you as i have done to no others and have chosen you for missions that i could not with safety have entrusted to any of my own followers knowing that scindia or holkar would be ready to pay great sums for these secrets none except bajee to whom i sent you with particulars were aware of the extent of my plans or that i was in communication with more than one of the rajahs  you have played your part marvellously well for i should not have deemed it possible that one of your race could live so long among us without exciting any suspicion while you remain in bombay i hope that you will act as my confidential agent i do not ask you to divulge any secrets you may learn relating to projects connected with the deccan but i should like to be informed as to the course of affairs generally of course my dealings with the council there must be carried on through the english resident but there is much information respecting the views of the council with regard to tippoo the nizam and bengal that will be valuable for me to know  i could not so act your excellency without permission from the council but i should imagine that they would not be averse to such an arrangement especially as perhaps you would give me private information as to the state of parties here such as you would not care to tell their resident  certainly i would do so they change their residents so frequently that it would be impossible for new men to really understand the situation which you with your intimate knowledge of poona could readily grasp of course the arrangement could only be temporary as my own position is so uncertain and in any case my life cannot now be a long one  i should propose that your salary as my private agent be a thousand rupees a month  i thank you much sir and if i stay at bombay and obtain the permission of the council to correspond with you i will readily undertake the part they can have little objection to the arrangement as doubtless you have agents in bombay already  certainly i have but these are natives and necessarily can only send me the rumours current in the bazaars or known generally to the public and their news is for the most part worthless  i have another favour to request harry said namely that you will give leave of absence to sufder in order that he may accompany me to bombay he and my old nurse could alone substantiate my birth and identity and it would be necessary for them to give their evidence before some legal authority  that i will readily do sufder is honest and faithful and i can rely upon him absolutely for anything in his sphere of duty and have only today appointed him to the command of two hundred men but although he has a hand ready to strike he has no brain capable of planning had it not been so i should before this have raised him to a higher position when he returns from bombay i will grant him the revenues of a village of which he shall be the patal a mayor so that in his old age he will be able to live in comfort  on leaving the minister harry went to sufders camp  so you are back again puntojee  yes and have brought soyera down with me  i have great news to tell you the soldier went on  it will not be news to me sufder i know that your command has been doubled and that you will now be the captain of two hundred men but i can tell you much more than that you are to accompany me down to bombay the day after tomorrow so as to give evidence about my birth and furthermore nana will on your return bestow upon you the jagheer revenue of a village district so that as he says when you grow too old for service you will be able to live comfortably  that is good news indeedbetter even than that i am to have the command of two hundred men for in truth i am beginning to be weary of service i am now nearly fifty and i feel myself growing stiff nothing would please me more than to be the patal of a village community of which i hold the jagheer however so long as nana lives and retains power i shall remain a soldier but at his death i shall serve no other master and shall take to country life again  does nana know that you are english  yes i have told him my story i was obliged to give my reasons for resigning and as nana has the support of the government of bombay there was no risk in my doing so  how long will it be before i get quite rid of this colour sufder  that i cannot say i should think that in a fortnight the greater part of it will have faded out but maybe soyera knows of something that will remove it more rapidly  soyera when asked said that she knew of nothing that would remove the dye at once but that if he washed his hands and face two or three times a day with a strong lye made from the ashes of a plant that grows everywhere on the plain it would help to get rid of it  i will go out tomorrow morning and fetch some in  when she had made the lye and mixed it with oil it made a very strong soap  how do you mean to dress to go down harry  i have no choice but even if i had i should ride out of here in my best court suit and change it for english clothes when we got down the ghauts i may have to come up here again for aught i know and it is better therefore that no one should know that i am english  mr malet however solved the difficulty for when in the evening harry went to enquire about the time that they would start he said  i had been thinking of offering you a suit to ride down in but unfortunately my clothes would be a great deal too small for you however i think that after all it is best you should go down as you are in the first place you would not show to advantage in english clothes in which you would feel tight and uncomfortable at first and in the second place i think that it is perhaps as well that the council should see you as you are then they would the better understand how you have been able to pass as a mahratta all these years  i will introduce you now to colonel palmer it is important that he should know you for possibly you may be sent up here on some mission or otherfor which having the favour of nana you would be specially fitted  accordingly the next morning they started early soyera had prepared the liquid soap but as it was decided that he should go in native dress harry thought it as well not to use it especially as the dye was gradually wearing off the party consisted of mr malet sufder and harry with an escort of ten cavalrymen belonging to one of the native regiments the mission clerk had been transferred to colonel palmer as his knowledge of affairs would be useful to the newcomer soyera was carried in a dhoolie and followed close behind the troopers  that evening they descended the ghauts into the concan and encamped there and on the following day rode into bombay where mr malet took them to an hotel principally used by natives of rank visiting bombay  you had best stay here till i send for you he said to harry i shall see some of the council tonight no doubt there will be a formal meeting tomorrow to ask my opinion about the probability of the present state of things continuing at poona i shall of course tell them your story and they will likely request you to go at once to see them therefore do not leave the hotel until you hear from me  sufder had not previously visited bombay and the next morning early he went out with soyera as his guide to inspect the european part of the town he was much struck with the appearance of neatness and order in the fort and the solidity of the buildings  it is a strong place assuredly he said to harry on his return in the first place it would be necessary for a force attacking it to cross over the narrow isthmus and causeway uniting the island with the land and that would be impossible in face of a force provided with artillery guarding it then if they succeeded in winning that they would have to make their way through the native town to get on to the maidan and this would be defended by the guns from all the batteries and in addition to the artillery on land it might be swept by guns on board ship truly those who talked about driving the english into the sea cannot have known anything of the strength of the position  as to carrying it by assault it could not be done nor could the garrison be starved out since they could always obtain supplies of all sorts by sea and yet except at the causeway the place has no natural strength the mahrattas acted unwisely indeed when they allowed the english to settle here  they could not foresee the future sufder now doubtless they are sorry but if in the future the british become masters of india the mahrattas will have no reason to regret having given them a foothold wherever their powers extend the natives are far better off than they were under the rule of their own princes were the british masters there would be no more wars no more jealousies and no more intrigues the peasants would till their fields in peace and the men who now take to soldiering would find more peaceful modes of earning a living  but you do not think surely harryfor after leaving poona he had been told to call him sothat the english can ever become masters of india they conquered the carnatic but even there they were not safe from the forays of hyder ali mysore bars their way farther north then there is the nizam to be dealt with and then berar and the mahrattas then comes rajputana and beyond are the sikhs and the fierce chiefs of scinde it is true that the english have beaten the peoples of lower bengal but these have always been looked down upon and despised as cowardly and effeminate by the fighting men of all india  besides how few are the white soldiers they say too that the french have promised tippoo to send a big army to help to drive the english into the sea  the french have quite work enough at home harry said it is true that they have got into egypt but they are shut up there by our fleets moreover even were they to cross over into arabia how could they march across a dry and almost waterless country for a thousand or two of miles when they arrived in scinde they would find all the fighting men of the province and the sikhs opposed to them and they would never be able to fight their way down to mysore the thing is absurd  the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a messenger from the government house with a request that mr lindsay should at once attend there harrys horse which had been saddled in readiness was brought round for it would have seemed strange for a mahratta whose dress showed that he held a good position to go on foot sufder rode by his side soyera following on foot  dismounting at the government house he threw the reins to one of the lads who were waiting in readiness to hold the horses of officers coming to see the governor on harry mentioning his name the native doorkeeper said  i have orders for you to be taken at once to the council chamber sahib on your arrival here  the governor with four members of the council and mr malet were seated at a long table mr malet rose and said  this is mr lindsay gentlemen  truly sir it would be difficult to recognize you as a fellow countryman in that garb the governor said though your colour is somewhat less dark than that of a mahratta  since i left poona i have ceased to dye sir as to my dress this will be the last time i shall wear it unless i should be called upon to go to poona again  your story is a most singular one the governor said but mr malet assures us that you are the son of major lindsay and has been telling us how you escaped the massacre at the camp and how your ayah has brought you up  she has come down with me sir i thought that her testimony would be necessary and i have also brought down her cousin who was present at the foray in which my father and mother were killed my account will be confirmed by their statements  you do credit to mahratta food and training mr lindsay but mr malet has mentioned to me that at one time you were employed as a shikaree to keep down the tigers which were doing havoc among the villagers near the top of the ghauts he has also informed us of the very valuable service you rendered by informing him of nana furnuwees measures for regaining power and replacing bajee rao on the musnudintelligence which saved us a great expenditure of money in preparing to support him with the certainty that by doing so we might excite the enmity of scindia he tells us also why you continued so long in the deccan instead of coming down here and i think you acted very wisely  we have mentioned your services in that matter in our reports to the board of directors and have said that partly as a recognition of this and partly because you are the son of an english officer who was killed in their service we should at once give you an appointment subject to their approval  now sir which would you prefer the civil or military branch  i should much prefer the military harry answered without hesitation unless indeed sir you think my services would be more useful in the civil  if we were at calcutta or madras there would be more scope for you in the civil service but as we hold at present little territory beyond this island there are therefore but few appointments affording an opportunity for the display of the intelligence which you certainly possess but should circumstances alter you might owing to your knowledge of the country and its language be told off for civil work in which the emoluments are very much higher than in the military branch of the service  you will at once be gazetted to the 3rd native cavalry and do duty with the regiment until your services are required elsewhere fresh disturbances may break out at poona and in that case you might be attached as assistant to colonel palmer  do you think you would be known again  i think it would be very unlikely sir when my skin has recovered its proper colour and i am dressed in uniform i feel sure no one would recognize me as having been an officer in the peishwas court  very well sir then you will see your name in the gazette tomorrow you will within a day or so report yourself to the officer commanding the regiment  i may say that it would be well if your nurse and the man who came down with you were to draw up statements concerning your birth and swear to them at the high court these might be valuable to you in the future  after expressing his thanks to the governor and council harry went out and rode back to the hotel with sufder    chapter 6 in the companys service   there was no conversation between harry and sufder on the way back to the hotel harry saying that he would tell the news when soyera joined them otherwise he would have to go through it twice they rode slowly through the streets and soyera arrived a few minutes after them  now harry said we will go up to my room and talk the matter over  mr malet has been kind enough to give such a favourable report of me that i am appointed lieutenant to the 3rd regiment of native cavalry and shall be employed as assistant to the resident at poona should there be fresh disturbances there  that is good fortune indeed sufder said  wonderfully good fortune and i owe it all in the first place to soyera and in the next to yourself you see i have gained greatly by taking your advice and remaining in the deccan until fit for military service had she declared who i was when she took me down to bombay before there is no saying what might have become of me  and now the first thing to do is for me to go out and order a uniform when i return i will draw up in mahratti and english a full account of the manner in which i was saved by soyera and you from being murdered and how i have been brought up  harry had learned at the governors the name and address of an official at the judges court who would get his statements copied out in proper form and writing and when he had taken them down from the lips of sufder and soyera he saw this gentleman who promised that the documents should be ready by the next day  having thus put his business in train harry went to call upon mrs sankey she did not recognize him at once but as soon as he made himself known she received him most warmly  you looked as if you would grow into a big fellow but i hardly expected that you would have done it so soon  it is more than four years since i left you i dont think that i am likely to grow any taller than i am though of course i shall get broader  he then told her what had happened since he left her and how he had just been appointed an officer in a native cavalry regiment  i am very glad you have come now my daughters have both married and i am going to sail for england in a few days whether i shall stay there permanently or come back i cannot say but at any rate i shall be away at least two years  i should have been very sorry to have missed you mrs sankey i have always looked back with the greatest pleasure at the time i spent here  you have kept up your english well she said  i have followed your advice and hardly ever missed reading aloud for an hour so as to keep my tongue accustomed to it and i know many of shakespeares plays by heart and could recite a great many passages from the writings of dean swift mr addison mr savage and others  his next visit was to jeemajee who received him with real pleasure when he told him who he was harry had not learnednor did he ever learnthat the kindly parsee had contributed a hundred pounds towards the expenses of his education but he did know that he had presented him with his outfit of clothes and had been the means of his being placed with mrs sankey and during the months he remained at bombay he paid frequent visits to the man who had so befriended him  the next day he went with sufder and soyera who swore to their statements before the judge of the high court  as soon as his uniform was ready harry went to his regimentwhich was encamped on the maidan between the fort and the native townand was introduced to the colonel  i have come to report myself sir he said to the colonel my name is lindsay  i was expecting you the colonel said for mr malet came in this morning and told me about you saying that you would most likely come either today or tomorrow i will have a tent pitched for you this afternoon and a soldier told off as your servant of course at first you will have to go through the somewhat unpleasant task of learning your drill  from what mr malet told me i think you are not likely to be much with us as from your perfect knowledge of mahratti and of the country you can do better service in a staff appointment than with the regiment  you are much fairer than they had given me to expect  i have been hard at work for the last two days in getting rid of the dyes with which i have been coloured ever since i was an infant  ah you are not very noticeably darker now than other officers in the regiment  now i will hand you over to the adjutant you will of course mess with us today and i can then introduce you to your brother officers  the adjutant was sent for and soon entered  mr lewis the colonel said this is mr lindsay who was gazetted to us two days ago he will be very useful to us if we go up to poona againof which there is always a possibilityfor he speaks mahratti like a native having lived among the people since he was an infant he is the son of major lindsay who was killed here at the time of the advance on poona  you will be a great acquisition to us the adjutant said as he left the tent with harry most of us speak a little mahratti but it will be very useful to have one of us who is perfect in that way of course you have not got your full kit yet but you will want a mess jacket and waistcoat these i can lend you till you get your own made  they are ordered already and i am to get them in a couple of days it was so much more important that i should get the undress uniform to enable me to begin work that i did not press the tailor quite so much as to the other clothes  are you ready to begin work at once  the sooner the better harry replied  then i shall hand you over to the native officer who has charge of the drilling of recruits there is a small yard behind the barracks where europeans are instructed in the first stages to see them doing the goose step would not add to the respect the soldiers have for their white officers they are therefore taught such matters in private so that when they come out for company drill they are not quite at sea  half an hour later harry was at work under the instructions of a native officer by the time he had finished a tent had been erected for him and he was glad to find a bath ready for it was much warmer down in bombay than above the ghauts and it had been hot work drilling the adjutant had chosen a mahratta servant and the mans surprise when the newlyjoined officer addressed him in his own language was great  as mr malet had told him that except when on duty the officers generally wore civilian clothes he had purchased several white suits consisting of jacket and trousers as these were kept in stock by a parsee tailor and he put on one of these with a white shirt after he had finished his bath he had scarcely done so when a bugle sounded  that is the call for tiffin sahib abdool said  do the officers go in uniform  no sahib not to this meal  just at this moment the adjutant came in  come along lindsay he said i thought i would come round for you it is rather trying going into a room full of strangers  there were some twelve officers gathered in the mess tent and the adjutant introduced harry to them singly they were all curious to see him having heard from the colonelwho had summoned them to the tent a quarter of an hour before the bugle soundedsome particulars of his life and how he had been at once appointed to be lieutenant without going through the usual term as a cadet as a reward for important services  their first impression of him was a favourable one he was now nearly six feet in height with a powerful and wellknit frame his face was pleasant and good tempered and although the features were still boyish there was an expression of restraint and determination that had been acquired from the circumstances in which he had been placed  he had seen the barbarous splendour of the entertainments at the peishwas court but nothing like the wellordered table now before him with its snowwhite cloth its bright silver and perfect appointments  when the meal was over the colonel said  as duty is over for the day i think it would be most interesting if mr lindsay would give us an account of his life and adventures as you are all here it would save him the trouble of going over his story again and again for you are all i am sure like myself anxious to know how it was that he has been able all these years to pass as a mahratta among mahrattas  there was a general expression of agreement cheroots were lighted and harry told his story with some detail when he had finished the colonel said  i am sure we are all obliged to you lindsay you have had a remarkable experience and few of us have in the course of our lives gone through anything like the same amount of adventures to have been at your age a peasant boy an english school boy a shikaree an officer in the peishwas court a confidential agent of nana furnuwees and now a british officer is indeed wonderful it speaks volumes for your intelligence and discretion  i cannot take the whole credit to myself sir i had two good friends my nurse not content with saving my life taught me english instructed me in the ways of our people and even in their religion and continually urged me to exercise myself in every way so that when some day i left her i should in bodily strength and activity not be inferior to others and aided by her brother expended all her savings of years in having me educated here next to her i owe much to sufder who first taught me the use of arms and then presented me to nana without such an introduction i must had i entered the mahratta service at all have gone as a private soldier instead of obtaining at once a post at court  to mrs sankey i owe very much for the kindness she showed me and the pains she took with me and i owe much too to mr jeemajee the parsee merchant  yes you owe much to both of them the colonel said but their teaching and advice would not have gone for much had it not been for your own energy and for the confidence you inspired in the peishwas minister  what are you going to do about your nurse  we have not quite arranged as yet sir but she will at any rate remain here for a time she loves me as a mother and i think that so long as i am quartered here she will remain she has already found a lodging at the house of a woman of the same caste as herself and tells me that she is sure she will be comfortable with her if we move and all goes on quietly in the deccan she will return to her brothers where she is thoroughly at home and happy  and sufder  he will return in the course of a week or so he is greatly interested in what he sees here especially in the shipping never having seen the sea before i think that probably he will remain for two or three years with his troop of two hundred men and will then settle in the village of which and the surrounding country he has received the jagheer this although not large will suffice for him to live in comfort it is but a few miles from jooneer and he will therefore be able to be near his friends and pay frequent visits to his cousin ramdass  in a short time harry became a general favourite and made the acquaintance of the officers of all the regiments in the garrison for his romantic story speedily circulated and before he had been a fortnight in the city he had received invitations to dine at all their messes  after the exciting life he had led for two years he felt on being released from drill that life in a garrison town was dull and monotonous the simple habits in which he had been brought up did not help him to enjoy heavy meals at regimental mess occasionally he and two or three other officers crossed to the mainland and had some shooting in the wild district of the concan but he was pleased when he received an order from the governor to call upon him  colonel palmer he said has written requesting me to send him an assistant as matters do not seem to be going on well at poona he suggested that you from your acquaintance with the people and their intrigues should be selected for the post but even had he not done so i should have chosen you as being better fitted for it than any other officer here  your instructions are simple you will watch and endeavour to penetrate the schemes of the various factions and assist colonel palmer generally  am i to go up in my uniform sir or to wear a disguise similar to that in which i came down here  that is a matter over which i have been thinking i have come to the conclusion that you will be more likely to obtain intelligence in native garb all parties look with jealousy upon us and would be chary of giving any information to an officer of the residency and therefore if you have no objection we think that it will be an advantage to you to assume native dress of course you could not go in the attire that you came down in for although you would not be recognized in uniform you would if dressed as before  i would rather leave that matter entirely to you and also the manner in which you can proceed you must also decide for yourself whether to renew your connection with nana furnuwees it appears to me that he is the only honest man in the deccan and the only man who takes the patriotic view that there should be peace and rest throughout the country he is however no more willing than others that we should in any way interfere in the affairs of the deccan  that certainly is so sir but i know that it is his most earnest desire to possess the friendship of the authorities of bombay he has frequently told me that he is a great admirer of the english of their methods of government and of the straightforwardness and sincerity with which they conduct their business but he is afraid of them he sees that where they once make an advance they never retire and is convinced that if they obtained a footing above the ghauts there would be no turning them out and that their influence would be supreme  very well mr lindsay you showed such discretion and judgment during your residence at poona that i am well content to leave the matter in your hands the appointment as assistant to colonel palmer will carry with it a civil allowance of three hundred rupees a month of course all necessary expenses will be paid and should you find it expedient to use a certain amount of bribery to obtain the news we require in other quarters besides that of the minister you will refer the matter to the resident  you will of course give your reports to colonel palmer and will be under his orders generally he will be requested to further your special mission in every way in his power  when shall i start sir  as soon as you like mr lindsay  i shall be ready sir as soon as the clothes are made for me i must have one or two disguises of various kinds to use as most desirable some of these i can no doubt buy ready madeperhaps all of them if so i will start at daylight tomorrow  very well mr lindsay i shall be sending up a despatch to colonel palmer and it will be left at your tent this evening  on leaving the government house harry went to see soyera scarcely a day had passed since he came to bombay without his paying her a visit  i am off again to poona he said i do not know how long i shall be away it must depend upon what is going on up there of course i should be glad to have you with me but that would hamper my movements i shall naturally see sufder as soon as i get there  but what are you going for will you travel as an officer  no i shall be in disguise it seems that things are unsettled and i am if possible to find out the intentions of the various leaders and communicate them privately to our resident i shall have to take to dyeing my skin again which is a nuisance but it cannot be helped i shall take with me three or four different disguises and get you to do the shopping for me i wish to have them by this evening as i shall start in the morning early  i shall get leave to take my soldier servant abdool with me he is a sharp fellow and may be useful i shall have to buy a pony for him  what sort of disguises do you want  one is that of a native soldier  that is easy enough as it differs but little from the ordinary mahrattas dress  one would certainly be the attire of a trader in good circumstances i cant think at present of any other  i should say the dress of a brahmin might be useful soyera suggested  yes that would give me an entry unquestioned to nana or to any other person of importance  by nightfall soyera had bought the three disguises and obtained from a native dyer a supply of stain sufficient for a long time and harry had purchased two useful ponies for himself and his servant  at mess that evening the colonel said  so you are going to leave us for a time mr lindsay i have received a letter from the governor requesting me to put you in orders tomorrow as seconded from the regiment for civil employment i wont ask you where you are going that is no business of ours but i am sure i can say in the name of my officers as well as myself that we shall all miss you very much  a murmur of acquiescence passed round the table and seeing that harry in thanking the colonel made no allusion to what he was going to do they followed the example of their superior officer and abstained from asking any questions  i should like to take my man abdool with me colonel harry said later on he is a sharp fellow and i might find him very useful  by all means i will tell the adjutant that i have allowed him to go with you  i am not going in uniform nor are you to do so harry said to abdool when he returned to his tent i am going in mahratta dress and i shall take a lodging in the town and pass as a native i know abdool that you are a sharp fellow and feel certain that i can depend upon you  you can certainly depend upon me sahib you have been a kind master and i would do anything for you  what part of the country do you come from abdool  from rajapoor in the concan sahib i had no fancy for working in the fields so i left and took service with the company i have never regretted it i have been a great deal better off than if i had enlisted in the army of one of the great chiefs the pay is higher and we are very much better treated  well abdool when this business which i am now starting on is over i shall recommend you for promotion and in any case will make you a present of three months pay  the next morning they started at daybreak when a few miles out of town they took off their uniforms and harry put on the dress of a trader there was no occasion for any disguise for abdool who like all the native troops was accustomed after drill was over for the day to put on native garments the uniforms were then folded up and stowed in the wallets behind the saddles  they had brought with them a good supply of grain for their horses and provisions for themselves so that they might not have to stop at any village they rode at a steady pace and mounted the ghauts by eleven oclock then they waited three hours to feed and rest the animals and just as the sun was setting entered poona having accomplished a journey of fifty miles knowing the place so well harry rode to a quiet street near the bazaar and seeing an old man at one of the doors asked him if he knew of anyone who could afford accommodation for him and his servant  i can do that myself the man said i am alone in the house two merchants who have been staying here left me yesterday and i can let you have all the house except one room for myself  you have no stables i suppose  no sahib but there is an outhouse which would hold the two horses  illustration there was a little haggling over the terms  there was a little haggling over the terms for it would have been altogether contrary to indian usages to have agreed to any price without demur finally the matter was arranged at a price halfway between that which the man demanded and that offered by harry and in a short time they were settled in the two rooms of the second floor harry then went out and bought two thick quilted cushions used as mattresses and two native blankets  they had still provisions enough for the evening the furniture was scanty consisting of a raised bed place or divan two tables raised about a foot from the ground brass basins and large earthenware jars of water harry however was too well accustomed to it to consider such accommodation insufficient  tomorrow he said i will get a carpet for sitting upon and you will have to get copper vessels for cooking  abdool presently went out and returned with two large bundles of forage for the horses soon afterwards they lay down feeling stiff and tired from their unaccustomed exertions  the next morning harry went to the residency he had again painted caste marks on his face which completely changed his appearance telling the guard that he had come from bombay and had a message for colonel palmer he was shown in  you bring a message for me the colonel said shortly for he was at the time writing a despatch  yes sir harry answered in mahratti i have come to be your assistant  then you are mr lindsay the resident exclaimed dropping his pen and rising to his feet i received a despatch yesterday saying that you were coming of course i remember you now having seen you on the day i came up here but your dress is altogether different and the expression of your face seems so changed  that is the result of my having adopted different caste marks larger than they were before with lines that almost cover my forehead  i did not expect you to come in disguise  the governor thought colonel that i might be of greater service in finding out what was passing in the town and in going elsewhere were i to come up as a native to an officer of the residency all parties would keep their lips sealed  i thoroughly agree with you the resident said your disguise differs so much from your former appearance that i do not think any of your acquaintances of those days would be likely to recognize you  at present i am supposed to be a trader but i have with me the dress of a peasant or small cultivator which i used when i went into scindias camp i have also the dress of a brahminone of the better classwhich i thought if necessary would enable me to enter the house of nana or other leaders without exciting surprise i also have my uniform with me  i am staying at present in the street that faces the market at the house of a man named naroo i myself am bhaskur i have a soldier servant with me on whom i can confidently rely and i will send him with a chit when i have any news to give you and you can send me word at what hour i had better call  now colonel i am at your orders and if you will indicate to me the nature of the news which you wish to gain or the person whom you want watched i will do the best i can at present i know nothing of any changes that have taken place since i left here  the only event that is publicly known is that while the peishwa has carried out his engagement with scindia and with the rajah of berar he refused to ratify any treaty with the nizam and the consequence is that the latters general quitted poona without taking leave of bajee rao and returned in great indignation to hyderabad this matter might have been smoothed over if scindia had intervened or if the peishwa had made suitable advances to the nizam but he has not done so there is no doubt that he thoroughly dislikes nana furnuwees and instead of being grateful to him for having placed him on the throne he would gladly weaken his power at any rate it was nana who formed the confederacy and i know that his greatest wish is to keep it intact and to secure peace to the country  moreover matters have been further complicated by the death of holkar he left two sons behind him khassee and mulhar unfortunately khassee is next door to an imbecile while mulhar was a bold and able prince the brothers quarrelled two half brothers took the part of mulhar who left his brothers camp with a small body of troops and took up his abode at a village just outside the cityand was i believe favoured by nana whose interest naturally was to have an active and able prince as ruler of holkars dominions scindiawho was i suspect delighted at this quarrel in holkars campsupported khassee and sent a body of troops to arrest mulhar who refusing to surrender maintained a desperate defence until he was killed jeswunt went to nagpore and wittoojee fled to kolapoore but they were almost the only adherents of mulhar who effected their escape  so matters stand at present the fact that the imbecile khassee owes his elevation to scindia will naturally give the latter a predominating influence over him thus you see the confederacy has gone completely to pieces the nizam is estranged the rajah of berar has gone home to nagpore holkars power is for the time subservient to scindia and nana furnuwees is therefore deprived of all those who aided to bring him back to power  you are well known to nana are you not  yes colonel he was kind enough to place a good deal of confidence in me  then i think you cannot do better than see him to begin with and gather his views on the matter i myself have heard nothing from him for some time he knows that the company are well disposed towards him but he also knows that they can give him no assistance in a sudden crisis  but surely colonel bajee rao who owes everything to him will not desert him  my opinion of the peishwa is that he is a man without a spark of good feeling that he has neither conscience nor gratitude and would betray his own brother if he thought that he would obtain any advantage by so doing he is a born schemer and his sole idea of politics is to play off one faction against another i would rather take the word of a man of the lowest class than the oath of bajee rao  i am sorry to hear it sir he seemed to me to be a fine fellow with many accomplishments his handsome face and figure and winning manner  his manner is part of his stock in trade the colonel said angrily he is a born actor and can deceive for a time even those who are perfectly aware of his unscrupulous character  remember one thing mr lindsay that if you are in any difficulty or if a tumult breaks out in the city you had best make your way here at once a trooper of my escort was thrown from his horse and killed the other day and if you attire yourself in his uniform you will pass for one of them whatever happens they are not likely to be touched both parties wish to stand well with me and even were it found out that you are an englishman you would be safely sheltered here for i should claim you as my assistant and an officer in our army and declare truthfully that you had only assumed this guise in order to ascertain for me the feelings of the populace  thank you sir i will certainly come here as soon as any serious trouble begins  that evening after rubbing off the caste marks and assuming those of a brahmin and putting on the dress suitable for itpadding it largely to give him the appearance of a stout and bulky manhe went to nanas house  will you tell the minister he said to the doorkeeper that kawerseen a brahmin of the kshittree caste desires to speak to him  the man gave the message to one of the attendants who in two or three minutes returned and asked harry to follow him the minister was alone  what have you to say to me holy man he enquired and then looking more fixedly at his visitor he exclaimed  why it is puntojee  you are right nana i am sent here to ascertain if possible what is going on and how things are likely to tend but first i must tell you that i am now here as colonel palmers assistant  i will take you entirely into my confidence nana said until you told me that you were an englishman when you took leave of me two years ago i could not quite understand why it was that i felt i could confide in you more than in the older men around me i esteem the english highly and especially admire them for their honesty and truthfulness you at once impressed me as one possessing such qualities and now that i know you are english i can understand the feeling that you inspired  i am glad you have come no doubt your government are well informed as to the state of affairs here i feel the power slipping from my hands without seeing any way by which i can recover my lost ground scindia is solely under the domination of ghatgay whose daughter he will shortly marry i have of course made it my business to enquire as to the antecedents of this man i find that he has the reputation of being a brutal ruffian remarkable alike for his greed and his crueltya worse adviser scindia could not have holkar was but a poor reed to lean upon for he was as weak in mind as in body but at any rate he was a true friend of mine and now that he has been succeeded by one even more imbecile than himselfand who is but a puppet in the hands of scindia to whose troops he owes his accessionhis power and his dominions are practically scindias  there can be no doubt whatever that bajee rao is acting secretly with scindia that is to say he is pretending so to act for he is a master of duplicity and even where his own interests are concerned seems to be unable to carry out honestly any agreement that he has made  i am an old man mr lindsay and can no longer struggle as i did two years ago against fate nor indeed do i see any means of contending against such powerful enemies the rajah of berar although well disposed towards me could not venture alone to support me against the united power of scindia and holkar backed by that of the peishwa  there is but one direction in which i could seek for helpnamely from the government of bombaybut even this were it given would scarcely avail much against the power of my enemies and even were i sure that it could do so i would not call it in my aim through life has been to uphold the power of the peishwa and to lessen that of scindia and holkar and by playing one against the other to avert the horrors of civil war were i to call in the aid of the english i should be acting in contradiction to the principles that i have ever held  the arrival of a force of english here would at once unite the whole of the mahrattas against them as it did when last they ascended the ghauts and believing as i do in their great valour and discipline which has been amply shown by the conduct of scindias infantry which are mainly officered by europeans it is beyond belief that they can withstand the whole power of the mahratta empire but granting that they might do so what would be the result i should see my country shaken to the centre the capital in the hands of strangers and to what end simply that i an old and wornout man should for a very few years remain in power here it would be necessary for those who placed me there to remain as my guardians and i should be a mere cypher in their hands nothing therefore would persuade me to seek english aid to retain me in power  but the english would doubtless act in alliance with the nizam and probably with the rajahs of berar and kolapoore  possibly they might do so but what would be the result each of these leaders would in return for his aid bargain for increased territory at the expense of the peishwa and i who believe that i am trusted by the great mass of the people here should become an object of execration at having brought the invaders into our country  no mr lindsay my enemies can and i believe will capture me and throw me into prison they will scarcely take my life for to do so would excite a storm of indignation but i always carry poison about with me and if they applied torture as a preliminary to death i have the power of releasing myself from their hands  are you established at the residency  no sir i am living in disguises of which i have several in the town in that way i can better discover what is going on than if i were in uniform as assistant to colonel palmer should there be a tumult in the city or if i find that my disguise has been detected i can make for the residency and either put on my uniform and declare my true character or attire myself as one of the residents escort  come here as often as you can nana said i shall always be glad to see you it is a relief to speak to one of whose friendship i feel secure as a brahmin you can pass in and out without suspicion and i will always tell you how matters stand  i have not yet spoken nana of my work as your agent in bombay i have sent you reports from time to time but there was nothing in them that could be of any value to you at present the attentions of the authorities of bombay madras and calcutta are centred upon the probability of war with mysore tippoo has continually broken the conditions under which he made peace with us six years ago and it is known that he is preparing for war he has received with honour many frenchmen and is in communication with the french government and believes that he will be supported by an army under general bonaparte and as it is certain that when the war breaks out again it will need the fighting strength of the three towns to make head against the army of mysore as far as i have been able to learn they have given but little attention to the state of affairs in the deccan i have therefore been able to furnish you with no useful information beyond telling you that the sympathies of the governor and council are wholly with you and that they consider that the fact of your being in power here secures them from any trouble with the mahrattas  therefore sir i have put aside the allowance you have given me considering that i have in no way earned it and have written this order upon the bankers with whom i have placed it authorizing them to pay the money to anyone you may depute to receive it and he handed the letter to the nana  the latter took it and without opening it tore it up  your offer does you honour mr lindsay but it is impossible for me to accept it your information has not been without advantages i have foreseen that the nizam would probably enter into an alliance with your people and that the very large increase that he has made in his battalions under foreign officers was intended to make his alliance more valuable i however have not deemed it necessary to imitate his example and that of scindia by raising a similar force your communications therefore have been of real value and have saved a large outlay here but even had it not been so there can be no question of your returning your pay you undertook certain work and you have to the best of your powers carried it out and it is not because you consider that the information you sent me is not sufficiently valuable that you have in any way failed to carry out your part of the contract  i consider it of very great value in the first place because as i have said it relieved me from anxiety as to the nizams intentions of increasing his army and in the second place it eased my mind by showing that neither scindia nor holkar was intriguing with bombay which knowledge is worth a crore of rupees to me  it is the first time sir since i have taken part in politics that anyone has offered to return money he has received on the ground that he had not sufficiently earned it or indeed upon any other ground whatever your doing so has confirmed my opinion of the honesty of your people and i would that such a feeling were common among my countrymen here no negotiations can be carried on no alliance can be formed without a demand for a large sum of money or for an addition of territory all our petty wars are waged not on a question of principle but entirely from greed  let us say no more about it i am as of course you have heard a very wealthy man and have so distributed my money among the shroffs of all india that whatever may happen here i shall lose comparatively little and i am glad to know that some very small portion of it goes to one whom i regard as a genuine friend and who does not draw a tenth part of what many of those around me accept without any consideration given for it  thank you sir butat any rate while i am stationed here as assistant residenti cannot continue to receive pay from you i should regard it as a disgraceful action and absolutely incompatible with my duty  well so far i will humour you mr lindsay though from what i hear in the carnatic and bengal the british officers civil and military do not hesitate to accept large sums from native princes  harry was well aware that this was so and that many british officials had amassed considerable fortunes by gifts from native sources he only replied  that is a matter for their own consciences sir they may be rewards for services rendered just as i did not hesitate to accept the sum that you so generously bestowed upon me it is not for me to judge other men but i cannot but think that the custom of officials accepting presents is a bad one  where can i find you nana said changing the subject if i should need to communicate with you before you call again  harry gave his address  your messenger must enquire for bhaskur a trader from ahmedabad who is lodging there  he chatted for some time longer with nana and then took his leave and returned to his lodging    chapter 7 an act of treachery   some months passed quietly scindia more openly assumed supreme power imprisoned several leading men and transferred their jagheers to his own relations colonel palmer had gone down to bombay on leave his place being filled temporarily by mr uhtoff  bajee was as usual playing a deep game he desired to become independent both of scindia and nana furnuwees the former he believed must sooner or later return to his own dominions and he desired his aid to get rid of nana therefore it was against the latter that his intrigues were at present directed the minister was still an object of affection to his people who believed as before in his goodness of character and who put down every act of oppression as being the work of scindia  harry saw nana frequently there being no change in the position there was little talk of politics and the minister generally turned the conversation upon england its power relatively to that of france the extent of its resources the modes of life among the population and its methods of government  it all differs widely from ours nana said after one of these conversations and in most respects is better the changes there are made not by force but by the will of the representatives of the people in their assembly a minister defeated there retires at once and his chief opponent succeeds him the army has no determining voice in the conduct of affairs but is wholly under the orders of the minister who may happen to be in power all this seems strange to us but undoubtedly the system is far better for the population there is no bloodshed no burning of villages no plundering no confiscation of estates it is a change in the personnel of the government but no change in the general course of affairs  it is strange that your soldiers fight so well when as you tell me they never carry arms until they enter the army while ours are trained from childhood in the use of weapons and your enemies the french is it the same with them  it is the same nana so far as their civil life is concerned for none carry weapons or are trained in their use there is one wide point of difference the french have to go as soldiers when they reach a certain age however much they may dislike it while with us there is no compulsion whatever and men enlist in the army just as they might take up any other trade there is however a body called the militia this like the army consists of volunteers but is not liable for service abroad and only goes out for a short period of training annually however by law should the supply of volunteers fall short battalions can be kept at their full strength by men chosen by ballot from the population but this is practically a dead letter and i am told that the ballot is never resorted to though doubtless it would be in the case of a national emergency  ah it is pleasant to be a minister in your country with no fear of plots of treachery or assassination were i a younger man i should like to visit england and stay there for a time so that on my return i could model some of our institutions upon yours  but no i fear that that would be too much for the most powerful minister to effect the people are wedded to their old customs and would not change them for others however much these might be for their benefit an order that none save those in the army should carry arms would unite the whole people against those who issued it  it was on the last day of 1797 that nana furnuwees made a formal visit to scindia in return for one the latter had paid him a few days before michel filoze a neapolitan who commanded eight battalions in scindias army had given his word of honour as a guarantee for the ministers safe return to his home the european officers in the service of the indian princes bore a high character not only for their fidelity to those they served but also for their honour in all their dealings and though nana would not have confided in an oath sworn by scindia he accepted that of filoze without hesitation  on his arrival near scindias camp the traitor seized him and with his battalions attacked his retinue amounting to about a thousand persons among whom were many of his principal adherents some of these were killed all of them stripped of their robes and ornaments parties of soldiers were immediately sent by ghatgay to plunder the house of nana and those of all his adherents  harry was in his room when he heard a sudden outburst of firing and a minute or two later abdool ran in  scindias men are in the town sahib they are attacking the houses of nanas adherents these are defending themselves as best they can there is a general panic for it is believed that the whole town will be looted  get your things together abdool i will change my dress for that of a native soldier and we will make for the residency  shall we ride sahib  no we will leave the horses here if we were to go on horseback we might be taken for nanas adherents trying to make their escape and be shot down without any further question  i felt misgivings when i saw nana going out but it would have come to the same thing in the end for if scindias whole army villainous as is the treachery had advanced against the town nana could have gathered no force to oppose them  three or four minutes later they started abdool carrying a bundle containing harrys disguises they made their way through lanes where the people were all standing at their doors talking excitedly continuous firing was heard in the direction of the better quarters mingled with shouts and cries no one questioned them all being too anxious as to their own safety to think of anything else  the residency was half a mile from the town there mr uhtoff was standing at his door and the men of his escort were all under arms harry had been in frequent communication with him from the time that he had taken colonel palmers place the resident did not for the moment recognize him in his new disguise but when he did so he asked anxiously what was going on in the town  a strong body of scindias troops are there attacking nanas adherents i fear that the minister himself is a prisoner in their camp  that is bad news indeed nana told me yesterday that he intended to visit scindia and had received a guarantee for his safe return from filoze i advised him not to go but he said that he could confide implicitly in the honour of a european officer i told him that the various european nations differed widely from each other and that although i would accept the word of honour of a british officer in scindias service i would not take that of a neapolitan however he said and said truly that it was incumbent on him to return scindias visit and that if he did not do so it would be treated as a slight and insult and would serve as a pretext for open war against him and that as he could but muster three or four thousand men the city must yield without resistance  i believe that this is the work of bajee rao and of ghatgaytwo scoundrels of whom i prefer ghatgay who although a ruffian is at least a fearless one while bajee rao is a monster of deceit i know that there have of late been several interviews between him and ghatgay and i have not the least doubt that the whole affair has been arranged between them with the hope on bajees part of getting rid of nana and on ghatgays of removing a sturdy opponent of his future soninlaw and of acquiring a large quantity of loot by the plunder of nanas adherents  you did well to come here for if the work of plunder is once begun there is no saying how far it will spread i shall ride at once to see the peishwa and request an explanation of what has occurred there is that troopers dress still lying ready for you if you would like to put it on there is a spare horse in my stable  thank you sir i should like it very much and rapidly changing his dress he was ready by the time the horses were brought round  he then took his place among the troopers of the escort and rode to bajee raos country palace which was some three miles from the town  after seeing everything in train the peishwa had left scindias camp before nanas arrival there and had summoned a dozen of the latters adherents under the pretence that he desired to see them on a matter of business wholly unsuspicious of treachery they rode out at once and each on his arrival was seized and thrown into a place of confinement  the resident learned this from a retainer of one of these nobles he had made his escape when his master was seized and was riding to carry the news to the british official whose influence he thought might suffice to save the captives lives  on arriving at the palace four of the troopers were ordered to dismountharry being one of those selectedand on demanding to see the peishwa the resident was after some little delay ushered into the audience chamber where bajee rao was seated with several of his officers standing behind him he received mr uhtoff with a show of great courtesy  the latter however stood stiffly and said  i have come your highness to request an explanation of what is going on the city of poona is being treated like a town taken by siege the houses of a number of persons of distinction are being attacked by scindias soldiery fighting is going on in the streets and the whole of the inhabitants are in a state of wild alarm  but this is not all nana furnuwees has owing to his reliance upon a solemn guarantee given for his safe return been seized when making a ceremonial visit to scindia  you must surely be misinformed the peishwa said you will readily believe that i am in perfect ignorance of such a proceeding  i might believe it prince mr uhtoff said coldly had i not been aware that you and your officers have decoyed a number of nanas friends to this palace and on their arrival had them suddenly arrested  bajee rao practised dissimulator as he was flushed at this unexpected accusation  i learned sir he said after a pause that there was a plot against my person by nana furnuwees and his adherents and i have therefore taken what i considered the necessary step of placing these in temporary confinement  it is a little strange your highness that the man who placed you on the musnud should be conspiring to turn you from it however what has been done has been done and i cannot hope that any words of mine will avail to persuade you to undo an act which will be considered throughout india as one of the grossest treachery and ingratitude my duty is a simple one namely merely to report to my government the circumstances of the case  the officers behind the peishwa fingered the hilts of their swords and the four troopers involuntarily made a step forward to support the resident bajee however made a sign to those behind him to remain quiet and the resident turning abruptly and without salutation to the peishwa left the hall followed by his men  they mounted as soon as they had left the palace and rode back to the residency mr uhtoff keeping his place at their head and speaking no word until he dismounted when he asked harry to accompany him to his room  this is a bad business indeed mr lindsay i cannot say that i am surprised because having studied bajee raos character i have for some time been expecting that he would strike a blow at nana still i acknowledge that it has come suddenly and the whole position of affairs has changed bajee has freed himself from nana but he has only riveted scindias yoke more firmly on his shoulders like most intriguers he has overreached himself he has kept one object in view and been blind to all else  his course should have been to support nana against scindia and thus to keep the balance of power in his own hands he has only succeeded in ridding himself of the one man who had the good of his country at heart and who was the only obstacle to scindias ambition the fool has ruined both himself and his country  i think mr lindsay that the best plan will be for you to mount at once and ride down to bombay your presence here just now can be of no special utility and it is most desirable that the government should have a full statement of the matter laid before them by one who has been present and who has made himself fully acquainted with the whole politics of the deccan  it is better that you should not go into the town again i will send in for your horses as soon as the tumult has subsided we have several spare animals here and you and your servant can take two of them i will write to the governor a report of my interview with bajee and say that i have sent you down to give him all the details of what has taken place which will save the time that it would take me to write a long report and will be far more convenient inasmuch as you can answer any point that he is desirous of ascertaining i do not think that you can do better than go in the disguise that you now have on for a soldier to be galloping fast is a common sight but people would be astonished at seeing either a brahmin or a trader riding at full speed i will give orders for the horses to be saddled at once and in the meantime you had best take a meal you will have no chance of getting one on the road and i have no doubt that dinner is ready for serving i will tell the butler to give some food to your man at once  twenty minutes later harry and abdool were on their way skirting round poona they heard the rattle of musketry still being maintained and indeed the fighting in the streets of the city continued for twentyfour hours by two in the morning they halted at the top of the ghauts partly to give the horses a rest and partly because it would have been very dangerous to attempt to make the descent in the dark  at daybreak they continued their journey arriving at bombay six hours later they rode straight for the government house where harry dismounted and throwing the reins of his horse to abdool told the attendant to inform the governor that a messenger from the resident at poona desired to see him he was at once shown in  why it is mr lindsay the governor said though i should scarce know you in your paint and disguise the matter on which you come must be something urgent or mr uhtoff would not have sent you down with it  harry handed over the despatch of which he was bearer and as the governor ran his eye over it his face became more and more grave as he gathered the news  this is serious indeed he said most serious now be pleased to sit down mr lindsay and furnish me with all the particulars of the affair  when harry had finished the governor said  i imagine that you can have eaten nothing today mr lindsay i am about to take tiffin and bid you do so with me i shall at once send to members of the council and by the time we have finished our meal they will no doubt be here  i shall be very glad to do so sir if you will allow me to go into the dressing room and put on my uniform i should hardly like to sit down to table in my present dress  do so by all means if you wish it but you must remember that your colour will not agree well with your dress  i will remove these caste marks sir and then i shall look only as if i were somewhat severely tanned  in ten minutes a servant knocked at the door and said that luncheon was ready harry was already dressed in his uniform and had removed the marks on his forehead the dye however was as dark as ever he had on leaving the governors room sent a servant down to fetch his wallet and to tell abdool that he was to take the horses to the barracks  the meal was an informal one the governor asked many questions and was pleased at the knowledge that harry showed of all the principal persons in poona and their character and ability  at the present moment he said the information that you have given me cannot be utilized but it would be most valuable were we to get mixed up in the confusion of parties at poona i gather that you consider nana furnuwees to be a great man  my opinion is not worth much on that point sir i think that he has over and over again shown great courage in extricating himself from difficulties which appeared to be overwhelming i believe him to be a sincere patriot and that he only desires to be at the head of the administration of affairs that he may prevent civil war from breaking out and to thwart the ambition of the great princes his tastes are simple his house is furnished plainly he cares nothing for the pleasures of the table but he is honest and i believe absolutely truthfulqualities which certainly are possessed by very few men in the deccan  i grant that he is not disposed to enter into any alliance with the british he has frequently told me that he admires them greatly for their straightforwardness and truthfulness as well as for their bravery and their methods of government both in the great towns and in the districts in which they are masters but he fears that were they to send an army to poona on his behalf or on that of any of the other parties it might end by their acquiring control over the affairs of the country and make them arbitrators in all disputes  no doubt he is right there the governor said with a smile however at present we are certainly not likely to interfere in the quarrels and intrigues beyond the ghauts nor do i see why we should be brought into collision with the mahrattasat any rate until they have ceased to quarrel among themselves and unite under one master in that case they might make another effort to turn us out  and now we will go into the room where the council must be by this time assembled  this proved to be the case and the governor read to them the note that he had received from mr uhtoff and then requested harry to repeat the details as fully as he had already done there was a consensus of opinion as to the importance of the news  come round again tomorrow morning mr lindsay the governor said by that time i shall have fully thought the matter out  so you have been masquerading as a native again mr lindsay the colonel said when harry called upon him  i can hardly consider it masquerading as i merely resumed the dress i wore for many years and i certainly speak mahratti vastly better than i speak english for although i improved a good deal while i was here i am conscious that though my grammar may be correct my pronunciation differs a good deal from that of my comrades  you speak english wonderfully well considering that you learned it from the natives the colonel said at first you spoke as a native that had learned english but a casual observer would not now detect any accent that would lead him to suppose that you had not been brought up in england  you will of course be at mess this evening  i think it would be better that i should not do so sir in the first place i should have innumerable questions to answer and in the second which is more important anything that i said might be heard by mess waiters it is quite possible that some of these are in the pay of scindia or holkar who keep themselves well informed of all that goes on here and were it known that an english officer had come down in disguise it would greatly increase the danger when i return there  i have no doubt that you are right mr lindsay is there anything new at poona  yes colonel and as it will be generally known in two or three days there can be no harm in my telling you scindia has made nana furnuwees a prisoner by an act of the grossest treachery he has killed almost all his principal adherents and when i got away his troops were engaged in looting the town  that is grave news the colonel said so long as nana was in power it was certain that scindia could not venture to take his army out of his own country for the purpose of attacking us but now that nana is overthrown and scindia will be minister to the peishwa we may expect troubles  not at present scindias army has for months been without pay he has no means of settling with them and until he does so they certainly will not move  i do not think that would detain him long mr lindsay he has only to march them into other territories with permission to plunder and they would be quite satisfied he certainly can have no liking for the rajahs of berar or kolapoore for both of them assisted nana to regain his power and an attack upon them would at once satisfy vengeance and put his troops in a good temper  but there is no doubt that the peishwa will find it much more irksome to be under scindias control than that of nana and were scindia to march away he would at once organize an army and buy holkars aid to render himself independent of scindia  they are treacherous beggars these mahrattas the colonel said they are absolutely faithless and would sell their fathers if they could make anything by the transaction  then you do not know yet whether you are to return  no i shall see the governor again tomorrow morning and shall then receive orders  i will have some dinner sent over to your quarters from the mess do not have too much light in the room or your colour may be noticed by the servant i will let the officers know that you have returned no doubt many of them will come in for a chat with you as no one can overhear you i do not think that any harm can be done by it  i think not colonel  i will tell them the colonel went on that you are on secret service that you will tell them as much as you can safely do but they must abstain from pressing you with questions we all know that you have been acting as assistant to mr uhtoff because it was mentioned in orders that you had been detailed for that duty but they know no more than that and will doubtless be surprised at your colour but you can very well say that as you had an important message to carry down you thought it best to disguise yourself  that will do excellently colonel and i shall be very glad to have a talk with my friends again  after leaving the colonel harry went to his own room where he found soyera who had been fetched by abdool  i am sorry to say that i am going away almost directly mother he said but it cannot be helped  i do not expect you always to stay here harry now that you are in the companys service you must of course do what you are ordered i am glad indeed to find that although you have been with them only a year you are chosen for a post in which you can gain credit and attract the attention of the authorities here  it is all thanks to the pains that you took to prepare me for such work  i dont expect to be away so long this time and indeed now that nana furnuwees is a prisoner it does not seem to me that there can be anything special to do until some change takes place in the situation and scindia either openly assumes supreme power or marches away with his army  that evening harrys room was crowded with visitors the news of the treacherous arrest of nana furnuwees excited the liveliest interest and was received with very much regret as nana was considered the only honest man of all the ministers of the native princes and to be friendly disposed towards the british and all saw that his fall might be followed by an important change in the attitude of the mahrattas  two days later harry returned to poona the next eighteen months passed without any very prominent incidents in order to furnish scindia with money to pay his troops and to be in a position to march away bajee rao agreed that ghatgay should as scindias minister raise contributions in poona accordingly a rule of the direst brutality and cruelty took place the respectable inhabitantsthe merchants traders and men of good familywere driven from their houses tortured often to death scourged and blown away from the mouths of cannon no person was safe from his persecution and the poorest were forced to deliver up all their little savings the rich were stripped of everything and atrocities of all kinds were committed upon the hapless population  bajee rao countenanced these things and was now included in the hatred felt for ghatgay and scindia troubles occurred between the peishwa and the rajah of satara who refused to deliver up an agent of nana whom he had at bajees request seized as scindias troops refused to move purseram bhow was released from captivity and raising an army captured the city of satara and compelled the fort to surrender but when ordered by bajee rao to disband the force that he had collected he excused himself from doing so on the plea that he had no money to pay them or to carry out the promises that he had given them  scindia himself was not without troubles in addition to the mutiny of his troops the three widows of his father who instead of receiving the treatment proper to their rank had been neglected and were living in poverty sought an interview with him and were seized by ghatgay flogged and barbarously treated their cause was taken up by the brahmins who had held the principal offices under scindias father and it was at last settled that they should take up their residence at burrampoor with a suitable establishment  their escort however had received private orders to carry them to the fortress of ahmednuggur  the news of this treachery spread soon after they had left the camp and an officer in the interest of the brahmins started with a troop of horse which he commanded dispersed the escort and rescued the ladies these he carried to the camp of amrud rao bajee raos foster brother who instantly afforded them protection and sallying out attacked and defeated a party of their pursuers led by ghatgay himself  five battalions of infantry were then sent by scindia but amrud attacked them boldly and compelled them to retreat negotiations were then opened and amrud believing scindias promises moved his camp to the neighbourhood of poona but during a mahommedan festival he and his troops were suddenly attacked by a few brigades of infantry which dispersed them slew great numbers and pillaged their camp  holkar now joined amrud rao who had escaped from the massacre the peishwa negotiated an alliance with the nizam scindia sent envoys to tippoo to ask for his assistance bajee rao did the same and it looked as if a desperate war was about to break out  all this time harry had been living quietly in the residency performing his duties as assistant to colonel palmer who had again taken charge there there was no occasion for him to resume his disguises the atrocities committed by ghatgay in poona were apparent to all and at present there seemed no possible combination that could check the power of scindia  colonel palmer however had several interviews with bajee rao and entreated him to put a stop to the doings of ghatgay but the latter declared that he was powerless to interfere and treated with contempt the warnings of the colonel that he was uniting the whole population in hatred of him  the rebellion under amrud and the adhesion of holkar to it seemed to afford some hope that an end would come to the terrible state of things prevailing and colonel palmer became convinced that scindia was really anxious to return to his own dominions where his troops so long deprived of their natural leaders were in a state of insubordination if the nana were but released from his prison at ahmednuggur something might be done he said he might be able to supply sufficient money to enable scindia to leave and the alarm nanas liberation would give to bajee would compel him to change his conduct lest nana should join amrud and with the assent of the whole population place him on the musnud  nana is the only man who can restore peace to this unhappy country he said to harry but i see no chance of scindia releasing a prisoner whom he could always use to terrify bajee should the latter dare to defy his authority  harry thought the matter over that night and at last determined to make an attempt to bring about his old friends release in the morning he said to the resident  i have been thinking over what you said last night colonel and with your permission i am resolved to make an attempt to bring about nanas release  but how on earth do you mean to proceed mr lindsay  my plans are not quite made up yet sir in the first place i shall ask you to give me three weeks leave so that if i fail you can make it evident that you are not responsible for my undertaking in the next place i shall endeavour to see nana in his prison and ascertain from him whether he can pay a considerable sum to scindia for his release if i find that he is in a position to do so i shall thenalways of course in disguiseendeavour to have a private interview with scindia and to convince him that it is in every way to his interest to allow nana to ransom himself he is of course perfectly well aware that in spite of bajees assurances of friendship he is at heart bitterly opposed to him and that the return of nana with the powers he before possessed would neutralize the peishwas power  it would be an excellent thing if that could be done the colonel said but it appears to me to be an absolute impossibility  i would rather not tell you how i intend to act sir so that in case of failure you can disavow all knowledge of my proceedings  well since you are willing to undertake the risk and unquestionably the bombay government would see with great pleasure nanas return to power i will throw no obstacle in your way you had better to begin with write me a formal request for a months leave to go down to bombay is there anything else that i can do to aid your project  nothing whatever and i am much obliged to you for acceding to my request if for no other reason than that my success should have the effect of releasing the inhabitants of poona from the horrible tyranny to which they are exposed i shall be willing to risk a great deal to gain it  i shall not leave for a day or two as i wish to think over all the details of my plan before i set about carrying it out  going into the city harry went to the spot where the proclamations of scindia were always affixed these were of various kinds such as forbidding anyone carrying arms to be in the streets after nightfall and that every inhabitant should furnish an account of his income in order that taxation should be carefully distributed to these scindias seal was affixed  one such order had been placed there that morning a sentry marched up and down in front of it lest any insult should be offered to the paper satisfied that this would suit his purpose he called abdool to him and explained what he wanted  it will not be till this evening for i want before that step is taken to collect a party of ten horsemen to ride with me to ahmednuggur and back by this time you know a great many people in the town and if i were to pay them well you should have no difficulty in getting that number  i could do that in half an hour sahib there are a great number of the disbanded soldiers of the peishwas army who are without employment and who would willingly undertake anything that would bring them in a little money  well you can arrange with them today they must not attract attention by going out together but must meet at the village of wittulwarree  the next morning harry went to the shop of a trader who was he knew formerly employed by nana and purchased from him a suit such as would be worn by an officer in scindias service then he wrote out a document in mahratti giving an order to the governor of ahmednuggur to permit the bearer musawood khan to have a private interview with nana furnuwees this done he told the resident that he intended to leave that night  colonel palmer asked no questions but only said  be careful mr lindsay be careful it is a desperate enterprise that you are undertaking and i should be sorry indeed if so promising an officer should be lost to our service  i will be careful i assure you i have no wish to throw away my life  when evening came on he went to his room stained his skin from head to foot put on the caste marks then dressed himself in the clothes that he had that morning purchased and at nine oclock left the house quietly with abdool at that hour poona would be quiet for the terror was so great that few people ventured into the street after nightfall  when they approached the house on which the proclamation was fixed they separated harry went quietly to the corner of the street a few yards from the spot where the soldier was marching up and down and listened intently peeping out from behind the wall whenever the sentry was walking in the other direction presently he heard a smothered sound and the dull thud of a falling body  he ran out abdool had crawled up to the other end of the sentrys beat and taken his place in a doorway the sentry came up to within a couple of yards of him and then turned abdool sprang out and with a bound leapt upon the sentrys back and with one hand grasped his musket  taken wholly by surprise the sentry fell forward on his face abdool still clinging to him he pressed his knife against the soldiers neck and said that at the slightest cry he would drive it home half stunned by the fall the soldier lay without moving  illustration harry ran up to the proclamation and tore it down  without the loss of a moment harry ran up to the proclamation and tore it down and then darted off again abdool springing to his feet brought the butt end of the soldiers musket down on his head and then satisfied that a minute or two must elapse before the man would be recovered sufficiently to give the alarm he too ran off and joined harry at the point where they had separated  that was well managed abdool now we will walk quietly until we are outside the town as if we met some of scindias men they would question were we hurrying  in a few minutes they were outside the city and then running at a brisk pace they reached the residency they were challenged by the sentry but on harry giving his name he was of course allowed to pass  he went quietly into his room and lighted a candle putting his knife in the flame he heated it and then carefully cut the seal from the paper on which it was fixed placed it on the order that he had written and again heating his knife passed it along under the paper until the under part of the seal was sufficiently warmed to adhere to it he placed the order in an inner pocket put a brace of pistols into his sash and buckled on a native sword that he had bought that morning then he went out again and found that abdool had the horses in readiness with two native saddles with embroidered housings such as was used by native officers which he had by harrys orders purchased that morning in the bazaar  they at once mounted and started at a gallop for wittulwarree    chapter 8 nanas release   at the entrance to the village harry found the ten troopers whom abdool had engaged standing by their horses he gave the order for them to march and at a brisk canter they started for ahmednuggur it was a ride of some forty miles and when they approached the town they halted until the sun rose and the gates of the city were opened  they then rode in the men were left at a khan abdool remaining with them they had been told if questioned to say that their leader musawood khan was an officer high in the service of scindia  harry took two of the troopers with him and rode to the governors house dismounting and leaving the horse in their charge he told one of the attendants to inform the governor that he was the bearer of an order from scindia and was at once shown up  the governor received him with all honour glanced at the order that harry presented to him placed the seal against his forehead in token of submission and then after a few words as to affairs at poona called an officer and ordered him to accompany musawood khan to nana furnuwees apartment this was a large room at an angle of the fortress with a balcony outside affording a view of the country round it for the governor knowing how rapidly and often the position changed and having no orders save to maintain a careful watch over the prisoner had endeavoured to ingratiate himself with him by lodging him comfortably and treating him well  the officer opened the door and when harry had entered locked it behind him nana furnuwees was seated at the window enjoying the fresh morning air he looked listlessly round and then rose suddenly to his feet as he recognized his visitor  what wonder is this he said that you should be here mr lindsay except as a prisoner  i am here as one of scindias officers harry replied with a smile although he himself is not aware of it in hopes of obtaining your freedom  that is too good even to hope for nana said sadly  in the first place sir are you aware of the state of things in poona  i have heard nothing since i came here nana said they make me comfortable as you see but except for the daily visit from the governor i have no visitors and from him i learn nothing as he has strict orders from scindia not to give me any information of what happens outside these walls fearing no doubt that i might take advantage of any change to endeavour to open communication with one or other of the leaders  before you tell me anything else please explain how you managed to enter here  that was easy enough sir i simply wrote out an order to the governor to permit me to have a private interview with you i tore down one of scindias proclamations and transferred his seal from it to the order that i had written dressed myself as you see as one of his officers got together ten mounted men to ride as my escort and here i am  you will be a great man some day nana said looking at the tall powerful figure of his visitor with its soldierly carriage  now tell me about affairs i shall then understand better why you have run this risk  harry gave him a sketch of everything that had happened since his confinement  you see sir he said as he concluded how the situation has changed amrud is nominally acting with his brothers approval but there is no question that bajee fears him amrud is in alliance with holkar purseram bhow is at liberty at the head of an army and a nominal conciliation has taken place between him and bajee the latter has incurred the detestation and hatred of the people of poona and most important of all scindia is really anxious to get back home but is unable to do so owing to his inability to pay his troops and willing as bajee might be to furnish the money to get rid of him he is without resources owing to the fact that the taxation wrung from the people has all gone into the pockets of scindia ghatgay and his other favourites  the question is sir whether you would be willing to purchase your liberty at a heavy price i think that if you could pay sufficient to enable scindia to satisfy his soldiers he might be induced to release you  how much do you think he would want  of that i can have no idea sir of course he would at first ask a great deal more than he would afterwards accept  yes i should be ready to pay nana said after considering for a minute as a prisoner here my money is of no use to me nor ever would be but i could pay a large sum and still be wealthy  that is what i wanted to know sir  but why do you run this risk nana asked  for several reasons sir in the first place because you have honoured me with your friendship in the second because i would fain save the people of poona from the horrible barbarity with which they are now treated and lastly because the government of bombay would i am sure be glad to hear of your reinstatement as the only means of restoring peace and tranquillity to the deccan  how will you open this matter to scindia  i have not fully thought that out sir but i have no doubt that i shall in some way be able to manage it and intend to act upon his fears as well as upon his avarice  but you say that ghatgay is all powerful and he would never permit an interview to take place between a stranger and scindia  from what i hear sir scindia is becoming jealous of ghatgays power and disgusted both by his imperious manner and by his atrocities in poonaagainst which he has several times protested but in vain if i am to obtain an audience with scindia it must be a secret one  but there will surely be great danger in such a step  doubtless it will not be without danger harry said but that i must risk i have not yet determined upon my plan as it would have been useless to think of that until i had seen you but as that has been managed so easily i fancy that i shall have no great difficulty in getting at him once i do so i feel certain that i shall be able to convince him that his best policy is to free you and place you in your old position as the peishwas minister as in that case you would be a check upon bajee rao and would be able to prevent him from entering into alliances hostile to scindia  well mr lindsay you have given me such proofs both of your intelligence and courage that i feel sure that if anyone can carry this through you will be able to do so and i need hardly say how deeply grateful i shall be to you for rescuing me from an imprisonment which seemed likely to terminate only with my life  and now i had better go sir harry said it is as well that our conference should not be too long a one  well goodbye mr lindsay even if nothing comes of all this it will be pleasant for me to know that at least i have one faithful friend who was true to me in my deepest adversity  harry went to the door and knocked it was immediately opened by the officer who had conducted him there and who had taken up his post a short distance from the door he led harry back to the governor who pressed him to stay with him but he replied that his orders were to return to poona instantly  after this interview he went direct to the tavern where the soldiers had put up ate a hasty meal and then mounted and rode out of the town when ten miles away he halted in a grove for some hours and then rode on to poona arrived within a mile of the town he paid each of the men the amount promised and told them to reenter the town separately then he secured a room for himself in a small khan just outside the city and sitting there alone worked out the plan of obtaining an interview with scindia  he then told abdool to go quietly to the residency and to bring out the brahmins dress he had before worn in the morning abdool went out to scindias camp with a letter which when scindia came out of his marquee he handed to him there was nothing unusual in this for petitions were frequently presented in this way to rulers in india  as he did so he said in a low voice it is private and important your highness and instead of handing it to one of his officers scindia went back to his tent to read it  it stated that the writer kawerseen an unworthy member of the kshittree brahmins prayed for a private interview with his highness on matters of the most urgent import scindia thought for a moment and then tearing up the piece of paper went out and as he passed abdool who was waiting at the entrance said  tell your master to be here at halfpast ten tonight the sentry will have orders to admit him  abdool returned at once to harry and delivered his message  that is good the latter said  you will take me with you sahib  certainly abdool if you are willing to go there is some danger in it and should scindia give the alarm you may be of great assistance by cutting down the sentry before he can run in take your pistols and tulwar and bring another sword for me if i can once get out of the tent we shall be fairly safe for in the darkness and confusion which will arise we shall be able to make off quietly we will ride there and fasten our horses in that grove that lies about a quarter of a mile from the camp  at halfpast nine they started and reached scindias tent at the time appointed harrys belief that he would succeed was largely founded on the knowledge that scindia was a weak young man who had never been engaged in warfare and was wanting in physical courage an attendant was at the door and led him to the princes private tent which stood in the middle of an encampment composed of large tents for the purpose of receptions and entertainments for the abodes of the ladies of the zenana and for the officers in whom scindia reposed most confidence the retinue of servants attendants and minor officials were lodged in tents fifty yards behind the royal encampment  scindia was sitting on a divan two lamps hung from the ceiling he himself was smoking  you have something of importance to say to me he said as harry entered and bowed deeply  i have your highness you are doubtless well aware that the kshittree brahmins who formerly held the principal offices under your father are greatly offended by the elevation of ghatgay and still more so by his atrocious deeds in the town of poona there has been a private meeting and twelve of them myself among the number have sworn by the feet of brahma to take your life either by poison dagger or musket ball  and you have the insolence to avow that you took such an oath  he sprang to his feet and would have touched the bell on the table but in an instant harry sprung forward with a loaded pistol pointed at scindias head  stop sir i beg of you for assuredly if you raise a voice or touch a bell that moment will be your last  scindia sank down into his seat again he had not the least doubt that the man before him would execute his threat  your highness he said i have not come here for the purpose of assassinating you i was first on the list but obtained from the others permission to endeavour to put an end to the present state of things before carrying out our vow we know that in spite of the enormous sums that ghatgay has raised in poona you yourself have not been enriched and that you have been unable to persuade your troops to march owing to your want of money to pay up their arrears we have thought the matter over and can see but one way by which you can obtain the necessary funds  and that is scindia asked  that is your highness to liberate nana furnuweessetting his liberty of course at a high price in this way you will not only be able to move your army but you will cripple the power of the peishwawho would if possible overthrow you now you have done his work and freed him from nana  you are well aware prince that nana furnuwees always exercised his authority on the side of peace and there is no fear that he will permit bajee rao to engage in war against you he is an old man and useless to you as a prisoner if you exacted a heavy sum from him it would in all ways aid your views  but how do you know that nana could raise such a sum as would satisfy the troops  we have assured ourselves on that score and i know that it matters not how much nana furnuwees will have to give what i would suggest is that you shall seize ghatgay and rid yourself of his domination he cannot but be as odious to you as he is to bajee rao and to the people  scindia sat for some time in silence  do i understand he said that if i carry out these suggestions your comrades will be satisfied  that i swear solemnly i do not threaten your highness for my visit today is one of conciliation you might as soon as i leave this tent order me to be arrested in that case i should use this pistol against myself and you would seek in vain for the names of my eleven brethren but your life would be forfeitedwhether in the midst of your guards or in your tent whether you ride or walk you would be watched and your servants would be bribed and your food poisoned if the first man fails he will blow out his brains and so will they all but be assured that the vow will be kept and that whether by night or by day you will never be safe  you are a bold man to speak so scindia said  i speak so your highness because i am perfectly ready to die for the good of the country and to secure for it peace and contentment  scindia rose and took two or three turns up and down the tent harry keeping his pistol in his hand in readiness to fire should he attempt to slip away at last scindia stopped before him  i agree to your conditions he said and the more readily because i shall as you say at once free myself from difficulties and avenge myself on bajee rao who is i know in spite of his professions of friendship constantly plotting against me tomorrow at daybreak an officer shall ride with a troop of cavalry and shall bring nana here  you have chosen wisely prince it is believe me your only way of escaping from your present difficulties i know that already your soldiery are becoming mutinous at being thus kept for months away from their country and receiving no pay that feeling will grow rapidly unless their demands are conceded as to ghatgay the soldiers hold him in abhorrence and his arrest and downfall would cause the most lively satisfaction among them your men are soldiers and not assassins and the tortures and executions that daily take place fill them with horror so that your order for his arrest will be executed with joy  now your highness i will leave you i believe that you will keep your promise as indeed it is to your interest to do so in which case you will never hear of myself or my eleven companions  do not fear scindia said tomorrow my messenger shall certainly start for ahmednuggur  harry bowing deeply turned passed through the curtain and made his way out of the tent abdool who was squatting near the entrance at once rose and followed him  is all well sahib  i think so i have so frightened scindia that i have little doubt he will carry out the promise he has given me i will tell you about it when we get back  they passed through the sleeping camp and mounted their horses in the grove and rode to the residency colonel palmer was still up engaged in writing a report for the government it was a dark night and the sentry on duty knowing harrys voice let him pass without question not even observing the change in his attire  what back again mr lindsay the colonel exclaimed in surprise when harry entered i thought that it would be a month before you returnedthat is if you ever returned at all and of this i had but little hope as i expected you have of course found it impossible to carry out your design  on the contrary sir i have been i hope perfectly successful i have seen nana furnuwees and ascertained that he is ready to pay a large sum to obtain his freedom and his former position as the peishwas minister i have seen scindia tomorrow a troop of horse will start to fetch nana to his camp and ghatgay will be arrested as soon as possible after he arrives  how in the name of fortune have you managed all these things the colonel asked  i will tell you sir now that i am back here i shall tomorrow reassume my uniform and there is no danger of my being recognized or of trouble arising from what i have done  he then related the various steps he had taken and his conversations with nana and scindia  upon my word mr lindsay i do not know whether to admire most your daring in bearding scindia in the heart of his camp or the intelligence with which you have carried out what seemed to me an absolutely impossible undertaking  light your cheroot i need not trouble about this report that i was engaged on when you entered but will put it by until the day after tomorrow when we shall see whether nana is brought to scindias camp  you speak hindustani as well as mahratti do you not  not so well sir but as you know i have during the six months that i was at bombay and since i have been here used most of my spare time working up hindustani with a moonshee  i am glad to hear it for i received a letter from the governor this morning saying that lord mornington has requested him to send an officer thoroughly acquainted with mahratti and with some knowledge of the people and that he has selected you for the service as being by far better fitted than anyone he knows for the appointment a knowledge of hindustani will of course be very useful to you but mahratti is the principal thing as he is intending to open negotiations with the mahrattas as well as with the nizam to induce them to join in concerted action against tippoo  he says that no vessel will be sailing for calcutta for less than a month so you can stay here for a few days and see how your scheme works out it will be a great step for you and ensure you rapid promotion  i am indeed obliged to the governor for selecting me harry said and will do my best to justify his confidence  two days later nana furnuwees was brought to scindias campnews which caused bajee rao intense consternation he at once sent off to open negotiations with the nizam for common action offering a considerable amount of territory for his assistance  colonel palmer rode over the next morning to scindias camp and found that scindia had demanded three millions of rupees as the price of nanas release and appointment as minister to the peishwa nana had protested his absolute inability to raise anything like that sum but had offered five hundred thousand rupees  i can quite believe that he could not pay the sum scindia demands the colonel said on his return and when scindia sees that he would rather return to prison than attempt impossibilities he will come down in his demands and nana will go up in his offer it is a mere question of bargaining  when scindia heard of the step that bajee rao had taken he was greatly alarmed for he could hardly hope to withstand the nizams army and that which bajee himself could raise and he therefore materially lowered his demands and finally accepted nanas offer of nine hundred thousand rupees this arrangement being made he permitted nana to leave the camp in order to raise the money receiving his solemn oath that if he failed to do so he would return and render himself a prisoner again  however in a few days nana sent in the money scindia fulfilled the other part of his promise and insisted upon the peishwas receiving nana as his minister a few days later he had ghatgay arrested by the sons of two of his european officers  scindia was indeed most anxious to be off he did not know that the nizam had refused bajee raos offer he had received news of widespread disaffection among his troops at home and felt that he could not rely upon those with him as soon therefore as he received the money from nana he partially paid the arrears due to the soldiers the sum however was altogether insufficient to satisfy the troops and as nana furnuwees found that bajee was still intriguing with scindia for his overthrow and that no rest could be hoped for until the latters army marched away he advanced scindia fifteen lakhs of rupees from his own private funds the latter was then able to satisfy his troops  scindia accepted the money but still remained in the neighbourhood of poona  these matters were not concluded until months after harry left for bombay on arriving there he called upon the governor to report the release of nana furnuwees  i received colonel palmers last report four days ago he has given me full details of the manner in which you on your own initiative brought about nanas release and the approaching departure of scindia and i of course brought them before the council and they quite agreed with me as to the remarkable daring and ability with which you had carried out what colonel palmer believed to be an impossible scheme  i have pleasure in handing you your commission of captain and only regret that we cannot break the rules of the service by nominating you major tomorrow your name will be removed from the list of officers of the 3rd regiment and you will be appointed to the staff you will have a week before you to obtain the proper uniform i shall not require you to perform any duties and you will therefore have your time to yourself till you sail i shall of course forward my reasons for sending you to lord mornington and shall give an account of the services that you have rendered which will doubtless excite as much admiration in calcutta as in bombay  i shall be glad if you will dine with me the day after tomorrow when i shall ask the members of the council to meet you  on leaving the governor harry at once went to the shop of the parsee merchant from whom he had obtained his regimentals and ordered the various uniforms required for the staff he then went to soyera and to his great satisfaction found sufder there the latters troop was one of those which had been disbanded when on the arrival of scindia bajee rao deemed it necessary to reduce his force and sufder after staying for some time at jooneer had now come down to see his cousin  i am glad indeed to find you here sufder in the first place because it is always a pleasure to meet a good friend and in the second because you can take soyera back with you and place her with ramdass  but why should i leave here harry  because mother i am to start for madras in three weeks and may be for aught i know away for a year or more of course you can remain here if you prefer it but it seems to me that the other would be the better plan  i should certainly prefer to go with sufder to my home soyera said i have numbers of acquaintances here but no real friends and ramdass and anundee will i know joyfully receive me  at any rate you shall be no burden to them soyera i will give you a thousand rupees with which you can pay your share of the expenses of the house or land and i will give you a similar sum to hand to ramdass as a token of my gratitude for his protection and kindness this will enable him to add to his holding and to the comforts of his house i would willingly give much more but it might cause suspicion and enquiry were he to extend his holding largely and the authorities of jooneer might demand from him how he became possessed of such means as i told you i have received much money in presents and could afford to give you very much more if it were of any advantage to you  i shall give a thousand rupees also to you sufder they will be useful to you when you settle down on the revenues of your district and enable you to cut a good figure among the people when you arrive there  the day before he was to sail a hindu entered harrys apartment and bowing deeply handed him a letter it was from nana  my good english friend  i send the enclosed bill upon my agent as a small token of acknowledgment for the inestimable service you have rendered me during my long life i have had many friends but these in supporting me acted in their own interest you alone have shown me absolutely disinterested friendship i have always been opposed to your people interfering in the affairs of the deccan but i see now that nothing save their intervention can save the country from absolute ruin owing to the constant struggles for supremacy among the great rajahs and i see that it were far better we should enjoy peace and protection under a foreign power than be exposed to ruin and misery at the hands of warring factions  i grieve that i have not seen you again colonel palmer tells me that you are about to start for either calcutta or madras to join the army that is about to act against tippoo it is unlikely that i shall ever see you again but i shall never forget that had it not been for you i should have ended my life a prisoner at ahmednuggur  nana  the bill enclosed was an order for a hundred thousand rupees upon nanas agent in bombay  when harry went to say goodbye to the governor the latter said  it is likely that you will see your old regiment before long captain lindsay this morning a ship arrived with orders from lord mornington for us to send as many troops as could possibly be spared to ascend the southern ghauts and join him near seringapatam lord mornington is now at madras making arrangements for an advance when his brother colonel wellesley will move forward with the nizams troops there is still a doubt what part the mahrattas will takeprobably they will hold aloof altogether until they see how matters go we know that tippoo has sent thirteen lakhs of rupees to bajee rao and that the latter and scindia are in constant communication with him however at present we shall take no notice of these proceedings but allow the peishwa to believe that we are deceived by the constant assurances that he gives us of his friendship although he has declined to enter into a treaty with us similar to that which the nizam has made  it is enough to have one formidable foe on our hands at a time and our experience of bajee assures us that he will not commit himself by openly declaring for tippoo until he sees how matters are going  the winds were unfavourable and it was not until six weeks after leaving bombay that harry arrived at madras it was now november 1798 and on landing he learned that general harris was in command of the army that was assembling at vellore and that the governor general had returned to calcutta he therefore at once went back to the ship which next day sailed for that town  on arriving there he presented himself at the government house and on sending in his name was in a short time shown in to lord morningtons private room  i am glad that you have come captain lindsay the latter said i wish that you had been here sooner  i came by the first ship sir after the governor of bombay received your letter but owing to contrary winds we have been nearly two months on the voyage i landed for an hour at madras and hearing that you had returned here i hesitated whether to come to you for orders or to join general harris at vellore but i thought it better to come on and so again embarked on the ship which has only just anchored  you were quite right sir for it was an agent rather than a soldier that i required i own that i thought the governor would have sent an older man  i am the bearer of this letter from him i believe that in it he gives his reasons for the honour he did me in selecting me for the post  i will look through it presently lord mornington said and if you will dine with me here i shall then have read it and shall be able to decide where you can be employed to the best advantage  the dinner was a quiet one only the officers of the governor generals suite being present the governor received harry with much more cordiality than he had evinced at their first interview and introduced him to his officers with the expression that captain lindsay had done very valuable service in the deccan little allusion was made to business until the other officers had left when lord mornington said  i have read the governor of bombays letter and am convinced that he could have made no better choice than he has done he speaks of you in the highest terms and has given me a slight sketch of your story and a fuller one of the manner in which you obtained the release of nana furnuwees i learn that nana has always been considered our friend although we have not been able to give him the support that we could wish as this would have entailed war with the mahrattas which bombay is in no position to undertake nevertheless his release will doubtless to some extent counterbalance the duplicity of the peishwa who while lavish in his promises to us is receiving money from tippoo and will undoubtedly unless restrained by nana openly espouse his cause should he gain any successes over us you showed such intelligence in the matter that he says i can place every confidence in you  although the nizam has been obliged to dismiss the french troops in his service and to send a portion of his army to act in connection with our own against mysore he is in no way to be trusted being as slippery as the rest of these indian princes and like the mahrattas would assuredly join tippoo if he saw his way to doing so this is so certain that nothing would be gained by sending another agent to hyderabad i therefore propose to open communications with the rajah of berar  none of my officers is able to talk mahratti though many of them are of course familiar with the southern dialects the rajah is already practically at war with the mahrattas as for a long time his troops have been ravaging the territory of purseram bhow which he was invited to do by the peishwa when purseram took sides against him he is doubtless in some apprehension of an attack by the mahrattas and upon our promising to guarantee his dominions and to give him support if attacked he may be willing to venture into an alliance with us and his doing so would alike help us in keeping the nizam to his engagements and deter the mahrattas from moving  this is the mission that i intend to confide to you i believe that it could not be in better hands if you will call tomorrow afternoon your written instructions and powers to act for me and to enter into engagements in my name will be ready for you and i should wish you to start the next morning you will have an escort of twenty troopers these indian princes have little respect for persons who travel unattended  you will understand that the instructions recite the maximum that you are authorized to offer to the rajah if he will be satisfied with less you will of course grant as little as you can if he demands more you must refer the matter to me at any rate so long as you are negotiating he will take no active steps against us though i have learned that bajee rao has already been at work trying to persuade him to join himself and tippoo against us were such a treaty concluded we could no longer hope to retain the nizam and indeed should find it difficult to contend against so powerful a confederacy at any rate if the rajah will not join us you must endeavour at least to secure his neutrality  the day after tomorrow you will start i will have a route map prepared for you the distance to nagpore is about eight hundred miles and you will get there in four weeks travelling thirty miles a day i have given orders today for one of the companys ships of war to take you and your escort to the mouth of the ganjam and express messengers have already started with orders to the commandant to provide waggons to carry your tent equipage and stores you should if the winds are favourable reach there in four or five days time  the carts will delay us sir and without them we might make forty miles a day after we have landed for the horses of this country have great endurance  a few days will make no great difference there are no towns of any importance on the road to nagpore and you would have to put up at wretched khans and would be considered as worthy of little consideration whereas i wish you to travel in a style suitable for my agent and to impress the native mind with your importance  have you horses  i have but one sir and a pony for my servant  you must purchase another and a good one with showy equipments you will of course charge that and all other expenses and your appointment will be a thousand rupees a month i have no doubt the rajah will lodge you handsomely should he not do so you had best encamp outside the town do not put up with any inferior lodging  very well sir i shall endeavour to carry out your orders to the letter  harry was fortunate in being able to purchase an excellent horse and in the afternoon received his letters of instruction on the following day he embarked in a twelvegun sloop with twenty troopers under the command of a native officer the wind was favourable and in four days they arrived at the mouth of the ganjam  a large native barge came out to meet them the horses and the stores which harry had purchased together with some boxes with presents for the rajah were transferred to her and two of the ships boats took the barge in tow to the shore the commandant of the small garrison there informed harry that the bullock carts had already gone on to a village thirty miles away and that he would find all in readiness for him on his arrival  without waiting an hour he started with his escort and half a mile from the village found the camp already pitched it consisted of one large and handsome tent such as those used by high officials and two smaller ones for the escort he had engaged at calcutta a good cook and this man at once began to light fires and prepare a meal from the stores harry had brought with him  the tent was handsomely furnished a large carpet covered the ground there was a bed four large chairs and a table while between the outer and inner walls of the tent was a bath as soon as they halted one of the troopers rode into the village and purchased fowls rice ghee and condiments for the use of the escort who were all mahommedans  harry found to his satisfaction that another set of waggons had started that morning for the next halting place and that he would find everything ready for him there this was a great satisfaction for he had feared that the work of taking down and packing the tents would delay his start in the morning and that at the end of the days ride he would have to wait some hours before the tents came up whereas by the system of double carriage he would not be delayed  the head man told him that his party would start in the morning as soon as the cart could be packed that fresh bullocks would be hired at the village where he would halt and would travel all night so as to be in readiness for him when he had accomplished another stage and that this process would be continued until they reached nagpore    chapter 9 a popular tumult   the journey was performed without incident harry enjoyed it much for this luxurious method of travelling was quite new to him and three weeks after leaving the coast they arrived at nagpore on the previous day the native officer had been sent on beforehand to inform the rajah of the arrival of a high officer of the governor generals and had taken on a letter from lord mornington accrediting harry to act in his name accordingly when the party arrived within a mile of the town they were met by two officers of the rajah who welcomed him in his name and said that a residence had been prepared for his use and that of the escort they were surprised at harrys perfect knowledge of their language for hitherto british agents who had come to nagpore had had but very slight acquaintance with it and had had to carry on their conversation by means of an interpreter  the town was large and straggling and composed for the most part of native huts built of mud there were however a few brick houses the property of flourishing traders the palace was a large square edifice without any architectural adornments trees grew everywhere in the streets and in the distance the town had the appearance of a forest  harry was conducted to one of the largest brick houses in the town a host of sweepers had been at work carpets were laid down and furniture placed in the principal rooms he had no doubt that it had been requisitioned from its owner by the rajah for him and the furniture supplied from the palace the principal rooms were on the upper floor and there was ample accommodation for the escort below  harry requested the officers to ascertain when the rajah would be ready to receive a visit from him and they returned with word that he would receive him in private audience at eight oclock that evening accordingly at that hour followed by four of his troopers he rode to the palace a guard of honour was drawn up at the entrance and saluted as he passed in the entrance hall and staircase were lined by attendants and all bowed profoundly as he passed he was conducted to a large audience chamber where the rajah attended by his principal officers was seated  the conversation was of the usual ceremonial kind the prince expressing his satisfaction that the governor general should have sent one of his officers to confer with him and assuring harry of his goodwill and friendship towards the english while harry on his part expressed the strong desire of lord mornington that the relations between him and the rajah should be continued unbroken and that nothing should ever occur to disturb their amity the presents sent by the governor general were then brought in and displayed and appeared to give much satisfaction to the chief  after the durbar was over the latter told harry that he would receive him privately at ten oclock next morning on arriving at that time he was shown into the princes private apartment and there explained to him the governor generals desire that he should join the confederacy between the nizam and the english  i have no quarrel with tippoo the rajah said at present none can say how the affair will end all say that the peishwa has agreed to assist tippoo he is a match and more for the nizam while we know not whether the english company or tippoo is the strongest should i remain neutral the peishwa and tippoo might eat me up  that is true rajah but you must remember that in the last war the english showed that they were much stronger than tippoo and he was glad to make peace with them by giving up nearly half his territories we are much stronger now ships arrive each day with more and more troops and believe me tippoo will assuredly be unable to stand against the english power even if he were backed up by the whole strength of poona  of course we know that messages have been sent to you by tippoo and that he has promised you a large slice of the nizams dominions if you will invade them and so prevent him from aiding the english  harry saw by the change in the princes countenance that he was surprised to find that his negotiations with tippoo were known to the english government he replied however  it is true that tippoo has sent to me but i have given him no answer the matter is too important to be settled in a hurry certainly tippoos offers were very advantageous  i can understand that they were tempting rajah yet they entailed a war against the english and the nizam when they had finished with tippoo instead of gaining territory you would find that much of yours would be lost  but undoubtedly were you to join us the governor general would show that he was not unthankful for the service and your assistance would be handsomely recompensed  what does the governor general offer  he is desirous of knowing what your own views are rajah and he will assuredly meet them if possible  i have not thought of it yet the prince said i must talk the matter over with my councillors we are good friends with the peishwa also with the nizam and with tippoo we know that the english are a great people but we have had nothing to do with them save that complimentary messages have been exchanged therefore it is not a matter upon which one can come to any hasty decision  the governor general would wish you to think the matter over well before deciding rajah and indeed there is no occasion for undue haste seeing that the english army is still lying near madras and is not yet ready to advance therefore i will leave the matter for the present believing that in your wisdom you will be able to see how matters are likely to go and whether the english company or tippoo are likely to be your best friends  it was nearly a fortnight before harry heard again from the rajah the latter had returned his visit and sent over presents of sweetmeats and food to his guests at the end of that time he came in one evening with only two attendants  i have come to speak to you on this matter privately he said my ministers are altogether divided in opinion some say we should fight against tippoo who is a cruel and implacable foe and who has slaughtered all the hindus in his territory who refused to embrace his religion others say it is better to be friends with him for it seems that these white men intend to eat up all india already they have taken the carnatic and bengal now they want to take mysore what will they take next  for myself i wish well to the english though there are few of them they are brave and strong but my council know of the offer that tippoo has made us and unless i can show them that the english are also ready to give us material advantages i shall not be able to persuade my chiefs that our interest must lie in an alliance with them  that is so rajah and if you will inform me what are your expectations i will see how far they tally with those which the governor general has authorized me to offer  i am not greedy the prince said i wish only to have what is fair and just i think that our aid is worth two crores of rupees 200000 pounds and that the company should put me in possession of the lands of purseram bhow together with the land that lies between us and malwan including the territories of the rajah of bhopal  your demand harry said gravely is so far beyond what i was authorized to offer you that i fear it is altogether useless for me to submit it to the governor general he would i am sure consider that in naming such terms you had resolved to make acceptance impossible  that is by no means my intention the rajah said nothing could be further from my thoughts and in order to secure an alliance that i believe would be advantageous i might be able to make some slight concession  i will send off a messenger then submitting your offer and asking for instructions and requesting that i may be allowed to meet you by further concessions on my part but i fear that strained as the english treasury is by the preparations for the war against tippoo it would be impossible for the company to pay the sum you name nor do i think that they would be disposed to guarantee you the territory of bhopal seeing that we have no quarrel with the rajah of that country  no doubt they might be willing to grant you a portion of the territories of mysore lying on the other side of the godavery which would be as valuable as bhopal  as the rajah himself was still uncertain as to which side it would be most advantageous to take and as he thought that the campaign against tippoo would last for many months he offered no objection to harrys proposal the latter sent off two troopers the next day with a letter to lord mornington saying that as the rajahs demands were he knew altogether out of the question he had sent them to him simply to gain time hoping that before the answer arrived the army would have gained such successes over tippoo as would induce the prince to greatly modify his terms the troopers were charged not to use undue haste but to travel quietly at a rate not exceeding twenty miles a day  two months passed the rajah was in no hurry for the two parties among his councillors were so evenly divided that he was by no means sure that even if he wished it he could put his army in motion in support of either the english or tippoo and in the next place he believed that the latter would win and was reluctant in the extreme to take any step that would draw down upon him the vengeance of the lord of mysore he occasionally saw harry and although he expressed his anxiety for the return of the messengers harry could see that this feeling was only feigned and that at heart he was not sorry that he was not yet called upon to decide  at the end of a month harry had received a letter from the governor general brought by a messenger in the disguise of a peasant it only said  march 6th 1799  the army has left vellore on the 11th the nizams contingent also marched as has that from bombay by the 1st of this month all should have reached the plateauthe bombay army at sedaseer fortyfive miles west of seringapatam and the main army about eighty miles east of that town by the end of the month both should be before tippoos capital siege will probably occupy a month  even if berar decides against us its army cannot arrive in time to aid tippoo therefore if you can extend the negotiations for a month after you receive this your mission will have been fulfilled  this messenger had of course been sent off before the arrival of the troopers in calcutta and if lord morningtons calculations were correct seringapatam would be invested before they could return three days later indeed a report reached nagpore that tippoo had fallen upon the advance guard of the bombay army and had been repulsed and on the 27th he had attacked general harris and had again been defeated and that on the 28th the main army had forded the cauvery and had marched to sosilly  this news caused great excitement in the town although seringapatam was generally supposed to be impregnable and as the english had failed to take it during the last war it was believed that after another futile siege they would be forced to fall back again from want of food as they did upon the previous occasion  the rajah like the majority believed that seringapatam could defy any assault and that surrounded as the british army would be by the mysore cavalry they would very speedily be forced to retire and that although tippoo might have yielded to the wishes of his general and attempted to check the advance it could have been with only a portion of his army  including the contingent furnished by the nizam the bombay army amounted to fortythree thousand men tippoo was credited with having at least twice that force and his uniform successes against his neighbours had created a belief that he was invincible the rajah therefore was well content to let matters rest until more decisive news reached him  it was on the 7th of april that the messengers returned with a letter  we no longer want active assistance from berar the army is within striking distance of seringapatam and a few thousand native horse one way or another will make but little difference you have done very well in gaining two months by referring the matter to me the rajahs demands are of course ridiculous he is evidently playing a double part and if we were defeated tomorrow would join tippoo and attack the nizam you can still however offer him five lakhs of rupees but do not guarantee him any additional territory  the peishwa is acting in precisely the same way the army that was to come to our assistance has not yet moved and he like berar is simply awaiting events at seringapatam  the rajah came in that evening  i hear that your messengers have returned sir  yes i am sorry to say that the governor general considers your demands are altogether excessive the treasury is almost empty and were he to guarantee you an extension of your dominions it would bring on a war with the peishwa and the rajah of bhopal but he is willing to pay five lakhs of rupees to cover the maintenance of your troops while in the field  the rajah flushed with anger  it is altogether insufficient he said  i do not say that is the final offer rajah that is the offer i am authorized to make in the first place possibly if you are willing to make concessions of a reasonable kind i may be able to meet youand you must remember that the friendship of the company is of no slight advantage and would assuredly be of infinite value to you were your territory invaded by scindia and the peishwa these may at any moment make up their differences purseram bhow may again become the commander of the peishwas army and after the manner in which your troops have for the last two or three years raided his jagheer he would be your bitterest enemy  harry saw that this consideration made a powerful impression upon the rajah and the latter said  i must think these matters over the sum that you offer is altogether insufficient and cannot be entertained for a moment however there is time for reflection  during the next four weeks harry saw the rajah occasionally but the latter made no attempt to talk business he was evidently undecided in his mind as to the best course he should take he feared tippoo more than he feared the english and he still believed that the latter would assuredly fail in capturing seringapatam tippoos offers too had been considerably higher than those of calcutta as he had promised him a large slice of the nizams dominions for his assistance he had therefore determined to reject the english offer and to march into the nizams country as soon as he heard that the besieging army had fallen back  harrys suspicions that this was the case were to a certain extent confirmed by the fact that bodies of armed men began to arrive in considerable numbers he felt that his own position was beginning to be precarious and the native officer commanding his escort brought in almost hourly reports of what was passing in the city the population was a mixed one and nearly divided between hindus and mahommedans the latter naturally sympathized altogether with tippoo while the former were in favour of taking no part on either side  so matters continued until the 10th of may when a horseman rode into the town with the news that seringapatam had been captured by the british and that tippoo himself was killed a feeling akin to stupefaction was excited by the news and it seemed at first that it must be false for it was incredible that tippoo with so strong an army should have been unable to defend the fortress that as was believed could withstand any attack however formidable for four months  illustration as he rode through the streets he saw    how fierce a feeling of resentment had been excited by the news  the rajah sent at once to ask harry to visit him as he rode through the streets he saw by the scowling faces of the mahommedan soldiers how fierce a feeling of resentment had been excited by the news that the native officer had brought in a few minutes before the rajah was deeply agitated  have you heard the news sahib  i have rajah  and do you think it possible  perfectly indeed i have been expecting it for some days but i supposed the english general needed time to bring in provisions from the country round to form his plans and construct his batteries  to me it is astounding the rajah said walking up and down the room  of course harry said the proposal that i made to you cannot now be carried out and i do not feel myself justified under the changed position of things in continuing the negotiations  i always intended to help the english the rajah went on  no doubt rajah i have noticed for some time that you have been gathering a large force here but you have given me no indication for what purpose it was intended  it was intended of course for service with the english the rajah said and it would have been set in motion as soon as the negotiations were completed  at any rate rajah in spite of the temptations offered you by tippoo you have remained neutral this will be considered in your favour and i can assure you that there will be no breach in the friendship between yourself and the english matters will merely remain as they were before this war commenced  except that the nizam will become more powerful than before the rajah said  that will no doubt be so for he will certainly take a considerable share of tippoos dominions but that need not trouble you i know the desire of the governor general has always been for peace he was driven into this war by the failure of tippoo to carry out his undertaking to release all european prisoners in his hands and also by the great preparations he was making to regain territory that he had lost but it cannot be to the interest of the company that the nizam should use his increased power to be a scourge to his neighbours and i can promise you that any wanton aggression on his part will be regarded with displeasure and probably lead to their interference in your behalf  now rajah i must remind you that i am here as your guest and i rely upon you to protect me as i came through the streets the attitude of the mahommedan soldiers was very threatening and i should not be surprised if they attempted to attack the house i need not say that any outrage upon the escort of a british agent would be tremendously avenged and that you would be more easily forgiven had you taken the part of tippoo than if you allow me and my escort to be massacred  i will take immediate steps for your safety and should any attempt be made i shall come with my household guards to your assistance a squadron of them shall ride back with you now to prevent any insult being offered to you in the streets  i will relieve you of my presence tonight harry said i do not wish to be an object of strife between you and your people and will therefore take my farewell of you at once i shall have pleasure in informing the governor general of the steps that you have taken to provide for my safety  and give him the assurance that my disposition is wholly friendly and that i rely on nothing so much as to secure his friendship and to remain on the most amicable terms with him  harry had no doubt that the assurance was given in earnest the fall of seringapatam and the death of tippoo had been a terrible shock to the rajah and even the fact that he had missed his opportunity of allying himself with the english was as nothing to the thought of what would have happened had he declared for tippoo  the rajah at once gave orders for a squadron of his horse to mount and continued his conversation with harry until they were ready in the courtyard then bidding adieu to the prince the latter mounted and was escorted through the streets by the cavalry guard  but although their presence prevented any attack being made on him the lower class groaned and yelled and he had no doubt that had it not been for his escort he would have been murdered on his way back  directly he arrived he called the troopers to arms and told them to barricade the gates and to be ready to take post at the windows in case of assault looking out he saw that the rajahs men had taken up their position in front of the house  a great crowd soon began to gather there most of the men were evidently soldiers and had arms in their hands loud shouts were raised and it was not long before a musket was discharged quickly followed by others the native officer in charge of the guard ordered the soldiers to seize those who fired but as his men pressed their horses forward the crowd closed in upon them breaking their ranks and rendering them powerless  while this had been going on the men of harrys escort were hard at work in getting up the paving stones of the yard and piling them against the gate the lower windows were all barred and as there was no entrance except by the front gate it was felt that they could hold the house for some time  as soon as the guard were swept away a portion of the crowd attacked the gate with showers of stones while a heavy musketry fire was opened at every window so heavy was this that harry would not allow the troopers to show themselves there but posted them behind the barricades of stone against the gates so that when these yielded they might be able to open fire whilst showing only their heads over the top line of stones  harry regretted now that he had not when he returned from the rajah at once ordered his men to mount and cut their way through the mob a few at least might have escaped though doubtless they would have been pursued by the irregular cavalry as it was he felt that although they might sell their lives dearly they must be destroyed to a man unless the rajah sent assistance to them that he would endeavour to do so he felt sure for the massacre of a british envoy and his escort was certain to bring the english troops to nagpore sooner or later and no assurances that the rajah had done all in his power to save them would be accepted as sufficient  the house stood in a garden which extended some distance behind it and it was here that the horses were picketed the front gate was a very strong one and was certain to resist all attacks for some time  harry called off half his men and set them to work at the wall at the end of the garden which was only constructed of dry mud directing them to make a hole large enough for a horse to pass through at this side all was quiet the people in the native houses there having gone round to the front to watch what was doing harry stood there for a few minutes watching the men at work and saw with satisfaction their heavy tulwars rapidly cutting through the soft wall he told them that when they had finished four of them were to remain to guard the hole in case any might try to force their way in and the rest were to return to aid their comrades at the gate  he had no great fear that the attempt would be made to enter in that direction for the windows in the back of the house were like those in front large and anyone attempting to climb the walls and enter the garden would be liable to be shot down from the windows as they could not be covered as were those on the other side by a fire kept up from the houses outside the entrance into the garden from the house was made by a small door at the bottom of a staircase leading from what had been the zenana for the gardens were always considered the special domain of the ladies there was another small door for the servants offices used by the men who early in the morning went in to keep the garden in order  when harry rejoined the party in front he found that the gates were yielding the lower portion had been almost chopped away but here the wall of stones prevented an entrance and the men with their axes could scarcely reach to touch the upper half presently however the hinges of the upper end of one of the half doors yielded to the weight a great shout arose from the mob and the musketry hitherto directed against the windows was now concentrated on the opening  but it was no longer one sided the troopers glad that the time for inaction had passed returned the fire with vigour they had shifted the upper line of stones so that there was room between each for a musket barrel and lying in shelter they were enabled to take deliberate aim at their assailants at every shot a man dropped and the crowd opened speedily and cleared away from the line of fire  there was a pause of some minutes and then a strong party of soldiers rushed forward and began to try to pull down the barrier a number of others opening fire over their heads so as to prevent the defenders from standing up to fire down into them it was evident that ere long a slope would be formed outside by which an assault could be made  that his men would for some time repel any attack harry thought certain but sooner or later it would succeed and there would then be no time to retire he therefore sent a man back to see if the hole in the wall was large enough and he returned directly saying that the men there had just concluded their work and that six of them were coming back  harry now gave orders to the native officer who was standing beside him to order these men to lead the horses through the opening when he had been gone a minute or two he sent all the men except four to follow the example of their comrades while those left with him redoubled their fire so that their assailants should not know that any of the defenders had been withdrawn  it was not long before a trooper ran back with the word that all the horses had been taken through the news came just in time for so much of the barricade had been pulled down that it could now be climbed harry therefore gave the word and with the last of the defenders went off at a run  the troop was gathered in the deserted lane at the bottom of the garden and on harrys arrival the men sprung into the saddles and galloped off the rattle of musketry was now very heavy but it suddenly stopped and a moment later shouts and yells told that the breach had been carried and the yard found to be deserted  they will search the house first harry said to the native officer and they will be cautious about it as they will think that at any moment they may come upon us and will be sure that they would meet with a desperate resistance i expect that it will be ten minutes before they discover how we have slipped through their hands  they made a long detour and then approached the palace from the other side harry having determined to place himself under the protection of the rajah for he did not think it possible that they could escape by hard riding as they might be pursued by the whole of the cavalry just as they were approaching it they heard a fresh outbreak of firing the musketry being mingled with the crack of field guns  the rajah has gone out to our rescue harry said he would have been too late if we had stopped there however we can rely upon him now  five minutes later they rode into the courtyard of the palace it was almost deserted but one of the officials came out and bowing deeply to harry said  the rajah himself has gone out with the household troops and a battery of artillery to put down the tumult he is furious that his guests should have been attacked  the firing presently ceased and a quarter of an hour later the rajah rode in a messenger had been despatched at once to inform him that the british officer with his escort had arrived at the palace harry and his men had dismounted and were still standing by their horses  the rajah sprang from his saddle as he rode up  the gods be thanked that i see you safely here my friend he said when i arrived at your house i feared that all was over for these rebels had gained possession you must not blame me for not arriving sooner when the firing was heard i feared that the rabble of the town aided perhaps by many of my soldiers were attacking you although until the officer who commanded the guard i had placed there returned i did not dream how serious the business was then i got my soldiers together but this occupied some time as many of them were in the town however as soon as a squadron of horse was collected and a couple of hundred infantry together with four guns of a battery i headed them myself and on arriving opened fire upon the mob who speedily scattered some fifty or sixty of them being killed  then i entered the house expecting to find only your dead bodies but there were no signs of strife i questioned some prisoners we had taken inside and these said that just before i came up a hole had been discovered in the garden wall and it was believed that you had all escaped through that i was about to ride with all speed to prevent any pursuit being taken up when a messenger arrived with the welcome news that you had just entered the palace  i thank you heartily rajah for having so promptly come to my aid though assuredly you would have arrived too late to save us had we not as soon as the fighting began set to work to prepare a means of escape once we got out we were sure that you would protect us and therefore rode here and awaited your return  tis well indeed that you thought of that plan sahib for i would not for half my dominions that a hair of your head should have been hurt while you were here as my guest  it has all ended fortunately rajah and now what would you recommend me to do  you had best stay here until nightfall i will ride now to the camps of my men to reproach them for their conduct and to ask if they want to bring the army that has just captured seringapatam down upon us when it is dark i will myself accompany you with my household cavalry until you are miles away  i pray you to report to the governor general how grieved i am that evildisposed persons should have raised a riot with the intention of killing you and assure him that i did all in my power to save you and shall if they can be discovered punish those concerned in the matter  i shall assuredly report very favourably of your conduct rajahwhich will i have no doubt be warmly appreciatedand shall let the governor general know that from the time of my arrival here i always have been treated with the greatest courtesy and attention by you  leaving the infantry and artillery with their guns in front of the palace lest any attack should be made upon it the rajah rode off with his cavalry and returned two hours later with the news that all was quiet and that the troops had returned to their duty  as soon as it was dark the party started the rajah rode at the head of his cavalry harry at his request taking his place with his own escort in the centre of it so that his presence among them should not be suspected  it is as well the rajah said that the news that you have left should not be known till tomorrow morning for although the troops would i have no doubt be obedient to my orders in a town like this there are many budmashes who might if they knew that you had started ride in pursuit with the intention of attacking you after i had left you  once out of the town they proceeded at a rapid pace which they maintained until twenty miles away from nagpore the rajah then returned with the main body of his cavalry ordering a native officer and thirty men to escort harry until he arrived at the frontier  there was however little occasion for this addition to harrys force the news of the fall of seringapatam had spread like wildfire and at each village through which they passed and at those in which they halted for the night the inhabitants saluted harry with the deepest respect and would willingly have supplied him and his escort with provisions without payment had he not insisted upon their receiving fair value for them  at the frontier the rajahs troop turned back and harry continued his journey reaching calcutta early in june  when he arrived there he was well received by the governor general who told him that he had rendered a great service by so delaying the negotiations that the rajah of berar had remained neutral during the war with tippoo and that he would probably soon require his services again  a descendant of the rajah of mysore whose government hyder ali had usurped was released from captivity and raised to the musnud nearly half the revenue of the country was assigned to him a large sum was set aside for the maintenance of the families of hyder and tippoo and the remaining territory was divided between the company and the nizam  a portion was set aside as the share of the peishwa although he had not fulfilled his engagement in any way but it was to be given only on the condition that he signed a treaty of alliance with the english similar to that entered into by the nizam the peishwa however would not consent to do this and the territory set aside for him was consequently divided between the company and the nizam  civil war was raging in the deccan the widows of mahdoo rao had been joined by a large force and were plundering scindias villages while jeswunt holkar was also ravaging the country scindia found that it was necessary to appoint balloba who had been for some years in captivity to the post of his chief minister and through him a treaty was made with the widows of mahdoo and the trouble in that direction ceased  the rajah of kolapoore was at war with the peishwa and the troops of purseram bhow and those of rastia were both defeated scindia and the peishwa now sent an army of thirty thousand horse and six thousand infantry against kolapoore but purseram who was in command was defeated and fell mortally wounded another army joined the defeated force and invested kolapoore  on the 13th of march 1800 nana furnuwees died and affairs in the mahratta country that had been to some extent kept in order by his wisdom and moderation now became worse than ever a dispute at once took place between the peishwa and scindia each being desirous of obtaining the treasures nana was supposed to possess scindia seized his jagheer ghatgay was released and obtained his former influence over scindia who seized balloba and threw him into prison where he died  the peishwa on his part was determined to destroy all the friends of nana and inviting most of the principal men to the palace he seized and sent them all prisoners to hill forts he now with scindia determined to destroy the family and adherents of purseram bhow appa sahib purserams son had succeeded him in the command of the army besieging kolapoore and receiving intelligence of the conspiracy against him raised the siege and retired to the carnatic and scindia plundered the whole of purserams villages  a fierce chief in dhoondia invaded the newlyacquired territories of the british and major general wellesley was sent against him and totally routed his party  jeswunt holkar was now becoming extremely dangerous and scindia was at last obliged to march away with his army to defend his own dominions he left behind him five battalions of regular infantry and ten thousand horse and before he set out compelled the peishwa to give him gold to the amount of fortyseven lakhs of rupees  on his way through malwan he sent seven of his regular battalions to protect his capital one column under captain mackintyre was intercepted on the way and all killed or made prisoners holkar then fell upon the other party which he also overpowered and defeated he next attacked scindias artillery on the march but major brownrigg an officer in the latters service with four battalions repulsed his assailants  the peishwa while this was going on was mercilessly murdering or imprisoning those whom he considered his enemies and ordered wittoojee holkar the brother of jeswunt to be trampled to death by an elephant  scindia having sent for ghatgay to rejoin him jeswunt advanced to meet him and was signally defeated he speedily gathered a fresh force and wasted not only scindias country but that of the peishwa and finally a great battle was fought near poona in which holkar thanks to his fourteen regular battalions officered by englishmen won a complete victory over the peishwas force and that left behind by scindia the peishwa was forced to fly and take refuge at bassein where he entered into negotiations for british support    chapter 10 a mission by sea   a fortnight after harrys return he was again sent for by lord mornington  captain lindsay i am about to employ you on a mission of a somewhat delicate character there have been many complaints that ships trading among the islands have been attacked and in some cases captured and the crews massacred by malays we recently received a communication from a native chief or rajah who owns the southern point of the malay peninsula he says that the dutch in java greatly interfere with his trade as all vessels trading in the east are bound to touch at batavia on their way to europe and consequently very few of them visit the peninsula as to do so would greatly lengthen their voyage to batavia he asks that we should make a settlement at the end of the peninsula so that our ships may trade with him and would be willing to place us in possession of an island two or three miles from the extreme southern portion of his dominions  there can be no doubt that the position would be an extremely valuable one lying as it does on our trade route to the east but it is also certain that a settlement of that kind would be viewed with extreme jealousy by the dutch whose possessions in java and other islands render them practically masters of the whole malay archipelago  certainly at present our hands are much too full here to permit of our engaging in any enterprise of this kind but at the same time it is desirable that we should obtain some reliable information as to the situation there the power of this rajah and the advantages that the island offers in the way of ports the salubrity of its climate and other similar particulars its possession would certainly be desirable not only as a centre for future trade with bankok and the east but as a port from which our vessels of war might suppress the piracy that prevails all along the malay coast and in the neighbouring island of sumatra such information may be extremely useful in the future and when our power in this country is consolidated  but this is not the sole object of your mission you will proceed either before or after your visit to this rajah as we will determine to batavia bearing a despatch from me to the dutch governor narrating a number of acts of piracy that have taken place among the islands and requesting that as they are the paramount power in that district they will take steps both for their own sake and ours to suppress piracy and offering on our part that two or three of our ships of war shall if they think it desirable aid them in the punishment of the malays you will be accompanied by an interpreter  there are several malay traders established here and some of them no doubt speak hindustani fluently i will have enquiries made among them and will also procure you a dutch interpreter  i do not propose that you shall go in a trading vessel to java the appearance of such a vessel off batavia would be resented by the dutch of course traders do go from here down to the islands but only to those not under dutch power they used generally to trade on their way down with burma and siam but the burmese have shown such hostility to us that it is no longer safe to enter their rivers and they have wrested the maritime provinces of siam on this side of the peninsula from that power so that trade there is for the present at an end i shall therefore send you down in one of our small sloops a larger vessel might irritate the dutch and a small one would be sufficient to furnish you with an escort to this rajah of johorenot only for protection but because the native potentates have no respect for persons who do not arrive with some sort of appearance of state  you will of course go as high commissioner with full powers to represent me i do not anticipate that you will be able to conclude any formal treaty with the rajah of johore he will of course ask for an equivalent either in money or in protection against some neighbouring rajah we have no money to spare at present and certainly no troops your commission therefore will be to acknowledge his communication to assure him of our friendship to ascertain the suitability of the island that he offers and to tell him that at present being so fully occupied with wars here we are scarcely in a position to extend our responsibility but that when matters are more settled we shall be prepared to enter into a treaty with him to open a trade with his dominions to pay a fair sum for the possession of the island if suitable and to enter into a treaty of alliance with him  of the value of such a settlement there can be no doubt whatever for we may take it that before very long some of the chinese ports will be open to european traders  a week later harry embarked on a brig mounting eight guns and usually employed in police work along the coast he was accompanied by a dutch interpreter a malay trader abdool and four troopers of the governor generals bodyguard in the handsome uniform worn by that corps the lieutenant in command of the brig received harry with the usual ceremony as a government commissioner he himself was at the gangway to meet him and twelve of the sailors with drawn cutlasses saluted as harry stepped on to the deck  the lieutenant a young man of about four or five and twenty looked surprised when he found that the official whom he was to carry down to java was apparently younger than himself  i suppose captain fairclough harry said with a smile when they entered the cabin that you expected to see a middleaged man  hardly that captain lindsay i heard that you were a young officer who had rendered distinguished services on the bombay side and had just returned from an important mission in the deccan but i own that i had not at all expected to see an officer younger than myself  i can quite understand that i have been exceptionally fortunate owing to the fact that i speak mahratti as well as english well i hope that after your reception we have done with ceremony and that you will forget that i am at present a civil official with the temporary rank of commissioner and regard and treat me as you might any young officer who had been given a passage in your brig i have led a pretty rough life and hate anything like ceremony we may be some weeks on board together and should have a pleasant time of it especially as the whole country is new to me  and to me also the lieutenant said i generally cruise from the mouth of the hooghly to chittagong and a dreary coast it is with its low muddy shores and scores of creeks and streams in the sunderbunds there is little to look after the people are quiet and very scattered but farther east they are piratically inclined and prey upon the native traders and we occasionally catch them at it and give them a lesson  well i shall be very glad to adopt your suggestion and to drop all ceremony i have not often had to carry civil officials in this craft she is too small for any such dignified people but when i was in the tigris we often carried civil and military officials from madras and some of them were unmitigated nuisancesnot the military men but the civilians the absurd airs they gave themselves as if heaven and earth belonged to them were sickening and they seemed to regard us as dust under their feet whenever we heard that we were to take a member of the council from calcutta to madras or the other way it was regarded as an infliction of a serious kind  well i propose to begin with that when we are down here together we drop titles you call me lindsay and i will call you fairclough  with all my heart the other said  what officers have you  a junior lieutenant and two midshipmen the lieutenant when i am alone always messes with me we are not so strict among our small craft in the companys service as they are in the royal navy and i think myself that it would be ridiculous for me to dine here by myself mr hardy by himself and the two midshipmen in a separate mess of their own that of course they do for they would not enjoy their meals with hardy and myself  i quite agree with you  this is your stateroom  but it is your private cabin fairclough is it not  well yes but i am accustomed to turn out whenever there are passengers  well at any rate i shall feel very much disgusted if you do so for me i should be most uncomfortable so i must insist on you having your things moved back here when i tell you that for sixteen years i lived in the house of a small mahratta cultivator you may well imagine that i can make myself perfectly comfortable anywhere  it will be quite contrary to the rules of our service the other began hesitatingly  i cant help that harry replied there are no rules without exceptions and mine is an altogether peculiar case you will really oblige me very much if you will have the change made  i see that you are surprised at what i told you about myself it is too long a story to tell you now but i will after dinner today repeat to you and hardy some of my experiences which you will see have been curious and account for my having the rank of captain and being employed in a responsible position at my age  i suppose you will soon be getting up anchor  yes the tide will be favourable now and everything is ready for a start  a few minutes later the clank of the capstan was heard and going on deck harry found lieutenant hardy preparing to sail as soon as the vessel was under way he came aft and was introduced to harry  the latter had enquired of the chief of the governors staff what was customary on these occasions and whether he was to take on board a stock of provisions  not at all was the reply government makes an allowance for messing and wine sometimes an official will take a dozen or so of champagne with him as the allowance though liberal would scarcely cover this but it is quite sufficient to enable a captain to keep a good table and provide port and sherry  harry seeing that the voyage might be much longer than usual had sent on board four dozen of champagne some of which he thought might be useful at the table if the rajah of johore came on board with a number of his chiefs or if the ship was visited by dutch officials  the dutch interpreter was to mess with the petty officers the malay preferred to prepare his victuals for himself  the wind was light and the brig drifted quietly down the river and when evening came on anchored as on account of the sandbanks and the lightness of the wind fairclough had thought it unadvisable to continue his voyage at night as soon as the sails had been taken in the two officers went down to the cabin where dinner was ready for them  it was a pleasant one for the two naval men were in high spirits over this change from their ordinary routine and the prospect of sailing on a strange voyage abdool as usual had placed himself behind his masters chair but harry said  i shant want you to wait on me during the voyage abdool the captains steward will do that  after the meal was over cheroots lighted and a decanter of port placed on the table fairclough asked harry for the story he had promised him and the latter accordingly gave them a sketch of his life and adventures  i no longer wonder lindsay at your having attained the rank of captain so young that old nurse of yours must have been a trump indeed but certainly it is wonderful that you should have lived first as a peasant and then at the peishwas court so long without anyone having had a suspicion that you were an englishman fancy your meddling in politics being regarded as a friend of the peishwa and this minister of his and being the means of getting the latter out of prison and so perhaps averting a war between the mahrattas and bombay that was a ticklish business too at nagpore and you were lucky in coming so well out of it  but after all i think the most wonderful part is that a boy of sixteen should have been a shikaree and killed no end of tigers leopards and bears and after that have risen so soon to the rank of captain in the companys service why you have seen and done more than most men double your age  yes i have had great luck and it is all owing to my old nurse having taken such pains first to enable me to pass as a mahratta and in the next place to teach me the english language and english ways  well the story has been an unconscionably long one i think i will go on deck and smoke a last cheroot and then turn in  if you were a new hand from england i should say that you had better smoke it here fairclough said for the mists from the water and swamps are apt to give fresh hands a touch of fever  the time passed pleasantly as they made direct for the mouth of the straits between the malay peninsula and sumatra there was a light but steady breeze and on the morning of the eighth day after sailing harry on going on deck saw land on the port side as the lieutenant on the evening before said that they should next day sight the great andaman he was not surprised  on looking at the chart he said to fairclough  i should have thought that it would have been shorter to go on the other side of the islands  it would have been rather shorter but there are four or five islands to the north of the andaman and another very small one halfway between it and negrais so i preferred going outside when we get south of the little andaman island we shall pass between it and the nicobar islands i fancy that they and perhaps the andamans once formed a part of sumatra they are scattered almost in a line from its northern point the land has probably sunk and these islands were no doubt the summits of mountains forming part of the chain that runs through sumatra  once through the passage south of little andaman we shall sail due east for a day or two and then lay her course nearly southeast which will take us right up the straits between sumatra and the malay peninsula  are there any islands scattered about there  there is one nasty little group called the arroa islands nearly in midchannel i shall take care to pass them in daylight farther down there are several largish islands near the sumatra coast but as the passage is some sixty miles wide there is little fear of our running foul of them  have the dutch any settlements at sumatra  two or three palembang is the principal it is on a river that runs down into the banca straits i believe that they have trading stations at jambi and siak  a fortnight later the brig anchored off the coast of singapore during the voyage harry had had many conversations with the malayan interpreter the latter told him that the chief who had written might not be in a position to carry out his offer not only were the small malay states frequently engaged in wars with each other but there were constant internal insurrections and struggles the various petty chiefs frequently endeavouring to set up as independent powers at the present time the tumangong or chief justice had obtained possession of the island of singapore and the adjacent district of the mainland while other chiefs had also thrown off their allegiance to the rajah of johore who himself had usurped the power from the former reigning family  if he said you want only to obtain a place for trade the tumangong is no doubt the person from whom you must obtain it but if you wanted the whole island you would have to treat not only with him but with the rajah as in case the latter should defeat and overthrow the tumangong he certainly would not recognize the cession of the island to you  is there a good port  no but it is not needed they do not have hurricanes here as they do in the bay of bengal and in the china seas and indeed among the islands so vessels can anchor off the coast in safety at all times of the year  what is the island like  it is covered with forest and jungle the malay replied there are but few inhabitants a hundred and fifty or so most of these are my people but there are a few chinese and bugis the malays are not cultivators they live by piracy attacking small native vessels passing through the narrow passages between singapore and the mainland the chinese cultivate patches of land  is it fertile  very rain falls there more than half the days in the year if the chinese had it they would make a garden of it it is better even than the land on that part of sumatra where they produce spices and grains of all sorts the malay peninsula would be very wealthy were it not split up into several kingdoms that are always at war with each other  singapore was a great place once seven hundred years ago it was the capital of the whole malay kingdom but it was taken a hundred years afterwards by the king of java and malacca then became the malay capital  the affair does not seem very promising harry said after repeating to fairclough what he had heard from the malay from my experience of the indian princes there is very little trust to be placed in any agreement made with them they keep it just as long as it suits them and then break it without the slightest sense of having done anything dishonourable it seems to me that the position here is very much like that in the deccan scindia holkar and the rajahs of berar and kolapoore are practically independent of the peishwa who maintains only a semblance of authority from what the interpreter tells me there seems to be only a puppet rajah who today possesses no authority whatever but who tomorrow may excite a quarrel among the other chiefs and again become their master  i think that in the first place i shall have to see this semiindependent chief whose possessions singapore forms part of and afterwards the rajah of johore his nominal master  the latter may view the matter in one of two ways in the first place he may consider the island of no importance whatever seeing that even were he again its master no revenue could be obtained from the handful of people living there and would therefore be glad to ratify the cession to us for a small sum on the other hand he may consider that the elevation of the island into the position of a great european trading port would add greatly to the power and importance of the tumangong and might enable him to make himself master of the whole of johore  it seems a complicated business certainly the sailor replied you see though this rebel chap having written to calcutta may be trusted to receive you hospitably there is no saying what the rajah may think of it  nor is it clear how i am to get at the rajah harry remarked the tumangong would no doubt object to my going beyond what he considers as his territory as it might seem that did he let me do so he would be recognizing the power of the rajah to interfere in his business however it is certain that i must carry home a clear report on the situation and to do that i must at any rate attempt to see the rajah  of course we must endeavour to learn from the malays on the island whether johore still holds any territory running down to the sea or whether the coast chiefs have also revolted against him in the first case i will send up a native to say that i have a mission from the governor general of india to visit his court but if he is cut off from the sea i must endeavour to make my way through somehow it would never do to return with only half a story i do not suppose the governor general is at all aware of the state of things here or that the chief who communicated with him is not the acknowledged rajah of johore  there can be no doubt that the possession of this island would be of great value to us as it would become a centre of trade not only with the east but with all the islands round except of course those belonging to holland therefore the first essential point is to ascertain whether the old rajah is likely to regain his former authority and whether if so he will recognize and on what terms the cession of the island to us  well i am glad lindsay that it is your business and not mine for it seems a very difficult affair and a somewhat dangerous one  three weeks after leaving calcutta the brig reached the island and at harrys request sailed round it taking soundings very frequently in order to obtain knowledge of the depth of the water and the nature of the sea bottom finally they anchored in the straits between it and the mainland this varied in width from two miles to a quarter of a mile and the depth of water at the eastern extremity of the straits was found to be insufficient for vessels of a large tonnage though navigable for ordinary native craft  the island itself was some twentyfive miles long and fifteen miles wide being as fairclough calculated about a third larger than the isle of wight no high hills were seen but the whole island was undulating and everywhere covered with forest and jungle  several small malay canoes had put off to them with fruit and as from what the interpreter had told them of the smallness of the population there was clearly no chance of any attack being made on the brig they were allowed to come alongside the supply of fruit was very welcome and the interpreter learned something from the natives as to the state of things on the mainland  as to this however they appeared to take but little interest they admitted that the tumangong was their lord but as they were too poor for him to levy any contributions from them his mastership was merely a nominal one and they did not trouble themselves about him if he should at any time send an officer and troops to exact tribute money they would simply retire into the interior where they could defy pursuit they had heard reports that there were wars on the mainland but beyond the fact that the rajah possessed very little authority they were unable to give any information they had vaguely heard that some of the chiefs supported the family of the former rajah  on the day after their anchoring a large canoe put off from the mainland in the stern sat two men whose gay dresses showed them to be minor chiefs or officials harry who had throughout the voyage worn only civilian costume of white drill now put on his full uniform as did the sowars of his escort the ladder was lowered for the accommodation of the visitors and these on reaching the deck were received by fairclough his officers and a guard of honour the malay interpreter stood by the captains side  why do you come here was their first question  we bring a high officer of the governor general at calcutta to confer with the lord of singapore fairclough answered through the interpreter  our lord thought that it might be so one of the officials said and therefore sent us off to enquire  fairclough led the malays to the quarterdeck where harry was standing with his four troopers as a bodyguard behind him  this is the official whom the governor general has sent to you  the malays struck with harrys uniform and still more with that of his guardall of which were new to them and impressed them deeplysalaamed profoundly to him  i have arrived harry said as the agent of our great governor and in answer to a request of your lord the tumangong that he should send an officer of rank here to treat with him  seeing this vessel of war the malay said when harrys speech had been translated to him our lord hoped that it might be so and directed us should this prove correct to inform you that he will himself come off to see you in three days time he has heard of the might of your lord in india that he has conquered great kingdoms that the rule is a wise one and that the people are well contented we love not the dutch who are hard masters and make the people labour for them and he desires to be on terms of friendship with the power which as he understands has taken their strong places in india so that they have no longer any importance there  he has done wisely harry said and i shall be glad to see your lord and to tell him what is in the mind of our governor  the envoys were then invited to the cabin where they were offered refreshments they ate sparingly but greatly appreciated the champagne and asked through the interpreter if they could be instructed how to make this liquor and were much disappointed on learning it could only be made from the juice of the grape that grew in a certain land in europe and could not be manufactured elsewhere though other wines which were equally good could be madethat as the fruits grown in a hot country like theirs could not be grown in europe where the climate was much colder so the grape could not flourish in their hot country  three days later the tumangong came off in a canoe gaily decorated by flags attended by several smaller craft as he set foot on the deck a salute was fired he appeared much disturbed when the first gun went off but the interpreter explained to him that it was a mark of honour always granted to native princes of importance seeing that no harm was done by the fire the malay approached harry whose escort had been rendered more imposing by a line of blue jackets with musket and cutlass drawn up behind them  harry advanced to meet him and friendly greetings were exchanged he then invited him down into the cabin where he was accompanied by one of his chief officers harry the captain and the interpreter went down with them the malay commenced the conversation  i hope that you bring a favourable answer to my letter  the governor bids me say that he willingly accepts your offer of friendship and would readily establish a trading station on the island of singapore but that being now engaged in a serious war in india it is not in his power at present to engage in an alliance that might involve him in war here since he might be unable to fulfil his obligations with us obligations under a treaty are regarded as sacred and to be upheld at all sacrifices later on when affairs are more settled in india he will gladly form an alliance with you  here is a despatch in your language stating his reasons more fully but in order to show his friendship he has sent me down in this ship of war to explain matters to you and to assure you that he appreciates your offer and will later on accept it but that he cannot enter into such a treaty now as being engaged in war he might not be able to protect you from all enemies should you call upon him to do so i am the bearer of several presents from him which he has sent as a proof of his friendship towards you  he touched a bell and at the signal some sailors brought in the presents consisting of a handsome doublebarrelled gun a brace of pistols some embroidered robes and some bales of english cloth and other manufactures also a dinner service of pottery an ormulu clock and other articles the rajah whose face had at first expressed disappointment was evidently much pleased with these presents and after perusing the letter expressed himself as well contented with its terms  i value them all the more he said because they are a proof that the english do not make treaties unless able to fulfil the conditions this is far better than accepting treaties and then withdrawing from them you can assure the great lord of calcutta although i regret much that he cannot at present form an alliance with me that i shall be ready to renew the negotiations with him whenever he notifies me that he can do so  the champagne was then produced the tumangong had evidently heard from his officers how delicious was the strange drink which bubbled as if it was boiling and was yet quite cold two bottles were put upon the table and the malays after tasting it cautiously at first consumed the greater portionthe two officers only sipping theirs occasionally and filling up their glasses so as to keep the others in countenance accustomed to more fiery beverages obtained from traders in the dutch possessions the malays were in no way affected by their potations although these evidently impressed them with the superiority of the english over their dutch rivals for the tumangong remarked  truly the english must be a great people to make such liquors the dutch sell us fiery drinks but their flavour is not to be compared with these i hope that your lord when he again sends a ship down to me will forward me some of this drink  i have fortunately a case of it with me harry said it contains two dozen bottles i will give orders for it to be placed in your boat  he could see by the malays face that he was greatly gratified and he added  i have no doubt tumangong that when i inform the governor general that you were pleased with this drink he will order some of it to be sent down when there is an opportunity so that the friendship between you and him can be maintained until the time comes when he can arrange with you for the concession of a trading station on the island of singapore  the offer shall be always open to him there is no occasion for haste  the conversation continued for some time longer and then the malay and his officers took their places in their canoe and rowed off under a salute similar to that which had greeted their arrival  that is quite satisfactory harry said to the commander  yes there is no doubt that he thought more of your present of champagne than of the gifts sent him by the governor and your promise to let him have a consignment occasionally will keep him in good temper  now what is your next move  i think it would be best to finish with the dutch first if there were any delay in the other matter they might get news from malacca or some of their trading stations in sumatra that the ship has been here and in that case they would guess that we are thinking of establishing a trading station and might send and make their own terms with the tumangong there can be no doubt that if we open a free port here it will do great damage to them and divert a large portion of the eastern trade here being so much more handy for all the country craft trading with siam and china besides having the advantage of avoiding the heavy dues demanded by the dutch  no doubt that will be the best way fairclough said we will get up anchor tomorrow morning  in the course of the afternoon a large canoe came off loaded with presents of fresh meat fruit and vegetable sent by the tumangong together with some handsomelymounted krises for harry and the officers of the ship  they continued their voyage without incident to batavia arriving there they dropped anchor and saluted the dutch flag the salute was returned from the shore and shortly afterwards a large boat flying the flag of holland and carrying several persons rowed out to them  it was apparent at once when they ascended to the deck that the visit of the british ship of war was not a welcome one the jealousy of the dutch of any attempt on our part to obtain a footing among the islands was intense and the opinion on shore on seeing the brig would be that she had come to announce that possession had been taken of some unoccupied island their manner therefore was cold when harry informed them through his dutch interpreter that he was the bearer of a despatch to the dutch governor from the governor general  i may say that it refers he said to the numerous outrages committed by the malays upon vessels owned by british subjects trading among the islands and that he suggests that the dutch authorities should join in an attempt to punish these marauders from whom they suffer equally with the british  the governor will receive you at three oclock this afternoon you will of course wish to deliver your despatch personally to him and as we shall acquaint him with its import he will no doubt be prepared to give you an answer forthwith  without further words the officials returned to their boats  they are a surly set of beggars fairclough said as they rowed off i dont think there is much chance of cooperation in that quarter indeed i am by no means sure that at heart they do not approve of these malay attacks at present they monopolize the trade in spice the native craft from all the islands bring their productions here and there can be no doubt that the piracies of the malays act as a great deterrent both to the native traders and our own from calcutta and madras  i think that very likely that is so harry agreed i do not think that the governor had any belief that they would cooperate in the matter and really only invited them to do so because it would explain the presence of a ship of war in these waters so i shall be in no way concerned if this part of my business turns out a failure  at the appointed time the captains gig was lowered and harry and fairclough took their places in it another boat carried the dutch interpreter and the four troopers they were received on landing by an official and a guard of honour and were conducted to the governors residence another guard of honour was drawn up at the entrance they were shown into a large room where the governor was seated surrounded by the members of his council  he rose and advanced a few paces shook hands with the two officers and begged them to be seated on two chairs next to him harry handed the despatch to him  it is very short sir he said and perhaps as you are aware of its import you will just glance through it  the governor did so and afterwards handed it to one of the members of the council and it was passed from hand to hand  i am quite in accord the governor said with lord mornington that the attacks of the malays which we as well as yourselves suffer from are deplorable and it is greatly to be wished that they could be suppressed but i think that lord mornington could hardly have been informed as to the great number of islands inhabited by the malays and the great naval force that would be required to overawe and punish these freebooters who are so bold that they do not hesitate to attack our traders even when large ships and carrying guns for their protection nothing short of a great fleet of cruisers would suffice  in the next place did we undertake any operations on a large scale against the malays throughout the islands they would unite against us and might in revenge assail many of our ports and do us enormous damage even if your fleet performed half the work it is we only who would be the sufferers certainly we have not sufficient vessels of war to attempt such an operation and even were the governor general of india to send down as many vessels as we have at our disposal the force would be altogether inadequate for such extensive operations these islands are counted by hundreds and on the approach of ships of war the people would desert their villages by the seashore and take to the interiorwhere it would in most cases be impossible to follow themand all the damage we could inflict would be to burn their villages which could be rebuilt after the ships had sailed away  to exterminate piracy would be the work not of months but of many years however i shall consult my council and will draft a reply to the despatch tomorrow  you have had a pleasant voyage down i hope  very much so harry replied we have had fine weather and light breezes  the conversation was continued for a few minutes and then the little party returned to their boats  there is not much doubt what the reply will be fairclough said  no and on the whole i dont see that the governor is to be blamed though of course he has not given us the principal reason which is his objection to our flag being seen flying beside the dutch among the islands still there is a good deal in what he says  i think so too you see they are going to send their answer tomorrow which may be taken as a proof that they are anxious to get rid of us as soon as possible    chapter 11 a prisoner   the next day the governor himself came off to the brig and was received with the usual honours  the council are quite of my opinion he said to harry as to the extreme difficulty and cost that an effort to put down piracy among the islands would involve our ships on the station would not be at all sufficient for such work and at any rate it is a step that we should not venture to engage in without the assent of the home government we shall of course write home fully upon the matter and shall leave the final decision to them at the same time expressing our own views and giving some idea as to the force that would have to be employed the expenditure involved and the time required for the operation  this letter contains a reply as far as we can give it to the governor generals proposals  his lordship will i am sure be sorry to hear your views sir but i imagine that he will not hesitate to undertake the work of punishing at least the people of some of the islands where outrages have taken place as soon as affairs are sufficiently settled in india for him to dispense for a time with the services of some of the companys ships of war  as harry expected the face of the dutch governor showed that this statement when translated was evidently most unpalatable to him after a moments hesitation however he said  if lord mornington waits until everything is quiet in india it will probably be a very long time before he will be able to carry out the operation you speak of  that may be sir i do not know whether you have heard that seringapatam has been captured and that tippoo himself fell in its defence  a look of amazement and even of consternation on the part of the dutch officials showed that the news was as unwelcome as it was unexpected the loss of their hold in india by the wonderful spread of the british power was an extremely sore point with them nothing would have pleased them better than to have heard that the power of the latter had been shattered  it is certainly news to us the governor said shortly but there are still other powers in india that are likely to give at least as much trouble as mysore has done  i quite admit that harry said but have no doubt that we shall be able to deal with them as satisfactorily as we have done with tippoo and possibly as quickly  that remains to be seen the governor said  quite so sir i have a considerable knowledge of india and of its native armies and i doubt whether any of them are as good fighters as tippoos men were  was mysore taken by storm or by famine  by storm after our batteries had opened fire for a few days  illustration well sir i will now return to shore the governor said  well sir i will now return to shore the governor said abruptly you will please to give the assurances of my high esteem to lord mornington  harry bowed and without another word the dutch officials descended the accommodation ladder and returned to shore when they were out of hearing fairclough burst into a hearty laugh  that was a severe broadside you poured into him lindsay i could see that they were absolutely flabbergasted when you told them about mysore their manner before that had been almost insolent but you cut their comb finely  i knew that it would be a heavy blow for them of course they view with intense disgust the spread of our power in india not only has it destroyed their dream of empire there but in case of war with them their islands here will be absolutely at our mercy if we are strong enough to win kingdom after kingdom in india there should be no difficulty in turning out the small bodies of troops they have in their various possessions  yes i see that and the time may come very shortly for the french are likely to lay hands on holland before long and as soon as they do so we shall be ready to pop down upon them here the days of van tromp are long passed and the dutch navy has become absolutely insignificant  well i am glad that this is over the sooner we are off the better  half an hour after the dutch governor had left orders were given to get up the anchor and loosen the sails and the brig was shortly on her way north  now what is your next move fairclough asked as the bustle of getting under way subsided  the malay tells me that there is a small town on the east coast and that this would be the most handy for landing as from there to johores town is not more than some twenty miles whether the road is open he cannot say the news he learned from the tumangongs people was that there was a great deal of fighting going on between johore and some of the petty rajahs what the position is at the present moment he could not discover  i should propose that we drop anchor off the place and that if we find the natives well disposed the interpreter should make an arrangement with a couple of natives to carry up a letter from me to the rajah saying that i have come on a matter of business from the governor of india and asking if he is willing to receive me and to guarantee my safety if he says no there is an end to it if he says yes i shall start as soon as the answer comes  would you take some blue jackets with you  no if we were attacked by a force of malays we should probably be annihilated even if i took half your ships company therefore the smaller the escort i travel with the better i shall of course take the malay my man abdool and the four men of the escort that is quite enough if we get up without trouble whereas if there is trouble the fewer the better  well i hope no harm will come of it lindsay of course if you consider it your duty to go go you must  yes i think it my duty i consider the cession of this island to be of extreme importance if we only obtain it from the tumangong some day the rajah of johore might get the upper hand and repudiate the treaty made without his approval and narrow as the strait is he might cross with forty or fifty canoes make his way through the woods and annihilate the settlement at one blow  no doubt that is so the other agreed well if you get detained you will of course try and make your way down to the coast i will remain at anchor off the town for a month after you start if there is no news of you then i shall conclude that it is hopeless to wait longer and shall sail for calcutta with your despatches as i was present at both your interviews i shall be able to report from my own knowledge as to the disposition shown both by the tumangong and the dutch  ten days later they cast anchor off the village some canoes soon came off to them with fruit and other products and shortly afterwards a war canoe came out with the chief man of the town at first he was very reticent but a bottle of champagne opened his lips and he and the interpreter conversed for some time together  what does he say harry asked when there was a pause in the conversation  he says sir that the country is very unsettled and that it is unsafe to travel the town acknowledges the rajah as its master and the territory through which the road runs is nominally his but it is infested by bands owing allegiance to a neighbouring rajah who is at war with him  have you asked him if it is possible to send a messenger through  he said that there are plenty of men who would venture to go through if well paid he thinks that two men would be better than ten for they could hide themselves more easily in the forest  well ask him what he would send two messengers through for  the malay answered that he could not say until he had spoken to some of them but he thought that for ten dollars they would be willing to undertake it  tell him that i would pay that and will give them as much more if on their return they will guide me and my party to the residence of the rajah  the malay shook his head  they would want more for that he said two natives could pass without much danger for if they were caught they could say that they belonged to one of the other bands but had lost their party it would be quite different if they were to have europeans with them  how many would go  seven of us altogether  i will see about it the chief said but if i succeed you will give me three bottles of that drink  i have very little of it harry said but i will agree to give him the three bottles if he finds messengers to take up my letters and arranges with them or others to guide us up  the malay nodded when the answer was translated to him drank half a tumbler of ships rum with great satisfaction and then went off  this is going to be a more dangerous business than our expedition to nagpore harry said to abdool when he told him what the malay had said about the dangers and the state of affairs on shore  my lord will manage it somehow abdool said he was born under a fortunate star and will assuredly do what is best  i shall do what i hope is best abdool but one cannot answer how it will turn out one thing is certain that if we fall into the hands of the malays we shall meet with little mercy  we should have had no mercy if we had fallen into the hands of the people of nagpore master abdool said  that is true enough abdool and i dont think we should have been much better off if scindia had laid hands on us after we had bearded him in his tent i cannot say that this expedition is one that i should have chosen were i not convinced that it is my duty however we must hope that all will go well with us as it has done before  the next day the malay came off again  i have arranged with two men he said to take your message for ten dollars but if they go back with you they will require twenty because the rajah might detain them  that i will pay harry said  but supposing you should not come back the malay said they might lose their reward will you pay them in advance  no i will leave the money in captain faircloughs hands and whether i return or not he will before he leaves pay it to the men themselves if they come back or to their families  that is a fair proposal the malay said when do you wish the messengers to start  the letter will be ready for them in an hours time i will come on shore with it see the men and give it to them with instructions will they travel by night or day  they will start at daybreak the chief said the road is but a track and could not be followed at night for a forest extends almost the whole distance and they would find it too dark to keep to the road i told them that it would be safer to travel at night but they said it could not be done they would not be likely to be surprised in the day as they would travel noiselessly and would be sure to hear any movement of a party of men coming along the road and could hide in the forest until they had passed moreover our people do not like travelling in the dark evil creatures are about and even the bravest fear them  very well chief then i will come ashore in an hour and give them this letter  as soon as they had left harry went down to the interpreter and gave him the exact purport of the message to the rajah leaving it to him to put it in the usual form in which communications were addressed to persons in authority but saying that it was necessary that he should impress him with his importance as the commissioner of the great governor of india when this was transcribed on some parchment which had been brought for the purpose harry went ashore with lieutenant hardy and a strong party of seamen for although the local chief had apparently been most friendly the treacherous nature of the malays was well known and fairclough thought it as well to order them to take their cutlasses with them and each man to carry a brace of pistols hidden beneath his jacket  a number of natives assembled on the shore as the boat approached but they seemed to be attracted by curiosity only just as the boat touched the beach the chief came down to meet them attended by a dozen armed followers he invited harry to follow him to his own house where the two messengers were awaiting him they were both men in the prime of lifestrong activelooking fellows harry through his interpreter explained exactly what he wished done  if you carry out your mission well and quickly he said i shall make you a present in addition to what has been agreed upon you will notice the rajahs manner when he reads the letter and tell me when you return whether he appeared to be pleased or not whether he hesitates as to giving me a guarantee and whether in your opinion he means to observe it i shall rely much upon your report  three days passed and then a boat brought the messengers off to the ship  so you have made your journey safely harry said through the interpreter  we met with no trouble by the way this is the answer that the rajah has sent  the letter was a satisfactory one the rajah expressed willingness to receive the officer whom the english lord had sent to him and to guarantee his safety while at his town but said that owing to the troubled state of the country he could not guarantee his safety on the road but would send down an escort of twenty men to guard him on his way up and the same on his return to the coast  and now harry said when the interpreter had read the document tell me what passed  when we said that we were messengers from an english lord on board a ship with great guns we were taken to the rajahs house he took the letter from us and read it then he asked some of those with him what they thought of the matter they answered that they could see no harm in it and perhaps you might bring presents he then asked us how many would come up with you and we told him four soldiers as escort and an interpreter he nodded and then talked in a low voice to those around him and told us to come again that afternoon when a letter would be given us to take to you  do you think that he means treachery harry asked  that we cannot say my lord we have talked as we came down it seems to us that he could have nothing to gain by hindering you but that perhaps he might detain you in order to obtain a ransom for you from the lord of india  harry had already enquired from the chief of the town as to the character of the rajah  he is feared but not liked the chief said he knows that there are those who would prefer that the old family should reign again and he has put many to death whom he has suspected as being favourable to this this is the reason why the tumangong and other chiefs have revolted against him the loss of so much territory has not improved him and in his fits of passion he spares none  what has become of the family of the former rajah harry asked  his wife and child are prisoners in the palace he said their friends are surprised that their lives should have been spared but the rajah is crafty and it is thought that he holds them so that he could if his position became desperate place the young prince on the throne and declare for him in which case some who are now his enemies might come over to his side i am told that except that they are kept prisoners the late rajahs wife and boy are well treated  the account was not satisfactory but it did not shake harrys determination questioning the malays further he found that they had heard at johore rumours that one of the chiefs on the border of pahang was collecting a large force with the intention of attacking the rajah that the people of johore were erecting strong palisades round the town and that the fighting men of the villages round had all been called in for its defence  when is this escort to come down he asked  they started at the same time as we did my lord and will be here by this evening  very well in that case i will land tomorrow morning at daybreak and start at once so that we shall reach johore tomorrow will you hire four men to act as carriers for us  at the time appointed harry went on shore with the malay abdool and four troopers they had put on full uniform and harry had brought with him to shore an assortment of presents similar to those he had given to the tumangong the two messengers and the four natives as carriers were awaiting him and as he went up the beach he was joined by twenty malays with an officer of the rajah who saluted him profoundly the chief of the village was also there and accompanied the party until beyond its boundary  after passing a few plantations they entered a dense forest the road was a mere footway apparently but little used the ground ascended rapidly and when they had gone a short distance some of the malay soldiers went scouting ahead the rest following in absolute silence stopping frequently to listen  it is quite evident abdool harry said in a whisper that what they said at the village is true and these people from johore consider the journey to be a very dangerous one they are evidently expecting a surprise and i am afraid that if we are attacked we shall not be able to place much reliance on them  abdool shook his head  what are we to do sahib if we are attacked  it depends on what these malays do if they make a good fight for it we will fight too if not and we see that resistance is useless we will remain quiet it would be of no use for six men to fight fifty on such ground as this they would creep up and hurl their spears at us and though we might kill some of them they would very soon overpower us  drop back and tell the four troopers that on no account are they to fire unless i give them the order  presently the malays came to a stop and the officer hurried back to harry  we have heard the sound of footsteps in the wood and one of my men says he saw a man running among the trees  it may have been some wild beast harry said there are plenty of them in the wood i hear and your man may have been mistaken in thinking that he saw a human figure and even if it was so it might be some villager who on hearing us has left the path thinking us to be enemies  it may be that the officer said when the words were translated to him but it is more likely that he was posted there to watch the path and that he has gone to tell his band that a party is approaching  even if it were so harry said the band may be only a small one  the officer moved forward and joined his men half an hour later without the slightest warning a shower of spears flew from among the trees followed immediately afterwards by a rush of dark figures several of the malay escort were at once cut down the rest fled at full speed  harry saw that resistance would be hopeless and would only ensure their destruction he therefore called to his followers to remain quiet the four bearers however threw down their burdens and fled at full speed down the path just as a number of malays poured out on either side  they were evidently struck with the appearance of harry and his followers but were about to rush upon them when a chief ran forward and shouted to them to abstain from attacking the strangers then he walked up to harry who was evidently the chief of the party  who are you white man he asked and where are you going  the interpreter replied that they were going on a visit of ceremony to the rajah of johore  we are his enemies the chief said and now you must come with us  this lord the interpreter began but the chief waved his hand for him to be silent  he waited for a quarter of an hour by which time he was joined by that portion of his followers which had pursued the malays many of them carried human heads in their hands and by the number of these harry saw that very few of his native escort could have escaped the chief ordered his men to pick up the packages that had been thrown down by the bearers and then turned off into the forest  after a quarter of an hours walk they arrived at the spot where a stillsmoking fire showed that the band had halted no pause was made however and the party kept on their way and in two hours time reached the foot of a high range of mountains that had been visible from the coast the climb was a severe one but in another hour they came out upon a flat plateau here in a small village a considerable body of men were gathered who hailed the arrival of their comrades with their ghastly triumphs of victory with loud shouts  the chief of the band led his captives to a hut somewhat superior in appearance to the others in front of which stood a man whose bright attire and ornaments showed him to be a chief of importance  who is this white man he asked and these soldiers who are with him  the officer repeated the description that he had received from the interpreter whom he pointed out  why was this white man going to johore he asked  he was sent by the white lord of india my lord  ask him why he was sent  i was sent to johore to ask the rajah if he would grant a trading station to the english  we want no english on our coast the chief said there are the dutch at malaccasome day we will turn them out  so he was bringing presents to johore was he  yes my lord these are the parcels and he beckoned up the men who carried them  these approached and humbly laid them at the rajahs feet  i have to report my lord that there were twenty of johores men with him these we killed  did the white man and his soldiers aid them  no my lord they stood quiet and offered no resistance therefore i brought them to you  you did well you are sure that none of the johore men escaped to carry off the news that we were here  quite certain we have the heads of twenty men and their officer  good i will examine these things put the white man and this malay into a hut and the four soldiers into another  who is this other man who is dressed differently  he is the white officers servant the interpreter said  well he can go with his master then  the four troopers were led off in one direction and harry and the others in another it was a hut roughly constructed of bamboos thatched with broad leaves while the entrance had no door the interpreter did not carry arms those of harry and abdool had been removed  things have turned out badly abdool harry said  very badly sahib i do not like the look of that rajah  nor do i abdool i am convinced that he means mischief and we must get away as soon as we can  have you got your knife with you so have i we must make a way out of the back of this hut  a group of half a dozen malays had taken their seats on the ground at a distance of some fifteen yards from the entrance but had posted no sentries behind it as they were taken in harry noticed that there was a patch of grain and beyond that rose the forest  these knives are no good against bamboo sahib  no i know that but we might cut these rattans which bind them together in the first place dig down with your knife and see if the bamboos are sound underneath they may have rotted there  you and i will stand at the entrance he went on to the interpreter then they cannot see in  bamboos are quite sound sahib  then we must try another way first cut the rattansbut not in a line with the entrance a few feet on one side  the wood was extremely tough and it was half an hour before abdool could cut through them and free three or four of the bamboo poles while he was doing this harry and the interpreter stood talking together apparently watching the movements of the malays  we are going to try and escape harry said will you go with us or remain here they will certainly kill us if they overtake us there is just a chance that they will not kill us if we stay  they will kill us the man said confidently it may not be today because the rajah will be looking over his presents and will be in a good temper but tomorrow they will come in and kris us assuredly i will go with you  when abdool announced that he had cut through the rattans harry joined him telling the interpreter to wait at the entrance till he called him  what next master abdool asked  the next thing will be to pull up the bamboos if you have cut all their lashings this ought not to be very difficult but it will make it easier if we cut the ground away as deep as we can on this side of them  kneeling down they set to work with their knives and after half an hours work they had laid bare the bottoms of four of the bamboos which were sunk two feet into the ground  now abdool we ought to get them up easily enough  with their united strength they pulled up a bamboo replaced it in its position and one by one got the other three up put them in again and lightly filled in the earth  now we can go at a minutes notice harry said at any rate we had better wait till it is dark  the sun had just set when they saw the rajah come out of his hut he gave an order and the four troopers were brought out and placed in a line four natives took their places behind them kris in hand  they are going to murder them harry exclaimed in horror  now abdool there is not a moment to be lost it will be our turn next  their guards had all risen to their feet watching what was going on three of the bamboos were plucked up in a moment this afforded an opening sufficiently large for them to pass through and keeping the hut between them and the guard they made their way through the plantation and dashed into the forest they heard yells of satisfaction in the village and harry had no doubt that the four troopers had been murdered  they ran at full speed through the forest and ten minutes later heard loud shouts of dismay and had no doubt that a party had been sent to take them out to execution and had discovered their escape it was already almost dark under the thick shade of the trees but for half an hour they ran on the malay in advance for he could see any obstacles better than they could the habits and training of his youth having given him experience in such work  for a time they had heard loud shouts behind them these had been useful in enabling them to keep a straight course the malay now turned and struck off at right angles to the line that they had been pursuing  we must keep on for a time he said when they do not overtake us they will scatter through the forest in all directions  for hours they toiled on sometimes at an easy walk sometimes breaking into a run at last the malay admitted that for the time they were safe and they threw themselves down upon the ground  tomorrow he said they will take up the search in earnest and will track our footsteps we had better take to a tree now it will not be safe to stay here  the others cordially agreed as for some time they had heard the roars of wild beasts which abounded in these forests and harry and abdool had run with their open knives in their hands prepared for a sudden attack  the others will have gone back to the village long ago the malay said when they had made themselves as comfortable as they could in the forks of the tree except the men who were guarding us they will not dare venture into the village for they would fear the rajahs anger even more than death from a tiger they will be first in the search tomorrow morning  which way do you wish to go my lord  i have been thinking it over as we came i think that our best plan will be to go on to johore doubtless the road down the coast will be watched how far from johore do you think we are  not very far the malay said we have been going in that direction ever since we first turnednot very straight perhaps but certainly in that direction i think that we cannot be more than five or six miles from the town it lies between the hills we crossed and the higher ones beyond we have been descending a little all the time  i am afraid that johore will not be very pleased to see us arriving empty handed and to learn that the escort he sent us have all been killed still the news that we bring him that his enemies are not far off will be useful to him and we will offer to aid him in the defence of his town if he is attacked at any rate it is a satisfaction to know that we have not very far to go and have got so good a start of the fellows behind us that they are not likely to overtake us before we get there  more than once during the night they heard angry growling at the foot of the tree towards morning there was a scraping sound  that is a leopard sahib the malay said in alarm he is climbing the tree to get at us  abdool was sitting immediately below harry and the latter called to him to come up beside him  mount as high as you can my lord the malay said the trunk is not so rough when you get higher and the beast will find it harder to climb  we shall do better here harry said these two arms nearly opposite to each other are just the thing for us  you go out to the end of one abdool and i will go out to the end of the other we will climb out as far as we can and then he will have to follow us very slowly whichever way he chooses if he goes for you i will follow him if he comes my way you follow him when the bough gets thin he wont be able to turn round and the one behind can give him a sudden stab which will make him leave go his hold  by the time he had finished speaking they were each far out on their respective branches and the leopard was close to the fork it paused a moment looked at the two men and after a moments hesitation began to crawl out towards abdool harry at once made his way back to the trunk and then followed the animal  abdool had gone out as far as he dared and holding on tightly swayed the end of the branch up and down the leopard as it approached him was evidently disconcerted and clung to the bough which was scarcely six inches in diameter at the point it had reached it snarled angrily as it became conscious that it was being followed  harry feeling convinced that it could not turn came fearlessly up to it and then struck his knife into its loin as the blade was but some four inches long he had no hope of striking a vital point  the leopard uttered a roar and tried to turn and strike at him with one of its forepaws but the blade again penetrated to its full depth this time on the other side and with a start it lost its footing clung for a moment to the branch with its forepaws and strove to regain its hold but harry brought his knife down again and again on one of its paws  abdool crawling in quickly struck it under the shoulder and a moment later it released its hold and fell heavily through the foliage to the ground for a time it was heard roaring and then the sound came only at intervals and at an increasing distance  that was a good business abdool harry said as they returned to their former post where the malay rejoined them  it was well done indeed sahib when i heard the beast climbing the tree it seemed to me that as we had no weapons except these little knives he would surely make an end of one of us  the interpreter did not understand mahratti in which abdool and harry always conversed but he said in hindustani  i have seen fights with leopards my lord but even with krises two of my people would hesitate to attack onethey fear them more than tigersbut little did i think that two men with small knives could save their lives from one my blood turned to water as i saw the beast climbing out on that bough and you going out after it  i have done a good deal of tiger and leopard hunting in my time harry said and know that a leopard cannot spring from a bough unless it is a fairly stout onestout enough for it to stand with all its paws upon it  well the day is beginning to break in half an hours time the sun will be up and the wild beasts will have all retired to their lairs i hope we shall see no more of them it is all very well to fight under such advantages but on foot were a tiger hiding near a path he would be sure to have one of us as we went along our knives would not do more than tickle him    chapter 12 the defence of johore   half an hour later the little party were on their way they were stiff at first from passing the night in a sitting attitude but it was not long before they were able to break into a trot this they kept up for an hour then to their great satisfaction the forest abruptly ceased and they saw at a distance of about a mile and a half the little town of johore lying in cultivated fields that extended to the edge of the forest  they broke into a walk for a short distance and then continued at their former pace for they could not tell how close their pursuers might be behind them it was not long before they saw men at work in the fields the interpreter shouted to them that a party of the enemy were not far behind and throwing down their tools they also made for the town spreading the alarm as they went fresh and fleet footed they arrived some minutes before harrys party and as these entered the place they found the whole population in the street the men armed with spears and krises  asking the way they soon reached the rajahs palace which consisted of a central house round which a number of huts were built the whole surrounded by a stone wall some eight feet high the rajah when they arrived was questioning some of his people as to the cause of this sudden alarm he was greatly surprised at the sight of harry in his full uniform attended only by one soldier and a native  how comes it that you arrive like this he asked angrily  explain what has happened harry said to the interpreter  the rajahs brow darkened as he heard how the escort he had sent down had been slain to a man on the previous day but his excitement increased when told that a strong force of his enemy was gathered within a few miles of the town and that an assault might be immediately expected  will you tell the rajah that i am used to warfare and shall be glad to assist him to the best of my power in the defence of his town  how many men were there the rajah asked  i should think there were a couple of thousand harry replied some of them had matchlocks but the greater part of them only spear and kris  and we have not more than five hundred the rajah said we cannot hope to resist them what think you  i will at once go round the town and see harry said it may be that being accustomed to war i can suggest some means of so strengthening the defences that we may hold them against the enemy  the rajah having heard many tales of the fighting powers of the whites said  i will go with you i would defend the place if i could for if johore were lost i should be but a fugitive all within it would be killed and i should have to beg an asylum from those over whom i was once master  calling a party of his men to follow him the rajah accompanied harry to the edge of the town it was already surrounded by a palisade but this was of no great strength and its circumference was fully a mile and a half  tell the rajah that we could make a first defence here but his fighting men are not numerous enough to hold so large a circuit against four times their number i should suggest that the whole population should be set to work to build another palisade much nearer to the palace all the women and children should be sent inside this all the provisions in the town be taken into the palace enclosure and a large supply of water stored there  as soon as the new palisade is finished all who can be spared from its defence should set to work to throw up a bank of earth against the wall and upon this the fighting men can take their places and should be able to defend the palace against any assault  the rajah listened attentively to the interpreter  the english officers words are good he said but we have no timber for the palisades that he speaks of  tell the rajah harry said when this was interpreted to him that there is plenty of wood and bamboos in the huts that stand outside the line of the new palisade and that if we pull these down we can use the materials moreover in any case it would be well to level these houses for if the enemy fired them it would be almost certain to fire the houses inside the palisade  the rajahs face brightened the tone of assurance in which harry spoke reassured him and he said to the interpreter  tell the officer that my people shall do just as he tells them if he will point out where the defence must be erected  harry was not long in fixing upon the line for the entrenchments it was some two hundred yards in diameter and at the rajahs orders the whole of the men and women of the town set to work to pull down the huts standing within fifty or sixty yards of this this was the work of a couple of hours and the materials were carried up to the line the stronger timbers were first planted in holes dug for them and the intervals between these were filled with bamboo poles on the inside face other bamboos were lashed with rattans across them as fast as these were used more houses were pulled down until the defence was completed the crossbars being some nine inches apart  this work performed the men women and children brought up what provisions they had and their most precious belongings these were carried inside the wall of the palace it was two oclock before the work was finished and there was then a rest for half an hour  then all were set to work to dig a trench three feet deep with perpendicular sides at a distance of two feet from the palisade a large store of bamboos that had been too slender for use in the palisade were sharpened and cut into lengths of two feet and these were planted thickly in the bottom of the trench others five feet long were sharpened and then thrust through the interstices between the upright bamboos the ends being fixed firmly in the ground inside while the sharpened points projected like a row of bayonets at a height of some two feet above the edge of the ditch  it was nightfall before the work was finished the rajah had himself been all the time upon the spot and was delighted when he saw how formidable was the obstacle that had been raised one small entrance alone had been left and through this all the women and children now passed and lay down in the space between the new palisade and the wall of the palace  the men were ordered to take post behind the stockade and a number of boys were sent out to act as scouts and give notice if an enemy approached the rajah however was of opinion that as the enemy would know that the alarm would have been given by the fugitives on their arrival and that the inhabitants would be on their guard they would not attack till daylight  harry had at his invitation gone up at midnight to his house and partaken of food which was also sent out to abdool and the interpreter the rajah would have continued the work all through the night had not harry dissuaded him saying that after six hours sleep everyone would work better  at one oclock a horn was sounded and with the exception of a few men left at the outer palisade all set to work again the men were employed in digging a trench a foot in depth inside the inner palisade throwing up the earth in front of them so as to lie protected from arrows and spears until it was time for them to rise to their feet to repel an actual assault the women and children filled baskets with the earth thrown from the outer trench on the previous day and carried it inside the wall where by five oclock a bank two feet high had been raised and on this a platform of bamboos three feet high and eighteen inches wide was erected  the work had scarcely been finished when a horn was sounded outside the town and the boys came running in while the men ran down to the outer palisade as day broke great numbers of dark figures were seen making their way through the fields on three sides of the town  the band we saw must have been joined by another there are certainly more than two thousand men there they will undoubtedly carry the outer palisade many of our men will be killed and many others will be unable to join us here i think that it will be much better to rely on this defence alone  having now great confidence in harrys judgment the rajah at once ordered a horn to be sounded and in a short time the whole of the men were assembled in their stronghold and the entrance closed by bamboos for which holes had been already dug close together then short lengths were lashed across them and they were further strengthened by a bank of earth piled against them  before this was quite finished yells of triumph were heard as the enemy finding the palisade unguarded poured in expecting to find that the inhabitants had fled at the news of their approach they paused however in surprise at seeing another line of defence outside the palace quickly the numbers increased until a thick line of dark figures was gathered at the edge of the cleared space  inside the defence all was quiet not a man showed himself doubtful whether the town had not been entirely evacuated the malays paused for some little time while some of the chiefs gathered together in consultation then a few of the men advanced with the evident intention of examining the defences  they were allowed to approach within ten yards of the ditch when a shower of arrows flew from the openings in the palisade and two only of the malays fled back to their companions the fall of the others provoked wild yells of anger a horn sounded and the assailants rushed upon them from all sides when within a few yards of the ditch they hurled their spears and shot a cloud of arrows a large proportion were stopped by the bamboos but such as passed through flew harmlessly over the heads of the defenders who replied with a far more deadly shower of arrows  leaping over those who had fallen the enemy dashed forward those in front endeavoured to check their course on arriving at the edge of the ditch but they were forced in by the pressure of those behind and the long spears of the defenders gleamed out through the openings of the bamboos inflicting terrible damage  in vain the assailants endeavoured to climb out of the ditch the bayonetlike line of bamboos checked them and the arrows of the concealed defenders told with terrible effect on the struggling mass at last at many points the ditch was literally filled with dead and the assailants were enabled to leap upon the line of bamboos which had so long checked their passage  the advantage was but slight the slippery poles were some six inches apart and slanting as they did afforded so poor a foothold that the malays were forced to stand between them on the narrow ledge between the palisading and the ditch here they thrust their spears between the palisade but these were wrenched from their hands and scores fell from the blows of kris spear and arrow until at last their leaders and chiefs seeing how terrible was the slaughter and how impossible it was to climb the bamboo fence called their men off and they fell back pursued by exulting cries from the women who were standing on the platform behind the wall of the palace watching the conflict and by the yells of the defenders of the stockade  of these but few had fallen while some five hundred of the assailants had perished the rajah was almost beside himself with joy at this crushing defeat of his enemy  i do not suppose it is over yet rajah harry said through his interpreter there are still some five times our number and they will surely not retire without endeavouring to avenge their defeat but i hardly think they will attack the stockade again possibly they will try fire next time and it will be harder to fight that than to keep men at bay  the rajah looked serious  yes he said they cannot return to their homes and say that they have left five hundred dead behind them what do you advise  they will hardly attack again today rajah therefore i shall have time to think it over but at present it seems to me that our only course is to shoot down as many of those who bring up firebrands as possible we have still a number of long bamboos left and with these we might thrust away any burning faggots that might be cast against the palisade  the rajah nodded  that might be done he said and with success no doubt  with success at many points rajah but if they succeed at only one point in establishing a big fire against the stockade we must retire within the wall they cannot burn us out there except at the gate and against that we must pile up earth and stones but i should certainly recommend that the roofs of all the buildings inside should be taken off unless indeed you have sufficient hides to cover them still we need not do that until we are driven inside the wall it takes but a short time to take off the broad leaves with which the roofs are covered  during the fight harry had taken no active part in the conflict he had divided the circle into three and had taken charge of one division abdool taking another and the rajah a third they had each encouraged the men under them and had gone where the pressure of the attack was most severe  on leaving the rajah harry joined abdool  they will try again abdool but i dont think they will try to carry the stockade by assault again  they will try fire sahib  that is just what i am afraid of the archers will shoot down a good many of them but in such numbers as they are this will make little difference and we must calculate that at at least a dozen spots they will place blazing faggots against the palisade  abdool nodded  i have been telling the rajah harry went on that the men must provide themselves with long bamboos which they can thrust through the openings in the stockade and push the faggots away but even if we do so we must calculate upon the enemy succeeding in some places in setting the palisades on fire  that would be very serious but of course we should go in behind the wall  i do not want to do that as long as we can possibly stay here i think that when night comes we ought to make a sortie  but are we not too few sahib  too few to defeat them abdool but not too few to beat them up you see the wind always blows in the evening up from the sea i noticed it last night it was quite strong what i should propose would be to pull up enough bamboos for four men to go out together on the side facing the wind two hundred men should first sally out remaining as they do so close to the ditch when all are ready they should crawl across the cleared ground and then at a signal attack the enemy who taken by surprise would be sure to give way at first  as they attack fifty men with torches should rush out and follow them and set fire to as many huts as they can as soon as they had done their work all should run back when the signal is given  there will be two advantages in the first place the sudden attack will disconcert the enemy and render them less willing to expose their lives by storming a place so desperately held in the second place the wind will carry the flame over the whole town and i hope the burning fragrants will carry the flames over all the fields where the crops are dry thus causing them much more difficulty in obtaining dry wood for faggots and they will be exposed to our arrows much longer before they throw them against the stockade  it would be excellent sahib but do you think the men would go  just at the present moment they would do anything they are half wild with excitement and triumph  harry presently went with the interpreter to the rajahs house  i have a plan to propose to you he said that will render it much more difficult for the enemy to set fire to the stockade and he then explained his scheme  the rajahs eyes glistened with excitement  nothing could be better he said and there is but one fear and that is that the enemy will follow us so hotly that they will enter through the breach before we can close it  i have thought of that harry said and the order must be that when the signal is given the men must throw down their torches and then each man must run not for the hole in the stockade but to the nearest point and keep along outside the ditch and enter by it in that way the point at which they entered would not be known and moreover they would be able to enter more rapidly and with much less confusion than if they all arrived together in a crowd a party would of course be left at the breach when they sally out and the moment the last man entered would replace and lash the bamboos in their position  if however we are hotly pursued you and i with your own guards should remain outside and keep them at bay until all the bamboos but one are replaced this will leave an opening sufficient for one man and we must fall back fighting they certainly would not venture to follow us through so narrow a passage  two hundred and fifty of the men were brought inside the wall and the rajah explained to them the duty upon which they would be employed he told off fifty of them as torch bearers explained to all carefully the plan harry had devised gave strict orders that no sound whatever must be made until they reached the houses and at harrys request impressed upon them the absolute necessity for not allowing their ardour to carry them too far but that torches must be thrown down and everyone run back as soon as the horn sounded  there was no doubt that the order was a satisfactory one the men raised their krises and spears and shouted with joy in their present mood nothing could please them more than the thought of an attack upon their assailants  all remained quiet on both sides until darkness fell then the crash of falling huts showed that the enemy intended to use fire and were about to begin the work of making faggots  they will attack an hour before daybreak the rajah said or may perhaps wait till the sun is up for in the daylight those who carried the torches would not be so conspicuous but would advance in the midst of their whole force  at what time are they likely to sleep  many will sleep early he said in readiness for the fight others will sit up and talk all night but those who intend to sleep will probably do so in a couple of hours  do you think that they are likely to place guards  no they will not dream that we should have the boldness to attack them  let us give them three hours harry said the sea wind will be blowing strongly then  the greater portion of the men who were to remain behind were to be stationed on the side on which the sortie was to be made so as to cover the retreat of the others by showers of arrows the rajahs principal officer was placed in command here his orders were that if the enemy came on too strongly he was to issue out with a hundred men and aid the party to beat back their assailants however harry did not think it likely that this would be the case the malays would be scattered all over the townsome perhaps even beyond the outer palisadesand before they could assemble in force the party ought to be safe within the palisade again  just before ten the two hundred men who were to make the attack sallied out they were led by the rajah while harry was to lead the firing party he chose this part because he would not be able to crawl across the open space as noiselessly as the malays could do  during the day a number of hides had been hung on the palisades so that the enemy should not notice that a gathering of men with torches was assembled there and in order that the light might not be conspicuous at this spot fires had been lighted at other points in order to give the impression that the defenders were holding themselves in readiness to repel another attack the bamboos had been removed ten minutes before the party issued out so noiseless was their tread that harry though close to the entrance could not hear it and when he looked out as soon as the last man had passed he could neither see nor hear anything the men had all thrown themselves on the ground as soon as they had passed out and were crawling forward without a sound being audible  harry and abdool had both armed themselves with a kris and spear behind them were the torch bearers arranged four abreast  it seemed an age before the sound of a horn rose in the air instantly they dashed through the opening followed by the men and at full speed crossed the cleared ground already the sound of shouts violent yells and the clashing of blades showed that the rajahs men were at work  scattering as they reached the houses the torch bearers ran from hut to hut pausing for a few seconds at each till the flame had gained a fair hold in less than a minute sixty or seventy houses were in flames harry had the man with the horn with him and as soon as he saw that the work was fairly done he ordered the signal to be blown the torches were thrown down and their bearers ran back at full speed and half a minute later the rajahs men poured out from the town there was no pursuit and the whole band reentered the stockade before with yells of fury numbers of the enemy ran forward  as soon as they did so arrows began to fly fast from the stockade and knowing that they could effect nothing without means of breaking through the malays retired as rapidly as they had advanced  short as was the interval that had elapsed since the first signal was given the town was at the point where the attack was made a sheet of flame which was spreading rapidly on either hand the hubbub among the enemy was tremendous upwards of a hundred had been killed by the rajahs partyfor the most part before they could offer any resistanceand not more than five or six of their assailants had received severe wounds  loud rose the shouts of exultation from the defenders as the fire spread with everincreasing rapidity flakes of fire driven by a strong wind started the flames in a score of places far ahead of the main conflagration and in half an hour only red embers and flickering timbers showed where johore had stood beyond however there were sheets of flame where the crops had been dry and ready for cutting and the garrison felt that their assailants would have to go a long distance to gather materials for endeavouring to burn them out  while the position had been surrounded by a zone of fire the rajah had at harrys suggestion sent the whole of the men and women to cast earth over the dead piled at four or five points so thickly in the ditch  if the matter is delayed another day he said the air will be so poisoned that it will be wellnigh impossible to exist here  the rajah admitted this but urged that his men would want to cut off the heads of their fallen enemies this being the general custom among the malays  it may be so rajah but it could not be carried out here without great danger our own lives depend upon getting them quickly buried we have no such custom of cutting off heads in our country but that is no affair of mine but the bodies now lie in what is in fact a grave and a few hours labour would be the means of saving the town from a pestilence later on  when the enemy depart i should advise you to build a great mound of earth over the trench it will be a record of your grand defence and by placing a strong stockade along the top you would strengthen your position greatly i should recommend you in that case to clear the space within it as far as the wall of all houses and to build the town entirely outside it  there was great dissatisfaction among the natives at being prevented from taking what seemed to them their natural trophies but when the rajah informed them that the order was given in consequence of the white officers advice they set about the work readily and before morning the dead were all hidden from sight by a deep layer of earth  the next day passed without incident at nightfall a sharp lookout was kept not only on the palisade but from the top of the rajahs house it was thought that the enemy of whom considerable numbers had been seen going into the forest would bring up the faggots as closely as possible before lighting them still it would be necessary to carry brands for that purpose and now that the ground was cleared of huts some at least of these brands could be seen even if carefully hidden  with the exception of the guards all slept during the day as it was necessary that they should be vigilant at night for the enemy might on this occasion approach at an earlier hour hoping to find the garrison unprepared harry and abdool paced round and round on the platform of the wall but although a few fires burned among the fields no glimmer of light could be seen where the town had stood  i wish i knew what they were up to abdool harry said about midnight i dont like this silence  perhaps they have gone away sahib  no i can hardly think that i believe we shall have another attack before morning they may bring ladders with them for climbing the palisade they may try fire but i am convinced that they will do something  the position is not so strong as it was if we had had more bamboos i should have set our men to dig another ditch and defend it like the first but they are all used up now i wish we had some rockets so that we could send up one from time to time and see what they are doing  another hour passed and some of the malays declared that they could hear a sound as of many men moving harry listened in vain but he knew that the malays senses were much keener than his own  he went at once to the rajah the chief had been up till midnight and then retired leaving orders that he was to be called directly an alarm of any sort was given he was seated with two or three of his councillors talking when harry with the interpreter entered  your people say they hear sounds rajah i can hear nothing myself but i know their hearing is keener than mine i am uneasy for even they cannot see the faintest glow that would tell that a fire is being brought up in my opinion we had better leave only two hundred men at the palisade and bring the rest in here we can lead them out at once if any point is hotly attacked and it would prevent confusion if the stockade were suddenly forced the enemy may be bringing up hundreds of ladders and in the darkness may get up close before they are noticed  do as you think best the rajah said and at once went out and sent officers to bring in three hundred of the men and also at harrys suggestion to tell the others that when the rajahs horn sounded all were to leave the stockade and make at once for the entrance through the wall  another half hour passed even harry was conscious now that there was a low dull sound in the air  i cannot think what they are doing the rajah who was now standing on the wall close to the gate said to harry however numerous they may be they should have moved as noiselessly as we did when we went out to attack them  i dont think that it will be long before we know now rajah  he had scarcely spoken when there was a loud shout from the palisade in front of them it was on this side that the men had been posted so thickly as it was of all things necessary to defend this to the last in order to enable those at other points to make their way to the gate the shout of alarm was followed almost instantly by the sound of a horn and immediately a tremendous yell resounded on all sides  it was answered by the shouts of the garrison and a moment later a score of balls composed of matting dipped in oil or resinous gum were thrown flaming over the palisades these had been prepared the previous day and the men charged with throwing them had each an earthenware pot containing glowing charcoal beside them their light showed groups of men twenty or thirty strong advancing within twenty yards of the palisade  they are carrying trees to batter down the stockade rajah said harry  behind the carrying parties was a dense crowd of malays who rushed forward as soon as the fireballs fell hurling their spears and shooting their arrows to which the defenders replied vigorously  the stockade will not stand a moment against those trees he continued tis best to call the men in at once  the rajah ordered the native beside him to sound his horn and in two or three minutes the men poured in at the entrance as soon as the last had come in the bamboos were put in the holes prepared for them with some rattans twined between them scores of men then set to work bringing up the earth and stones that had been piled close at hand  in the meantime the three hundred men on the walls kept up a shower of arrows on the enemy the battering rams which consisted of trees stripped of their branches and some forty feet long and ten inches thick did their work and by the time the entrance was secure the malays poured in with exultant shouts  a large supply of the fireballs had been placed on the platforms and as these were lighted and thrown down the assailants were exposed to a deadly shower of arrows as they rushed forward at this moment the rajahs servant brought up four doublebarrelled guns  they are loaded the chief said as he handed one of these to harry  how long is it since they were fired the latter asked  it is three months since i last went out shooting the rajah replied  harry at once proceeded to draw the charges  i should advise you to do the same rajah a gun that has not been fired for three months is not likely to carry straight and is more dangerous to its owner than to an enemy  the rajah called up two of his men and one of these at once drew the charges of the guns and reloaded them from the powder horn and bag of bullets the servants had brought  the enemy did not press their attack but retired behind the palisades and from this shelter began to shoot their arrows fast while a few matchlock men also replied  it would be as well rajah to order all your men to sit down there is no use in their exposing themselves to the arrows and they are only wasting their own we must wait now to see what their next move will be fire will be of no use to them now and the wall will take some battering before it gives way and brave as the men may be they could not work the battering rams under the shower of spears and arrows that would be poured upon them  i should send the greater part of your men down to get off the roofs of the huts those up here must place a man or two on watch at each side and throw a fireball occasionally  in a few moments the enemy ceased shooting their arrows for the light of the fireballs showed them that the garrison was in shelter  there is no occasion for you to stay here any longer rajah i will look after matters until morning and will send to you as soon as there is any stir outside  in half an hour the huts were stripped of their most combustible material this was heaped up under the platforms where it would be safe from falling arrows the women drew pots of water from the well and a hundred men were then left in the courtyard with orders to pull up or stamp out any flaming arrows that might fall but as the time went on it was evident that the assailants had not thought of providing themselves with the materials requisite and the greater part of the garrison lay down quietly and slept  harry had waited until he saw the work in the courtyard completed and then with the interpreter entered the rajahs house the room he generally used was empty some lamps were burning there and he laid himself down on a divan while the malay curled himself up on the floor  harry had slept but a short time when he was awakened by a light touch on his shoulder and springing up saw a woman with a boy some six years old standing beside him the woman placed her finger on her lips imploringly harry at once roused the interpreter through him the woman explained that she was the widow of the late rajah and that her son was the lawful heir to the throne  i have come to you brave white lord she said to ask you if your people will grant us protection  that would be impossible harry replied my people are busy with their own wars in india and even were they not so occupied they could not interfere in a domestic quarrel between the malay chiefs  why are you fighting here then  i am fighting in my own quarrel i was attacked and my followers killed by the rajah now assailing this place i myself should have been murdered had i not made my escape and should certainly be killed by him if he were victorious  i think it likely that before very long there may be an english trading station at singapore and if you and your son were to go there you would certainly be well received i shall of course relate your story which i have already heard on my return to calcutta and on my explaining that your son is entitled to the throne of johore it may be that some sum would be granted for your maintenance for it may well be that in time the throne may again become vacant and that the people tired of these constant wars will unite to accept your son as rajah i may tell you that i am sure the tumangong will grant us a trading station and possibly the whole island but as he is not the rajah of johore although at present independent of him we should like to have his assent to the cession it is for this purpose i have come here although up to the present time i have not said anything about it to the rajah as we have both been much too busy to talk of such matters  it may be years before the english come to singapore but my report will certainly be noted and assuredly an asylum would be granted you and you would be kindly received i can say no more than that  thanks my lord i could have hoped for no more forgive me for having thus disturbed you but as all in the house save ourselves are asleep i thought that it was an opportunity that would not occur again i will teach my son that the english are his friends and should aught happen to me and should he ever become rajah here he will act as their friend also  when this had been interpreted to harry she and the boy left the room as noiselessly as they had entered harry was well pleased with the interview probably the present man would when the result of this struggle became known regain much of the power he had lost assuredly as long as he remained rajah he would now be ready to grant anything asked for and as singapore was virtually lost to him his assent would be given without hesitation if on the other hand he were dethroned or died it was likely that this boy would in time become rajah and in view of this possibility doubtless the governor would order that if at any time he and his mother arrived at singapore they should be well received    chapter 13 the break up of the monsoon   the night and early morning passed quietly the chatter of many voices showed that a portion at any rate of the assailants were beyond the stockade but it was not until nine oclock that numerous parties were seen coming from the forest  i suppose they have been making ladders all night harry said to abdool who was with him on the wall from which owing to the fact that the house stood on a rising knoll of ground which commanded a good view over the stockade the assailants could be seen  well i have no doubt we shall be able to beat them off we have as many men as we want for the circuit of the walls and while we shall be partly sheltered they will have to advance in the open  the malays had indeed been busy since daybreak in manufacturing arrows from thin reeds and bamboos used in the construction of the huts demolished on the previous evening tipping them with chips of stone and winging them with feathers of which plenty were found in the houses and scattered about the yard all felt that this would be the decisive attack and that the enemy after one more repulse would draw off that the repulse would be given all felt confident already the slaughter of their assailants had been very great while very few of their own number had fallen  an hour later large parties of the enemy advanced to the stockade this they did unmolested as the distance was too great for anything like certainty of aim the rajah again took his place by harrys side presently at the sound of a horn a great flight of arrows rose high in the air from behind the stockade  they are fire arrows the rajah exclaimed i will send a hundred men down to help the women to extinguish them and he himself descended an officer following with the men  the women were all seated close to the platforms and as the arrows came raining down they ran out being joined by the rajah and his men had the leafy roofs remained in their place the whole would have been in a blaze in two or three minutes as it was the vast proportion of the arrows stuck in the earth and burnt themselves out while the few that fell among the debris that had not been cleared away were extinguished immediately for two or three minutes the showers of arrows continued and then ceased as to the surprise of the assailants there were no indications of the palace being on fire  then the signal was given for the attack and exasperated by the failure of the plan they had relied upon as being certain to cause a panic the malays with loud shouts rushed forward a large number of them carried ladders and in spite of the many who fell under the arrows of the defenders the ladders were soon planted against the walls and the malays swarmed up on all sides  a desperate struggle took place some of the ladders were high enough to project above the wall these with the men upon them were thrown back on others the malays as they climbed up were met by the spears of the defenders or as their heads rose above the walls with the deadly kris their leaders moved about among the throng below urging the men forward and harry seeing that things were going on well all round took the guns from the hands of the soldier who attended him and directed his aim against these  three fell to his first shots as the soldier handed them to him reloaded his eye caught a group of chiefs behind whom stood what was evidently a picked body of men in the midst of the group was the rajah to whom harry had recently been a prisoner with a feeling of deep satisfaction that his hand should avenge the murder of his four troopers harry levelled his gun between two of the defenders of the wall took a steady aim and fired  illustration without a cry the rajah fell back shot through the head  as the chief was but some twentyfive yards away there was little fear of his missing and without a cry the rajah fell back shot through the head a yell of consternation rose from those around him two more shots then rang out and two more chiefs fell  the others shouted to their men and a furious rush forward was made harry snatched up a spear lying by the side of a native who had fallen shouted to the rajahs guard of twenty menwho were in the yard below as a reserve in case the enemy gained a footing at any point of the wallto come up and then joined in the fight  the assailants fought with such fury that for a time the issue was doubtful several times three or four succeeded in throwing themselves over the wall but only to be cut down before they could be joined by others at last the malays drew off amid the exultant shouts of the defenders  in a short time the attack became more feeble at all points the news of the death of their leader had doubtless spread and its effect was aided by several other chiefs falling under harrys fire and ere long not one of their followers remained inside the palisade half an hour later the lookout from the top of the rajahs house shouted that the whole of the assailants were retiring in a body towards the forest  excited by their victory the rajahs troops would have sallied out in pursuit but harry dissuaded him from permitting it  they must have lost altogether over a thousand of their men but they are still vastly more numerous than your people and nothing would suit them better than that you should follow them and give them a chance of avenging the loss they have suffered  but the rajah will come again he will never remain quiet under the disgrace  he will trouble you no more harry said i shot him myself and six or seven of his principal chiefs  you are indeed my friend the rajah exclaimed earnestly when the words were translated to him then there is a hope that i may have peace the death of the rajah and of so many of the chiefs that have joined him will lead to quarrels and disputes and the confederacy formed against me will break up and while fighting among themselves they will not think of attacking again a place that has proved so fatal to them  the rajah had some difficulty in allaying the enthusiasm of his men but he repeated what harry had said to him and added that since it was entirely due to their white guest that they had repulsed the attack there could be no doubt that his advice must now be attended to since he had shown himself a master in war  be content he said wherever our language is spoken the malays will tell the story of how three thousand men were defeated by five hundred and it will be said that the men of johore surpassed in bravery everything that has been told of the deeds of their fathers there is no fear of the enemy returning here the rajah and many of his chiefs have fallen by the hand of our white friend henceforth for many years you will be able to rest in peace  in a month you will have rebuilt the houses and sown again the fields that have been burnt after that we shall have leisure and a treble stockade shall be built stronger and firmer than that into which they forced an entry your first task must be to carry the bodies of our enemies far out beyond the town where their skeletons will act as a warning as to what welcome johore gives to its foes a present of money will be given to each man this afternoon to help him to rebuild his house and make good the damages that he has suffered  the interpreter had rapidly translated the speech to harry as it went on and as the rajah ended and the applause that greeted him subsided harry said a few words to the interpreter which he repeated to the rajah the latter held up his hand to show that he had more to say  my white friend warns me that for a day or two we must not leave the town it may be that the enemy have halted near the edge of the forest in the hope of taking us unawares this however can only be for a day or two at most for i have no doubt that the provisions they brought with them are by now exhausted and if they stop in the forest they will perish from hunger therefore let no one go beyond the town for two days a watch shall be kept on the roof of my house and if any of the enemy make their appearance in the forest a horn will summon all to retire within the walls  there was feasting that night at the rajahs house all his officers and men of importance were present sacks of rice and other grain were distributed among the soldiers and women some buffaloes that had been driven inside the wall to serve as food should the siege prove a long one were also killed and cut up and very large jars containing the fermented juice of the pineapple and other fruits were served out  during the day the breaches in the palisades had all been repaired and at night the whole population were told to remain within its shelter while numerous guards were posted by the rajah while the meal at the rajahs was going on a party of native musicians played and sang the malays being very fond of music  harry sat at the rajahs right hand and was the subject of unbounded praise and admiration among the company speaker after speaker rose and addressed him and afterwards the interpreter said a few words to them in his name thanking them for the goodwill they had shown and praising them highly not only for their bravery but especially for the manner in which they had carried out the orders given to them the proceedings did not terminate until a very late hour and harry was heartily glad when at last he could retire to rest  in the morning the rajah said to him  now my friend you have not told me why you have come here we have been so busy that we have not spoken on other subjects save the war the message you sent up to me was that you came from the great white lord of calcutta and desired to see me you may be sure that whatever you desire of me shall be granted for were it not for your coming i should now be a hunted fugitive and my people slain  it is not much that i desire rajah the tumangong is willing to grant to us a trading station on the island of singapore and possibly we may acquire from him the whole island but we are aware that he is not the rightful lord of the island and it may be that in time you may recover possession of all johore thus then i come to you to ask you if you are willing to consent to this privilege being granted to us which assuredly will benefit your kingdom by providing a market close to you at which you can barter your produce for goods that you require with us or with native traders from the east at present we are not in a position to plant this trading station in singapore being engaged in serious wars in india and it may be a considerable time before things have so settled down that we can do so i have therefore only to ask your assent to our arrangement with the tumangong whenever it can be carried out and we shall certainly be willing to recognize your authority by a gift of money  i willingly consent the rajah said it is indeed but a small thing so long as i live i shall be ready to enter into any treaty with you and doubtless my successor whoever he may be knowing what you have done for us and our state will also agree  it was not indeed until the year 1819 that the british took possession of the island paying sixty thousand dollars to the tumangong shortly after they had settled there the young prince who had escaped from johore came down there he was awarded a pension and at the death of the rajah was placed on the throne by the british to the general satisfaction of the inhabitants  the next day a number of men came in from villages scattered among the hills who had not heard of the approach of the enemy until too late to enter the town and take part in its defence by this time scouts had penetrated far into the forest and brought back news that although there were many dead there there were no signs of the enemy the work therefore of rebuilding the town was commenced every available man of the garrison and those who had come in being engaged in cutting wood and bringing it in  in the course of the next day or two several chiefs whose attitude had before been threatening came or sent members of their families to congratulate the rajah upon the defeat that he had inflicted upon his enemies and to assure him of their loyalty to his rule  harry had stayed on at the earnest request of the rajah but he now declared that he must return to the coast the rajahs approval of the cession of a trading port and of the island itself was written both in the malay and the english languages and signed by the chief copies were also made and signed by harry to be kept in the palace in order that on any future occasion they could be consulted  a great number of presents of krises and other articles of malayan manufacture were offered to harry but he excused himself from accepting them saying that in the first place it was not customary for commissioners of the governor to accept presents and in the second that being constantly employed on service he had no place where these could be deposited during his long absences  on the third morning after the retreat of the enemy harry started with his two companions for the coast attended by an escort of twenty men of the rajahs own guard commanded by a high officer there was now no fear of molestation but the escort was sent as a mark of honour starting early they reached the coast town in the afternoon  they were received with great joy by the inhabitants who had been in a state of abject terror a runner who was the bearer of a message to the rajah from the headman had left on the morning after harrys party had started and had returned with the news that he had found the headless bodies of all the escort but had seen no traces of the white man nor his followers who had doubtless all been carried off by the enemy the news caused terrible consternation as it was thought that the town might be attacked at any moment those of the inhabitants who possessed canoes took to them and paddled away down the coast the others fled to the mountains  finding however from scouts who had been left that four days had passed without the appearance of the enemy most of them had returned on the evening before harry arrived there on hearing from his escort of the defeat of the invaders and their enormous loss the most lively joy was manifested and harry was treated with almost reverential respect the men of the escort agreeing that it was solely due to him that the victory had been gained he made however but a very short stay in the village and the headman at once ordered the largest canoe to be prepared this was decorated with flowers and flags and manned by twenty rowers who as soon as harry and his two companions took their seats in it rowed off to the brig  welcome back lindsay fairclough shouted as the canoe approached we could hardly believe our eyes when we saw you come down to the canoe we have been in a terrible fright about you the natives brought off news that the escort that had been sent down to take you to johore were every one killed and that as there were no signs of any of your party it was certain that you had been carried off we sent a boat ashore every morning armed to the teeth but they reported that the place was almost entirely deserted and the two or three men left there said that no news whatever had been received of you  by this time harry had gained the deck  where is your escort fairclough asked  i am sorry to say that they were all murdered however my story is a long one and although the rajah sent down some food with the escort he gave me i am desperately thirsty and will tell you all that happened when i have wetted my whistle  fairclough told hardy to come with them below and harrys story was told in full over sundry cups of tea which harry preferred to stronger beverages  that was an adventure indeed fairclough said when harry had brought his story to an end i would have given anything to have been with you in that siege i own i should not have cared about being a prisoner in that fellows camp especially as you were disarmed and could not even make a fight for it that affair with the leopard would have been more to my taste though if i had been in your place with nothing but your knife and abdools i doubt whether i should have come out of it as well as you did but the other business was splendid and those malays of the rajahs must have fought well indeed to beat off a force six times their own strength  the great point is that i have obtained his ratification of the tumangongs grant whenever it may be made  that is satisfactory of course but it would not have to my mind anything like the importance of your series of adventures which will be something to think over all your life i wish i had been there with my crew to have backed you up though i am afraid that most of them would have shared the fate of your malay escort in that sudden attack in the forest  yes with all their pluck they could scarcely have repulsed such a sudden onslaught though certainly the killing would not all have been on one side i am glad indeed that abdool also came safely out of it as i should have missed him fearfully  the interpreter showed himself a good man and i hope that lord mornington will when i report his conduct make him a handsome present if he had not got away with me it is hardly likely i should ever have found my way to johore and if i had done so i could not have explained to the rajah that he was going to be attacked or have got him to erect the stockade that was the main cause of our success in fact he would probably in his anger at the slaughter of his escort have ordered me to be executed on the spot as it was he did not take either that or the loss of his presents greatly to heart  you saved his kingdom for him there is no doubt it is not likely that he would ever have ventured to defend himself had it not been for the confidence that he felt in you and in the steps you took  no he told me himself that he would have taken flight at once and in that case his kingdom would have been lost and he himself sooner or later hunted down  and now i suppose we can start as soon as we like  certainly the sooner the better i shall be very glad to be back again for there is no saying what is going on there assuredly the friendship of the mahrattas cannot be relied upon i know that we are not likely to make any fresh move except in self defence until mysore is completely pacified and a firm government established still there is never any saying what will happen having been in the thick of the mahratta business all along i should not like to be out of it now  well we will get up anchor at daybreak tomorrow  all on board were glad when the news that they were to sail for calcutta the next morning was circulated through the ship to the crew the voyage had been a monotonous one the weather having been uniformly fine since they started and they had had no adventures such as they had hoped for with hostile natives  nothing was talked of that night between decks but harrys story which had been told by lieutenant hardy to the midshipmen who had retailed it to the petty officers and it had rapidly spread abdool and the interpreter were made as much of as was possible considering that neither could understand english and deep were the expressions of regret that none of the sailors had taken part in so tough a fight  by the time the sun was up next morning the vessel was under weigh and with light breezes sailed round singapore and then headed northwest the winds as before were light and as the northeast monsoon was still blowing the rate of progress was slow  i wish we could have got into the hooghly fairclough said as he walked impatiently up and down the quarterdeck before the monsoon broke but i dont see much chance of it it generally changes about the middle of april and we are well on in the first week now at the rate at which we are sailing we shall take at least three weeks before we get there you see we are only just clear of the northern point of sumatra and it is already a month since we got up anchor  but we shall have the wind almost behind us fairclough  yes when it has settled down it is the change that i do not like of course sometimes we have only a few days of moderately rough weather but occasionally there is a hurricane at the break up and a hurricane in the bay of bengal is no joke i shall not mind much if we get fairly past the andamans for from there to the mouth of the hooghly it is open water and i should be under no uneasiness as to the brig battling her way through it but to be caught in a hurricane with these patches of islands and rocks in the neighbourhood would to say the least be awkward  are there any ports among the islands i recollect hearing an officer say that there was a settlement made there some years ago  that was so in 1791 an establishment was started in the southern part of the island and two years later it was moved to a harbour on the northwest side of the bay it was called port cornwallis but was abandoned in 1796 being found terribly unhealthy it was a pity for it afforded good shelter when the northeast monsoon was blowing and partially so from the southwest monsoon no doubt it could have been made more healthy if the country round had been well cleared but it was not found to be of sufficient utility to warrant a large outlay and the natives are so bitterly unfriendly that it would require a garrison of two or three hundred men to overawe them we should have been always losing lifenot from open attacks perhaps but from their habit of crawling up and shooting men down with their arrows  a week later they were some seventy or eighty miles to the west of the andaman group directly the brig weathered the northernmost point of sumatra the course had been laid more to the west so as to avoid the dangerous inside passage when harry went on deck in the morning he found that the wind had dropped altogether  there is an end of the monsoon fairclough said i am just going to shorten sail there is no saying which way the wind will come the glass is falling fast but of course that is only to be expected i think if you are wise after breakfast you will take off that drill suit and get into something better calculated to stand rough weather for that we are sure to have and any amount of rain that is always the case at the changes of the monsoon  you see it is a sort of battle between the two winds the southwesterly will gain in the end but the other will die hard and it is this struggle that causes the circular storms which when they are serious are called hurricanes though at ordinary times they are simply called the break up of the monsoon which generally causes bad weather all over the indian ocean  towards evening low banks of cloud were seen to the south and the sky looked dim and misty in the opposite direction  they are mustering their forces you see lindsay and the glass has fallen so far that i fancy the fight will be a hot one at any rate we will make all snug for the night  sail after sail was taken in until only a storm jib a small fore staysail and a closereefed main topsail were left standing the bank of cloud to the south had risen considerably and when darkness closed in the upper edge was lit up by the almost incessant flicker of lightning the upper spars were sent down on deck and then there being nothing more to be done the crew who had all donned roughweather clothes awaited the outburst  that it would be more than ordinarily severe there could be no doubt and the men clustered in little groups by the bulwarks talked in low tones as they watched the slowlyapproaching storm from the south with occasional glances northwards where indeed no clouds could be seen but the sky was frequently lit up by the reflections of lightning below the horizon  what do you think of it harry asked the interpreter  i do not like it the malay replied i think that there will be a great hurricane i have seen many changes of the monsoon but never one that looked so threatening as this  it does look bad harry said though as i have never been at sea before at the change of the monsoon i am no judge at all but it certainly looks as if we were in for a bad gale at any rate we shall be safer here than we were in that hut in the mountains  the malay made no reply for some time then he said  yes sahib but there was something to do there directly we got in you began to prepare for an escape it was not certain that we should succeed they might have come in and killed us before you were ready but as we were busy we had not much time to think of the danger  here we can do nothing  no but as you see everything has already been done you and i have not been working but the sailors have been busy in taking off sail and getting down all the upper spars we are ready for the worst now just as we were when we had opened the passage for our escape and we felt fairly confidentalthough we might meet with many dangers we had a good chance of getting safely away  there are the danger signals lindsay the captain said as a pale light suddenly shone out above  looking up harry saw a ball of fire on the mainmast head presently this seemed to roll down the mast till it reached the topsail yard then it broke into two and these rolled out until they remained stationary one at each end of the yard harry had never seen this phenomenon before  what is it he asked fairclough in an awed voice  they are often seen before the outburst of a severe tempest of course they look like balls of phosphorus but in reality they are electric and are a sign that the whole atmosphere is charged with electricity sailors have all sorts of superstitions about them but of course excepting that they are signs of the condition of the air they are perfectly harmless  he raised his voice  dont stand near the foot of the masts lads keep well away from them there is nothing to be afraid of in those lights but if we happened to be struck by lightning and it ran down the mast some of you might be knocked over  i dont know why he continued to harry the first flash of lightning at the beginning of a storm is always the most dangerous i cant account for it in any way but there is no question as to the fact i always feel relieved when the first clap of thunder is over for i know then that we are comparatively safe from danger in that way  gradually the stars disappeared  mr hardy the captain said to the lieutenant who was standing near will you go down to my cabin and see how the glass stands  harry did not hear the answer when hardy returned but fairclough said to him  it has gone down another quarter of an inch since i looked at it half an hour ago and it was as low then as i have ever seen it  mr hardy you had better send the men aloft and furl the main topsail altogether and run down the fore staysail we can get it up again as soon as the first burst is over put four men at the wheel  there was still no breath of wind stirring the stay sail was run down but the men hung back from ascending the shrouds of the main mast  they are afraid of those lights fairclough said but i do not think there is the slightest danger from them  i will go up myself sir hardy said and he ran up the starboard shrouds while at the same moment one of the midshipmen led the way on the port side the sailors at once followed their officers  the latter had nearly reached the yard when the two balls of fire began to roll along it joined in the centre and then slowly ascended the topmast the fireballs paused there for half a minute and then vanished  now eden the lieutenant said let us get the work done at once before that fellow makes his appearance again  the men followed them out on the yard and worked in desperate haste with occasional glances up at the mast head in a couple of minutes the sail was firmly secured in its gaskets and all made their way below  thank goodness here it comes at last fairclough said the suspense is more trying than the gale itself  a low murmur was heard and a faint pale light was soon visible to the south  get ready to hold on all he shouted to the men  the sound momentarily increased in volume and the distant light brightened until a long line of white foam was clearly discernible it approached with extraordinary speed there was a sudden puff of air it lasted but a few seconds and then died away  hold on the captain again shouted  half a minute later with a tremendous roar the wind struck the brig knowing which way it would come fairclough had half an hour before lowered a boat and brought the vessels head round so that it pointed north the boat had then been hoisted up  in the interval of waiting the ships head had slightly drifted round again and the wind struck her on the quarter so great was the pressure that she heeled far over burying her bows so deeply that it seemed as if she were going to dive head foremost the water swept over the bulwarks in torrents and extended almost up to the foot of the foremast then very slowly as she gathered way the bow lifted and in a minute she was scudding fast before the gale gathering speed every moment from the pressure of the wind upon her masts and hull and from the fragment of sail shown forward at present there were no waves the surface of the water seeming pressed almost flat by the weight of the wind  then there was a deafening crash and a blaze of light the foretop mast was riven in fragments but none of these fell on the deck the wind carrying them far ahead  you had better make your way forward mr hardy fairclough shouted into the lieutenants ear and see if anyone is hurt  fortunately the precaution which had been taken of ordering the men away from the mast had prevented any loss of life but several of the men were temporarily blinded three or four had been struck to the deck by the passage of the electric fluid close to them but these presently regained their feet hardy returned and reported to the captain  you had better send the carpenter down to see that there is no fire below  in a minute the man ran up with the news that he believed the foot of the mast was on fire mr hardy went to a group of men  get some buckets my lads he said quietly and make your way down to the hold i will go with you as was to be expected the lightning has fired the foot of the mast but there is no cause for alarm as we have discovered it so soon we shall not be long in getting it under  the men at once filled the fire buckets and led by mr hardy went below as soon as the hatchway leading to the hold was lifted a volume of smoke poured up  wait a minute till it has cleared off a little the lieutenant said and then to the midshipman who had accompanied him  go to the captain and tell him that there is more smoke than i like and ask him to come below tell him i think the pumps had better be rigged and the hose passed down  fairclough who was accompanied by harry joined him just as he was about to descend the ladder  i will go down with you mr hardy he said  mr eden will you go up and send down all hands except those at the wheel set a strong gang to rig the pumps and pass the hose down  he and the lieutenant then made their way along the hold the smoke was very thick and it was only by stooping low that they could get along they could see however a glow of light ahead  we can do nothing with this the captain said beyond trying to keep it from spreading until we have shifted all these stores the gang with buckets had better come down empty them on the pile and then set to work to clear the stuff away as quickly as possible  the men who came along gradually and with difficulty began to remove the barrels coils of rope and spare sails stowed there several of them were overpowered by the smoke and had to be carried up again and others came down and took their places  in three or four minutes the hose was passed down and the clank of the pumps could be heard mr hardy took the nozzle and while the men now a strong party worked at the stores directed a stream of water upon the flames  for a time the efforts seemed to make no impression and the steam added to the difficulty of working another gang of men were set to work forward of the mast and after half an hours labour the stores were so far removed that the hose could be brought to play upon the burning mass at the foot of the mast  the lieutenant had been relieved by harry and he by the two midshipmen in succession changes were frequent and in another quarter of an hour it was evident that the flames were well under control the men engaged below relieved those at the pumps and in an hour from the first outbreak all danger was over though pumping was kept up for some time longer  the captain made frequent visits to the deck the vessel was still running before the wind and the sea had got up the motion of the ship was becoming more and more violent but as there was nothing to be done the men below were not disturbed at their work and this was continued until smoke no longer ascended    chapter 14 the great andaman   leaving a party below to clear away the burnt barrels and debris and to extinguish any fire that might still smoulder among them the rest returned on deck terrible as was the storm it was a relief to all to cling to the rail and breathe the fresh air after the stifling atmosphere of the hold  the scene however was a terrible one lightning was flashing overhead incessantly although the thunder was only occasionally heard above the howl of the storm the sea was broken and irregular leaping in masses over the bulwarks and sweeping the decks the force of the wind continually tore the heads off the waves and carried the spray along in blinding showers  we are very near the eye of the hurricane captain fairclough shouted in lindsays ear the men at the wheel tell me she has been twice round the compass already but this broken sea would alone tell that we must get a little sail on the main mast and try to edge out of it  a small stay sail was got out and hoisted and the helm was put down a little though still running at but a slight angle before the wind the pressure was now sufficient to lay her down to her gunwale the crew gathered under shelter of the weather bulwark holding on by belaying pins and stanchions  night had now set in but it made little difference for the darkness had before been intense save for the white crests of the tossing waves sheets of foam blew across the deck and sometimes a heavy fall of water toppled down on the crew a pannikin of hot soup had been served out to the men and this would be the last hot refreshment they would obtain before the gale broke for the hatchways were all battened down and it was impossible to keep the fire alight  the best thing you can do is to turn in lindsay fairclough said after the former had finished his soupa task of no slight difficulty under the circumstances you can do no good by remaining up  how long is it likely to last  probably for two or three days possibly longer  i will take your advice harry said i shall be glad to get these wet clothes off  for a time he was sorry that he had lain down for the motion was so violent that he could with difficulty keep himself in his berth being however completely worn out by the buffeting of the gale the efforts required to hold on the excitement of the fire and storm it was not long before he dropped off to sleep and he did not wake up until a ray of dim light showed that the morning was breaking the motion of the ship was unabated and after with great difficulty getting into his clothes he went up on deck  except that the clouds were somewhat more broken there was no change dark masses of vapour flew overhead torn and ragged the wild tumble of waves rose and fell without order or regularity forward the bulwark on both bows had been carried away and the deck was swept clear of every movable object  one watch was below the men of the other were for the most part gathered aft and lashed to belaying pins fairclough was standing near the wheel with some difficulty harry made his way to him  not much change since last night he said i feel quite ashamed of myself for having been sleeping in my berth while you have all been exposed to this gale  there has not been much to do the commander said in fact there is nothing to be done except to keep her as much as we dare from running straight before the wind we have not had much success that way for as you see the tumble of water shows that we are still but a short distance from the centre of the gale i sent the starboard watch below at four bells and in a few minutes we shall be relieved hardy wanted to stay with me but i would not have it  the cook has managed somehow to boil some water and served a pannikin of coffee to all hands just before the watch turned in and he has sent word that he will have some more ready by the time they come up again  he looked at his watch and called out four bells  one of the men made his way to the bell with alacrity the watch below did not come up for a few minutes as they waited to drink their coffee as soon as they appeared the men on deck went below  all the better for your sleep mr hardy fairclough asked as the other joined him  very much better sir i think the cook ought to have a medal the cup of coffee before we turned in and that we have just drunk have made new men of us  you will call me instantly if there is any change mr hardy  mr eden you had better come with us the coffee will be ready in my cabin  there was no possibility of sitting at the table but sitting down on the floor to leeward and holding a mug in one hand and a biscuit in the other they managed with some difficulty to dispose of the meal then fairclough putting on some dry clothes threw himself on his bunk the midshipman retired to his own cabin and harry went on deck  how are we heading mr hardy he shouted when he joined the lieutenant  at the present moment we are running nearly due east but as we have been round the compass several times since the gale struck us there is no means of saying with anything like certainty where our position is but i was talking it over with the captain before i went down and we both agreed that as the centre of the hurricane is undoubtedly moving to the northeast we must have gone a good many miles in that direction  of course there is no means of determining how far till we can get a glimpse of the sun but there is no doubt that if the gale continues we shall soon be in a very perilous position for we must be driving towards the andamans we may have the luck to pass north of them or to go between them  we tried last night to get up a little more sail but she would not stand it and we were obliged to take it off again so we can do nothing but hope for the best  two hours later fairclough came out again  i am afraid that you have not been to sleep harry said  no i am all the better for the rest but sleep was out of the question  how is she heading now mr hardy  northeast sir  fairclough took his telescope from the rack in the companion and slinging it over his shoulder mounted the ratlines to the top  have you made out anything he asked the sailor stationed there  i have thought once or twice sir that i saw land ahead but i could not say for certain it is so thick that it is only when the clouds open a bit that one has a chance  although he had taken his glass with him fairclough did not attempt to use it at present but stood gazing fixedly ahead a quarter of an hour later there was a sudden rift in the clouds and a low shore was visible some five or six miles ahead and a dark mass much farther off rising into the cloud fairclough instantly unslung the telescope and adjusted it a minute afterwards the clouds closed in again and telling the man to keep a sharp lookout he descended to the deck  we must set the main topsail on her again close reefed of course we are running straight for land and unless i am much mistaken it is the great andaman there is a lofty hill some distance back from the shore i only caught a glimpse of its lower part but none of the small islands have any hill to speak of the shore is about six miles off and as the peak lies about the centre of the island and as this is a hundred and forty miles long we are some seventy miles from the northern point  you know what that means however we must do all that we can to keep her off  ay ay sir hardy said turning without another word and then gave orders to the men to set the top sail  this was done and the ships course was laid parallel to the shore the wind was now nearly northwest and she lay down until the water was several planks up her deck the crew were all lashed to windward clustering where they would be most out of danger should the mast go  fairclough stood for a minute looking at the shivering mast and the shrouds stretched like iron bars  we must get the guns overboard mr hardy she will never stand this and indeed the waves striking her broadside were falling in a cascade over her  calling four of the men hardy made his way down into the lee scuppers where the water was nearly up to their waists opened the portholes and slacked the lashings when the four guns disappeared overboard it required much greater pains to get down the guns from the port side as tackle had to be attached to each so that they could be lowered carefully one by one across the deck but all worked heartily and these also were launched overboard  that has eased her a bit fairclough said when hardy rejoined him they helped to pin her down and i could almost feel the difference as each gun went overboard  i am afraid that it will make no difference in the long run hardy said she must be making a great deal of leeway and i should say that she will be on shore in a couple of hours at the latest still we may have time to look out for a soft spot  we should not have much chance in that case hardy my only hope is in another shift of wind  but it will go round more to the north sir and then we shant be able to lie our course at all it has gone round a point since we got up the top sail  quite so and i doubt whether it will go round soon enough to save us if it should go round a little more to the north we must try and get her on the other tack but i am afraid in such a sea she will not go about of course our great aim is to reach port cornwallis or if we cannot get as far as that i have just been having a look at the chart and i see there are three narrow straits how much water there is in them i do not know they are most vaguely marked on the chart one of them is but thirty miles north of our present position and if we find that we cannot make the northern point i shall try to get in there i am not sure that in any case it would not be the best plan for if there is only water enough to run a mile or so up this passage we shall ground in comparatively still water whereas as the wind has been blowing from every quarter it is almost certain that there will be a tremendous sea in the open port  fairclough placed himself at the wheel and told the two midshipmen to go round and tell the crew that there was an inlet ahead but the depth of the water was uncertain when they approached it all hands would come aft so as to avoid being crushed by the falling masts a dozen of the men were to take hatchets and cut away the wreckage if the mast fell leaving only a couple of the shrouds uncut when this was done directly the vessel began to break up those who could not swim were to make their way by these shrouds to the floating mast those who could swim could make at once for the shore  when all have left the ship but mr hardy and myself we will cut the shrouds and the masts will probably ground ere long  while before the sailors had for the most part been gazing at the coast on which they had little doubt that their bodies would soon be cast up they became lively and active as soon as they received the order it seemed that after all there was a chance for them  four hours passed the wind had now so far headed them that the brig could no longer keep her course parallel with the shore twice they had endeavoured to put her about but each time failed and she was now making so much leeway that the coast was less than three miles away a tremendous sea was breaking upon it one of the midshipmen had for the past hour been in the foretop with a glass and the captain himself now went up and took his place beside him he saw at once that accustomed as he was to use his telescope in rough weather it would be useless here for the motion was so great that it was only by following the midshipmans example and lashing himself to the mast that he could retain a footing  you are sure that you have seen no break in the surf mr eden  quite sure sir  we ought not to be far from it now if it is rightly marked on the chart  another hour passed and they were within a mile and a half of the shore  i think that i can see a break over there sir and the midshipman pointed to a spot a mile along the coast  pray god that it may be so fairclough said for it is our only chance  two or three minutes later he said  you are right there is certainly a break there there is a line of surf but it does not run up the shore as it does everywhere else  he at once descended to the deck  thank god he said as he joined mr hardy and harry who on seeing him coming down had made their way to the shrouds there is a break in the surf it is not a complete break but there is certainly an inlet of some sort and though it looks as if there were a bar there may be plenty of water for us for with such a sea as this it would break in three fathoms of water and as we dont draw more than two we may get over it at any rate it is our only hope  it gives us a chance if we strike the lieutenant said for it will be comparatively calm water inside the bar those who can swim should have no difficulty in getting ashore the others might do so on wreckage her masts are sure to come out of her if she strikes heavily  i shall be obliged if you will go up to the foretop hardy and con the brig in but mind you come down before we get to the white water you may as well send mr eden down  mr hardy was not long before he came down again and at the captains suggestion both he and harry went below and armed themselves with pistols as soon as they came up again they took their places by fairclough the seamen had all gathered aft the boatswain had cut the lashings holding the sparsthat had been sent down from aloftin their place by the bulwarks the boats had all been torn from their davits or smashed with the exception of the largest cutter which lay bottom upwards in the middle of the ship securely lashed to the deck  now men the captain said raising his voice almost to a shout so that all might hear him you have behaved as well as men could do during this storm and i have no doubt that you will continue to do so to the end remember that no one is to leave the ship till i give the order if you are cool and calm there is good ground for hope that all may be saved  if the mast falls you who have hatchets run forward at once and stand in readiness to cut the lanyards but dont strike until i give the order  they were now fast approaching the line of surf  let everyone take hold of something mr fairclough shouted if we strike we are sure to be pooped  another minute and she was close to the breaking waves everyone held his breath as impelled by a great breaker she dashed into the surf with the swiftness of an arrow there was a shock followed by a grating noise and then the brig slowly came to a standstill  hold on hold on for your lives the captain shouted as a wave even larger than the last came towering up behind them in an almost perpendicular wall it struck the vessel with tremendous force and swept waist deep along the deck while the vessel herself surged forward there was another shock but this time much slighter and as the next wave carried them on there was a general cheer from the sailors  she has floated she is through it hurrah  she was indeed over the bar  there are men in the water fairclough shouted get ready to cast ropes to them  four men who had been swept overboard by the rush of water were rescued two others were found dead on the deck having been dashed against the stanchions or other obstacles  the brig continued her course four or five hundred yards farther then as the banks of the inlet closed in fairclough gave orders for the anchors to be let go everything had been prepared for this order and the anchors at once dropped and as soon as fifty fathoms of chain had been run out the brig swung round head to wind  muster the men and see if any are missing  this was done and only one besides three found dead did not answer to his name the general opinion was that he had struck against something as he was swept overboard and had been killed or disabled for all who had been seen in the water had been rescued  serve out an allowance of grog all round mr eden fairclough said and tell the cook to get his fire alight as soon as possible we shall all be glad of a good meal  well thank god everything has ended far better than we could have hoped for  two hours later the crew having got into dry clothes were sitting down enjoying a plentiful allowance of pea soup and salt junk while the officers were partaking of similar fare in the cabin none who saw them there would have dreamt of the long struggle they had been through and that the ship was well nigh a wreck it was now late in the afternoon and fairclough gave orders that all might turn in as soon as they liked except that an anchor watch of four men must maintain a sharp lookout for the natives of the island were bitterly hostile to the whites  i dont think there is any real danger he said to harry or that they will attempt to take the ship their habit is i have heard to lie in hiding and to shoot their arrows at any stranger who may land  they sat chatting for an hour after the meal was concluded then the conversation flagged and fairclough said presently  i think that we may as well follow the mens example and turn in i can hardly keep my eyes open  the gale was still blowing strongly in the morning though its force had somewhat abated but inside the bar there was but a slight swell and the brig rode easily at her anchors for the wind was now several points west of north and they were consequently protected by the land  the work of repairing damages began at once for owing to the length of the voyage the stores of provisions and water were beginning to run very short two or three buffaloes had been bought at the village where harry had landed but with the exception of some fruit and the meat sent off by the tumangong no other fresh food had been obtained since they sailed from calcutta the boat was turned over and launched and the work of making a new foretop mast and overhauling the rigging proceeded with  during the day several of the natives were observed at the edge of the forest by harry who having no special work to do had been asked by fairclough to keep his eye on the shore and to ascertain whether they were being watched as he intended when the repairs were finished to see if any spring of fresh water existed in the neighbourhood he therefore kept a telescope directed on the shore and soon after daybreak made out two little men at the edge of the trees  the natives of the andaman islands are among the lowest types of humanity known their stature does not exceed five feet and with their slender limbs and large heads their appearance is almost that of a deformed people they use no clothing whatever plastering their bodies with clay or mud to protect the skin from the suns rays animals are scarce on the islands and the people live chiefly on fish they carry bows and arrows and heavy spears to which in most cases are added shields they inhabit roughlymade arbours and seldom remain long at any spot moving about in small communities according to the abundance or scarcity of food they use no cooking utensils and simply prepare their food by placing it on burning embers  the men first made out soon disappeared but later on harry could see that there were many of them inside the line of forest  it is a nuisance the captain said when he told him the result of his examination of the shore i suppose in a day or two we shall have hundreds of them down here i dont think they will try to interfere with us as long as we are at work but they will certainly oppose us if we attempt to enter the forest and will effectually prevent our wandering about in search of water we could only go in a strong body and even then might lose a good many lives from their arrows  of course we should be able to beat them off but i should be sorry to have to kill a lot of the poor little beggars one can hardly blame them for their hostility naturally they want to have the place to themselves and are just as averse to our landing as our forefathers were to julius caesar and his romans  of course they would be if they only knew it very much better off by being civil we have numbers of things that would be invaluable to them for instance i would willingly give them a dozen cooking pots and as many frying pans if they would let us obtain water peaceably i suppose that at some time or other malays landed here and carried off a number of heads or they may have been shot down by some reckless ruffians of traders and have so come to view all strangers as deadly enemies however so far as i have heard there is no chance of their being friendly and native traders say that of vessels that have been wrecked on the coast none of the crew ever escaped  by the way i believe that fish are extremely plentiful here we have a good supply of fishing lines on board for we generally fish when we are at anchor  if you will let me have them tomorrow harry said abdool and i will look after that i hate having nothing to do and certainly fish would be a very agreeable change after such a long spell of salt meat  you shall have them the first thing in the morning  accordingly the next day the lines were got out and the malay interpreter who knew a great deal more of fishing than did harry or abdool took the matter in hand the hooks were baited with pieces of meat or shreds of white or scarlet bunting the fish bit eagerly and all three were kept actively employed in drawing them up and rebaiting the hooks they were of all sizes from a quarter of a pound to four or five pounds and by dinner time there were enough to furnish an ample meal for all on board  i will keep three or four of the men at work this afternoon fairclough said and we will have night lines down we can salt down those we do not eat and at any rate we shall not be drawing much on our stores  by evening the new foretop mast was in its place as the heaviest part of the work was now done orders were given for a boats crew to start in the morning to cruise along the coast and see if any stream ran into it mr eden was to be in command the crew were to be well armed but were not to attempt to effect a landing  the sea had now calmed down and the southwest monsoon was blowing steadily  you had better go south the land is much higher there and there is more likelihood of there being streams i think you will be able to lie your course or at any rate make a long leg and a short one you are to go as nearly as you can tell twenty miles if you do not meet with a stream by that time turn back you will have the wind free then and can be back here well before sunset of course if you find fresh water you will at once return  would you like to go with the boat mr lindsay  very much my hands are so sore from hauling in the lines that i am afraid i shall not be able to help in the fishing tomorrow  the party started early it consisted of ten men the coxswain the midshipmen and harry the surf was no longer breaking on the bar outside there was a bright sea with whitecrested waves and before starting the captain ordered a reef to be put in the sails  she could carry full sail well enough he said to harry but there is no occasion for haste and it is always best to be on the safe side especially when a middy is in command besides it is just as well to keep dry jackets  a keg of water and a supply of food sufficient for two days were placed on board  i expect you will be back by three oclock in the afternoon mr eden but it is always well to provide against any accident  with the sheets hauled tight aft the cutter was just able to lie her course outside the line of breakers in a little over an hour there was a break in the shore and a stream of some forty feet wide fell into the sea and a general cheer broke from the sailors who had been put on allowance for the past week  put her about coxswain the midshipman said we need go no farther  cant we land and have a bathe sir the coxswain asked  certainly not that is the very thing that we musnt do for anything we know there may be natives about and some of us might get stuck full of their arrows before we could get out of range this will be good news and there will be no longer any need for your being kept on short allowance of water  at ten oclock the boat reentered the inlet and lowered sail by the side of the brig  you have been successful i suppose by your coming back so soon mr eden the captain said when they were within easy hail  yes sir there is a small stream about seven miles from here  that is very satisfactory now you can come on board there is plenty of work for all hands  everyone indeed was busy in repairing damages the carpenters were engaged upon the bulwarks and the stern which had been much damaged by the wave that had lifted them over the bar as there were not sufficient planks on board for this work canvas was utilized for filling up the gaps in the bulwarks and this after being nailed to temporary stanchions was coated with pitch all hands worked cheerfully the change of diet already benefited them and the news that there was plenty of fresh water near enabled the remaining supply to be freely useda matter of no slight consequence to men working in the broiling sun  two days later the work was finished and on the following morning the anchors were weighed and the sails shaken out and the brig left the inlet that had saved them from destruction and after sailing out to sea a couple of miles came about and laid her course for the mouth of the stream  the fishing had been continued without intermission watches had again been set and the work of attending to the lines was very welcome as helping to pass away the four hours of darkness by the time they left the inlet a sufficient quantity had been salted down to last the ships company for a week without recourse to the saltmeat casks  the carpenter with three or four assistants had patched up the second cutterthe boat that had been least injured the others had been broken up for firewood some of the pieces being reserved for the repairs of the cutter  as soon as the brig reached the mouth of the stream she was anchored two hundred yards off the shore the water barrels had already been got up on deck and some of these were lowered into the first cutter of which mr hardy took the command it was not deemed advisable to employ the second boat in bringing water on board as if heavily laden the water would force its way in through the hastilyexecuted repairs the captain then accompanied by harry and an armed crew took his place in her and went ahead of the larger boat into the stream  it was found to be but three or four feet deep with a slow current and for some little distance up was too brackish to be used it was not until they entered the line of forest that it was found fresh enough the men in the first cutter proceeded to fill their casks while those in the other boat laid in their oars and musket in hand watched the forest in a few minutes the work was done and the first cutter rowed straight for the brig while the second cutter followed her for some distance beyond the trees and there waited for her return  so far so good fairclough said but i am afraid that we shall be disturbed before we have made another trip no doubt some of the natives followed the cutter along the shore yesterday i dont suppose they recognized what your object was as you did not enter the stream but when they saw the brig going the same way this morning i have no doubt that they set off in this direction however with one more boat load we can manage well enough until we reach the hooghly for with this wind we shall make a quick run  in a quarter of an hour the cutter was seen returning and when it approached them fairclough again took the lead all appeared still in the forest and the men had just begun to refill the casks when a shower of arrows fell among the boats  let half your men go on with their work mr hardy and the others stand to their arms  not a single foe was visible but the arrows still flew fast from among the trees  open fire fairclough said fire anywhere among the bushes i dont suppose that we shall hit them but it may frighten them they cant know much about firearms  from both boats a scattering fire of musketry at once opened the men loading and firing as quickly as they could the effect was immediate arrows still fell but only occasionally and evidently shot at random for but few of them came near the boats  the men in the first cutter were working energetically dipping breakers into the water and emptying them into the large casks in three or four minutes these were filled and hardy hailed the captain  we are full up now sir both casks and breakers  then retire at once mr hardy we will follow you  as they issued from under the trees the arrows again fell fast  dont fire the captain said perhaps they may issue out and then we will give them a lessonthat it is better not to interfere with men who are doing them no harm  this proved to be the case no one had been hit by the fire from the boats and now that the shooting had ceased the natives with shouts of triumph ran out from the forest there were some hundreds of them  the captain hailed the boat in front  stop rowing mr hardy and open fire on them  now lads he went on to his own crew fire steadily and dont throw away a shot  illustration the rattle of musketry broke out again  as the rattle of musketry broke out again from both boats many of the natives dropped the others stopped at once a shower of arrows was discharged and then as the fire was kept up they fled back into the woods and the men again taking to their oars rowed out without further molestation to the brig none of the crew had been killed but four were wounded by the arrows  i hope they are not poisoned fairclough said in a low voice to harry i dont know whether they use poison on these islands but we must hope not however we will not frighten them by even hinting at the possibility of such a thing  happily however no evil symptoms resulted the wounds were for the most part slight and the next day all were able to return to their duty the fair weather now set in and ten days later the brig dropped anchor in the river opposite calcutta  harry at once went ashore and handed to the governor a full report of what had taken place  i have not time to read this rather bulky report of yours at present captain lindsay the latter said with a smile please give me the pith of it as shortly as possible  the island sir is well adapted for a trading station and would i should think when the forests are partly cleared away be a healthy one i have interviewed the tumangong who has signed a document agreeing at any time in the future that it may be desired to cede either a trading station or the whole island to us he was greatly pleased with the presents that you sent and is i believe thoroughly in earnest in his desire for a trading station to be established so close to him the rajah of johore has ratified this agreement and has given his cordial consent for the cession of the island to us  it seems that he himself is an usurper the rightful heir is a boy of seven or eight years old and i think it is possible that either at the present mans death or possibly even before that he may ascend the throne at present he and his mother are in the hands of the reigning rajah but i have promised her that if we take possession of singapore she and her son can find an asylum there and a small pension for her maintenance and she on her part has promised that she will bring up her son to regard us as his best friends and that he if he ascends the throne shall also ratify the treaty and will become our warm ally  as to the dutch the reply of their governor is with the report but certainly it is an unfavourable one and no cooperation in the work of repressing piracy can be expected from them  i did not expect it captain lindsay and indeed as i told you at the time only sent you to batavia in order to account for the presence of one of our ships of war in those waters  well sir your mission has been in all respects most satisfactory i shall read your report and give it full consideration at my leisure for the present you will remain here available for any office military or civil but at present at any rate you will retain your civil employment  i will not ask you to dine with me today as it is hardly likely that i shall have time to read your report this afternoon but i shall be glad if you will do so tomorrow and you can then answer any questions that may suggest themselves to me    chapter 15 assaye   while the deccan had been torn by civil war the government of bombay had extended their territory the nabob of surat who had been under their protection had died and they had taken the government of the province into their own hands a civil war having broken out at baroda they had supported one of the rival princes and had after a good deal of fighting placed their candidate on the thronevarious districts being assigned to them in return for their assistance  holkar on hearing of bajees arrival at bassein placed his brother amrud on the musnud and commenced a series of atrocities in poona equal to that which it had suffered at the hands of ghatgay respectable inhabitants being robbed and ill treated many tortured and some killed in order to wring from them the treasures that they were supposed to have concealed  during the months that followed his return to calcutta harry remained attached to the staff of the marquis of wellesleyfor to this title lord mornington had succeeded during his absence on the death of his fatherand was sent on various missions among others accompanying the governor generals brother the honorable henry wellesley to the court of oude he could now speak hindustani as well as mahratti and was very useful in acting as an interpreter and in aiding to carry on the negotiations  in february 1803 he was sent by the governor general to join the force that major general wellesley was preparing in mysore to aid bajee rao to recover his throne the treaty that the latter had concluded with the government on his arrival at bassein was a most advantageous one to the english in return for their assistance he agreed that a force of infantry with guns and european artillerymen should be stationed within his territories their maintenance being paid by handing over to the company a large amount of territory the two parties were to support each other in case of war and the peishwa bound himself not to make aggressions against other states nor to negotiate with them without the governors consent the peishwa agreed also to abandon the mahratta claims on surat and other districts that had been occupied by the english  on arriving at general wellesleys camp harry reported himself to that officer for service  i am very glad to have you with me captain lindsay i have frequently heard my brother speak of your services and your perfect knowledge of mahratti and your acquaintance with its people will be of great value to me  you know the peishwa well do you think that he will be faithful to the engagement that he has made with us  certainly not sir he has been intriguing ever since he ascended the musnud his duplicity is only equalled by his treachery and as soon as he is restored in poona he will again begin his intrigues with scindia and the other mahratta chiefs  that is the opinion that i have formed of him from what i have heard the general said however the terms of the treaty will render him practically our servant for we shall maintain a body of troops near poona which will effectually prevent any scheme of his from succeeding  what course holkar will take we cannot say but the other mahratta chiefs have all entered into a confederacy against us and we shall have the forces of scindia of the rajah of bhopal the rajah of berar and the rajah of kolapoore to deal with  the partition of mysore had indeed done much to unite the mahrattas together the everincreasing power of the british was a serious source of alarm for in addition to mysore lord wellesley had without a shadow of justification obtained the control of oude  i am sorry sir that the rajah of berar has declared against us i was nearly three months with him and should after the news of the capture of seringapatam have fallen a victim to the fury of the mohammedans in the city had he not taken me under his protection but at the same time i have no doubt in my mind that he was ready to join whichever side was victorious  you have then no good opinion of the mahrattas captain lindsay  i have met but one honest man among them nana furnuwees was not only an extraordinary man but devoted his talents wholly to the good of the state his word could always be relied upon his life was simple and his habits frugal i honoured and esteemed him greatly  yes it was owing to you as my brother told me that he was released from prison i was greatly struck with the story when i heard it because it showed how much can be accomplished even by the youngest officer who is active and enterprising and ready to act on his own initiative i saw a copy of mr uhtoffs report of the affair  well you will be attached to my staff with no particular duties at present but doubtless we shall find plenty for you to do when we once cross the frontier into the mahratta country  harry found that in addition to the eight thousand infantry and seventeen hundred cavalry under the command of general wellesley the nizams force of eight thousand regular troops and fifteen thousand irregulars were advancing towards the frontier the whole commanded by colonel stephenson on the 25th of march these forces advanced and were joined by numerous small mahratta chiefs in the peishwas interest general wellesleys army advanced straight on poona which was evacuated at once by holkars force and as it was stated that he intended to burn the town before he retired the general hastened forward with his cavalry and on the 20th of april took possession of the place colonel stephenson whose cooperation was no longer required moved north towards the godavery to protect the country against the irruptions of holkar  four weeks later bajee rao arrived from the coast and resumed his seat on the musnud amid great rejoicings by the inhabitants who had suffered terribly both at the hands of ghatgay and holkar  scindia having recovered from the effects of his defeat by holkar had returned crossed the nerbudda and encamped on the nizams frontier he was busy preparing for war in conjunction with the rajah of berar and had even made overtures to holkar to join in opposing the english bajee rao himself as was afterwards discovered was also in friendly communication with scindia  the resident at scindias court was ordered to leave it unless that prince retired from his position on the nizams frontier scindia when summoned sent a defiant reply and as it was now evident that war was impending general wellesley was invested with full powers and lord lake who commanded the army of hindustan was ordered to advance to attack the formidable force of french infantry under perron and take possession of delhi agra and other places held by the mahrattas another attempt was made to persuade scindia to retire but evasive answers were returned and it was not until the 3rd of august that the resident quitted scindia and wellesley prepared to attack ahmednuggur  the possession of this place was of great importance because it was situated close to the nizams frontier and afforded great facilities for future operations the town was surrounded by a wall flanked by towers and was defended by a number of arabs and a battalion of scindias regular infantry these offered a vigorous resistance for after a breach had been made in the walls and the troops had entered they retired fighting from house to house and keeping up a heavy fire however by nightfall they were driven inside their fort  a battery of four guns was erected within four hundred yards of it and these opened with such effect that the governor surrendered on being allowed to depart with the garrison and their private property  on the 24th general wellesley crossed the godavery colonel stephenson moving in the direction of aurungabad scindia and the rajah of berar were now within forty miles of him but they suddenly turned off as if intending to make a dash for hyderabad where the nizam had expired three weeks before  wellesley followed close after them and they then turned and took up a position to the north of julnapoor a town lying east of aurungabad on the 2nd of september julnapoor was captured by colonel stephenson who afterwards made a night attack upon scindias camp inflicting considerable loss  on the 21st the whole mahratta army with sixteen battalions of regular infantry were encamped twentytwo miles north of julnapoor and the next day the army marched against them by two routes colonel stephenson taking the western road and general wellesley the eastern  the next afternoon when about to halt general wellesley learned that the mahrattas were encamped about six miles from him on the banks of the kaitna he determined to attack them at once without waiting for colonel stephenson for in another day they would in all probability send off their infantry and begin to carry on a desultory warfare with their horse  illustration plan of the battle of assaye  the general rode on with his staff and an escort of cavalry and obtained a view of the mahratta host from rising ground they were in the fork formed by the junction of the kaitna with the juah their right consisted wholly of cavalry and was protected by the high and rocky bank of the stream which was at one or two points impassable for guns their left consisting of the infantry and artillery was posted in the village of assaye which lay near the fork of the river  the general determined at once to attack at this point the force under his command consisted of four battalions of sepoys and the 74th and 78th regiments with the 19th dragoons and three regiments of native cavalryin all four thousand five hundred men opposed to them were ten thousand five hundred disciplined troops taught and commanded by european officers scindias irregulars and the infantry of the rajah of berar with a wellappointed train of artillery of over a hundred guns and some forty thousand cavalry  from the position in which the british force arrived they had to march for some distance parallel with the river and exposed to a terrible artillery fire which created such havoc especially among the bullocks drawing the guns that the cavalry could not move forward the infantry therefore proceeded alone crossed the kaitna by a ford and then swinging round advanced against the village while they were crossing the river the mahratta cavalry were brought up from their former position and took post behind assaye  the steadiness with which the little force advanced to the attack against so immense an army had already had the effect of shaking the mahrattas it seemed to them that their opponents must be conscious that they were invincible pouring in a volley the first british line charged with the bayonet the mahratta infantry at once wavered and then gave way and fell back on their second line posted near the juah  as the 74th regiment passed through the village a body of mahratta horse charged them but they were met by the british cavalry who drove them with great slaughter into the river the second mahratta line gave way with scarcely any resistance and the british cavalry pressing hotly after them cut them up terribly the infantry followed as quickly as possible  but suddenly there was a roar of guns behind them and the flying mahrattas at once rallied and faced their pursuers as they advanced the force had captured the mahrattas guns but numbers of the artillerymen had thrown themselves down lying as if dead as soon as they saw that the british line was still pressing forward in pursuit the artillerymen leapt to their feet and turning the guns opened fire  the general at once put himself at the head of the 71st regiment and the native cavalry and after a desperate conflict in which the general had his horse shot under him succeeded in recapturing the guns in the meantime colonel maxwell with the cavalry had again and again charged the fugitives who had rallied and succeeded in completely breaking them up but was himself killed  the battle had lasted three hours one thousand five hundred and sixtysix of the british force were killed or wounded being rather more than a third of the troops engaged the enemy left twelve hundred dead on the field of battle and the country through which they retreated was covered with their wounded the camp with a number of bullocks and a large quantity of military stores and ninetyeight cannon fell into the hands of the victors  scindia in great alarm sent an ambassador to the british camp and after various conferences a truce was agreed upon between him and the general the conditions being that scindia should not approach within forty miles of his frontier and that the british should not enter his dominions  on the day after the battle of assaye the general sent for harry  captain lindsay i have a mission which you can carry out better than any of my other officers i wish you to make your way across the country to inform general lake of the victory we have won and to point out that at present scindia is paralysed and will be unable to send troops to aid his force in the northwest for should he do so i shall at once enter his territory  do not run the risk of returning but tell lord lake that my orders are that you shall remain with him i do not think that we shall have much fighting here though no doubt later on holkar and the rajah of berar will reform their armies and try conclusions with us again while on the other side there is likely to be heavy fighting you must of course travel in disguise but you are already accustomed to that  i will willingly undertake the mission sir  would you like to take anyone with you  i should be glad if you will give me four troopers from one of your native cavalry regiments i shall of course ride as a petty chief but i might be interrupted in small villages were i alone with only my servant whereas if i had four followers it would appear natural to them as even the pettiest leader is always accompanied by a party however small of horsemen  certainly i will give orders to the colonel of the 1st cavalry to choose four wellmounted men who can speak mahratti there are many such in his regiment  there was no difficulty about disguises for a large quantity of native clothing had been found in the camp harry chose a dress suitable for a native in command of some fifty or sixty men and the four troopers attired themselves in the garments of native soldiers which indeed differed in no way from those worn by the peasantry harry had packed his uniform in his native saddlebag and also his cocked hat after taking out the stiffening so that it would lie flat and had exchanged his own saddle for that of one of holkars horsemen he advised the men to do the same so that when they joined lord lake they would be able at once to appear in uniform there was an abundance of native swords and spears lying where the mahratta force had been defeated  abdool had at once been sent into the village and had there succeeded in buying some brown dye used in colouring the clothes and with this harry stained his face and hands and two hours after receiving the order rode out from camp followed by abdool and the four troopers  he considered that there was but little danger in the journey as for the greater portion of the distance he would ride through the dominions of the young nizam he would however have to pass through the territory of the rajah of berar beyond this he would enter the country in which the british were already supreme while in the nizams dominions he experienced no difficulties the news of the victory of assaye had already spread and the inhabitants were relieved of the fears they had been entertaining of a great raid by holkar the passage therefore of a petty chief with four followers was regarded with indifference and indeed he was generally supposed to be one of the nizams irregular cavalry on his way with some message to hyderabad  still less attention was paid to him in the villages of berar many bodies of the rajahs troops had already passed through on their way to nagpore and they were naturally taken to be some of the fugitives  they travelled as rapidly as possible the horses were all inured to long journeys and they had made from fifty to sixty miles a day they halted at a village twenty miles east of nagpore nothing unusual had happened and harry had just lain down to sleep when there was a sound as of people gathering in front of his hut  he was about to rise to see what was going on when the door was opened and a number of armed villagers at once poured into the room and he was seized before he had time to leap to his feet he made no attempt at resistance but believing that some mistake had been committed he angrily demanded the reason of this assault  he was dragged out into the street as this happened he heard pistol shots and a moment later the four troopers rode up  one of them had remained at the door of the hut while the others had lain down seeing a number of people moving about he had roused his companions they had got out of the window at the back of the hut here their horses had been picketed and mounting at once they rode out just as a body of men made a rush at the door of their hut by the use of their pistols and swords they had broken through these and seeing the crowd in front of the hut that harry had occupied they charged without hesitation  the villagers unprepared for such an attack fell back losing their hold of harry and abdool whom they had also captured the latter darted away and in a few seconds returned leading the two horses  shall we set the houses alight before we start sahib one of the troopers asked  no they may rally in a minute or two and the sooner we are out of it the better  he turned and started at once and as he did so a dropping fire from matchlocks and guns was opened upon them the villagers arms were however wholly untrustworthy and the powder bad one of the troopers was hit in the arm but with that exception they rode out unharmed  what does it all mean abdool harry asked as after riding fast for a quarter of a mile they broke into a slower pace of course they must in some way have recognized me for i heard some of them saying death to the english infidel  it was through me that they recognized you sahib abdool said they seized me before they entered your hut and tied a bandage round my mouth to prevent my giving any alarm as they took me out into the road one of them said  son of sheitan i knew you directly i saw you you were with that english officer in nagpore then when i looked at the head of your party i saw that though he had changed his dress and stained his face to the colour of ours it was the same man who came as an envoy to our rajah and whose house we attacked  we shall hear what the rajah says to him when we take him to nagpore  i understand now abdool i have thought of my own disguise and that of the troopers but as you always except when riding behind me dress in your native clothes it seemed to me a matter of course that you would pass without difficulty and it never occurred to me that you must during our three months stay at nagpore have become known by sight to most of the people there it is a bad blunder and it will be a lesson to me in future  then he turned and spoke to the troopers  you have done well indeed tonight he said and i owe it to you that i have escaped if not death an imprisonment of months if i had been taken to nagpore and handed over to the rajah he would doubtless have imprisoned me but would not have ventured to take my life for he would have known that the part that he had taken against us would be more readily forgiven than the murder of a british officer but i do not think i should have reached the palace furious as the people must be at their crushing defeat at assaye they would have torn me to pieces the moment they heard from my captors that i was an englishman therefore i feel that you have saved my life  how was it that you were not also surprised  when he heard how the alarm had been given and how they had at once mounted and ridden out just as a party were about to enter the hut he said  it was well done and shows that you are quick fellows as well as brave i shall report your conduct when we join the army and shall myself give you a batta of six months pay  now we will ride on for a few miles and then leave the road and take shelter till morning in a wood the horses have had five hours rest at the village and there will be time for them to have as much more before we mount again  it is lucky that you bought some grain for them this evening instead of waiting till the morning so they can have a good feed before starting  henceforth they avoided the villages as much as possible and passed unquestioned until they reached the hustoo river which at this point formed the eastern boundary of berar they swam the horses across and after stopping for a few hours at dundava rode on and continued their journey due north and crossed the sone river at maunpoor having accomplished a journey of nearly a thousand miles in twenty days  on arriving there harry found that general lake had left six weeks before and had encamped at secundara where on the 26th of august despatches had been received from the governor general authorizing active operations against scindia and his allies and two days later the force halted on the mahratta frontier within sight of the mosque at coel where perron was encamped  perron a french officer in scindias service commanded no less than fortythree thousand men and four hundred and sixtyfour guns about half of these were with scindia in the deccan and the force encamped at coel numbered about twenty thousand  perron an active and ambitious man had assumed an almost independent position a large grant of territory had been given him by scindia and in this he ruled with absolute authority and had it not been for the interposition of the british it is probable that he would ere long have assumed the position of an independent prince indeed his army of partially disciplined men was more than a match for the whole force of scindia  at a short distance from coel was the fortress of alighur which was considered to be almost impregnable it was defended by a triple line of walls and fortifications so that an enemy entering it would have to advance by a devious route from one gate to another exposed all the time to a terrible artillery fire it was almost surrounded by a swamp and the only approach was along a narrow strip of firm ground leading to the gate  early on the morning of the 29th the british troops advanced to attack perrons force but it at once drew off although the infantry were supported by twenty thousand horse believing that alighur was impregnable perron left a strong force there under one of his officers named pedron and marched with his army towards agra  on the 4th of september a storming party commanded by colonel monson left the british camp and was accompanied by two batteries each consisting of four eighteenpounders a portion of the defenders was posted on the strip of dry ground outside the gate where a battery with three guns had been mounted before daybreak colonel monson moved forward with two companies of the 76th regiment the enemy took the alarm before he reached their battery and fled towards the gate without waiting to discharge their guns  monson pressed after them in the hope of being able to enter before the gate was shut but he was too late the entrance was raked by the guns on the walls which opened with a destructive fire of grape ladders were applied to the walls but these were manned by so strong a body of pikemen that it was found impossible to gain a footing so bold were the defenders that as the soldiers fell back they ran down the ladders and pursued them hotly but were soon beaten off  a six pounder was brought up to burst open the gate but its fire did but little damage and a twelve pounder was then employed the gates yielded and the storming party rushed in but during the twenty minutes that had elapsed between the guns opening fire and the time at which the gate yielded the troops had been exposed to a terrible fire both of grape and musketry colonel monson was wounded and the loss was heavy  the second gate was forced with comparatively little difficulty although a terrible fire of artillery and musketry was kept up from the walls on either side of the road and from the bastion commanding it the assailants pressed so hotly upon the defenders of the second gate that they gained the third before the enemy had time to close it  but another and stronger gate had still to be passed and here a desperate stand was made the troops were obliged to take shelter close to the wall until the twelve pounder was brought up it was of little avail for the artillerymen were shot down as soon as they endeavoured to work it at length two or three officers gathered a party and made a rush at the wicket gate half a dozen muskets were discharged together at the lock and the gate at once gave way  the whole party rushed forward into the interior of the fortress gained the ramparts and opened fire on the enemy who in vain attempted to drive out the force gathered near the gate and pedron finding further resistance impossible surrendered  the loss of the victors in killed and wounded amounted to two hundred and twentythree while that of the garrison in killed alone exceeded two thousand an enormous quantity of military stores was found here the french having made it their chief depot the number of guns captured was two hundred and eightyone  on the 7th of september the army marched for delhi on the way general lake received a letter from monsieur perron saying that he had quitted the service of scindia and requesting a free passage to lucknow the easy capture of a fortress that he and his engineers had rendered as they believed impregnable and the loss of all his military stores sufficed to show him that he could not hope to withstand the progress of the british and that it was better for him to resign at once than to continue a hopeless struggle especially as the loss of alighur would excite the fury of scindia and possibly lead to his arrest and execution he had indeed received information that he had already lost scindias confidence and that intrigues were being carried on with some of his officers to deprive him of his jagheer and command  his request was therefore granted and escorted by a party of his own bodyguard and by some british dragoons he proceeded to lucknow and afterwards settled in the neighbourhood of chandernagore  the capture of alighur had indeed made a tremendous impression upon the native mind and as the army advanced several fortresses that might have made a long defence were abandoned  on the 11th general lakes army encamped within six miles of delhi but the tents were but just pitched when intelligence was received that a large force of the enemy was in position two miles distant it consisted of sixteen battalions of regular infantry six thousand cavalry and a large train of artillery commanded by monsieur bourquieu perrons second in command  general lake at once with the whole of his cavalry reconnoitred the position that the enemy had taken up it was two miles from the camp and consisted of a low hill covered by broken ground on each flank seeing that the enemy could only be attacked in front general lake ordered the infantry and artillery to come up  while waiting for their arrival the cavalry suffered some loss from the enemys artillery fire the general seeing that it was doubtful whether an attack on so strong a position would be successful determined to attempt to draw the enemy from it the cavalry advanced a short distance and then as the fire upon them redoubled they were ordered to fall back their line had hidden the approach of the infantry from the enemy and the latter believing that the cavalry were retreating left their entrenchments and started in pursuit with shouts of victory the cavalry opened right and left and the enemy found themselves face to face with a steady line of infantry who at once advanced the general himself leading them at the head of the 76th regiment  a tremendous fire was opened upon them by the mahratta guns but when within a hundred paces of the enemy the whole line fired a volley and then charged with the bayonet the enemy did not stand for a moment but seized by a panic fled in all directions pursued by the cavalry and the horse artillery battery these followed them as far as the banks of the jumna and great numbers of the enemy lost their lives in endeavouring to cross the river  the british loss in killed and wounded was nearly six hundred men while that of the enemy was estimated at two thousand sixtyeight pieces of cannon two waggons laden with treasure and thirtyseven with ammunition fell into the hands of the victors who on the 14th crossed the jumna and took possession of the city without opposition being welcomed enthusiastically by the population who had long groaned under the terrible oppression of their mahratta masters  two days later general lake paid a visit to the unfortunate emperor who was now eightythree years old he had been blinded by his brutal conquerors and lived in a state of misery and poverty greater than that of any of the tillers of the fields of the wide empire over which he had once ruled he lived for another three years and was succeeded by his son mirza akbar  leaving a force at delhi general lake marched southward as the strong town of agra was still in the possession of scindias troops he arrived before the city on the 4th of october and in three days had cut off their communication with the surrounding country his cavalry being assisted by five thousand horse sent by the rajah of bhurtpoor who had as soon as he heard of the fall of alighur hastened to enter into an alliance with the british  the garrison was strong and seven battalions of scindias regular infantry were encamped on the glacis and held possession of the town the garrison however refused to admit them into the fort as they had determined to share among themselves the large amount of treasure deposited there  inside the fort great confusion prevailed the troops had been commanded by english officers in scindias service and these had been imprisoned as soon as the war broke out no answer was therefore made to the summons to surrender  on the morning of the 10th scindias infantry were attacked they fought stoutly but were finally defeated and their twentysix brass guns captured two days later two thousand five hundred of them who had retired when defeated and taken shelter under the guns of the fort came over in a body and took service with the british  siege operations were at once commenced and on the 17th a battery of eight eighteenpounders opened fire with such effect that a breach was almost effected when the garrison released the british officers and sent them to the camp to offer to surrender they were allowed to do so and to leave the fort with their clothes but without arms six thousand then marched out under these conditions  one hundred and sixtyfour pieces of cannon with a vast quantity of ammunition and stores were found in the fort together with twentytwo lakhs of rupees which were divided among the captors  on the 20th harry with his little party joined the army he and his troopers had at benares resumed their uniform he at once waited on general lake and handed him the despatch in which general wellesley had described the victory at assaye  this is great news indeed sir the general said but i cannot understand how you have brought it here so speedily  i rode in disguise through berar sir and of course the troopers were also disguised except that i was attacked in one villagewhere i was recognized by a peasant who had seen me when i was staying as the governor generals envoy at nagpore before the capture of seringapatami got through without difficulty  yes i heard from the marquis of wellesley that the rajah had been kept from declaring against us by a young officer of great ability whom he had sent to nagpore for the purpose and who narrowly escaped assassination there when the news of the fall of seringapatam was received i think he said that you had a perfect knowledge of mahratti and also of hindustani and that he had sent you to accompany his brother general wellesley  well the news of assaye is welcome indeed and scindia will be very chary of weakening his army in the deccan by sending reinforcements in this direction  i see sir that general wellesley has begged me to temporarily place you on my staff as in the present troubled state of the country it would be dangerous to endeavour to make your way back to him of course i will gladly do so for your knowledge of the languages will be very useful to me for none of my staff can speak either of them well  general lake sent for the head of his staff introduced harry to him and informed him of the news that he had brought and then ordered a general salute to be fired by all the available guns in the fort and artillery batteries it was not long before the roar of cannon began telling the army that a splendid victory had been won in the west and a short time later notices were affixed to the gates of the forts and other public places relating how general wellesley with but four thousand five hundred men had routed the army of holkar and the rajah of beraramounting in all to over fifty thousand of whom ten thousand five hundred were disciplined troops commanded by frenchmen the news excited the utmost enthusiasm among the troops as the disproportion of numbers was far greater than it had been at the battle of delhi    chapter 16 a disastrous retreat   a few days later the news was received that seven of scindias regular battalions had just arrived from the deccan under the command of a french officer and had been joined by five others the whole amounting to nine thousand welltrained infantry with five thousand cavalry and seventyfive guns as it was understood that they were intending the recapture of delhi general lake marched against them on the 27th of october and pressing forward with all speed came up with them on the morning of the 1st of november they at once retreated and general lake whose infantry was still some distance in the rear determined to attack them at once as they retired the enemy cut the bank of a large tank and flooded the ground thereby impeding the advance of the cavalry and giving time to scindias men to take up a strong position between the villages of laswaree and mohaulpore  illustration plan of the battle of laswaree  their right was protected by a deep ravine their rear by a rivulet their front was lined with their seventyfive guns chained together so as to protect the artillerymen from a charge of horse the ground in front of them was covered with deep grass which partially concealed their disposition  the three brigades of cavalry charged boldly up but were received with a terrible fire and fell back with much loss and seeing the impossibility of carrying the enemys position without infantry general lake deferred making another attack until they came up as soon as these and the artillery reached the spot he prepared for an assault  the mahrattas had in the meantime changed their position and drawn up one line in front and one in rear of the village of mohaulpore the french officer who had been in command of their army had two days before left their camp and ridden to meet general lakes army and had there surrendered and a mahratta officer had succeeded him in command shaken by the repeated successes of the british he now offered to surrender his guns an hour was given him to do so but as no movement was made at the end of that time orders were given for the advance  the infantry consisted of the 76th regiment and six battalions of sepoys one of the three brigades of cavalry was directed to support them another was sent to the right to watch the enemy and to take advantage of any confusion that might appear among them the third brigade formed the reserve the four batteries of artillery were to support the attack general lakes plan was to turn the enemys right flank and he moved off his infantry along the bank of a rivulet which ran round near the right angle of the enemys new position the high grass for a time concealed the movement but as soon as the mahrattas perceived it they threw back their right flank and opened a tremendous fire upon the village  the british artillery now opened but the enemys cannon were far superior in number and were well served and the ranks of the 76th who were in front of the advance were terribly thinned the general was with them and as soon as a battalion and a half of sepoys had come up led them against the enemys position  the latter now opened with canister and the ground being of a broken character the formation of the assailants line was to some extent disordered and the mahratta cavalry charged they were repulsed by heavy volleys from the infantry but they rallied and being reinforced were about to resume the attack when the general ordered the 29th dragoons to charge they burst through both lines of the enemys infantry wheeled round and charged the cavalry and drove them from the field and then turning again fell on the rear of the second line which was now hotly engaged with the british infantry who following the dragoons at the double had rushed forward on the guns captured them and driven the first line back on the second  the rest of the british infantry had now come up but perrons regular infantry who were all drawn from hill districts and had been victorious in many a fight resisted to the last two thousand were surrounded and made prisoners but the rest all fought until they fell  the victory of laswaree cost the british eight hundred and twentyfour men killed and wounded but it completed the overthrow of the whole of the regiments trained by perron and de boigne and laid the tract of country watered by the jumna under the power of the british  harry who had accompanied the general having carried the order to the dragoons to charge rode with them and came unhurt out of the desperate fight  a few days later the army quitted laswaree and moved towards agra resting for a fortnight at besawur the great successes gained by both the british armies had had their effect and a number of rajahs came in to make a treaty of alliance general lakes force after a short rest then marched southward and took up a position at biana  while these events had been going on a detachment from the army had entered bundelcund this had been under the control of the peishwa but by an agreement made with him in august it was ceded to the company he receiving in exchange grants in the southern mahratta country and near surat he sent orders to this effect to his officers  shamsheer a descendant of the first peishwa refused to obey him and the british force entered bundelcund and being joined by a powerful chiefwith eight thousand irregular infantry four thousand horse and three regular battalions of infantry commanded by a european officercaptured several strongholds shamsheer then treated for peace but after having delayed the advance for two months finally broke off negotiations suddenly and the british at once laid siege to calpee which capitulated on the 4th of december finding himself unable to resist the farther advance of the british shamsheer then surrendered  in october ambajee inglia who had acted as scindias representative and held under him extensive territories had offered to renounce his dependence on scindia and become a tributary of the british negotiations were as usual spun out to a great length but a treaty was concluded with him on the 16th of december by which he agreed to surrender gwalior and the lands to the north of it and to remain as an independent sovereign of the other territories in his possession  a corps under colonel white was sent to take possession of the fortress the commandant refused to recognize the arrangement but upon batteries being erected a breach was soon effected and the garrison surrendered  the news came that scindia had broken his treaty and had been defeated with great slaughter by general wellesley who afterwards besieged the strong fortress of gawilghur guns were brought up with great difficulty over thirty miles of mountains and ravines they opened fire on the 13th of december and as soon as a breach was practicable the place was carried by storm and a large quantity of guns and ammunition fell into the hands of the british  the rajah of berar terrified at the defeat of scindia now sent to ask for peace and ceded the district of cuttack thereby placing the whole of the maritime provinces between madras and calcutta in the hands of the british scindia finding himself forsaken by his ally also made peace surrendering a considerable portion of his territories  1804 opened quietly but peace was not long maintained holkar had after his expulsion from poona made peace with scindia and when hostilities commenced had waited to see the result before committing himself at first he viewed with satisfaction the misfortunes that had befallen scindia and the rajah of berar but when he saw that they were threatened with annihilation he prepared to aid them he had however delayed too long and when scindia and the rajah of berar had been obliged to crave for peace he kept his army on the frontier of the rajah of jaipore now a british ally  general lake addressed a letter to him saying that the british government were willing to leave him unmolested but requiring as a pledge of his good intentions that he should withdraw into his own territory holkar sent back a long list of demands which were impossible to satisfy and also addressed a letter to generalnow sir arthurwellesley threatening to overrun the whole country unless some of the districts in the deccan were ceded to him and after sending off this letter he began raiding the territory of jaipore colonel murray was therefore sent to aid the rajah and to march in the direction of holkars capital while lord lake marched westward until he neared jaipore  on the 15th of may a detachment captured the strong fort of rampoora the sole fortress which holkar possessed north of the chumbul river and holkar immediately fell back the heat being now intense the general left colonel monson with five battalions of sepoys and three thousand irregular horse sent by rajpoot allies and returned to agra losing numbers of his men on the march by sunstroke  harry had been left with colonel monson the latter intending to cooperate with colonel murray entered holkars territory and on the way captured a strong hill fort he afterwards advanced fifty miles beyond the range of mountains that formed the frontier  on the 7th of july he heard that holkar was advancing with his whole army to meet him monsons force was much weakened by the absence of two detachments one of which had garrisoned the hill fort that had been captured and another had gone to fetch a supply of grain almost at the same time he heard a report that colonel murray intended to fall back  after consulting with harry who as one of lord lakes staff was considered as his special representative it was agreed that it would be madness with so small a force to give battle to holkar and at four in the morning on the following day monson sent off his baggage and stores and remained with his troops drawn up in order of battle until nine oclock leaving the irregular cavalry under lieutenant lucan to follow in half an hour and bring him intelligence of holkars movements  monson marched twelve miles when a trooper of the irregular cavalry overtook him with the news that they had been completely defeated by holkars army and that lucan had been made prisoner the retreat was continued and the force reached the pass across the mountains on the evening of the following day and took up a position there holkars cavalry appeared next morning and on the 11th holkar himself arrived and sent in a demand for the surrender of the cannon and muskets this was refused and holkar dividing his horse into three bodies charged the detachment vigorously in front and both flanks but the defenders again and again repulsed the attack holkar then drew off about four miles and was joined by the artillery and infantry  what is your opinion captain lindsay colonel monson said  if we had a regiment of british infantry with us sir i should say that we might attack them with success but with only four battalions of sepoys it seems to me that a retreat would be the better choice of two evils we shall undoubtedly suffer heavily the rain is pouring down unceasingly and i doubt whether we shall be able to get the guns along but we ought to be able to march as fast as holkars infantry and as to his cavalry we can certainly beat them off  two long marches were made the enemys cavalry swarmed round them but dared not attack and the force arrived safely at kotah where they expected to find food and shelter the rajah however closed the gates and refused to admit them and the force pressed on towards a ford on the chumbul the distance was only seven miles but from the incessant rain and the state of the road a whole day was spent in accomplishing it  the ford was impassable but during the night it subsided a little and they were able to cross a days halt was necessary in order to procure some grain and on the 15th when the march was continued the guns sank so deep in the mud that they could not be extricated and they were therefore spiked and abandoned  two days later the force reached another river but it was so swollen that it was unfordable the artillerymen were sent across on elephants but ten days were spent in carrying the rest of the troops over partly on elephants and partly on rafts terrible privation was suffered and many men were drowned in crossing while the wives and children of the sepoys who by some gross mismanagement were left to the last were slaughtered by the enemy under the eyes of their husbands and fathers  on the 29th the corps reached rampoora where a reinforcement of two battalions of sepoys six guns and a body of cavalry together with a supply of grain forwarded by lord lake from agra awaited them notwithstanding this reinforcement colonel monson considered it his duty to continue his retreat and on the 22nd of august reached the banass which was also in flood some boats however were found and a portion of the troops were carried across  early the next morning holkars cavalry appeared and encamped at a distance of four miles the next day the river was fordable and most of the baggage and four battalions crossed the enemys cavalry also crossed in great numbers both to the right and left of the british position  their artillery and infantry arrived in the afternoon and opened fire on the battalions still left on the bank harry was with these seeing that they were being decimated by the guns he called upon the sepoys to charge this they did with great spirit drove back the enemy and captured some of the guns but the mahrattas soon rallied and led by holkar himself charged in such overwhelming numbers that the handful of troops was nearly annihilated harry seeing that all was lost cut his way through the enemys horse and succeeded in crossing the river  illustration harry succeeded in crossing the river  colonel monson continued his retreat and reached kooshalpur on the night of the 25th he found that the native officer in command there had declared for holkar but that the fort which contained the elephants and baggage still held out that evening monson learnt that some of his sepoy officers were in communication with holkar and two companies and a large portion of the native cavalry deserted  the whole of the enemys cavalry now encamped round the detachment at seven in the evening colonel monson continued his march forming his troops into an oblong which the enemy in vain attempted to break on the night of the 27th after halting for a few hours he moved again at one in the morning but had no sooner cleared the broken ground than the enemys cavalry made a desperate charge this was repulsed with great coolness the sepoys reserving their fire till the enemy were within bayonet reach  at sunset the troops worn out by fatigue and hunger arrived at the biana pass but the enemy brought up their guns and the retreat was continued the confusion in the ranks which had been increasing all day now extended and the troops broke and fled to agra pursued by straggling parties of the enemy for the greater portion of the distance  in consequence of this disastrous affair it was decided that lord lake should immediately take the field although the wet weather still continued and a large tract of country was under water four weeks after the arrival of monson with his fugitives the army marched out of their cantonment and encamped on the right bank of the river  the situation was critical holkars army numbered ninetytwo thousand men of whom sixtysix thousand were cavalry and he had with him ninetytwo cannon he had advanced to muttra which had been abandoned at his approach  lord lake sent for harry  i have another dangerous mission for you captain lindsay i consider it more than possible that holkar will make an attempt to recapture delhi colonel ochterlony in command there must be warned of the probability of an attack he may be in ignorance of what is passing here you will bear this despatch urging on him to do all that he can to place the town in a state of defence and to summon to his assistance as many irregulars as possible from the neighbouring chiefs the distance is a hundred and twenty miles i leave it to you whether to go in uniform or in disguise  i think sir that i had better disguise myself as doubtless holkars cavalry are spread all over the country intent on plundering and should i fall in with them i ought to have no difficulty in passing myself off as one of themselves i will leave my uniform here to be brought on with the baggage they might take it into their heads to search my saddlebags  i think that would be the wisest plan the general said you will of course remain at delhi till reinforcements arrive there the despatches will be ready for you in an hours time  there was no difficulty in obtaining dye at agra and harry stained himself from head to foot put on the disguise in which he had ridden with the news of assaye and after receiving the despatch started at once the direct road lay through muttra but as holkars main body was at this town he rode to the northeast as far as secundara there was no occasion for any great haste for it was certain that some little time must elapse before holkar could march from muttra and he accordingly stopped for the night at coringunga having ridden about fifty miles he speedily secured a room and abdool at once set to to prepare a meal while it was being cooked there was a sound of a body of horse entering the village  it is unfortunate that we have stopped here abdool he said we are sure to be questioned  ten minutes later the door opened and an officer of holkars irregular horse entered  i hear that you have just arrived he said  yes i rode in but half an hour ago  where are you going  to sambol there seems no chance of fighting at present and i therefore left the army to pay a visit for a day or two to some friends my man has just prepared a meal will you share it with me  i will with pleasure the officer said for i have ridden from muttra and may have to wait an hour before my supper is ready for me what may be your name  puntojee and yours  wisnas  the officer unbuckled his sword and seated himself on the ground the room being entirely unfurnished  were you in that affair when we chased the english dogs from beyond the mountains to agra  yes i was in it and never wish to campaign in such weather again i was wet through for three weeks and hardly feel that i have got dry yet  they are brave fellows those sepoys in the english service  they are indeed harry agreed it seemed that we must destroy them and yet they withstood our attacks weary and exhausted as they must have been the worst of it was that after all our exertions there was no booty to be obtained  yes that was bad one doesnt feel so disposed to risk ones life when there is nothing to be gained we did not even succeed in capturing their treasure chest if we could have brought our infantry up we should have destroyed them but they had to march at the same rate as the guns and in such weather they could get along but slowly for it often required the bullocks of four guns to drag one through those quagmires  that was where the english had the advantage over us the road was no doubt bad enough for them it was infinitely worse for us after they had cut it up in passing  it was a mistake when scindia began to form regiments of infantry and holkar and the peishwa imitated him before that we had india at our mercy what power could withstand a hundred thousand horsemen here today there tomorrow then we had it in our power to waste all the country and to starve out the fortresses from cuttack to the north our territory extended from the great mountains on the east to the sea in the west  now we can only move at the pace of footmen and while formerly no infantry would venture to withstand our charge now as you see a handful of sepoys set us at defiance repulsed our charges and gained agra simply because our guns and infantry could not arrive to help us  there can be no doubt that you are right harry agreed but i cannot blame scindia and holkar for forming regiments of infantry trained by foreign officers they had seen how the regiments so raised by the english had won great victories in the carnatic and bengal and they did not think at that time that ere long they might become formidable to the mahrattas scindia and holkar raised their regiments not to fight against the strangers but against each other it was their mutual hostility that so diminished the strength of the mahrattas when dogs fight dogs the wild boar ravages the land  it is true enough the other said as a nation we might have ruled asia but divided among ourselves wasting our forces against each other we have allowed the stranger to wrest province after province from us  now i will go out and see that the men have all got quarters and that the people of the village are feeding them as they should in truth we have been having a bad time lately  yes indeed i thought myself lucky sometimes to get a handful of grain after twenty hours in the saddle  it cannot be helped comrade we must drive the strangers back towards allahabad recover benares agra and delhi and then we shall be able to rest in peace for a time before we settle accounts with scindia and the others who have made a disgraceful peace with the english we shall never have peace in the deccan till we sack and destroy bombay and force the last englishman to take to his ships  harry started with abdool before daybreak the next morning and riding all day reached delhi late in the evening putting up the horses he proceeded to the house occupied by colonel ochterlony the resident  will you tell the colonel he said that i am an officer with despatches from general lake  he was at once shown in colonel burns the commander of the garrison was with the resident neither was surprised that the messenger should be a native for they knew the difficulties a british officer would encounter in travelling from agra  i have ridden with a despatch for you colonel from general lake i am captain lindsay and have the honour of serving on the generals staff  i am glad to see you sir ochterlony said kindly your name is pretty well known to all of us as that of an officer who has successfully carried out several dangerous enterprises and this cannot have been one of the most dangerous of them for indeed in that disguise i do not think that anyone would entertain the slightest suspicion that you are not what you appear to be  i am told you speak mahratta perfectly  i was brought up among the mahrattas sir i have got through easily and only once came upon a body of holkars cavalry  you have just arrived captain lindsay  yes not ten minutes ago  the colonel rang the bell and directed a servant who came in to bring in wine and refreshments he then opened the despatches which after reading he passed across to colonel burns  of course we have heard reports of the disaster to monsons force was it as serious as they say  it was very serious sir i was with them and they suffered terribly they lost their guns and baggage and at least a third of their infantry  it is unfortunate very unfortunate captain lindsay we have had so many victories of late that the natives must have almost concluded that we were invincible but this check will encourage them and will doubtless bring many waverers over to their side  i dont think that it was in any way colonel monsons fault his column was to join that of colonel murraywho however doubtless learning the great strength holkar had with him fell backand with only five battalions of sepoys and a dozen guns it was practically impossible that monson could single handed resist the attack of ninety thousand men if he had had with him a couple of british battalions and a regiment or two of our cavalry he might have held the passes but alone it did not seem to me possible that he could do so especially when the enemys cavalry could have crossed the hills at other points and taken them in the rear even if he had resisted all attacks he must have been starved out  as being in a sort of way representative of general lake colonel monson was good enough to ask my opinion and i quite agreed with him that the best plan was to fall back we believed of course that we should find shelter at kotah but two days march in the rear and had not the rajah declared for holkar and shut his gates all would have been well for we beat off all attacks on our way there it was his treachery and that of the commandant of kooshalpur that caused the disaster  holkar is at muttra and lake is about to march against him  yes sir if holkar gives battle there he will no doubt be defeated but as this despatch will have informed you general lake feared much that as he advances holkar will content himself with harassing him on the march with a cloud of horsemen while with the main body of his army he marches rapidly north to endeavour to recapture delhi and obtain possession of the emperors person it is to warn you of that danger that i have ridden here  the danger is no doubt serious the resident said and the town is certainly in no position for defence the walls are in a most dilapidated condition and would crumble after a few hours cannonade colonel burnss force is wholly inadequate to defend a city of some ten miles in circumference the irregular troops cannot be relied upon in case of need however we must do what we can and as we may be sure that general lake will hasten on with all speed we shall not have to hold out for many days  now captain lindsay as you say that you only left agra yesterday morning and have ridden some eighty miles today i am sure you have need of rest the general has told me to employ you on any duty that i may think requisite therefore if you will come here at eight oclock tomorrow morning i shall be glad indeed of your services where did you leave your horses  i left them at a khan a few minutes walk from here  then if you will go down and tell your man to bring them up they can be put up in the stables here i have already ordered a room to be prepared for you my servants will give your man some food  the next morning harry after taking the early breakfast a servant brought to his room went down to colonel ochterlonys office  i have not brought my uniform with me colonel he said for i might have been searched  that does not matter two of my escort shall ride with you which will be sufficient to show that you represent me here is a list of the zemindars within fifteen miles of the city you will today visit as many of them as possible and request them to ride in to see me tomorrow morning i have directed that you are to have one of my horses for after the work yours has just had it will need two or three days rest  say nothing about the possibility of holkars coming here they might hang back if you did so i would rather meet them as a body and open the matter to them myself you will be able to see by their manner if any of them have thought of the possibility of the city being besieged if they have some of them will possibly excuse themselves coming though i think that the great majority will come for they must know well enough that if holkar took the city his troops would ravage the country as they have done all the villages through which they have passed and that therefore it is to their interest to aid in its defence  i am going now to see the emperor and to obtain from him an order for all the ablebodied men of the city to set to work under my orders and those of colonel burns to repair the fortifications at the points where an enemy would naturally attack them  in any case where you see that those you call upon make excuses for not coming in you have my full authority for telling them that all who do not do so will be regarded as our enemies and will be severely punished and their estates forfeited no excuse whatever will be accepted unless on your arrival you find that a man is seriously ill in which case you will order that his son or some near relation be sent to represent him  for the next three days harry spent his whole time on horseback and although it was evident to him that several of those he visited were averse to going into delhi none of them ventured to incur the displeasure of the english resident by an absolute refusal each morning therefore colonel ochterlony received those harry had visited on the previous day he told them frankly that it was possible that holkar might appear before the walls but assured them that he had no doubt of being able to resist all attacks until general lake arrived which he would be sure to do in a few days  in the meantime great numbers of men laboured at the walls the battlements had in some cases fallen and the gaps were filled up with sandbags the moat which had been neglected for many years was cleared out and the side made steeper so that an attacking party would have to use ladders both for descending into it and climbing out the bastions were repaired as far as could be done and the houses in the lane that ran round inside the wall were all loopholed for musketry  many of the irregular cavalry had deserted but the sepoys stood firm knowing how terrible were the cruelties perpetrated by holkar on all who fell into his hands their number was small but they were to some extent strengthened by the levies brought in by the zemindars  there was no time to be lost for on the 2nd of september general lake had approached to within a mile of muttra which had already been abandoned by holkar whose horsemen made their appearance before delhi on the 7th the irregular cavalry and those of the zemindars were ordered to attack them but as soon as they left the town they dispersed and rode away  the next day the enemys infantry and artillery came up and a heavy fire was immediately opened on the southeast angle of the city wall in twentyfour hours the whole of the parapet was demolished and some partial breaches made in the wall itself the sepoys encouraged by the presence and efforts of ochterlony and burns stood their ground with great courage and at nightfall laboured incessantly at repairing the breaches and in making a new parapet with sandbags  towards morning they formed up passed out through one of the breaches led by their officers made a rush at the battery that had been doing so much damage bayoneted or drove off the enemy stationed there and spiked the guns  in the meantime some guns had been playing against the southern walls here they were able to approach through gardens and the ruins of a village until near the defences and establishing a powerful battery opened fire and soon made a breach in the walls between the turkoman and ajmere gates  unable to hinder them the sepoys aided by a portion of the population worked from the morning of the 10th until that of the 12th to form an inner defence the houses near the breach were pulled down and the materials used for forming strong barricades at the mouths of the streets leading from it the houses themselves were loopholed and everything was prepared for a desperate defence during that day the guns continued to enlarge the breach and the sepoys who had laboured almost incessantly for four nights and days were able to lie down for some hours  that night passed quietly holkar had probably heard from adherents in the town of the retrenchment that had been formed and colonel ochterlony believed that the absence of any movement towards the breach was a sign that he was making preparations for a sudden attack at some other point sentries were placed along the walls facing the encampment of his army and just before dawn the discharge of a musket at the lahore gate showed that it was against it that the enemys attack was directed  the sepoys had been bivouacked in an open space in the centre of the city and they at once proceeded to the point threatened in the dim early morning light a great mass of men could be made out approaching and at the same moment fifty guns opened fire on the gate to cover their advance the cannon on the bastion by the gate replied directing their fire on the infantry column these however pushed forward with loud shouts many of them carried ladders and although suffering heavily from the musketry fireopened as soon as they came within easy rangethey placed the ladders against the wall and strove to climb them the face of the wall was flanked by the bastion and from this an incessant fire of musketry was maintained by a strong force of sepoys while others repulsed with the bayonet the efforts of their assailants to gain a footing and hurled backwards many of the ladders holkars men who had expected to effect a surprise and carry the wall before its defenders could arrive there soon lost heart and in a short time fled leaving most of their ladders behind them  the little garrison remained under arms all that day and the next night expecting another assault but on the morning of the 15th holkar and his army were seen marching away in the distance and on the 18th lord lake arrived  harry had not taken part in the defence of delhi he had on the day before holkars army arrived before the city ridden out to sekerah some fiveandtwenty miles away it was some distance beyond any point he had hitherto reached but the petty rajah who held a wide jagheer could put five hundred men in the field a small british force had been stationed there but it had been recalled at once when harry brought the news of the probable approach of holkar the rajah then promised to send three hundred of his troops to aid in the defence of the city but none had arrived and harrys mission was to urge him to send them off instantly  the rajah had however heard that holkars force was within a days march of the capital and entertaining no doubt that he would carry the feeble defences without difficulty had resolved to throw in his lot with him harry was now riding in uniform having obtained the loan of a jacket trousers and cap from one of the british officers of the garrison the rajah received him in his palace and harry saw at once by the scowling faces of the men who gathered round him that he had only waited for the news that holkars army was near delhi before throwing off the mask of friendship  i have come over rajah he said to tell you that colonel ochterlony requests that you will send every available fighting man to delhi at once he prays you to despatch as many as you can possibly gather together  the rajah replied coldly  why should i do so by tomorrow night holkar with his great army will have captured the town why should i send my men there to die fighting for strangers i take no orders from them i have received the emperors it is true but he is old and infirm and is a prisoner in your hands  i deny that he is a prisoner rajah he is treated with all honour and is in a very different position from that which he occupied when he was imprisoned by the mahrattas  the mahrattas are a great people the rajah answered angrily has not holkar driven a force of the infidels into agra and soon when he has captured delhi he will defeat the rest of them and carry his arms to benares  in that case harry said quietly it is a pity that he did not first crush the english army and then march to benares and finish with delhi at his leisure instead of so doing he has avoided a battle and is retiring north with his army  it is not true the rajah shouted he wishes first to gain possession of the capital to liberate the emperor and after that he will soon make an end of your people  he made a sign to those standing round him who immediately threw themselves upon harry the latter offered no resistance seeing that it would only lead to his being killed on the spot  he was at once dragged out from the audience chamber to the courtyard beyond he saw the bodies of the two native troopers who had accompanied him abdool who had also been with him was missing and knowing how watchful and active he was he hoped that he might have mounted and ridden off before he could be attacked    chapter 17 an escape   harrys arms were at once bound he was placed on a horse and escorted by ten natives was taken out of the town and after a ride of three hours arrived at the foot of a strong hill fort perched on a lofty rock here the party dismounted halfway up the hill they passed through a gate in the lower wall and then mounted to the fort where the officer in command received them and on reading an order from the rajah conducted the prisoner into a room at the summit of the highest tower his arms were then unbound and the governor and soldiers left the room locking and barring the door behind them  on the way harry had thought over his position it did not seem to him desperate if only holkar failed to capture delhi and even if he did so there was still some hope he had no doubt that the rajah was waiting to see how matters went if holkar captured the city he would probably send him in to him as a pledge of his goodwill but he might still hesitate until he saw the issue of the battle that was likely to be fought outside the walls when the english army arrived there he had hitherto affected friendship with the english and had offered no objection whatever to the small force being stationed near his town but doubtless the news of the disaster to colonel monsons force had shaken him and convinced him that the english were not invincible and that holkars immense army would inflict a decisive defeat upon them in which case those who had shown any friendly feeling towards the english would be made to suffer for itby devastation of their lands and the loss of their jagheer if not of their lives harry felt therefore that the success of the attack on delhi would probably be as disastrous to himself as to all the defenders of the city  his first impulse was to look out from the loopholes of the tower on the one side as he had noticed the rock fell sheer away from the foot of the wall to a depth of two or three hundred feet on the other side he looked down into a courtyard sixty feet below him this was surrounded by high and very strong walls bristling with cannon and with strong circular bastions at each corner  immediately below him was the flat roof of the house occupied by the rajah when staying at the fort and round the yard were low buildings doubtless containing provisions and munitions of war and some of them allotted to the picked corps who did duty there the huts for the rest of the garrison being lower down the hill near the second wall  in one corner of the room was a door on trying it he found it to be unfastened and opening it he walked out there was a flight of narrow stone steps in what was evidently a projecting turret ascending these he found himself on a flat roof on the top of the tower he spent half an hour here examining carefully the features of the ground and the defences of the fort the place though strong did not approach in this respect many of the hill forts that he had seen in the deccan and he concluded that a british force of moderate strength could easily effect its capture though if stoutly held it could defy native attack  he then returned to the room below half an hour later some armed natives entered one of them carried a large bundle of straw which he threw down in one corner another bore a dish of rice and a third a skin of water they had evidently been told not to address him for as soon as they had placed their burdens on the ground they retired without any remark  this is bad harry said to himself when they had left i would just as lief sleep on straw as on a bed but if i had had some blankets i might have made myself a rope though i dont think it would have reached the roof of the house below much less to the courtyard so that idea must be given up i have heard of fellows working their way through the floors of their cells but they have taken away my knife and there is not a scrap of furniture from which i could get some iron to manufacture a tool there is no concealing a knife when they bring my food for it is sure to be as it is todayrice or some other grain boiled and not even a spoon to eat it with  the door seems the only possible way though at present i cannot see where the possibility comes in it is of solid wood and strong enough to cage a tiger still if i am to get out i fancy that it must be through the door  a closer examination of it did not increase his hopes even when he pushed his hardest against it it did not yield in the slightest degree he sat down on the straw and turned over every possible idea in his mind no scheme of getting out of the difficulty presented itself  the only chance that i can see is that instead of four fellows coming up with the man who brings my food there may be only two taking them by surprise and snatching a weapon from them i might manage three of them but i could not even hope to silence five before they gave the alarm  i hope that abdool got away safely i think that if he did he was likely when he had once shaken off pursuit to come back and try to find out what had become of me his face could not have been particularly noticed for i expect the troopers were attacked as soon as i entered that scoundrels house and if he took off his uniform and went in in native dress there would be little chance of his being recognized when he finds out where i have been taken he will no doubt go back to delhi and report but with holkar within two miles they have too much on their hands to think of sending to demand my release if holkar fails to take the place and retires as lake approaches there will no doubt be a hot pursuit and certainly they could not send two or three hundred men here less than that would be of no good whatever the rajah has committed himself by the murder of my troopers and as he cannot hope for forgiveness he would either fly to oude or else move in here with his force with which he would think himself safe from anything short of an army  it is certain that with such important work on hand no men can be spared for a rescue expedition no there is not a shadow of chance unless holkar is defeated  having settled this matter in his mind and decided that no amount of thinking would enable him to see a way of escaping harry dismissed the subject from his thoughts ate his rice and lay down as soon as it became dark having had but little rest for the past week  two days passed as he was sitting on the platform over his cell he heard a distant boom and knew that holkar was besieging delhi the next day to his satisfaction the sound of cannonading was again distinct  at any rate he said to himself holkar has not carried the place by a sudden rush there is a regularity about the fire that shows that it is deliberate no doubt they are breaching one of the walls  going to the other side of the platform he saw that a good many of the rajahs followers were standing on the wall listening to the firing the wall itself was some thirtyfive feet below the spot where he was standing neither loophole of his cell commanded a view of it so that a prisoner could hold no conversation with the guard below  presently another man came up on to the walls and approached the group there he was like the others dressed in a small white turban a short jacket made of unbleached hemp underneath which was a loose tunic bound at the waist with a sash and coming down to the knees he carried a spear and matchlock and across his shoulder a small shield was slung the others did not turn round and when a few yards from them he looked up at harry and the latter saw to his delight that he was abdool  harry dared not make any gesture that might be noticed but he nodded his head slightly and walked to the other side of the platform where he remained for a short time and then returned abdool looked again in his direction but continued to talk with the others as to the attack upon the town and agreed with them that holkar would make short work of its defenders  presently the whole party descended to the courtyard together some of them went down to the lower wall to talk to their comrades there but whether abdool accompanied them or was still in the fort harry could not make out he did not indeed remain long on the platform but after looking towards delhi for some little time he went down to his room  it was evident that abdool had enlisted in the rajahs service and had no doubt been engaged by the governor of the fort the rajah would be uneasy in his mind and would assuredly take on any men that presented themselves in order to strengthen himself if holkar failed to take the town and also to gain the latters approbation by joining him with as large a force as possible probably abdool had only enlisted on the previous day and would of course need time to acquaint himself with the fortifications the position of the guards and the manner in which he could best communicate with him  harrys meals were brought up twice a day at seven oclock in the morning and at nightfall hitherto he had been quiet and patient as there was nothing to be done but to await the course of events now that he knew abdool was there and would certainly endeavour to open communications with him it was difficult for him to keep quiet and he passed hours in pacing round and round his room occasionally he went up to the roof but he could see no signs of abdool and therefore remained but a short time on the lookout as were he to keep on watching the courtyard it might attract notice and the idea might occur to someone that he was expecting some signal to be made to him  three days passed without a sign and then when the guard came in with his ration harry saw that abdool was one of the number as he glanced at him abdool who was standing a little way behind the others shook his head and retired with them harry felt a momentary disappointment but saw at once that nothing could be attempted in broad daylight and that it was at night only that there was a possibility of success he thought that abdool had only come up in order to see the nature of the fastenings of the doors and the general position  he was not with the party who came up in the evening but in the centre of his rice harry found a small piece of paper rolled into a ball there was not however light enough to enable him to read it but he lay awake half the night and at the first gleam of daylight went up on to the platform and seating himself so that he was not visible from below waited till he could see to read the letter it was of course in mahratti and so badly written that he had difficulty in deciphering it he finally however made it out  tomorrow evening when i come up we will attack the others if all goes well if not will try the next evening  so intent was he in deciphering the writing that he had hardly noticed the outburst of heavy firing in the distance he had feared the enemy had captured delhi on the previous day as he had heard no firing but now the roar of cannon was very heavy and he had no doubt that holkar was trying to take the town by assault  in less than half an hour the sound ceased suddenly  they have either taken the town or been beaten off decisively he said to himself  in the afternoon he saw a party of horsemen approaching followed by some palanquins  that looks hopeful he said to himself a messenger has probably brought the rajah news that the assault has failed and he is bringing his zenana here for safety until he hears the issue of the battle which will probably take place in a day or two i wonder whether this will upset abdools plans  the rajahs return was greeted by the discharge of matchlocks presently however this was succeeded by cries of rage and a clamour of voices  holkar has been thrashed now it is a toss up whether the rajah will in his anger send up and have me brought down and executed i think the chances are in my favour the fellow is evidently crafty or he would not have persuaded ochterlony that he was friendly towards us and i think he will hold me as a sort of hostage so that if holkar is defeated he may make favourable terms for himself by offering to surrender me  it was not until an hour later that harry heard a party ascending the stairs when the door opened he saw that two of the men carried torches abdool who was in the rear closed the door behind him and then said now sahib and struck down the man in front of him with his tulwar  harry had risen to his feet as he heard the men coming and had braced himself up for a spring when abdool gave the word with a blow straight from the shoulder he struck the man carrying the dish senseless to the floor tore the sword from his sash warded off a hasty blow delivered by one torch bearer who was too much astonished at the sudden attack to act with decision and cut him down while at the same moment abdool almost severed the neck of the other  thanks abdool harry said grasping his followers hand you have saved my life  not yet sahib our work has but begun there are other dangers to be met however the arrival of the rajah has been fortunate the news he has brought hasbut first let me finish the man you knocked down  there is no occasion for that tear his sash into strips and bind his hands and feet and gag him with his own turban  now what is our next step  i have a rope round my body sahib to lower ourselves on to the ramparts i am wearing an extra suit of clothes so that you can get up as one of the garrison i think we have plenty of time for it is not likely that these men will be missed everyone is too excited by the news that holkar has failed to take delhi to notice whether we return or not  he took off the outer garment that he had brought with him while harry removed his uniform and attired himself in it and placing the turban of one of the soldiers on his head possessed himself of a shield spear and dagger and then said  what next abdool  we will put out these torches sahibthese were still burning on the floorthe light might be noticed from below and they might wonder why we stayed here so long  are there any guards on the walls  no sahib they have them on the lower wall but not here  the torches were extinguished and then they went up to the platform above they fastened one end of the rope to the battlement having first tied knots at short intervals  i will go down first on to the wall sahib and if by chance any man may have come up from below which is not likely i can hide and he at once commenced to lower himself down  in two or three minutes abdool was joined by harry the courtyard was dark save that a few torches burned here and there a great babble of talking was going on and the windows of the rajahs house were lighted up  what are your plans abdool i see that we shall be able to get through the gates here without fear of discovery is the gate through the other wall shut  yes sahib it is always closed at sunset except where the road comes up to the gate there is only one place where the rock projects at the foot of the wall and there is a possibility of climbing down that was where i had intended we should cross the wall the height is but twenty feet there and i have another rope of that length there are no sentries placed except over the gate  it is quite possible that even there there is none tonight there is no order among these fellows as there is among the companys troops and as there is no enemy near they think that such a watch is unnecessary and if any have been sent there they are pretty sure to have gone to the huts to talk over the news from delhi the matter should be easy enough  we may as well start at once these fellows will quieten down presently and will then be more likely to hear any noise we may make  looking about they went down by the stairs leading to the courtyard and walked carelessly across taking care to avoid mingling with the excited groups and at the same time keeping as far from the torches burning in the courtyard as possible they passed through the gatewhich was standing open without a guardand followed the zigzag road with towers placed at its corners each mounting two guns so as to sweep the approach  there were two high walls on either hand loopholed for musketry and abdool said that there was a platform wide enough for two men to pass along the whole length of it the road terminated in a heavy gate some forty yards above that through the outer wall a bastion covered it so that were the lower gate carried an enemy would not be able to bring guns to bear against it this gate stood open and passing through it and behind the bastion they came at once upon the low stonebuilt huts where the majority of the garrison lived in time of peace  several torches were burning here and round each of these were groups of men talking excitedly leaving harry behind one of the huts abdool strolled up for a few minutes to listen to the conversation and then rejoined his master  what are they saying abdool  they are saying sir that it was wrong of holkar to attack the city before he had defeated the english it has cost many lives but when the english are defeated he will be able without doubt to capture the city which probably would open its gates to him seeing that no assistance could come to them  no one doubts then that holkar will defeat us  not in the least abdool replied they say that he has two hundred cannon these will mow down the english then the cavalry will charge and there will be an end of the matter  they seem to have forgotten all about laswaree harry said but we had better be going where is the way up to the wall  close by sahib  they ascended the steps as far as could be seen the wall was entirely deserted and they made their way cautiously until close to the gate harry then stopped and abdool went on with noiseless tread he soon returned  it is as i thought no sentries are yet posted  but that tower over the gate abdool is a great deal too high for us to descend by that rope that you have got  yes sahib we go out by an entrance on to a bastion flanking the gate the rope will be long enough there or at any rate there will be but a very short drop  they entered the tower through the door communicating with the wall abdool led the way  keep close to me sahib i went down here this morning and can find my way in the dark i did not think that there was much chance of our coming this way but it was better to find out all about it  moving slowly and cautiously they came to a flight of steps they descended some twenty feet and found themselves at an open portal leading on to the flanking bastion the rope was soon fixed  i will go first sahib and will let you know how far you will have to drop for the wall looks to me higher than it was at the point where i intended to descend  illustration abdool at once slipped down  it was tied round the neck of a gun and abdool at once slipped down there was a pause then a slight dull sound and the rope hung loose  the knot at the end is ten feet from the ground abdool said in a low tone  that is near enough harry replied and then he swung himself over  when he came to the last knot he lowered himself to the full length of his arms and let go the fall was not much more than a yard and abdool stood close by ready to catch him should he miss his foothold on alighting  they at once started at a rapid pace down the hill they had nearly reached the plain when the deep note of a horn was heard  that is the alarm harry exclaimed they have found out that i have gone  they will soon be after us but there is no fear of their catching us abdool said as they broke into a trot no one will know at first what has happened everyone will run to his post then they will have to search the fort and all the ground between it and the lower wall all that will take time it may be an hour before horsemen start  i did not think that they would miss you till tomorrow morning  i suppose the rajah sent up for me to amuse himself by threatening me he would hardly venture to do more until he is sure that holkar has defeated us however as you say there is very little chance of their catching us  as soon as they were down on the plain harry went on  we had better strike north for an hour or two they are sure to ride across the plain in the direction of delhi thinking we shall make straight for the city  that will be best sahib  fortunately the rain had ceased and the sky was cloudless so that they were able to direct their course by the stars for two hours they kept due north and then turned west it was a long journey from the point where they turned harry calculated that it would be nearly fifty miles the fort was some fifteen miles northeast of sekerah and they were now farther away from delhi than they had been when they started he felt the advantage of the light native dress and the sandals that abdool had given him instead of his boots  when they came across cultivated ground they walked but a great portion of the country was a sandy waste with the ruins of villages and temples that had in the palmy days of the empire stood there across this they went at a trot for the sand was generally compact enough to sustain their weight  we shall hardly get there before day breaks sahib abdool remarked  no but that is of little consequence probably by this time holkar will have marched awayeither to give battle or what is more likely to recruit and for many miles round delhi the country will be rejoicing at having been spared the ruin that would have befallen it had he taken the city so i have no fear that we shall be hindered on the way for though they may wonder at my appearancefor the dye has now almost worn off and anyone can see that i am a whitethey will be all the more willing to render us any assistance  there is no fear of the rajahs horsemen keeping up the pursuit beyond halfway between sekerah and the city for they must know that all the zemindars and people round it are in our favour and that they might be attacked when beyond the limits of the rajahs jagheer  when morning broke they could see in the distance the minarets of delhi  they must be ten miles away abdool and i will enter the next house we come to i fancy from our position we must be close to the residence of the zemindar who at once brought in a force of fifty men to aid in the defence of the town there we are sure of hospitable treatment and indeed i sorely need rest and food i have eaten nothing since yesterday morning and counting the distance we made to the north after leaving the fort we must have walked nearly fifty miles  half a mile farther they saw a house and made straight for it  is shuja khan within harry asked an armed retainer standing at the entrance  the soldier recognized harryhaving seen him when he called upon his masterand replied  he returned last night my lord  will you tell him that captain lindsay who was treacherously captured by the rajah of sekerah has just escaped and is on his way to the city and that he asks for his hospitality  enter my lord the man said salaaming deeply our master will i am sure gladly receive you  he showed harry into a large room where a few minutes later the zemindar joined him  peace be with you sahib i am rejoiced to see you in safety for i heard at delhi that you had not returned and there were fears that ill had befallen you and your escort  my escort were killed and i myself carried a prisoner to the rajahs hill fort and i have owed my escape to the faithfulness of my servant who got away when the others were massacred and disguising himself got into the fort and contrived my escape  all honour be to him the zemindar said then you have walked all night  yes we went ten miles to the north first knowing that we should be pursued for we heard the alarm given just after we started we have walked fifty miles and when i say that i have eaten nothing since yesterday morning you may be sure that we are sorely in need of refreshment  it shall be got ready at once sahib and while it is being prepared you can take a bath and a change of garments  i need the bath almost as much as i need a feed harry laughed i have just been looking into the glass and i see that i am wellnigh as dark as when i came to you nine or ten days ago  his host led him to a room containing a bath which was soon filled by the servants one of whom brought in a handsome suit of the zemindars clothes it was more than half an hour before he went down again as soon as he entered the room a servant brought in a meal consisting of slices of meat on a skewer and a pillau of chicken  the zemindar sat by while he ate his meal and harry gave him a short account of the manner in which he had effected his escape the former in turn related the events of the siege adding that spies had brought in the news late in the afternoon that holkar would march away in the morning as he had heard that the english army was but two days distant  was he going to meet the english or to retire towards malwar  that i cannot say sahib for the spies could not tell us doubtless he and his army are much dispirited at their failure to take the city but the general opinion of the townspeople was that he would give battle be victorious and would return and continue the siege  i have no fear of his being victorious he knows in the battles of assaye and poona how scindia was utterly routed and how at laswaree and delhi the mahrattas were scattered and i do not think that he will venture upon giving battle but if he does i have no fear whatever of the result it was more than his whole army could do to break up monsons force although composed entirely of native infantry until it was near agra this time there will be british infantry and cavalry and the mahrattas will never stand against their charge  harry had already enquired about abdool and found that he had also had a meal and was now asleep  now sahib shuja said it were best that you should rest for a time there will be nought doing in delhi today and after the heat of the day is over we can supply you with horses and an escort  harry accepted the invitation for he was stiff and sore from his exertions the man showed him to a room that had been prepared for him and he was soon fast asleep he did not awake until the sun was getting low he at once went downstairs  the horses are ready the zemindar said but i pray you to take a meal before mounting it is ready and will be served directly  harry who had been too tired to do justice to his food in the morning was by no means sorry to take another meal as he rose to go he thanked the zemindar most heartily for his kindness  it is an honour that you have bestowed upon me the zemindar said courteously you and your brave countrymen are fighting to free us from the oppression of the mahrattas and any one of your race would meet with a hearty welcome here  the horses were now brought round the one intended for harry was a very handsome animal richly caparisoned  it is a fine horse indeed he said as he was about to mount  the horse is yours sahib shuja khan said he is of good breed and will carry you far and fast i shall esteem it a great honour that you should ride him  do not thank me i pray you tis but a little thing to do for one of our brave defenders of whose deeds one of your officers was telling me when he was deploring your loss  i thank you most heartily khan and after the manner in which you have given it i cannot refuse so handsome a present i shall be proud to ride such an animal and you may be sure that as i do so i shall often think of him who presented it to me and shall assuredly mention to colonel ochterlony the very great kindness with which you have received me  as he rode off followed by an escort of four of the zemindars retainers he saw with satisfaction that abdool was also attired in clean white garments  you have done well i hope abdool  i have been well treated indeed sahib and the zemindars head man told me that i was to consider the horse on which i ride my own he will carry me well for he is a stout and serviceable animal i was wondering what we should do for horses for there are but few in the city as most of those owning them sent them away with their valuables on hearing of holkars approach  the zemindar is a generous man indeed he has as you heard presented me with the horse that i am riding it is certainly a splendid animal and though my own was a good one this is far better in fact i have seen no handsomer horse anywhere  i wish you had as good a one abdool and then we need not fear being overtaken though half the mahratta army were in pursuit  they entered the city by the northern gate and saw nothing of the enemy who were encamped on the other side of the city harry was most warmly received by colonel ochterlony  i have been in much anxiety about you he said that you had been detained was certain but i hoped that that petty rajah would not have ventured to harm you for he would be sure that sooner or later we should have a heavy reckoning with him  i fancy sir that he was waiting for news from here he was convinced that holkar would take the city and defeat lord lake had he done so i have no doubt that he would either have sent me prisoner to him or would have despatched me and forwarded only my head as i felt certain that things would not turn out as he stated i had no great fear for my life but i thought that i might have been kept a prisoner for a very long time for lord lake would have his hands full in other directions  then he released you on the news that holkar had failed to capture the city  no sir i got away owing to the fidelity of my orderly who after riding off himself when the two troopers with me were attacked and killed entered a hill fort where i was confined took service there and contrived my escape i shall hand in a report with the details for your perusal when things have quietened down a bit my man has rendered me other valuable services and i should be greatly pleased if in consideration of the fidelity and daring that he has shown you would think fit to recommend him for promotion as a native officer he belongs to the 3rd bombay cavalry  i should certainly have pleasure in doing so captain lindsay i shall of course be drawing up a list of the zemindars and others who have rendered service and recommending them for reward to the government if you will give me the particulars as to the mans name and services i will include him in the list he has been with you some time has he not  yes sir for upwards of six years he accompanied me from calcutta to nagpore when i went on a mission to the rajah whom it was desirable to keep neutral until the war in mysore was brought to an end he was at assaye and journeyed in disguise across the country with me to carry the news of that victory to general lake he took part with me in the cavalry charge at laswaree and in the retreat of colonel monsons column  that is quite good enough colonel ochterlony said but i should think that it would be the shortest and best way for you to recommend him direct to lord lake who would be able to put him in orders at once at the same time i will send to calcutta a recommendation that some special reward should be granted to him there will be a large number of forfeitures of the estates of those who have sided with scindia and holkar i make no doubt that on my strong recommendation he will obtain a grant of the revenue of a village or two such a grant would do good by showing that instances of fidelity even in the case of a private soldier do not go unnoticed or unrewarded we expect the generals arrival here in a couple of days  i shall be very glad sir if only because my uniform is coming on with his baggage at present with my white face and this showy native dress i feel that i am stared at by everyone i meet the uniform that captain ewart lent me i had to leave behind when i made my escape  it will not inconvenience him poor fellow the colonel said for he was almost cut in two by a cannon shot as the enemy advanced to the last assault  when the general arrived within three miles of the city harry rode out to his camp and having first obtained his uniform went in to report himself  so you got through safely captain lindsay i supposed that you had when the news reached us that delhi was defending itself stoutly for had they not had some days warning they could hardly have held out for an hour  this is colonel burnss report of the military operations of the siege sir and this is a letter from the resident and this is my own report of my doings since i left you at agra  thank you captain lindsay i shall have a communication to send to colonel ochterlony this afternoon and should be obliged if you will carry it for me  harry bowed and left and then joined the officers of the staff who were just sitting down to lunch and were all glad to see him again  so you managed to get through holkars lines lindsay  oh yes i met with no difficulty and only fell in once with any of his troops i spent an evening with their officer and after that rode through without interruption there was really no danger and i do not think holkar himself could have suspected me of being a british officer  and now about the siege you may imagine that we were all very anxious about it for though of course we should soon have retaken the place there would have been a general plunder and massacre by that brute holkar  you must wait for particulars until you get there harry said for i know nothing about it whatever except what i have heard  and how is that  i was at the time a prisoner in the hands of the petty rajah of sekerah he promised to send in three hundred men the day before holkar arrived i was sent to urge him to despatch them instantly to aid in the defence he was evidently impressed with the idea that holkar was going to retake the place without any difficulty and would afterwards annihilate our army so thinking that was the winning side he arrested me and sent me off to a hill fort fifteen miles away and murdered my two troopers  and how did you get away  harry gave an account of the manner in which abdool had managed his escape  such a fellow as that is a jewel  he is indeed major and i would not part with him for any money he came round with me from bombay to calcutta six years ago and has ridden with me ever since he fought most gallantly in the malay peninsula and at many other places in my report to the general of my last adventure i have mentioned his services with me in my various journeys and have strongly recommended his promotion  he well deserves it the major said he has like you carried his life in his hand for if he had been detected undoubtedly he would have shared your fate    chapter 18 an awkward position   three hours later harry was sent for by the general  i have read your report captain lindsay and thoroughly concur with you that the very meritorious conduct of the soldier of the 3rd bombay cavalry who has so long been attached to your service should be rewarded i cannot of course promote him in his own regiment he will therefore appear in orders tomorrow as appointed havildar in the 5th bengal cavalry which is at present under my command with a statement that having now completed ten years service in the bombay army and having for six years of it been serving chiefly in this presidency and having distinguished himself by his fidelity and courage he has now been specially singled out for this promotion and will be henceforth in charge of an escort of twenty men of his new regiment attached to the generals staff  as to yourself sir i have in a despatch that will be sent off this evening strongly recommended you to the governor general for promotion to the rank of major you were i see by our army list promoted to the rank of captain seven years ago before being sent to calcutta and considering the distinguished and dangerous services that you have rendered i wonder that you have not received another step that is however accounted for by the fact that you have now for some time been away from calcutta with general wellesley and myself i am sure that my recommendation will at once be complied with  i am very grateful for your kindness sir  you owe it to your own merits and not to any kindness on my part lord lake said you have an altogether exceptional record and even in the comparatively short time that you have been with me have performed most valuable services colonel monson reports most highly of your conduct during his retreat and the mission that you undertook at my request to colonel ochterlony was a most dangerous one and in itself sufficient to ensure your promotion there are many zealous officers in the service but few indeed so qualified by their acquaintance with the native languages as to undertake the missions with which you have been entrusted and have so successfully carried out  harry took the despatches and at once mounted his horse which abdool had brought round as soon as his master was summoned to the generals tent after he had left the camp he called abdool up to his side the latter was still in his native dress  abdool i shall have to look out for another cook and body servant unless indeed i have another trooper told off to me  abdool looked at harry in astonishment  how is that my lord are you dissatisfied with me  harry laughed  not in any way abdool upon the contrary but your name will appear in orders tomorrow as promoted to the rank of havildar in the 5th bengal cavalry as a recognition of your faithful services  it is a great honour abdool said especially as i have not served as a soubahdar but i would far rather stay with you you have been a father to me and i pray you to let me remain as i am  you are to remain with me abdool if you had had to leave me i should myself have told the general that i was sure you would rather not do so and that when you left me i should myself show my gratitude for your good services but of his own accord he has arranged this you are not to join your new regiment but are to command twenty sowars of the 5th which are to be attached to those of the generals staff for escort duty in this way you will still be with me but as a native officer instead of a servant and should i be sent on any special duty you will i am sure be able to go with me as before  abdools face brightened  that would be well indeed sahib it will truly be a great honour to be an officer and if i ever return to my native village in the deccan i shall be regarded with great respect and the faces of my father and mother will be made white at the honour i have won still i fear that i shall not be as much with you as i have been before  nearly as much abdool i expect that lord lake knowing how much i am indebted to you will permit me to take you with me when engaged on any detached service and you and your troopers will form part of his escort at all times besides it is likely that as matters stand i shall not be sent away on any special duty for some time to come you will i know be glad to hear that the general has recommended me for promotion also and that i shall shortly be a major  that pleases me more than my own promotion sahib i thought that you would have had it long ago after that business at nagpore  i had only been a captain then a few months and was very young for that rank it would have been unfair to others if i had been promoted then i am still very young to be a major  it is not years but what you have done abdool said did you not obtain the release of nana furnuwees and so change the state of affairs altogether at poona  well it was for that i got the rank of captain and since then though i have made a few journeys that would have been perilous had i not been able to speak mahratti like a native i have had no opportunities of specially distinguishing myself  as soon as we get to delhi you had better order yourself a uniform you know the dress worn by the native officers of the 5th and you must hurry the tailor on for you may be sure that the army will not remain long at delhi but will set off to meet holkar as soon as provisions are collected for there is no saying how far we may have to march before we meet him i do not think that he will be in any hurry to give battle  on the 18th of october the army arrived before delhi holkars cavalry were still in the neighbourhood but news came that the infantry with a considerable number of his guns and a few thousand horsemen had left him on the 29th he crossed the jumna below panniput to attack a detachment of one battalion of sepoys and some matchlock men who were under colonel burns returning to the station at saharunpoorfrom which he had hastened when a report reached him that holkar meditated an attack on delhi he was overtaken by holkar at shamlee  the inhabitants of the place joined holkar but burns formed his camp into a square and repulsed all attacks until general lake with six regiments of cavalry the horse artillery and a brigade of infantry arrived to his relief on the 3rd of november when holkar at once retired and marched south into the district known as the doab where his horsemen plundered and burnt every village near his line of route general lake followed at once  he had before leaving delhi sent the rest of the british infantry with two regiments of cavalry under general fraser to attack holkars infantry and artillery which had retired into the dominions of the rajah of bhurtpoor who although he had been the first to enter into alliance with the british after the capture of agra had now declared against them they had taken up a position near the rajahs fortress of deeg which was believed to be impregnable  their position was a very strong one an extensive morass and a deep tank covered their front on their left was a fortified village and on their right the fort of deeg which was supported by several lines of batteries  harry had been directed to accompany general fraser and was to take with him abdools little troop to serve as escort and furnish messengers abdoolnow in his new uniformrode at its head behind general frasers staff as he reconnoitred the enemys position and felt no small pride in his changed position especially as the british officers of the staff all of whom had heard of the manner in which he had brought about harrys escape took special notice of him and on the march one or other had often dropped behind to have a talk with him  the next morning the british troops moved forward to the attack in two lines the 76th regiment rushed impetuously against the fortified village and drove its defenders out at the point of the bayonet a tremendous fire was at once opened by the batteries behind it but without for a moment hesitating the 76th charged them and were speedily in the thick of their enemies the 1st bengal european regiment which followed seeing them almost surrounded ran down to their assistance and were followed by the sepoys and holkars infantry unable to resist the assault fled to shelter of their next line of guns  general fraser himself led the attack upon these they were also carried but the general fell mortally wounded colonel monson who now succeeded to the command reformed the troopswho were in some disorder owing to the impetuosity of their chargeand led them forward again battery after battery was captured numbers of holkars men tried to cross the morass but sank in the mud and lost their lives the rest took refuge under the walls of deeg whose guns at once opened fire upon their pursuers  while the tide pressed forward unchecked the mahratta horse had ridden down in the rear of the british and had taken possession of the first line of batteries and had turned their guns upon their late captors the consequences would have been serious had not captain norford gathered together twentyeight men of the 76th regiment and led them against the mahratta horse these staggered by the daring with which this handful of men advanced against them fired a hasty volley and fled captain norford was killed but the men took possession of the guns which the mahrattas thinking that the day was altogether lost did not attempt to recapture  as the fortress of deeg was far too strong to be attacked by any force unprovided with siege guns the british drew back until beyond the range of its cannon carrying off all the guns captured in the batteries eightyseven in number the total amount of artillery employed against our troops was no less than one hundred and sixty guns our loss was naturally heavy amounting to over six hundred and forty killed and wounded while that of the enemy was estimated at two thousand killed or smothered in the morass  the force encamped beyond the reach of the guns of deeg awaiting orders from general lake the battle was scarcely over when colonel monson rode up to harry and said  it is of great importance that general lake should receive the news of our victory as soon as possible there is no one so well fitted to carry it as you are there will be no occasion for disguise this time for holkars depredations must have excited the whole population against him at the same time you had better take your havildar and his troopers with you it will command respect and if you should come across any small body of holkars marauders i am sure that you will give a good account of them  can you give me any indication as to where general lake is likely to be at present sir  he marched from shamsheer to mahomedabad and as he probably took the road through sekerah he no doubt settled accounts with that rascally rajah i understood from him that he suspected holkar would make for sherdanah as the begum of that place has five battalions of drilled troops and forty guns which would be a welcome reinforcement after that he will of course be guided by holkars movements  the reports of the peasantry lead me to believe that the enemy are advancing in the direction of furukabad i should say that you had best cross the jumna at muttra and ride to alighur in that way you will not be likely to meet holkars force which must at present be beyond the ganges  half an hour later harry started with his escort he crossed the jumna at muttra and there learned that holkar had the night before arrived within twelve miles of the town and was as usual destroying everything before him harry continued his course to cod within a mile or two of alighur which he reached late in the evening  the capture of the fort believed to be impregnable had had the effect of producing so profound a respect for the british arms that harry on his arrival was received by the principal men of the town and a large house was placed at his disposal for himself and his escort supplies were at once furnished and when a meal had been eaten and the horses attended to the troops lay down for the night  harry had been informed that a horseman had brought in news that the british army had arrived at bareilly he started at daybreak and late the next evening after a ride of over one hundred miles rode into lord lakes camp  what news do you bring the general asked as he alighted from his horse  i have to report sir that on the 13th the force under general fraser attacked the enemy who were very strongly posted within gunshot of the fortress of deeg after hard fighting he completely defeated them captured eightyseven of their guns and drove them from under the guns of deeg which at once opened fire on us the enemys loss was estimated at two thousand ours was not known when i left the camp but it was roughly estimated at over six hundred in killed and wounded among the former i regret to say was general fraser who was mortally wounded by a cannon shot while leading on his men  i am sorry to hear of his loss general lake said while the rest of your news is satisfactory indeed reports had reached me that the rajah of bhurtpoor had joined holkar but after coming into agra and begging that we would accept him as an ally i had difficulty in believing that he would have turned against us especially as he must have known that if holkar was defeated he would have to bear the whole brunt of our angerwhich he could not hope to escape as his territory lies within two or three days march of agra  the general called his staff and told them of the brilliant victory that had been won at deeg the news spread rapidly through the camp and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers by the troops in the meantime lord lake had entered his tent and obtained full particulars of the battle  i was close to general fraser when he was struck sir harry concluded he and his escort were with the cavalry when it charged the second line of their batteries five of the escort were killed and i may say that the others led by their havildar were among the first in at the guns  i have just received news the general said that holkar crossed this morning at surajepoor and was believed to be on his way to furukabad he is evidently on the march to deeg and if he joins his troops there they may attack colonel monsons force therefore i intend to leave the tents and infantry to follow and shall start at daybreak with the cavalry and horse artillery and hope to overtake him especially as he has lately moved fast and will probably rest a day or two at furukabad  the next day the cavalry marched upwards of forty miles and on the following morning continued their journey they had fiftyeight miles now before them with occasional halts they marched all day crossed the ganges at surajepoor and pushed on until within a mile of holkars camp believing the british to be many miles away no precautions had been taken against surprise and the first intimation of an enemy being near at hand was the opening of fire at daybreak by lord lakes artillery into their campthe guns being posted so as to permit the british cavalry to attack without coming across the line of fire  round after round of grape was poured into the camp and then the guns ceased firing as the six regiments of cavalry dashed in among the panicstricken enemy scarcely any resistance was attempted and in a few minutes the ground was strewn with dead holkar had mounted and ridden off with a portion of his cavalry before our men entered the camp and did not draw rein until he reached caline eighteen miles distant his troops fled in all directions hotly pursued by the cavalry for twelve miles great numbers being overtaken and cut down the cavalry halted from sheer fatigue having performed the almost unparalleled march of seventy miles since their last halting place an exploit rendered all the more wonderful by the fact that they had made a march of three hundred and fifty miles in the preceding fortnight  their loss in the action was only two killed and twenty wounded holkars loss was estimated at three thousand killed on the field and half of his cavalry which was previously sixty thousand strong were now but scattered fugitives  that day three royal salutes were fired for as many victories namely that at furukabad that at deeg and the capture of shaddonethe last of holkars fortresses in the southby colonel wallis as was expected holkar and his cavalry as soon as they recovered from their panic rode to deeg and joined the remains of the infantry and artillery there  general lake remained a day or two to rest the troops after their exertions the brigade of infantry that had been left behind when the cavalry started on their last march had been ordered to move rapidly down to agra and to escort thence the heavy guns that would be required for the siege of deeg and on the 1st of december general lake joined the force near that fortress the battering train arrived from agra on the 12th and the trenches were opened on the following day  in point of territory the country ruled over by the rajah of bhurtpoor was a comparatively small one it was inhabited by a people called jats who differed in many respects from the communities round them they were hardy industrious and brave and had at one time taken a prominent share in the wars of that part of india and had been masters of agra they had lost the city however in 1774 and with it a considerable portion of their territory under the present rajah however they had regained some of their lost ground and on his entering into an alliance with the british he had received a considerable increase of territory  in these circumstances the defection was wholly unexpected the rajah had a standing army of six thousand men and could on an emergency place fifty thousand in the field nevertheless seeing how other very much more powerful native princes had been unable to withstand the british arms his conduct was not only ungrateful and treacherous but wholly unaccountable  it was necessary for the army to move forward to deeg with great circumspection holkars cavalry constantly hovered round them and they had to protect an enormous train conveying the siege appliances and provisions for the force in view of the comparatively small equipage now deemed sufficient in native wars in india the size of that which accompanied lord lakes army on this occasion appears prodigious the followers were estimated at not less than sixty thousand besides elephants and camels a hundred thousand bullocks were employed on preparations for an advance into the town  but during the night holkar and the garrison of deeg retired and made for bhurtpoor on the morning of the 25th therefore the british took unopposed possession of deeg capturing there and in the batteries outside a hundred guns a week later general lake moved forward to bhurtpoor holkar as before had not entered the town but had formed a camp a few miles distant here he was able to maintain himself for the rajah of bhurtpoor had called to his assistance a great marauding leader ameer khan who was raiding in bundelcund and also a leader named bapeejee scindia and these with the rajahs cavalry and that of holkar formed so powerful a force that the british cavalry were fully occupied in keeping them at a distance from camp and in protecting the convoy  on the day of the arrival of the army before bhurtpoor harrywho had now been gazetted to the rank of majorwas sent to agra thirtyfour miles distant with orders respecting a convoy that was about to be sent off from there he was accompanied by abdool and ten troopers at that time ameer khan had not appeared upon the scene and it was not considered that there was any danger of the communications with agra being interfered with  harry reached the city in the afternoon and waited there until four oclock next day seeing that the preparations for the convoy which was a very large one were completed it started at that hour and was to get as far as possible by nightfall so that it would be able to reach the camp by the following evening after seeing it in motion harry started with his escort for the ride back he was some ten miles away from the convoy when night fell bhurtpoor like deeg stood on a plain surrounded by swamps and morasses the situation having been chosen from the difficulties these offered to the advance of an enemy  after proceeding for five miles farther abdool who was riding with harry said  i do not know sahib but it seems to me by the sound of the horses hoofs that we have left the track  harry called a halt and abdool dismounted and found that his suspicion was correct and that they had certainly left the road  this is awkward harry said for we do not know how long it is since we left it or whether it is to the right hand or left  the night was indeed a very dark one a mist almost covered the sky and it was only occasionally that a star could be seen  we must go carefully or we shall fall in one of these morasses  two troopers were sent off one to the right the other to the left one of them when he had gone about a quarter of a mile was heard to shout that he was fast in the morass abdool and four of the men rode to his assistance and presently returned with him having with the greatest difficulty extricated his horse nothing had been heard of the other trooper again and again harry shouted but no reply came back they waited half an hour and then concluded that either the man on his return had missed his way altogether or that he had fallen into a swamp when they were too far off to hear his voice and had perished there  harry again gave the word for them to move on this time at a walk abdool preceded them on foot presently he said  the ground is getting softer sahib i think that we are approaching a swamp  we had better all dismount harry said setting the example  now let each move in different directions going very cautiously and calling out if he comes upon soft ground  he himself with two of the troopers remained with the horses one after another the men came upon swampy ground one only continued to find it firm  i suppose that that is the way we came into it abdool harry said as the others returned to the horses we must follow him and will do it on foot this is getting serious  for a quarter of a mile they kept on ground that was comparatively firm then the man ahead of them gave a sudden shout he had fallen waist deep into a little stream he was soon hauled out  there is nothing to be done abdool but to halt till morning let us go back till we can find a piece of ground dry enough to lie down upon  they had made however little progress when their feet began to sink up to the ankles  it is no use abdool we have evidently lost our bearings altogether we must stay where we are till morning or we shall get helplessly bogged  the hours passed slowly and painfully from time to time the men endeavoured to find firmer ground but always without success and it was with the deepest satisfaction that at last they saw the sky begin to lighten half an hour later they were able to form an idea of their position  they were far in what appeared to be a wide morass there were pools of water in some places and it seemed almost miraculous that they should have succeeded in so far entering the swamp where even by daylight there scarcely seemed a yard of firm ground abdool again went ahead and step by step the little troop followed frequently having to turn back again on finding the line that they were pursuing impassable  they were still a hundred yards from what appeared to be solid ground when they heard loud shouts and looking round saw some fifty horsemen skirting the edge of the morass when they reached the point opposite to the little party they dismounted and opened fire one of the troopers fell dead and several of the horses were hit  there is nothing for it but to surrender abdool harry said as some of the troopers returned the fire  the enemy rode off for a hundred yards and then leaving the horses in charge of a few of their number they returned to the edge of the morass threw themselves down in the long coarse grass and again opened fire two more of the troopers fell at the first discharge harry drew out his handkerchief and waved it  illustration harry drew out his handkerchief and waved it  we will not surrender if they are holkars men he said to abdool we should only be tortured and then put to death if they are bhurtpoors men we may have fair treatment  therefore as soon as the enemy had stopped firing he shouted  whose soldiers are you  the rajah of bhurtpoors was shouted back  we will surrender if you will swear to take us to bhurtpoor and hand us over to the rajah if you will not do so we will defend ourselves to the last  a native officer stood up  assuredly we will take you to the rajah i swear it on my faith  very well then send a man to guide us out of this place  an order was given one of the men went back and mounted his horse and rode along by the edge of the morass for nearly half a mile the others more slowly followed him  it is clear that this place in front of us is absolutely impassable harry said or they would never all move away  it is lucky that you have not got your favourite horse today sir abdool saidfor harry had bought from one of the cavalry a horse that had been captured from the mahrattas as one was insufficient for the work he had to do  i should be very glad indeed abdool if i thought that i was likely to return to camp soon but in such peril as this it is but a small satisfaction to know that he is safe  what do you think of our chances sahib  i dont think the rajah of bhurtpoor will harm us he must feel that his situation is almost desperate and it would put him beyond the reach of pardon if he were to massacre his prisoners  the jat had now dismounted and could be seen making his way towards them on foot sometimes coming straight but more often making long bends and turns it was evident by the absence of any hesitation in his movements that he was well acquainted with the morass  if that is the only way to us harry said it is marvellous indeed that we made our way so far  i think sahib that it was the instinct of the horses i felt mine pull at the rein as i was leading him sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left and i always let him have his way knowing that horses can see and smell better than we can and as we were all in single file you followed without noticing the turns  in ten minutes the man arrived he spoke to harry but his language differed widely from either mahratti or that spoken by the people of bengal however he signed to the troopers to lay down their arms and when they had done so started to rejoin the others and leading the horses the party followed the path was fairly firm and harry had no doubt that it was used by fowlers in search of the game with which at certain seasons of the year the lakes and morasses abounded  when they arrived at the edge of the swamp where the others were awaiting them harry handed his sword to their leader he and his party then mounted and surrounded by the jats rode to bhurtpoor their entrance was greeted with loud shouts and acclamations by the populace making their way straight through the town which covered a large extent of ground they reached the palace a noble building built upon a rock that rose abruptly from the plain ascending the steep path leading to the gate the party entered the courtyard here the captives remained in charge of the horsemen while the leader went in to report to the rajah  illustration view of the rajahs palace bhurtpoor  presently he came out with four of the rajahs guard and these led harry and abdool into the audience chamber the rajah with a number of personal attendants entered and took his seat  you are an officer in the english army what is your rank the rajah said in mahratti  i am a major  of what regiment  i am on the personal staff of the general  and this man  he is a native officer at present commanding a portion of the generals escort  how was it that you were alone last night  i had ridden to agra the day before and was too late in starting back to gain the camp before it was dark i lost my way and finding that we were in the heart of the morass we were obliged to wait till morning  it is well that you did not try to get out had you done so none of you would be here now  you speak mahratti like a native  i was some years at poona and as a child had a mahratta woman as a nurse and learnt it from her  the rajah was silent for a minute or two then he asked  does your general think that he is going to capture my town  i do not know but he is going to try  he will not succeed the rajah said positively we gave up deeg because we did not want a large force shut up there our walls are strong but were they levelled to the ground we would still defend the place to the last  i am aware that your people are brave rajah they fought well indeed and if holkars troops had fought as stoutly the result might have been different  the rajah again sat in thought for some time then he said  i do not wish to treat you harshly i can honour brave men even when they are enemies you will have an apartment assigned to you here and be treated as my guest only do not venture to leave the palaceat least unless you leave it with me there are many who have lost friends at deeg many who may lose their lives before your army retires and i could not answer for your safety would you like this native officer to be with you  i should esteem it a great favour rajah he has been with me for several years and i regard him as a friend thank you also for your courtesy to me  you will give your promise not to try to escape  as harry believed that in the course of a short time the british would be masters of the town he assented without hesitation  the rajah looked pleased  you need be under no uneasiness as to your troopers they will of course be in confinement but beyond that they shall have no reason to complain of their treatment  the rajah said a few words to one of his attendants who at once motioned to harry and abdool to follow him harry bowed to the rajah and with abdool followed the attendant he was taken to a commodious chamber the walls and divans were of white marble and the floor was paved with the same material but in two colours the framework of the window was elaborately carved and it was evident that the room was at ordinary times used as a guest chamber  the attendant left them for a few minutes  this is better than i had even hoped for abdool there can be no doubt that the rajah though he put a good face on it is desperately anxious and behaves to us in this way in hopes that he may finally obtain better terms than he otherwise would do by his good treatment of us  he looks honest and straightforward sahib tis strange that he should have behaved so treacherously just after the company had granted him an increase of territory  we must make some allowances for him no doubt like all the indian princes we have had to do with he is ready to join the strongest side he heard that holkar was coming down with an immense army and believed that we should not be able to withstand him in that case he as our ally would share in our misfortunes his territories would be ravaged and he himself killed or taken back as a prisoner to the deccan he was probably hesitating when the news came of monsons disastrous retreat this doubtless confirmed his opinion of holkars invincibility and he determined as the only way of saving himself to declare for him  the attendant now entered with four men bearing cushions for the divans and carpets for the floor large ewers and basins with soft embroidered towels and a pile of rugs for beds after he had retired harry went to the window and looked out below was the courtyard and the room was on the first story  well if we are to be prisoners abdool we could hardly wish to be better suited a fortnights rest will do us no harm for we have been riding hard almost ever since we left agra with monsons force  it is well sahib that you were with us when we were captured had we been alone we should have had no mercy it is because the rajah regards you as such a valuable prisoner that we have been spared  if you had not given your promise i think we might have made our escape  we might have done so abdool but if i had not given my promise you may be sure that we should not have been lodged so comfortably   chapter 19 bhurtpoor   half an hour later the attendant entered with two servants carrying a large tray with a variety of dishes after they had eaten the meal harry proposed that they should go up to the top of one of the central towers of the palace to obtain a general view of the country  it would be better to do that than to venture down into the courtyard at present abdool the sight of our uniforms might give offence as it would not be understood that we have the rajahs permission to move about the palace we must wait till the man comes in with the tray it is possible that he may understand enough mahratti to make out what we want and will show us the way up  it would never do for us to try to ascend alone we might accidentally open the door of the rajahs zenana and then i doubt if even his desire to hold me as a hostage would suffice to save our lives  the attendant understood enough of mahratti to make out their request and offered at once to accompany them they ascended numerous staircases until at last they reached the flat roof of the palace above which rose three round towers surmounted by domes the highest of these had a gallery running round it a few feet below the dome  the attendant led the way to this and on reaching the gallery they found that it commanded a very wide view over the flat country the town itself covered a considerable space the walls being eight miles in circumference at the eastern end the fort a square and solid edifice was built on ground somewhat higher than the town it had bastions and flanking towers and as had been learned from prisoners taken at deeg it had a moat much wider and deeper than that which ran round the town walls it was built within these one side of the square looking across the country while the other three were inside although the houses were for the most part scattered the town had a picturesque appearance from the number of trees growing within it  towards the northeast the fort of deeg could be clearly seen and to the southwest the mosques and fort of agra were faintly visible in the clear air at a distance of a mile and a half from the city was the british camp with its white tents and an irregular black mass marked the low shelters of the camp followers and the enormous concourse of draught animals  it certainly seemed a hazardous enterprise for so small a number of troops to attack such a large and populous town strongly fortified and held by a brave people harry remarked on this to abdool but the latter said confidently  they cannot stand against the english sahib general lake has always been victorious  he has so abdool and that is one of the reasons why i do not feel so certain of his success as i did he has never yet undertaken a siege and his impetuosity and confidence in his troops may lead him to make an attack with insufficient numbers and before it is really practicable i do not think that this town is to be taken by storm and i doubt whether lord lake will be content to wait for regular siege operations before he tries an assault  look over there towards agra if i am not mistaken there is a large body of cavalry out there they are certainly not our men they are too much mixed up for that possibly the rajah may have obtained the aid of a band of pindarees or of some other irregular troops at any rate it will give trouble to the convoy we left yesterday  he looked at the camp again  there is a stir in the valley and it looks as if they had heard of that force out there and are about to start to attack it  three regiments of cavalry set out as they were getting ready two horsemen could be seen to ride off at a gallop from a group of trees half a mile from the camp as soon as they approached the mass of horsemen in the distance they turned and rode off at full speed  they have evidently no idea of fighting today whoever they are we may as well go down again abdool this is a grand lookout and we shall at any rate get a general idea of the direction in which the attack will be made  two days later they were able from their lookout to see that bodies of men came and went between the camp and a group of trees halfway between it and the town  i expect that they are establishing a battery among those trees harry said and it will not be long before the affair begins  the next morning six eighteenpounders opened fire from the wood and in the afternoon another battery of eight mortars began throwing shells into the town the guns on the walls answered and a brisk fire was kept up for the next ten days during this time several breaches had been effected in the wall near the southeast angle but the defenders had fixed strong wooden stockades in the debris every night so that no attack could be made in order to prevent this being done with the lastmade breach it was determined to assault at once  the two prisoners had not had the lookout gallery to themselves some of the rajahs officers were constantly there and any movement of troops was at once reported by them the rajah himself had twice or thrice come up for a short time to watch the operations and had on each occasion talked for some minutes with harry  your people will be mad if they try to attack us through that small hole in the wall he said on the afternoon of the 14th were they to level a quarter of a mile of the wall they might have some chance though i doubt whether they would ever get a footing at the top but with all my soldiers ready to defend that small opening and with thirty or forty guns to fire at your people as they advance it is as ridiculous as if ten men should attempt to take this palace what do you think  i cannot say rajah from here i am unable to see what is taking place at the walls nor how wide is the breach you speak of nor how deep the ditch beyond therefore i can give no opinion  the english are brave fighters the rajah said they have taken places in a few hours that seemed impregnable but they cannot perform impossibilities our walls are defended by forty thousand men andalthough in the open field i do not say that you might not defeat us seeing how your troops are disciplined while with us each man fights for himselfwhen it is a question of holding a wall or defending a breach i can trust my soldiers we are twice as numerous we have heavier guns and more of them than you have and as i told you the english will never get into bhurtpoor  at seven oclock in the evening a deep and almost continuous roar of guns broke out  the assault has begun harry exclaimed we shall not see much but we may get some idea as to how things are going from the lookout  it was too dark for the movements of troops to be seen but the quick flashes of the guns on either side and a play of flickering fire along the top of the wall showed that the storming party was approaching the attack was made in three parties one advanced against a battery which the defenders had established outside the walls at a spot where its fire would take in flank any force advancing against the point towards which the fire of the english guns had been directed another was to attempt a gateway near the breach while the central column consisting of five hundred europeans and a battalion of sepoys was to attack the breach itself  for a time the roar of firing was incessant the alarm had been given as soon as the british columns advanced from the wood notwithstanding this the right column advanced straight against the battery captured it and spiked the guns the left column as it approached the gate came upon a deep cut filled with water and having no means of crossing this they moved to the support of the force attacking the breach this had been greatly delayed the ground to be crossed was swampy with many pools and in the darkness numbers lost their way and the force arrived at the point of attack in great confusion  a small party of twentythree men onlyof the 22nd regiment under lieutenant manserwho formed the forlorn hope crossed the ditch breast high in water and mounted the breach in the confusion that reigned among the troops some of the officers had lost their way and there was no one to assume the command or to give orders and lieutenant manser finding that he was unsupported and could not with a handful of men attempt to attack either of the bastions from which a terrible fire was being maintained made the men sit down and shelter themselves as well as they could in the debris of the breach while he himself recrossed the ditch to summon up the support in this he failed all order was lost and the men who formed the forlorn hope were at last called back and the whole force retired suffering heavily from the terrible fire to which they were exposed eightyfive were killed and three hundred and seventyone wounded  a more deplorable and illmanaged assault was never made by british troops as harry had thought possible lord lake had treated the capture of bhurtpoor as if it had been but a little hill fort he had made no attempt to carry out regular siege operations but trusting to the valour of his troops had sent them across a considerable distance of plain swept by the enemys fire to assault a breach defended by some of the bravest tribesmen of india and had not even issued commands which would have ensured order and cohesion in the attack  the lesson that had been taught was not sufficiently taken to heart some more batteries were placed in position and on the 16th opened a heavy fire against the wall on the left of the former breach which had been repaired during the two nights following its successful defence so heavy was the fire from the new batteries that another breach was made in the course of a few hours the jats stockaded it during the night but the timbers were soon knocked to fragments and for five days a continuous cannonade was maintained and a large breach formed  it was necessary to find out how wide the ditch was and three native cavalry and three british troopers all dressed as natives suddenly dashed out of the camp at a short distance behind them a number of sepoys ran out as if in pursuit discharging their muskets as they did so just as the six horsemen arrived at the ditch two of the troopers chargers were made to fall the native havildar shouted to the soldiers on the wall to save them from the accursed feringhees and show them the nearest entrance to the city the soldiers pointed to a gate near the breach and as soon as the men had again mounted the havildar rode with them along the ditch and made the necessary observations  then they put spurs to their horses and rode offthe jats on seeing that they had been deceived opening upon them with musketry their excitement and fury however disturbed their aim and the six horsemen rode into camp unhurt and reported that the ditch was not very wide and that it did not seem to be very deep  portable bridges were at once constructed these were to be carried by picked men who were instructed in the best method of pushing them over the ditch to prevent the recurrence of the confusion that had been before caused by the assault in the dark it was determined that it should be made in daylight and on the following afternoon the storming party moved forward it consisted of four hundred and twenty men from the european regiments supported by the rest of those troops and three battalions of native infantry colonel macrae was in command the whole of the batteries opened fire to cover the movement and keep down that of the besieged  on arriving at the ditch it was found that the portable bridges could not be thrown across as during the night the garrison had dammed up the moat below the breach and turned a quantity of water into it thus doubling both its width and depth a few gallant fellows jumped in swam across and climbed the breach but there were few capable of performing this feat encumbered by their muskets and ammunition and colonel macrae seeing the impossibility of succeeding called them back and retired under a tremendous fire from the bastions and walls  this assault was even more disastrous than the last for the loss in killed and wounded amounted to nearly six hundred harry was deeply disappointed at these reverses which the rajah himself with great glee reported to him with full details  there had been other fighting two british convoys on their way from agra had been attacked by the horsemen of ameer khan holkar and the rajah the first might have been successful for the twelve hundred bullocks were escorted by only fourteen hundred men and these although they might have defended themselves successfully were unable to keep the convoy together the animals excited by the firing were rushing off in all directions when fortunately a body of our cavalry which had been sent out to meet the convoy arrived and drove off the enemy with a loss of six hundred men  the next morning a general movement could be seen in the british camp the rajah who was immediately informed of it came up to the lookout  the english general has given it up as hopeless he said they are about to march away  it looks like it rajah harry admitted but i should hardly fancy that lord lake will take such a step he has tried to take the town by a sudden assault and i think that he will not retreat until he has attempted to do so by a regular siege operation  an hour later the whole of the tents had been pulled down and presently both the troops and the huge body of followers and cattle were in motion  they are not going to agra the rajah said after watching them for some time they must be going to march to the north  two hours later the great procession had arrived at the north of the town there they halted and their long lines of tents began to rise  they are going to try another point the rajah exclaimed truly they are brave men but they will be repulsed as they were before  i fancy they will begin in another way rajah and will make regular approaches so that they will not have to pass across the open ground swept by your guns  this indeed turned out to be the case the trenches were at once opened and ere long two batteries were established at a distance of four hundred yards from the wall two days later another still nearer opened fire and by the 20th of february the trenches had been pressed forward to the edge of the ditch and a mine sunk with the intention of blowing up the counterscarp and so partially filling the ditch the troops intended for the assault took their places in the trenches at an early hour so as to be ready to attack as soon as the repairs made by the garrison in the breach during the night could be destroyed by the batteries  the jats however had been rendered so confident by their previous successes that during the night they made a sally crept into the advanced trenchfrom which the workmen had been withdrawnand started to demolish the mine and carry off the tools as the storming party moved down through the trenches the jatswho had made the first sallyjoined by a considerable number from the town rushed forward and attacked them and inflicted considerable loss before they were repulsed a portion of them however still held the advanced trench and when the 75th and 76th who were at the head of the column were ordered to dislodge them they hesitated  the repulse of the former attacks had had its effect and the troops believing that the enemy would have filled the mine with powder and would explode it as they advanced refused to move the remaining men of the flank companies of the 22nd stepped forward but as they were too few to attack so considerable a number of the enemy the 12th and 15th sepoy regiments were called to the front and these advanced gallantly  the enemy were driven from the trench at the point of the bayonet the ditch however had again been flooded and was found to be impassable but there was a bastion to the right that had been damaged by the breaching guns and the troops at once made for this a few men of the 12th managed to climb up and planted the flag of their regiment on it but as only one could mount at a time and the jats were swarming down upon them they were recalled and the force again drew off having lost in killed and wounded nearly nine hundred men notwithstanding the terrible losses that had been suffered general lake persevered in his intention to carry the place at the point of the bayonet and on the following day the batteries opened their fire on the bastion that had been nearly carried by the 12th native infantry  the position had become serious the cavalry had a fortnight or three weeks before defeated those of the rajah and his allies with heavy loss and brought in a convoy and ameer khan who had only joined the rajah of bhurtpoor in the hope of plunder had deserted his ally and ridden off with his following and a large body of pindarees with the intention of devastating and plundering the district of rohilcund three regiments of british cavalry under general smith and as many of native horse with artillery followed on his track and after a pursuit of three weeks at last came up with him annihilated his infantry and captured his guns his cavalry however for the most part escaped as the horses of the pursuers were completely worn out  they returned to the british camp after more than a months absence from a chase extending over seven hundred miles  their absence had greatly increased the difficulties in the british camp without their protection the danger to which convoys were exposed was great provisions were running short in camp the ammunition was almost exhausted and numbers of the guns were rendered unserviceable these circumstances afforded the only excuse that can be made for a fresh attack upon bhurtpoor  it was even more disastrous than those which had preceded it the 75th and 76th regiments deeply ashamed of their conduct on the preceding occasion volunteered to a man and they with the other european regiments and five regiments of sepoys under the command of colonel monson moved out to the attack at three in the afternoon nothing could exceed the courage which they displayed and their conduct rivalled that of the storming party at the siege of badajos but they were fighting against impossibilities the bastion could not be climbed some of the soldiers drove their bayonets into the wall one above another and attempted to climb up by these steps but were knocked down by logs of wood large shot and other missiles others attempted to get in by the shot holes that had been made here and there but as only one man could enter at a time they were killed before a footing could be obtained all this time a terrible fire was maintained by the enemy against our men showers of grape and musketry swept their lines pots filled with gunpowder and other combustibles exploded among them bales of cotton dipped in oil fell flaming in their midst  for two hours the hopeless conflict was maintained then the order was given to retire and the men fell back having lost in killed and wounded nine hundred and eightyseven of their comrades thus the four assaults had cost the army three thousand two hundred and three of its best soldiers the force was still further weakened by a large number of deaths from dysentery and fever the result of the miasma rising from the marshes  the camp was now shifted to drier ground to the northeast of the town the movement being harassed by the enemys horse the rajah who had been jubilant over his success looked grave when the new encampment was fixed  they have not done with me yet he said to harry why do they not go now they see that they cannot take the place  because were they to do so rajah half india would be in arms against them in a fortnight never before since we set foot in india have such defeats been inflicted upon us and lord lake cannot march away and so own himself entirely beaten never before has an english general out here so blundered  still although unable to take bhurtpoor general lake knows well enough that he can easily repulse all attacks on his camp he knows too that the greatest efforts will be made to send up reinforcements bombay madras and calcutta will all send every available man and ere long his losses will be much more than counterbalanced by the forces that will join him we have during our history suffered several disasters but never one that has not been redeemed and revenged  holkar was here this morning the rajah said after a long silence he came to congratulate me on our victory after he had done so he asked that you and your troopers should be handed over to him i need scarcely say that i refused you were captured by my men and though i am in alliance with holkar i do not owe him any fealty it is i who have aided him while he has given but little assistance to me and would i am sure ride away and leave me to my fate if he knew where to go to but his country his capital and his forts are all in the hands of the english and he stays near here because it is at present the safest place for him  on the 23rd of march the british cavalry returned for a month no attempt had been made to renew the siege but the camp still remained as a threat against bhurtpoor and the time had not been lost convoys escorted by strong parties of infantry had come out from agra supplies of all kinds battering guns and ammunition arrived almost daily the armourers worked at the old guns and made them again fit for service and everything showed that when the attack was renewed it would be much more formidable than before  the cavalry were given a few days rest after their arrival but before daybreak on the 29th they moved out in hopes of surprising holkar he had however scouts well posted far out and he effected his retreat with the loss only of some of his baggage animals he retired some miles to the southwest and again pitched his camp  on the 2nd of april the cavalry with the horse artillery again moved out at midnight and this time came upon the enemy undiscovered and before they had time to mount their horses the cavalry charged them in front and on both flanks while the artillery swept the camp with grape great numbers were slain both in holkars camp and in the pursuit which was continued for eight miles the whole of the camp equipage the greater portion of the guns and the bazaars were captured and during the next day or two large bodies of holkars troops considering his case hopeless deserted him when in his flight he crossed the jumna he had but eight thousand horse five thousand infantry and thirty guns the remains of the great army with which he had crossed the river confident of victory the year before  on the following day lord lake who had received considerable reinforcements again moved his camp to the southeast of the city and prepared to resume active operations against it the rajah had for some time been in a despondent state and the next morning he came alone to harrys room  i want to have a talk with you he said and abdool seeing that the conversation was to be a private one at once left the room  my friend he said i have for some time felt that my cause was becoming hopeless i have never supposed that after failing four times and each with heavy loss your people would continue the siege but i see now that i was wrong we might repulse another attack and another but of what use would it be your people would only become stronger after each defeat  i see now that i have acted as one bereft of sense i had no quarrel with the company they added to my territory they had promised to defend me against all attacks but when i heard that holkar was approaching with so vast an army i thought that surely he would recapture delhi and drive you out of agra and perhaps down to calcutta or that after taking agra he would turn against me and so foolish man that i was i joined him  and now i would fain make peace and i pray you to go to your general and ask what terms he will grant they may be hard but i am in no position to stand out ameer khan has been chased and routed holkar is little better than a fugitive and owns only his horse and saddle there is no one to whom i can look for aid i put myself in the english generals hands  i will willingly go rajah no doubt it has been supposed for weeks that i and my escort have perished and when the general hears of the kind treatment that we have receiveda treatment so different from that we should have met with had we fallen into the hands of holkarit will i feel certain have an effect on the terms that he will lay down  harry had each day paid a visit to the troopers who were confined in a large airy room opening into the courtyard they had been well fed and had been permitted to go out into the open air for several hours a day and to mingle freely with the jat soldiers half an hour after his interview with the rajah harry went down there to his surprise he found abdool and the troopers all mounted as well as a party of the rajahs own guard  before leaving the rajah had returned his sword to him as he rode through the streets followed by his own troopers and with the rajahs guard riding ahead the people looked on with curiosity but evinced no animosity against him successful as had been the defence the fact that the british had received great convoys and reinforcements had caused a feeling of apprehension as to the final result food too was becoming very scarce for although small quantities were brought in by the side opposite to that occupied by the camp this was altogether insufficient for the needs of a large population swollen by the fighting men of the whole country  even these supplies had ceased since the return of the british cavalry and the rout of holkar and the fighting men were losing heart their losses had been small in comparison with those of the besiegers but the defeat of holkar impressed all with the fear that the british must in the end triumph they had already done more than any who had tried to stem the tide of the british power they had repulsed them four times and their defence would be the subject of admiration for all the native peoples of india therefore when it was known that the captured english officer was leaving the town with his troopers the idea that the end was near caused general satisfaction  harry left the town by the gate nearest to the british encampment the rajahs guard still accompanied him but halted halfway between the walls and the camp and there dismounted the officer in command telling harry that his orders were to wait until his return numbers of the soldiers had gathered at the edge of the camp on seeing the party riding towards it and when the guard fell back and harry with his troop approached and it was seen that it was a british officer with an escort of native cavalry a loud cheer broke out  most of the soldiers knew harry by sight and all had heard of his being missing with his escort and as the time had passed without any news of him arriving it was supposed that all had been killed by the horsemen of ameer khan or holkar many of the men of the 5th native cavalry were in the crowd and these shouted welcomes to their comrades while several english officers ran up and shook harry by the hand  i have been a prisoner in bhurtpoor he said in answer to the questions i have been extremely well treated but i cannot tell you more now i am here on a mission to the general  curious to ascertain the cause of the cheering general lake appeared at the entrance of his tent just as harry rode up  why major lindsay he exclaimed where did you spring from we had all given you up as dead long ago  i have been in bhurtpoor sir and am now here in the character of the rajahs ambassador  that is good news but come in and tell me first about yourself  harry briefly related how they had lost their way in a morass and had been attacked in the morning and that finding it impossible to make a way out he had surrendered he spoke in the warmest terms of the rajahs treatment of him and his followers  we were treated as guests rather than prisoners sir and lived in a handsome room got excellent food and had the run of the palace scarce a day passed on which i did not have a talk with the rajah himself  it is an exceptional case indeed the general said had you fallen into holkars hands or into those of ameer khan very different treatment would have awaited you and now what has the rajah to say for himself  his plea is sir that he believed holkars army would assuredly sweep us away and that in that case he would have been attacked by him for having formed an alliance with us  his position was certainly an awkward one the general said and now what does he propose  he does not propose anything sir he places himself in your hands he admits his faults and is as he may well be heartily sorry for them he believes that he might still defend his town for some time but his allies having been thrashed he sees that in the end he must be overpowered he asks that you will formulate your demands  your news is very welcome major lindsay for indeed i am as anxious to be off as the rajah can be to see me go scindia is giving trouble again and has written a letter couched in such arrogant terms that it is virtually a declaration of war i could not leave here until the town was captured for it would have seemed to all india that we had been defeated and would have been a terrible blow to our prestige therefore at all costs i must have taken the place it will however be another fortnight before we shall be ready to recommence the siege  i do not wish to be hard on the rajah and i know that the authorities at calcutta view the case in the light that he has put it and are willing to believe that his turning against us was not an act of deliberate treachery but a fear of holkar  his treatment of you and your escort is in itself much in his favour of course in this as in similar cases we could deprive him of his dominions and send him a prisoner to a fortress but the governor general is most anxious that this business should be concluded it has already cost us more men than we lost in the overthrow of tippoos power he has given me authority to negotiate a peace if the rajah offers to surrender he has named the terms approximately and the rajahs treatment of you will certainly induce me to minimize the demands as far as possible especially as it is most important that the force shall be available elsewhere  of course the grant of territory made to him will be rescinded in the second place we must until all the terms of the treaty are fulfilled retain the fortress of deeg which we shall garrison strongly the rajah must pay twenty lakhs of rupees towards our expenses we shall not demand this at once but three lakhs must immediately be paid one of his sons must be given up to us as a hostage for the fulfilment of the treaty the rajah must also bind himself not to enter into any communication with any princes or chiefs at war with us  i think that you will allow that those are not hard conditions  certainly not sir and i have no doubt that the rajah will agree to them without hesitation  i will have a draft of the treaty drawn up in half an hour general lake said of course you will carry it back to the rajah  certainly sir fifty men of his bodyguard are waiting for me halfway between the camp and the town  harry left the tent and found the officers of the staff and many others waiting to welcome him back  they will all want to hear what you have to tell major the head of the staff said you had best go into the mess tent and hold a durbar  the tent was soon filled with the officers with the exception of the chief of the staff who had been sent for by the general  in the first place lindsay one of the officers said we take it that you have come on a mission from the rajah does he mean to surrender  he is willing to surrender if the terms are not too onerous  the announcement was received with a loud cheer there was not one present but believed that the next assault would be successful but the cost of the previous attacks had been so great that it was believed the city would not be taken unless with great slaughter the unhealthiness of the country had told upon their spirits even more than the repulses and the news that they would soon be able to march away created the deepest satisfaction  and now for your own adventures lindsay  my adventures began and ended in a swamp it was four oclock before the convoy left agra and i then rode on fast till it was night when i was still five or six miles from the camp it was pitch dark and we lost our way and presently found ourselves in a deep swamp and could discover no way of getting out of it  then he told them of the attack how they had been obliged to surrender and had been guided out of the morass  when we reached the rajahs palace all our troubles were ended a handsome chamber was placed at my disposal and the havildar of my escort was allowed to be with me i was treated rather as an honoured guest than as a prisoner i lived on the fat of the land and was permitted to wander about the palace and spent most of my time in the gallery round the highest tower where i could see all that was going on the rajah himself was most kind to me and enquired daily if my wants were supplied to my satisfaction he would often come up to the gallery and chat with me sometimes for an hour the troopers also were all well treated  you have received a great deal of misplaced commiseration one of the officers said we have all thought of you as having been tortured to death either by holkar or ameer khan and now we find you have been better housed and better fed than we have  and you are going back again i suppose with the chiefs answer  yes i must not tell you the conditions but i think i can say it is certain that the rajah will not hesitate a moment in accepting them  well he deserves to be let off leniently if only for his treatment of you and your men it is a contrast indeed to what has generally happened to officers who have fallen into the hands of any of these native princes  there was a general talk until an aidedecamp came in and asked harry to accompany him to the generals tent  there is the draft of the treaty the latter said i hope that there will be no delay in returning a prompt answer i want either yes or no these indian princes are adepts in the art of prolonging a negotiation if you see that he has any disposition to do so say at once that i have told you that the terms i offer are final and must be accepted or rejected  very well sir i hope to return with the answer tomorrow early  and followed by his escort harry rode for the city the rajahs guard mounted as soon as they saw him coming and escorted him to the palace the street leading to it was now thronged with people and it was evident to harry that among the great majority there was a feeling of hope that he was the bearer of acceptable terms for among the poorer class the pressure of want was already severe    chapter 20 home   harry on arriving at the palace at once went to the rajahs room  well sahib what terms does your general offer me  terms which i think sir you will have no hesitation in accepting here is a draft of the treaty that he proposes  the rajah glanced at the document which was written in english and in mahratti for none of the generals staff understood the jat language harry saw at once that the terms were far less onerous than the rajah had expected for his face brightened and the air of despondency that it had for some days expressed passed away  it is better than i had looked for he said as a rule the english have not been merciful to those they have subdued that the territory they gave me would be taken away was a matter of course the sum to be paid is heavy but as they have given me time i can manage to collect it without much difficulty this is all that is demanded and that they should hold deeg and my son as a hostage until the money is paid is fair and just  i thought that the conditions would meet with your acceptance rajah and i may say that your kindly treatment of myself and my escort has gone some way in mitigating the terms that would otherwise have been demanded but the general said that you must understand that he can make no further diminution of his demands and that tomorrow he expects an answer yes or no  i reply yes at once major lindsay a load has been lifted from my mind i shall still have my liberty my capital and my people and am grateful indeed for the clemency that has been shown me i had relied somewhat upon your good offices but had small hopes that after what has taken place i should be offered such terms  the rajah at once sent for his sonsof whom harry had seen but little for they were always on the walls encouraging the troops and seeing that the breaches were repaired as soon as made the rajah read to them the draft of the treaty they too were visibly relieved for they had talked the matter over with their father on the evening before and had agreed that probably he and his family would be kept as prisoners in a fortress that the fortifications of the town would be destroyed and some nominee of the british government created rajah  the general has not said which of my sons is to be hostage  no rajah he left that to you i may say that he took the same view of your position as that which you yourself explained to me namely that you joined holkar simply from the apprehension that if the english were defeated by him he would next turn his arms against you  which of you will go the rajah asked his sons  all expressed their willingness  then i will choose my third son he said to harry the others will be more useful here  harry rode out early in the morning with the news that the rajah accepted the terms offered to him in an hour the treaty was written out formally the general affixing his signature harry returned to the city this time accompanied by a general officer and both signed their names as witnesses to the rajahs signature some bullock carts with chests containing the three lakhs of rupees were already in the courtyard and with these and the rajahs third son harry returned to camp  the army afterwards started to meet scindia who had advanced with his army with the intention of joining holkar and assisting the rajah of bhurtpoor he had for some time been almost openly hostile had sent his relation bapeejee scindia with a strong body of horse to act in concert with the cavalry of ameer khan and holkar and had sent letters to the government which amounted to a declaration of war but when holkar reached his camp a fugitive and he heard that bhurtpoor had surrendered he at once fell back and endeavoured to make excuses for his conduct alleging that bapeejee scindia has acted entirely without orders and that he had himself advanced only with the intention of mediating between the rajah of bhurtpoor and the english  no one was deceived by his assurances but it was thought politic to pretend to believe them the marquis of wellesleys term of office had expired and a successor had come out with orders to carry out a policy differing widely from that which he had followed the latter had enormously extended the area of the british possessions in india the british troops had won a marvellous series of victories but this had been effected at an immense cost and so far the revenue drawn from the conquered provinces barely sufficed to pay the expenses of occupation and management  the treaties too that had been entered into with various rajahs and chiefs might at any moment plunge the government into war in support of our allies and accordingly lord cornwallis was again sent out to carry out the policy of maintaining friendly relations with the native powers and of abstaining from interference in their quarrels with each other indeed a breathing time was urgently needed the rapid progress of the british arms had aroused a feeling of distrust and hostility among all the native princes and it was necessary to carry out a strong but peaceful administration in the conquered provinces to give confidence to their populations to appoint civil officers of all sorts and so to divide the troops that while they ceased to threaten any of the native powers they should maintain order in the new dependencies not yet reconciled to the change of masters or capable of appreciating the benefits arising from orderly rule  accordingly scindias excuses were accepted a considerable portion of the dominions that had been wrested from him were restored and even holkar whose atrocious cruelties to all the british soldiers and officers who fell into his hands should have placed him beyond the pale of pardon was again invested with most of his former possessionswith the object no doubt of counterbalancing scindias power as had holkar been driven to take refuge in the north as a fugitive scindia would have become paramount among the mahrattas  one of the last acts of the marquis of wellesley was to offer harry a high civil appointment in one of the new provinces but he declined it upon the ground that he was about to apply for leave to go to england he had indeed already formed the idea of quitting the service altogether the presents he had received from bajee rao on his first arrival at poona and on being invested as peishwa and the still larger one that nana furnuwees had given him had been for the most part invested in the purchase of land at bombay in the eight years that has elapsed the town had greatly increased in size and the land had been gradually sold at four or five times the sum that it had cost and the proceeds sent to england harry was therefore a rich man  he had been constantly engaged in service for nearly nine years and as he had never been settled long enough to have an establishment of his own his military pay had much more than sufficed for his wants and the large increase which he had obtained when engaged in civil or special duty had been entirely laid by there was then no further occasion whatever for him to remain in the service at any rate he determined to obtain a three years leave and before the end of that time he could finally make up his mind on the subject  a month therefore after the siege of bhurtpoor was concluded harry had an interview with lord lake and requested three years leave to go to england  you have well earned it major lindsay your services have been very great and if the war was likely to continue i should have asked you to reconsider your request but as from what i hear a complete change of policy has been determined upon and it has been decided that there shall be no further extension of our territory there is likelyat any rate for a timeto be a period of peace the board of directors desire to consolidate the territory that we have gained and wish to abstain from all embarrassing alliances or from any meddling in the affairs of the native princes  you who have been so long at poona and understand the shifty nature of scindia holkar and indeed of all the native princes must know well that these orders are much more easily given than carried out if our restraining hand is removed we shall have scindia and holkar the peishwa the rajahs of berar kolapoore and bhurtpoor at each others throats again they will treat our declarations that we desire peace only as a proof of weakness and may at any moment lay aside their private quarrels to unite against us and unlikely as it may seem at present my conviction is that there will never be permanent peace in india until we are masters from cape comorin to the borders of afghanistan it may be another half century and will certainly only be after hard fighting but i believe that until all india acknowledges our rule there will not be anything like permanent peace within its borders  i am afraid that that is so sir the only really sincere and honest man that i have met bent upon serving his country was nana furnuwees and in consequence he was equally hated by the peishwa scindia and holkar i was certainly extremely well treated by the rajah of bhurtpoor but this was no doubt largely due to the fact that he thought that if matters went against him his courtesy to me would tell in his favour while ill treatment or murder would have put him beyond the pale of forgiveness  your application comes at a fortunate moment for i am sending a regiment of bombay cavalry back to their presidency and it will be well that you should travel with it through jaipore and ajmeer to surat and so on to bombay which will save you a long journeyunless indeed you wish to travel by way of the ganges  i would much rather go to bombay sir i wish to visit the good people who brought me up i will ask you to allow havildar abdool to go with me i dont know whether he will wish to take his discharge but i should think he would do so and as he belongs properly to the bombay army and is indeed a mahratta i am sure that he would prefer to settle there  i will certainly do that and will see that the services he has rendered are mentioned in his discharge and i will myself write to the government of bombay saying that i had intended to grant him a small holding as a reward for his fidelity and asking that this may be bestowed upon him either in the concan or in some of the territory that we have become possessed of above the ghauts  abdool was greatly moved when harry told him that he had applied for and obtained leave  you will take me with you master i hope  i think abdool that you would do better to remain in your own country you would feel very strange in england among people none of whom speak your language you would also feel the cold greatly  i would rather go with you sahib were i to go back to my native village i should find myself among strangers for i have now been nearly fifteen years away and what should i do without employment  well we will think it over abdool lord lake kindly offered to write a letter in your favour to the government of bombay asking them to give you the charge of a village district which would keep you in comfort  i should not be comfortable if i were not with you sahib  well abdool we are going with the bombay regiment which starts tomorrow and shall travel through central india to surat there i shall leave them in the concan and cross the ghauts to jooneer and pay a visit to soyera ramdass and sufder and see them all comfortably settled and then go down to bombay so we shall both have plenty of time to think it over  accordingly the next morning harry after saying goodbye to all his friends started the journey to surat was nearly seven hundred miles and was accomplished without incident on their arrival at jowaur they ascended the ghaut to trimbuck and then rode to jooneer and another half hour took them to the farm  harry was received with delight by its occupants it was six years since he had parted from his old nurse at bombay and he had greatly changed since then he was now a tall and powerfullybuilt man  and so you are already a major as was your dear father she said after the first greetings were over it seems to me but a short time since you were an infant in my arms but what brings you here  there is going to be a general peace for some time soyera and i have had enough of fighting and am on my way home to england where i hope to learn something about my fathers and mothers families i have three years leave and as i am as rich as i could desire to be possibly i may return here no more  i shall grieve harry but it is natural for you to do so and i shall feel happy in the thought that you have become all your parents could have wished and that i have been the means in some way of bringing this about  in all ways soyera i owe not only my life but all that i am to you had you been without friends i would have taken you to england but happily you are among your own people and have now been living with your good brother and his wife for fourandtwenty years and i can leave you knowing that you are perfectly comfortable and happy  have you any desire to better your condition ramdass i owe you too so much that it would greatly please me to be able in some way to show that i am grateful for the shelter you gave me for so many years  there is nothing ramdass said i have all that i can desire had i more i should have greater cares those who are rich here are not the best off for it is they who are squeezed when our lords have need of money my sons will divide my land when i die and my daughter is already married and provided for had i a larger farm i should need more hands and have more cares the bounty which you before gave me has gratified my utmost desires  a messenger had already been sent off to sufder who rode in the next day he too was well and comfortable and was viewed as a man of importance by the villagers  harry remained there four days longer then bade farewell to those who had proved themselves his true friends and rode down to bombay on the road he had a long talk with abdool who remained fixed in his determination to accompany him to england if he would take him  very well abdool so it shall be but if at any time you have a longing to come back to your own country i will pay your passage and give you enough to make you comfortable for life  harry remained but a few days in bombay wound up his affairs with his agents there and being fortunate in finding a vessel that was on the point of sailing took passage in her for england the voyage was an uneventful one they experienced bad weather off the cape but with that exception carried all canvas till they entered the channel here they encountered another gale but arrived safely in the thames four months after leaving calcutta  it was now january 1806 and after going with abdool to an hotel harrys first step was to procure warm clothing for himself and his follower the weather was exceedingly cold and although abdool had as he considered wrapped himself up in an extraordinary way he was unable to keep warm except when sitting in front of a huge fire  is it always like this sahib he asked in a tone of great anxiety  oh no abdool only for perhaps two months out of the twelve you will find it pleasant enough in summer and after two or three winters will get accustomed to the cold you had better not think of going out till you get your clothes i will have a tailor in to measure you i should say that it would be more convenient for you to take to european clothes you will not find them uncomfortable as you have for so many years been accustomed to uniform they are much more convenient for getting about in and you will not be stared at in the streets as you would be if you went about in native costume however you can wear your own turban if you like  abdool willingly consented to this proposal a tailor was consulted and suggested looselycut trousers and a short jacket similar to that now worn by the french zouaves and differing but little from that of the indian cavalry in this with the addition of a long and warmlylined cloak abdool professed his readiness to encounter any degree of cold  as soon as his own clothes had arrived harry went to leadenhall street and sending in his card was shown into a large room where two or three of the governors of the company were seated considering the reports that had been brought from india in the ship in which harry had arrived  your name is familiar to us major lindsay the gentleman at the head of the table said cordially you have been mentioned in numerous despatches and always in terms of the highest commendation first by the governor of bombay then by the marquis of wellesley for the manner in which you secured the neutrality of berar during the mysore war then again if i remember rightly for obtaining concessions for our occupation of the island of singapore when we are in a position to undertake it he also sent us your report of that business by which it appeared that you had some extremely perilous adventures entailed by your zeal to obtain the rajah of johores consent to the cession sir arthur wellesley mentioned your name in his despatch after assaye and lord lakes despatches make numerous mention of your service with him altogether i do not think that any officer has received such warm and general commendation as you have done  thank you sir i have always done my best and been exceptionally fortunate in being engaged in services that gave me an opportunity of in some degree distinguishing myself  pray sit down major my colleagues and myself will be glad to know a little more about you when the governor of bombay informed us that he most strongly recommended you for a commission he mentioned that you were a son of major lindsay who with his wife was killed in the concan at the time of that most unfortunate and illmanaged expedition to poona we had never heard of your existence before had it been brought before our notice we should of course have assigned a pension for your bringing up and education  harry at his request gave a very brief outline of the manner in which he had been saved by his nurse who had taught him english and prepared him for entering the service when he came of age  i have returned to england he said partly to find out if possible any of my relatives who may exist on my fathers or mothers side  i have no doubt that we shall be able to put you in the way of doing so doubtless at the time of your fathers and mothers death we notified the factat any rate to your fathers familyand received communications from them we will cause a search to be made where are you staying  harry gave the name of the hotel  we will send you word there as soon as the records have been searched at any rate it is certain that the birthplace of your father and the residence of his father will be found at the time he obtained his appointment as cadet i have no doubt that the letter communicating his death was directed to that address  the next day a messenger brought a note to harrys hotel  dear major lindsay  we find that your grandfather was a landowner in norfolk his address was parley house merdford the letter sent to him with the account of your fathers death was answered by a son of his who stated that his father had died two months before and enquired if any news had been obtained of an infant who they had learned had been born some months before the murder of its parents we replied that the report to us had stated body of infant not found we at his request wrote to bombay on the subject  the answer was as before that although the body of the child was not found with those of its father and mother no doubt whatever was entertained that it had been killed it was some days after the catastrophe happened before any report of it reached the authorities when a party of cavalry were at once sent out many of the bodies had been mutilated and some almost devoured by jackals no doubts were entertained that the infant had been altogether devoured  the remains were all buried at the spot where they were found and a stone was erected some months afterwards by the officers of his regiment recording the deaths of major lindsay his wife and child at that spot  two days later harry took his place with abdool on the north coach and after spending a day at norwich drove in a post chaise to merdford here he heard that parley house was two miles distant and without alighting drove on there it was a fine house standing in a wellwooded park on a footman answering the bell harry handed him his card major h lindsay  he was shown into a library and a minute later a gentleman entered he was about sixty years of age of the best type of english squire tall inclined to be portly with genial face and hearty voice  we are of the same name i see major lindsay  we are sir and strange as it may appear to you of the same blood  indeed he said shaking hands with his visitor what is the relationship it must be a distant one for i was not aware that i had any connection of your rank in the army  by the way now that i think of it i have seen in the reports of our campaigns in india the name of a captain lindsay frequently mentioned  i am the man sir  i am glad to know that one who has so distinguished himself is a relation of mine however distant  it is not so very distant sir in point of fact i am your nephew  the squire looked at him in bewilderment  my nephew he repeated  yes mr lindsay i am the son of your brother also major lindsay of the bombay army i returned from india but ten days ago and learned for the first time from the governors of the company the family to which my father belonged had it been otherwise i should have written to you years ago to inform you that i was the infant who was supposed to have perished when its father and mother were killed  harry thought that the colour paled a little in his uncles face  you have of course proofs of your identity the latter said gravely  certainly i have the evidence of the indian nurse who saved my life and brought me up that of a cousin of hers who was an officer of the band that attacked my father and that of her brother with whom i resided from the time she brought me therethree days after the death of my parentsuntil i was twelve years old when she placed me with a lady in bombay for two years and a half to be taught to speak english perfectly after that i was some three years in the service of the peishwa  these depositions were by the order of the governor of bombay sworn to by them before the chief justice there my identity was fully recognized by the governor of bombay who at once recommended me for a commission in consequence of some service that i had rendered to the government and the recommendation was accepted by the court at home and my commission dated from the time of my appointment by the governor  i see a likeness in you to my brother who when i last saw him was about your age i do not say that you are exactly like him but your expression and voice both recall him to me as a matter of form of course i should like to see these depositions i am curious to know the details of your adventures  but that will keep i will at once introduce you to my wife and daughter like your father i was unfortunate in my children i know that you had several brothers and sisters born before you all of whom died in their infancy i did not marry until some years later than he did i had two boys who were both drowned when out in a fishing boat at yarmouth my daughter was the youngest  he rose from his seat and led the way to the drawing room where a lady some fifteen years younger than himself was seated at work with a girl of nineteen or twenty  my dear he said i have a surprise for you this gentleman major lindsay who has distinguished himself greatly in india is our nephew he claims and i may say at once that i see no reasons whatever to doubt it that he is the child of my brother harry who as you may remember was with his wife killed in india a few months after we were married my enquiries resulted in leaving as it seemed no room for doubt that the infant had perished with his parents and that its body had been devoured by wild beasts  but it now appears that he was saved by his nurse who happened to have a relation who was an officer in the party that attacked harrys camp she took him to the house of a brother and there he was brought up and he afterwards went down to bombay where he satisfied the governor as to his identity and received a commission i have not heard further particulars yet but major lindsay  i suppose i shall come to call you harry in time nephew  will tell us all about it himself i am sure that you will join with me in welcoming harrys boy heartily and in my satisfaction that he has proved himself well worthy of his race  harry was a little surprised at detecting a tone of warning in the manner in which the last words were spoken and at the agitation with which mrs lindsay had listened to her husband this disappeared however as she held out her hand to him  i welcome you back to england nephew yours is indeed a strange story i know that my husband was greatly attached to your father  yes i loved him dearly mr lindsay said and can see a resemblance to him in his son he is taller and more strongly built than harry was i do not say that the features are very like but there is something in the expression of his face and tone of his voice that recalls him to me strongly  this is my daughter mary we called her so after your mother it was a fancy of mine for i knew her well before she married your father the two families were on terms of great friendship and for her sake as well as for my brothers i gave her the name  i am glad to meet you cousin the girl said holding out her hand frankly to him it is of course a great surprise to us and i can hardly realize yet that you are really my cousin  now harry his uncle said briskly i will give orders to have your things taken out of the post chaise and carried up to your room we shall be having lunch directly and after that you shall tell us your story at full length  ten minutes later they sat down to lunch when harry rejoined the others he fancied he saw traces of tears in the eyes of mrs lindsay and her daughter and he thought that perhaps they had been thinking that if their own boys had lived they also would be young men now  after the meal was over the squire said  now wife we will all adjourn to the library it is the most comfortable room in the house and the cosiestjust the place for listening to a long story i have told william to get two more armchairs there so that we can sit round the firewhich is quite the proper thing to do when a story has to be told  the light had faded out of the sky and the curtains were drawn but the squire would not have candles lighted saying that the blaze of the fire was the proper thing to listen by harry related fully the manner in which he had been brought up and trained by his nurse for the time when he could present himself at bombay and also his adventures in the deccan which had paved the way for his obtaining a commission he told the rest more briefly though he was obliged in answer to the questions of the others to go somewhat further into his personal adventures  it is a wonderful story the squire said when he at last finished there are many things that you have cut very short and which you must some other time tell us fully your poor father would have reason to be proud of you indeed had he lived to see you now he thought that he was wonderfully fortunate in obtaining a majority at the age of thirtyfive but you have got it ten years younger  well we have not spared you for we have kept you talking over four hours  dinner passed off quickly and when wine had been placed on the table and the servants retired mr lindsay said  you will understand harry that although absolutely certain that you are my nephew i do not resign and offer you my seat at the head of the table until the documents that you have brought are formally examined  what do you mean uncle harry asked in surprise  i mean of course that as your fathers son this estate is yours and not mine  harry rose to his feet  i dont understand you uncle i never dreamt for a moment and he stopped  that your father was my eldest brother yes he was a year older than myself and at his fathers death would of course have succeeded to the estate but he died before him and you as his son will of course succeed  but i could not dream of such a thing uncle do you think that i have come down here with the idea of turning you and my aunt and cousin out and taking your place if i had known it i should not have come down at all it would be monstrous if after you have been master here for twentyfive years i should come down to claim the estate from you  i am glad to hear you say so harry his uncle said gravely naturally it did not occur to us that you were ignorant that your father was the eldest son we thought from your manner that you would be willing to arrange everything on amicable terms for of course legally you are entitled to all the back rents which i honestly say i could not pay your aunts little fortune and my portion as younger brother will be amply sufficient to keep us three comfortably but as to paying the arrears it would be impossible  my dear uncle the whole thing is impossible i have returned home with an ample amount of money to live in luxury i did not think it necessary to mention in my story that nana furnuwees presented me with a considerable sum of money and bajee rao did the same this i invested in land close to bombay which is now covered with houses and fetched five times the price i gave for it in addition to this i have been in civil employment for the past six years and as i have always been on the move i have never had the expense of an establishment and have thus saved some five thousand pounds  therefore i am master of something over ninety thousand pounds and can if i do not return to indiawhich i have i may say already made up my mind not to do buy an estate i have had very much more than my share of adventures and have marvellously escaped if i return my luck might change  at any rate i have had enough of it i have made a very handsome fortune and even putting everything else aside would rather know that i owed all i possessed to my own good luck and exertions than to an accident of birth  but that cannot be lad  well uncle harry said obstinately if you choose to see things in that light all i can say is that i shall at once throw up my leave and return to india and if you choose to leave this house and estate it may go to wreck and ruin for anything i care  well well my boy we wont say anything more about it now but will leave it to the lawyers to settle  i shall certainly employ no lawyers in the matter uncle by all means obtain your solicitors opinion as to whether the proofs i have put in your hands are sufficient to establish beyond all fear of doubt the fact that i am the son of major harry lindsay it matters not whether my father was your elder brother or not to anyone except ourselves i am perfectly satisfied with having proved to the satisfaction of all in india that i am the son of a brave officer my object in coming to england was not to see whether i was entitled to money but simply to find friends among the families of my father and mother and if it were to end in my turning you my aunt and cousin out of the place you have believed to be your own for so many years my visit here would be a dismal failure and i should bitterly regret having set foot in england  please do not let us say anything more about it the matter so far as i am concerned is concluded and nothing that can possibly be said will shake my determination in any way  in order to break the silence for mrs lindsay and mary were both wiping their eyes harry went on  now that we have finished this question uncle i will tell you how i got the ratification of the treaty that will some day be made for our occupation of singapore from the rajah of johore as far as the excitement went it certainly was the most stirring business that i was ever employed in and he at once launched into the narrative of his capture the escape the adventure with the tiger and the defence of johore  it seems to me harry his uncle said when he had finished that you not only have as many lives as a cat but as a whole posse of cats i cannot but think that it was a wild business altogether and that having got the assent of the gentleman with the very hard name there was no occasion to bother about the rajah who seemed to have no authority whatever  but he might have got it you see uncle it may be ten years or more before a governor general will be able to attend to the business and it was as well to get it settled once for all  what did the rajah present you with for saving his capital  he offered me a number of weapons and things but as i had no place to put them in i could not be bothered with them i do not think that cash was at all a strong point with him and i dont suppose he had a thousand dollars in his treasury i was a little surprised that he did not offer me half a dozen young ladies as wives but had he done so i should have resisted the temptation as they would have been even more trouble than the weapons  you never fell in love with any of the indian beauties cousin harry  i have never seen any to fall in love with the ladies of the upper class in india whether hindus or mussulmans always go closely veiled and as to the english ladies in the first place they were nearly all married and in the second place i went as little into society as i could help being on the governor generals staff and nearly always away on duty certainly i never saw anyone who caused my pulse to beat faster which i believe from what i have read is one of the many symptoms of being in love  harry then enquired about his mothers relations  i unfortunately can tell you nothing about them she was an only daughter when she married your father both her parents died years ago they only had a lease of the place they lived in and i really cannot tell you anything whatever about them there was a son who would i suppose succeed to any property his father left but he was a neerdowell and was seldom at home and i have never seen or heard of him since  well i am quite content with the relations that i have found and shall not trouble myself to seek further  four days passed at the end of that time mr lindsay received a letter from his lawyer and after breakfast asked harry to go into the library with him  about that business that we were talking about i have today received an answer to my letter my lawyer is of opinion from what i told him of these papers that your case is a strong one and that though if i chose i might give you a great deal of trouble he thinks that in the long run you would succeed as i dont want to give you trouble and as i am myself as completely convinced that you are my brother harrys son as that i am his brother the matter may now be considered as finally settled  quite so uncle i dont want to hear anything more about it if you choose to be obstinate and turn out i can only say that i shall be sorry that the old house where my father and you were both born should go to wreck and ruin at any rate let the matter rest for the present possibly it may yet be arranged to the satisfaction of all parties  it will certainly not be arranged to my satisfaction the squire grumbled unless you become master here  we will talk it over in six months time  he related the conversation to his wife who to his surprise looked pleased  nothing could be better she said it would be an excellent plan  what on earth do you mean louisa  you are as blind as an owl peter there can be only one meaning in what he has said only one arrangement that could be satisfactory to all parties  and what is that my dear the squire said a little testily  i mean of course that he should marry mary  the squire sat down suddenly in his surprise  such an idea never entered my head he said but why should you think of it why the young fellow has only been here four or five days  that is quite long enough for him to see that mary is a charming girl mrs lindsay said he has seen very little of ladies and he is no doubt struck with the idea that she is an extremely nice girl i dont say that he is in love with her yet but quite enough perhaps to foresee that ere long he will feel more ardent than he does at present and that it is the only arrangement possible since we are determined to turn out for him  now mind peter you do not throw out the slightest hint either to him or to her that such a solution has ever occurred to us it might spoil everything it would make mary shy with him and might cause him to be awkward you give your consent to remain here for six months by that time the question will have solved itself if i am wrong no harm will have been done if i am right the arrangement will be as he says a satisfactory one to us all  i was always against cousins marrying mr lindsay said doubtfully  dont be absurd peter i dont say that in some cases there is not a good deal to be said against it but where both the man and the woman are healthy and come of healthy families no union can be more likely to be happy  but i think i have heard you speak  never mind what you have heard me speak sir circumstances alter cases and this case is altogether an exceptional one  we certainly could not wish for a finer young fellow as marys husband he is a desirable partner in every respect he is himself well off and although i quite agree with you that whatever it costs we must give the dear old place up i grant that it would be very pleasant to avoid so terrible a wrench  the one thing i dont like is that man of his he moves about so noiselessly that it is like having a ghost in the room  it is you who are absurd now louisa the squire said the man has over and over again proved himself to be a most faithful friend to him i own that it is a little trying to see him standing behind harrys chair without moving except when his master wants something but after all that is less fidgety than having footmen dodging about you  well louisa i will take particular heed of what you have said and will be mum as a mouse until we see how the cat jumps  mrs lindsays prevision turned out correct harry remained a week longer at parley house then he heard that an estate was for sale two miles away and drove over quietly to inspect it ten days later he wrote from london and said that he had bought the place  he is the most obstinate fellow that i ever knew mr lindsay exclaimed as he read the letter  what is it dear  he has bought hungerfords place and never gave me the slightest hint of his intentions  well i think it will be very nice to have him so near us mrs lindsay said decidedly  oh of course and it will be so handy for  peter will you take another cup of tea his wife said sharply and mr lindsay knew that he had nearly put his foot in it  a week later harry came down againto see as he said what required to be done to the house and he needed no persuasion to stay at parley hall to decide upon matters he needed a great deal of advice both from mrs lindsay and mary and then having put the house into the hands of the builders and decorators he went up to town again however he frequently ran down to see how things were getting on and before the alterations were all finished mary had consented to become its mistress  abdool preferred to remain as his masters body servant as before he had even before leaving india picked up a certain amount of english and had improved considerably his knowledge of the language during the long voyage mary fortunately had not shared in her mothers feelings about him but on learning that he had several times saved harrys life had taken to him greatly he never returned to his native land  and although harry and his wife talked sometimes of making the voyage to india they were never enabled to accomplish it for as children grew up around them mary was no longer free to travel abdools devotion was now divided between his master and mistress and the little ones who were never tired of listening to his stories of their fathers adventures  mr and mrs lindsay lived to an advanced age and died within a few weeks of each other harry then moved to parley hall and sold the estate he had bought as the management of one estate and his duties as county magistrate occupied as much time as he cared to give the only complaint made against him by his neighbours was that he did not care for field sports but as he said he had seen enough bloodshed to last him his lifetime and would neither shed the blood of bird nor beast though he had no quarrel with those who liked that sort of thing  he kept up a regular correspondence to the end of her life with his old nurse and his interest in his indian friends never abated he was an old man when the indian mutiny broke out and two of his grandsons took their share in the long siege of delhi and served with both the forces which under sir colin campbell fought their way into lucknow and finally broke the neck of the sepoy mutiny
