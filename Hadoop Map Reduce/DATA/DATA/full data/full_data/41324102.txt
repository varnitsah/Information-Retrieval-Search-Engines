41324102	the country house  by john galsworthy     chapter i  a party at worsted skeynes  the year was 1891 the month october the day monday in the dark outside the railwaystation at worsted skeynes mr horace pendyces omnibus his brougham his luggagecart monopolised space the face of mr horace pendyces coachman monopolised the light of the solitary station lantern rosygilled with fat closeclipped grey whiskers and inscrutably pursed lips it presided high up in the easterly air like an emblem of the feudal system on the platform within mr horace pendyces first footman and second groom in long livery coats with silver buttons their appearance slightly relieved by the rakish cock of their tophats awaited the arrival of the 615  the first footman took from his pocket a halfsheet of stamped and crested notepaper covered with mr horace pendyces small and precise calligraphy he read from it in a nasal derisive voice  hon geoff and mrs winlow blue room and dress maid small drab mr george white room mrs jaspar bellew gold the captain red general pendyce pink room valet back attic thats the lot  the groom a redcheeked youth paid no attention  if this here ambler of mr georges wins on

another over the page green room right wingthat foxleigh hes no good take all you can and give nothing sort but cant he shoot just thats why they ask him  from behind a screen of dark trees the train ran in  down the platform came the first passengerstwo cattlemen with long sticks slouching by in their frieze coats diffusing an odour of beast and black tobacco then a couple and single figures keeping as far apart as possible the guests of mr horace pendyce slowly they came out one by one into the loom of the carriages and stood with their eyes fixed carefully before them as though afraid they might recognise each other a tall man in a fur coat whose tall wife carried a small bag of silver and shagreen spoke to the coachman  how are you benson mr george says captain pendyce told him he wouldnt be down till the 930 i suppose wed better  like a breeze tuning through the frigid silence of a fog a high clear voice was heard  oh thanks ill go up in the brougham  followed by the first footman carrying her wraps and muffled in a white veil through which the hon geoffrey winlows leisurely gaze caught the gleam of eyes a lady stepped forward and with a backward glance vanished into the brougham her head appeared again behind the swathe of gauze  theres plenty of room george  george pendyce walked quickly forward and disappeared beside her there was a crunch of wheels the brougham rolled away  the hon geoffrey winlow raised his face again  who was that benson  the coachman leaned over confidentially holding his podgy whitegloved hand outspread on a level with the hon geoffreys hat  mrs jaspar bellew sir captain bellews lady of the firs  but i thought they werent  no sir theyre not sir  ah  a calm rarefied voice was heard from the door of the omnibus  now geoff  the hon geoffrey winlow followed his wife mr foxleigh and general pendyce into the omnibus and again mrs winlows voice was heard  oh do you mind my maid get in tookson  mr horace pendyces mansion white and long and low standing well within its acres had come into the possession of his greatgreatgreatgrandfather through an alliance with the last of the worsteds originally a fine property let in smallish holdings to tenants who having no attention bestowed on them did very well and paid excellent rents it was now farmed on model lines at a slight loss at stated intervals mr pendyce imported a new kind of cow or partridge and built a wing to the schools his income was fortunately independent of this estate he was in complete accord with the rector and the sanitary authorities and not infrequently complained that his tenants did not stay on the land his wife was a totteridge and his coverts admirable he had been needless to say an eldest son it was his individual conviction that individualism had ruined england and he had set himself deliberately to eradicate this vice from the character of his tenants by substituting for their individualism his own tastes plans and sentiments one might almost say his own individualism and losing money thereby he had gone far to demonstrate his pet theory that the higher the individualism the more sterile the life of the community if however the matter was thus put to him he grew both garrulous and angry for he considered himself not an individualist but what he called a tory communist in connection with his agricultural interests he was naturally a fair trader a tax on corn he knew would make all the difference in the world to the prosperity of england as he often said a tax of three or four shillings on corn and i should be farming my estate at a profit  mr pendyce had other peculiarities in which he was not too individual he was averse to any change in the existing order of things made lists of everything and was never really so happy as when talking of himself or his estate he had a black spaniel dog called john with a long nose and longer ears whom he had bred himself till the creature was not happy out of his sight  in appearance mr pendyce was rather of the old school upright and active with thin sidewhiskers to which however for some years past he had added moustaches which drooped and were now grizzled he wore large cravats and squaretailed coats he did not smoke  at the head of his diningtable loaded with flowers and plate he sat between the hon mrs winlow and mrs jaspar bellew nor could he have desired more striking and contrasted supporters equally tall fullfigured and comely nature had fixed between these two women a gulf which mr pendyce a man of spare figure tried in vain to fill the composure peculiar to the ashen type of the british aristocracy wintered permanently on mrs winlows features like the smile of a frosty day expressionless to a degree they at once convinced the spectator that she was a woman of the best breeding had an expression ever arisen upon these features it is impossible to say what might have been the consequences she had followed her nurses adjuration lor miss truda never you make a faceyou might grow so never since that day had gertrude winlow an honourable in her own right and in that of her husband made a face not even it is believed when her son was born and then to find on the other side of mr pendyce that puzzling mrs bellew with the greengrey eyes at which the best people of her own sex looked with instinctive disapproval a woman in her position should avoid anything conspicuous and nature had given her a toostriking appearance people said that when the year before last she had separated from captain bellew and left the firs it was simply because they were tired of one another they said too that it looked as if she were encouraging the attentions of george mr pendyces eldest son  lady maiden had remarked to mrs winlow in the drawingroom before dinner  what is it about that mrs bellew i never liked her a woman situated as she is ought to be more careful i dont understand her being asked here at all with her husband still at the firs only just over the way besides shes very hard up she doesnt even attempt to disguise it i call her almost an adventuress  mrs winlow had answered  but shes some sort of cousin to mrs pendyce the pendyces are related to everybody its so boring one never knows  lady maiden replied  did you know her when she was living down here i dislike those hardriding women she and her husband were perfectly reckless one heard of nothing else but what she had jumped and how she had jumped it and she bets and goes racing if george pendyce is not in love with her im very much mistaken hes been seeing far too much of her in town shes one of those women that men are always hanging about  at the head of his dinnertable where before each guest was placed a menu carefully written in his eldest daughters handwriting horace pendyce supped his soup  this soup he said to mrs bellew reminds me of your dear old father he was extraordinarily fond of it i had a great respect for your fathera wonderful man i always said he was the most determined man id met since my own dear father and he was the most obstinate man in the three kingdoms  he frequently made use of the expression in the three kingdoms which sometimes preceded a statement that his grandmother was descended from richard iii while his grandfather came down from the cornish giants one of whom he would say with a disparaging smile had once thrown a cow over a wall  your father was too much of an individualist mrs bellew i have a lot of experience of individualism in the management of my estate and i find that an individualist is never contented my tenants have everything they want but its impossible to satisfy them theres a fellow called peacock now a most pigheaded narrowminded chap i dont give in to him of course if he had his way hed go back to the old days farm the land in his own fashion he wants to buy it from me old vicious system of yeoman farming says his grandfather had it hes that sort of man i hate individualism its ruining england you wont find better cottages or better farmbuildings anywhere than on my estate i go in for centralisation i dare say you know what i call myselfa tory communist to my mind thats the party of the future now your fathers motto was every man for himself on the land that would never do landlord and tenant must work together youll come over to newmarket with us on wednesday george has a very fine horse running in the rutlandshire a very fine horse  he doesnt bet im glad to say if theres one thing i hate more than another its gambling  mrs bellew gave him a sidelong glance and a little ironical smile peeped out on her full red lips but mr pendyce had been called away to his soup when he was ready to resume the conversation she was talking to his son and the squire frowning turned to the hon mrs winlow her attention was automatic complete monosyllabic she did not appear to fatigue herself by an oversympathetic comprehension nor was she subservient mr pendyce found her a competent listener  the country is changing he said changing every day country houses are not what they were a great responsibility rests on us landlords if we go the whole thing goes  what indeed could be more delightful than this countryhouse life of mr pendyce its perfect cleanliness its busy leisure its combination of fresh air and scented warmth its complete intellectual repose its essential and professional aloofness from suffering of any kind and its soupemblematically and above all its soupmade from the rich remains of pampered beasts  mr pendyce thought this life the one right life those who lived it the only right people he considered it a duty to live this life with its simple healthy yet luxurious curriculum surrounded by creatures bred for his own devouring surrounded as it were by a sea of soup and that people should go on existing by the million in the towns preying on each other and getting continually out of work with all those other depressing concomitants of an awkward state distressed him while suburban life that living in little rows of slateroofed houses so lamentably similar that no man of individual taste could bear to see them he much disliked yet in spite of his strong prejudice in favour of countryhouse life he was not a rich man his income barely exceeding ten thousand a year  the first shootingparty of the season devoted to spinneys and the outlying coverts had been as usual made to synchronise with the last newmarket meeting for newmarket was within an uncomfortable distance of worsted skeynes and though mr pendyce had a horror of gaming he liked to figure there and pass for a man interested in sport for sports sake and he was really rather proud of the fact that his son had picked up so good a horse as the ambler promised to be for so little money and was racing him for pure sport  the guests had been carefully chosen on mrs winlows right was thomas brandwhite of brown and brandwhite who had a position in the financial world which could not well be ignored two places in the country and a yacht his long lined face with very heavy moustaches wore habitually a peevish look he had retired from his firm and now only sat on the boards of several companies next to him was mrs hussell barter with that touching look to be seen on the faces of many english ladies that look of women who are always doing their duty their rather painful duty whose eyes above cheeks creased and withered once roseleaf hued now overcoloured by strong weather are starry and anxious whose speech is simple sympathetic direct a little shy a little hopeless yet always hopeful who are ever surrounded by children invalids old people all looking to them for support who have never known the luxury of breaking downof these was mrs hussell barter the wife of the reverend hussell barter who would shoot tomorrow but would not attend the racemeeting on the wednesday on her other hand was gilbert foxleigh a leanflanked man with a long narrow head strong white teeth and hollow thirsting eyes he came of a county family of foxleighs and was one of six brothers invaluable to the owners of coverts or young halfbroken horses in days when as a foxleigh would put it hardly a johnny of the lot could shoot or ride for nuts there was no species of beast bird or fish that he could not and did not destroy with equal skill and enjoyment the only thing against him was his income which was very small he had taken in mrs brandwhite to whom however he talked but little leaving her to general pendyce her neighbour on the other side  had he been born a year before his brother instead of a year after charles pendyce would naturally have owned worsted skeynes and horace would have gone into the army instead as it was having almost imperceptibly become a majorgeneral he had retired taking with him his pension the third brother had he chosen to be born would have gone into the church where a living awaited him he had elected otherwise and the living had passed perforce to a collateral branch between horace and charles seen from behind it was difficult to distinguish both were spare both erect with the least inclination to bottle shoulders but charles pendyce brushed his hair both before and behind away from a central parting and about the back of his still active knees there was a look of feebleness seen from the front they could readily be differentiated for the generals whiskers broadened down his cheeks till they reached his moustaches and there was in his face and manner a sort of formal though discontented effacement as of an individualist who has all his life been part of a system from which he has issued at last unconscious indeed of his loss but with a vague sense of injury he had never married feeling it to be comparatively useless owing to horace having gained that year on him at the start and he lived with a valet close to his club in pall mall  in lady maiden whom he had taken in to dinner worsted skeynes entertained a good woman and a personality whose teas to working men in the london season were famous no working man who had attended them had ever gone away without a wholesome respect for his hostess she was indeed a woman who permitted no liberties to be taken with her in any walk of life the daughter of a rural dean she appeared at her best when seated having rather short legs her face was wellcoloured her mouth firm and rather wide her nose wellshaped her hair dark she spoke in a decided voice and did not mince her words it was to her that her husband sir james owed his reactionary principles on the subject of woman  round the corner at the end of the table the hon geoffrey winlow was telling his hostess of the balkan provinces from a tour in which he had just returned his face of the norman type with regular handsome features had a leisurely and capable expression his manner was easy and pleasant only at times it became apparent that his ideas were in perfect order so that he would naturally not care to be corrected his father lord montrossor whose seat was at coldingham six miles away would ultimately yield to him his place in the house of lords  and next him sat mrs pendyce a portrait of this lady hung over the sideboard at the end of the room and though it had been painted by a fashionable painter it had caught a gleam of that something still in her face these twenty years later she was not young her dark hair was going grey but she was not old for she had been married at nineteen and was still only fiftytwo her face was rather long and very pale and her eyebrows arched and dark and always slightly raised her eyes were dark grey sometimes almost black for the pupils dilated when she was moved her lips were the least thing parted and the expression of those lips and eyes was of a rather touching gentleness of a rather touching expectancy and yet all this was not the something that was rather the outward sign of an inborn sense that she had no need to ask for things of an instinctive faith that she already had them by that something and by her long transparent hands men could tell that she had been a totteridge and her voice which was rather slow with a little not unpleasant trick of speech and her eyelids by second nature just a trifle lowered confirmed this impression over her bosom which hid the heart of a lady rose and fell a piece of wonderful old lace  round the corner again sir james maiden and bee pendyce the eldest daughter were talking of horses and huntingbee seldom from choice spoke of anything else her face was pleasant and good yet not quite pretty and this little fact seemed to have entered into her very nature making her shy and ever willing to do things for others  sir james had small grey whiskers and a carved keen visage he came of an old kentish family which had migrated to cambridgeshire his coverts were exceptionally fine he was also a justice of the peace a colonel of yeomanry a keen churchman and much feared by poachers he held the reactionary views already mentioned being a little afraid of lady malden  beyond miss pendyce sat the reverend hussell barter who would shoot tomorrow but would not attend the racemeeting on wednesday  the rector of worsted skeynes was not tall and his head had been rendered somewhat bald by thought his broad face of very straight build from the top of the forehead to the base of the chin was wellcoloured cleanshaven and of a shape that may be seen in portraits of the georgian era his cheeks were full and folded his lower lip had a habit of protruding and his eyebrows jutted out above his full light eyes his manner was authoritative and he articulated his words in a voice to which long service in the pulpit had imparted remarkable carryingpowerin fact when engaged in private conversation it was with difficulty that he was not overheard perhaps even in confidential matters he was not unwilling that what he said should bear fruit in some ways indeed he was typical uncertainty hesitation tolerationexcept of such opinions as he heldhe did not like imagination he distrusted he found his duty in life very clear and other peoples perhaps clearer and he did not encourage his parishioners to think for themselves the habit seemed to him a dangerous one he was outspoken in his opinions and when he had occasion to find fault spoke of the offender as a man of no character a fellow like that with such a ring of conviction that his audience could not but be convinced of the immorality of that person he had a bluff jolly way of speaking and was popular in his parisha good cricketer a still better fisherman a fair shot though as he said he could not really afford time for shooting while disclaiming interference in secular matters he watched the tendencies of his flock from a sound point of view and especially encouraged them to support the existing order of thingsthe british empire and the english church his cure was hereditary and he fortunately possessed some private means for he had a large family his partner at dinner was norah the younger of the two pendyce girls who had a round open face and a more decided manner than her sister bee  her brother george the eldest son sat on her right george was of middle height with a redbrown cleanshaved face and solid jaw his eyes were grey he had firm lips and darkish carefully brushed hair a little thin on the top but with that peculiar gloss seen on the hair of some men about town his clothes were unostentatiously perfect such men may be seen in piccadilly at any hour of the day or night he had been intended for the guards but had failed to pass the necessary examination through no fault of his own owing to a constitutional inability to spell had he been his younger brother gerald he would probably have fulfilled the pendyce tradition and passed into the army as a matter of course and had gerald now captain pendyce been george the elder son he might possibly have failed george lived at his club in town on an allowance of six hundred a year and sat a great deal in a baywindow reading ruffs guide to the turf  he raised his eyes from the menu and looked stealthily round helen bellew was talking to his father her white shoulder turned a little away george was proud of his composure but there was a strange longing in his face she gave indeed just excuse for people to consider her too goodlooking for the position in which she was placed her figure was tall and supple and full and now that she no longer hunted was getting fuller her hair looped back in loose bands across a broad low brow had a peculiar soft lustre  there was a touch of sensuality about her lips the face was too broad across the brow and cheekbones but the eyes were magnificenticegrey sometimes almost green always luminous and set in with dark lashes  there was something pathetic in georges gaze as of a man forced to look against his will  it had been going on all that past summer and still he did not know where he stood sometimes she seemed fond of him sometimes treated him as though he had no chance that which he had begun as a game was now deadly earnest and this in itself was tragic that comfortable ease of spirit which is the breath of life was taken away he could think of nothing but her was she one of those women who feed on mens admiration and give them no return was she only waiting to make her conquest more secure these riddles he asked of her face a hundred times lying awake in the dark to george pendyce a man of the world unaccustomed to privation whose simple creed was live and enjoy there was something terrible about a longing which never left him for a moment which he could not help any more than he could help eating the end of which he could not see he had known her when she lived at the firs he had known her in the huntingfield but his passion was only of last summers date it had sprung suddenly out of a flirtation started at a dance  a man about town does not psychologise himself he accepts his condition with touching simplicity he is hungry he must be fed he is thirsty he must drink why he is hungry when he became hungry these inquiries are beside the mark no ethical aspect of the matter troubled him the attainment of a married woman not living with her husband did not impinge upon his creed what would come after though full of unpleasant possibilities he left to the future his real disquiet far nearer far more primitive and simple was the feeling of drifting helplessly in a current so strong that he could not keep his feet  ah yes a bad case dreadful thing for the sweetenhams that young fellows been obliged to give up the army cant think what old sweetenham was about he must have known his son was hit i should say bethany himself was the only one in the dark theres no doubt lady rose was to blame mr pendyce was speaking  mrs bellew smiled  my sympathies are all with lady rose what do you say george  george frowned  i always thought he said that bethany was an ass  george said mr pendyce is immoral all young men are immoral i notice it more and more youve given up your hunting i hear  mrs bellew sighed  one cant hunt on next to nothing  ah you live in london london spoils everybody people dont take the interest in hunting and farming they used to i cant get george here at all not that im a believer in apronstrings young men will be young men  thus summing up the laws of nature the squire resumed his knife and fork  but neither mrs bellew nor george followed his example the one sat with her eyes fixed on her plate and a faint smile playing on her lips the other sat without a smile and his eyes in which there was such a deep resentful longing looked from his father to mrs bellew and from mrs bellew to his mother and as though down that vista of faces and fruits and flowers a secret current had been set flowing mrs pendyce nodded gently to her son     chapter ii  the covert shoot  at the head of the breakfasttable sat mr pendyce eating methodically he was somewhat silent as became a man who has just read family prayers but about that silence and the pile of halfopened letters on his right was a hint of autocracy  be informaldo what you like dress as you like sit where you like eat what you like drink tea or coffee but each glance of his eyes each sentence of his sparing semigenial talk seemed to repeat that but  at the foot of the breakfasttable sat mrs pendyce behind a silver urn which emitted a gentle steam her hands worked without ceasing amongst cups and while they worked her lips worked too in spasmodic utterances that never had any reference to herself pushed a little to her left and entirely neglected lay a piece of dry toast on a small white plate twice she took it up buttered a bit of it and put it down again once she rested and her eyes which fell on mrs bellow seemed to say how very charming you look my dear then taking up the sugartongs she began again  on the long sideboard covered with a white cloth reposed a number of edibles only to be found amongst that portion of the community which breeds creatures for its own devouring at one end of this row of viands was a large game pie with a triangular gap in the pastry at the other on two oval dishes lay four cold partridges in various stages of decomposition behind them a silver basket of openwork design was occupied by three bunches of black one bunch of white grapes and a silver grapecutter which performed no function it was so blunt but had once belonged to a totteridge and wore their crest  no servants were in the room but the sidedoor was now and again opened and something brought in and this suggested that behind the door persons were collected only waiting to be called upon it was in fact as though mr pendyce had said a butler and two footmen at least could hand you things but this is a simple country house  at times a male guest rose napkin in hand and said to a lady can i get you anything from the sideboard being refused he went and filled his own plate three dogstwo foxterriers and a decrepit skye circled round uneasily smelling at the visitors napkins and there went up a hum of talk in which sentences like these could be distinguished rippin stand that by the wood dyou remember your rockettin woodcock last year jerry and the dear old squire never touched a feather did you squire dickdick bad dogcome and do your tricks trusttrust paid for isnt he rather a darling  on mr pendyces foot or by the side of his chair whence he could see what was being eaten sat the spaniel john and now and then mr pendyce taking a small portion of something between his finger and thumb would say  johnmake a good breakfast sir james i always say a halfbreakfasted man is no good  and mrs pendyce her eyebrows lifted would look anxiously up and down the table murmuring another cup dear let me seeare you sugar  when all had finished a silence fell as if each sought to get away from what he had been eating as if each felt he had been engaged in an unworthy practice then mr pendyce finishing his last grape wiped his mouth  youve a quarter of an hour gentlemen we start at tenfifteen  mrs pendyce left seated with a vague ironical smile ate one mouthful of her buttered toast now very old and leathery gave the rest to the dear dogs and called  george you want a new shooting tie dear boy that green ones quite faded ive been meaning to get some silks down for ages have you had any news of your horse this morning  yes blacksmith says hes fit as a fiddle  i do so hope hell win that race for you your uncle hubert once lost four thousand pounds over the rutlandshire i remember perfectly my father had to pay it im so glad you dont bet dear boy  my dear mother i do bet  oh george i hope not much for goodness sake dont tell your father hes like all the pendyces cant bear a risk  my dear mother im not likely to but as a matter of fact there is no risk i stand to win a lot of money to nothing  but george is that right  of course its all right  oh well i dont understand mrs pendyce dropped her eyes a flush came into her white cheeks she looked up again and said quickly george i should like just a little bet on your horsea real bet say about a sovereign  george pendyces creed permitted the show of no emotion he smiled  all right mother ill put it on for you itll be about eight to one  does that mean that if he wins i shall get eight  george nodded  mrs pendyce looked abstractedly at his tie  i think it might be two sovereigns one seems very little to lose because i do so want him to win isnt helen bellew perfectly charming this morning its delightful to see a woman look her best in the morning  george turned to hide the colour in his cheeks  she looks fresh enough certainly  mrs pendyce glanced up at him there was a touch of quizzicality in one of her lifted eyebrows  i mustnt keep you dear youll be late for the shooting  mr pendyce a sportsman of the old school who still kept pointers which in the teeth of modern fashion he was unable to employ set his face against the use of two guns  any man he would say who cares to shoot at worsted skeynes must do with one gun as my dear old father had to do before me hell get a good days sportno barndoor birds for he encouraged his pheasants to remain lean that they might fly the better but dont let him expect one of these battuessheer butchery i call them  he was excessively fond of birdsit was in fact his hobby and he had collected under glass cases a prodigious number of specimens of those species which are in danger of becoming extinct having really in some pendycean sort of way a feeling that by this practice he was doing them a good turn championing them as it were to a world that would soon be unable to look upon them in the flesh he wished too that his collection should become an integral part of the estate and be passed on to his son and his sons son after him  look at this dartford warbler he would say beautiful little creaturegetting rarer every day i had the greatest difficulty in procuring this specimen you wouldnt believe me if i told you what i had to pay for him  some of his unique birds he had shot himself having in his youth made expeditions to foreign countries solely with this object but the great majority he had been compelled to purchase in his library were row upon row of books carefully arranged and bearing on this fascinating subject and his collection of rare almost extinct birds eggs was one of the finest in the three kingdoms one egg especially he would point to with pride as the last obtainable of that particular breed this was procured he would say by my dear old gillie angus out of the birds very nest there was just the single egg the species he added tenderly handling the delicate porcelainlike oval in his brown hand covered with very fine blackish hairs is now extinct he was in fact a true birdlover strongly condemning cockneys or rough ignorant persons who with no collections of their own wantonly destroyed kingfishers or scarce birds of any sort out of pure stupidity i would have them flogged he would say for he believed that no such bird should be killed except on commission and for choicebarring such extreme cases as that dartford warblerin some foreign country or remoter part of the british isles it was indeed illustrative of mr pendyces character and whole point of view that whenever a rare winged stranger appeared on his own estate it was talked of as an event and preserved alive with the greatest care in the hope that it might breed and be handed down with the property but if it were personally known to belong to mr fuller or lord quarryman whose estates abutted on worsted skeynes and there was grave and imminent danger of its going back it was promptly shot and stuffed that it might not be lost to posterity an encounter with another landowner having the same hobby of whom there were several in his neighbourhood would upset him for a week making him strangely morose and he would at once redouble his efforts to add something rarer than ever to his own collection  his arrangements for shooting were precisely conceived little slips of paper with the names of the guns written thereon were placed in a hat and one by one drawn out again and this he always did himself behind the right wing of the house he held a review of the beaters who filed before him out of the yard each with a long stick in his hand and no expression on his face five minutes of directions to the keeper and then the guns started carrying their own weapons and a sufficiency of cartridges for the first drive in the old way  a misty radiance clung over the grass as the sun dried the heavy dew the thrushes hopped and ran and hid themselves the rooks cawed peacefully in the old elms at an angle the game cart constructed on mr pendyces own pattern and drawn by a hairy horse in charge of an aged man made its way slowly to the end of the first beat  george lagged behind his hands deep in his pockets drinking in the joy of the tranquil day the soft bird sounds so clear and friendly that chorus of wild life the scent of the coverts stole to him and he thought  what a ripping day for shooting  the squire wearing a suit carefully coloured so that no bird should see him leather leggings and a cloth helmet of his own devising ventilated by many little holes came up to his son and the spaniel john who had a passion for the collection of birds almost equal to his masters came up too  youre end gun george he said youll get a nice high bird  george felt the ground with his feet and blew a speck of dust off his barrels and the smell of the oil sent a delicious tremor darting through him everything even helen bellew was forgotten then in the silence rose a faroff clamour a cock pheasant skimming low his plumage silken in the sun dived out of the green and golden spinney curled to the right and was lost in undergrowth some pigeons passed over at a great height the taptap of sticks beating against trees began then with a fitful rushing noise a pheasant came straight out george threw up his gun and pulled the bird stopped in midair jerked forward and fell headlong into the grass sods with a thud in the sunlight the dead bird lay and a smirk of triumph played on georges lips he was feeling the joy of life  during his covert shoots the squire had the habit of recording his impressions in a mental notebook he put special marks against such as missed or shot birds behind the waist or placed lead in them to the detriment of their market value or broke only one leg of a hare at a time causing the animal to cry like a tortured child which some men do not like or such as anxious for fame claimed dead creatures that they had not shot or peopled the next beat with imaginary slain or too frequently wiped an important neighbours eye or shot too many beaters in the legs against this evidence however he unconsciously weighed the more undeniable social facts such as the title of winlows father sir james maldens coverts which must also presently be shot thomas brandwhites position in the financial world general pendyces relationship to himself and the importance of the english church against foxleigh alone he could put no marks the fellow destroyed everything that came within reach with utter precision and this was perhaps fortunate for foxleigh had neither title coverts position nor cloth and the squire weighed one thing else besidesthe pleasure of giving them all a good days sport for his heart was kind  the sun had fallen well behind the home wood when the guns stood waiting for the last drive of the day from the keepers cottage in the hollow where late threads of crimson clung in the brown network of virginia creeper rose a mist of wood smoke dispersed upon the breeze sound there was none only that faint stirthe far far callings of men and beasts and birdsthat never quite dies of a country evening high above the wood some startled pigeons were still wheeling no other life in sight but a gleam of sunlight stole down the side of the covert and laid a burnish on the turned leaves till the whole wood seemed quivering with magic out of that quivering wood a wounded rabbit had stolen and was dying it lay on its side on the slope of a tussock of grass its hind legs drawn under it its forelegs raised like the hands of a praying child motionless as death all its remaining life was centred in its black soft eyes uncomplaining ungrudging unknowing with that poor soft wandering eye it was going back to mother earth there foxleigh too some day must go asking of nature why she had murdered him     chapter iii  the blissful hour  it was the hour between tea and dinner when the spirit of the country house was resting conscious of its virtue half asleep  having bathed and changed george pendyce took his bettingbook into the smokingroom in a nook devoted to literature protected from draught and intrusion by a high leather screen he sat down in an armchair and fell into a doze  with legs crossed his chin resting on one hand his comely figure relaxed he exhaled a fragrance of soap as though in this perfect peace his soul were giving off its natural odour his spirit on the borderland of dreams trembled with those faint stirrings of chivalry and aspiration the outcome of physical wellbeing after a long day in the open air the outcome of security from all that is unpleasant and fraught with danger he was awakened by voices  george is not a bad shot  gave a shocking exhibition at the last stand mrs bellew was with him they were going over him like smoke he couldnt touch a feather  it was winlows voice a silence then thomas brandwhites  a mistake the ladies coming out i never will have them myself what do you say sir james  bad principlevery bad  a laughthomas brandwhites laugh the laugh of a man never quite sure of himself  that fellow bellew is a cracked chap they call him the desperate character about here drinks like a fish and rides like the devil she used to go pretty hard too ive noticed theres always a couple like that in a hunting country did you ever see him thin highshouldered whitefaced chap with little dark eyes and a red moustache  shes still a young woman  thirty or thirtytwo  how was it they didnt get on  the sound of a match being struck  case of the kettle and the pot  its easy to see shes fond of admiration love of admiration plays old harry with women  winlows leisurely tones again  there was a child i believe and it died and after thati know there was some story you never could get to the bottom of it bellew chucked his regiment in consequence shes subject to moods they say when nothings exciting enough must skate on thin ice must have a man skating after her if the poor devil weighs more than she does in he goes  thats like her father old cheriton i knew him at the clubone of the old sort of squires married his second wife at sixty and buried her at eighty old claret and piquet they called him had more children under the rose than any man in devonshire i saw him playing halfcrown points the week before he died its in the blood whats georges weightah ha  its no laughing matter brandwhite theres time for a hundred up before dinner if you care for a game winlow  the sound of chairs drawn back of footsteps and the closing of a door george was alone again a spot of red in either of his cheeks those vague stirrings of chivalry and aspiration were gone and gone that sense of wellearned ease he got up came out of his corner and walked to and fro on the tigerskin before the fire he lit a cigarette threw it away and lit another  skating on thin ice that would not stop him their gossip would not stop him nor their sneers they would but send him on the faster  he threw away the second cigarette it was strange for him to go to the drawingroom at this hour of the day but he went  opening the door quietly he saw the long pleasant room lighted with tall oillamps and mrs bellew seated at the piano singing the teathings were still on a table at one end but every one had finished as far away as might be in the embrasure of the baywindow general pendyce and bee were playing chess grouped in the centre of the room by one of the lamps lady maiden mrs winlow and mrs brandwhite had turned their faces towards the piano and a sort of slight unwillingness or surprise showed on those faces a sort of we were having a most interesting talk i dont think we ought to have been stopped expression  before the fire with his long legs outstretched stood gerald pendyce and a little apart her dark eyes fixed on the singer and a piece of embroidery in her lap sat mrs pendyce on the edge of whose skirt lay roy the old skye terrier      but had i wist before i lost           that love had been sae ill to win      i had lockt my heart in a case of gowd           and pinnd it with a siller pin      o waly waly but love be bonny           a little time while it is new      but when tis auld it waxeth cauld           and fades awa like morning dew  this was the song george heard trembling and dying to the chords of the fine piano that was a little out of tune  he gazed at the singer and though he was not musical there came a look into his eyes that he quickly hid away  a slight murmur occurred in the centre of the room and from the fireplace gerald called out thanks thats rippin  the voice of general pendyce rose in the baywindow check  mrs pendyce taking up her embroidery on which a tear had dropped said gently  thank you dear most charming  mrs bellew left the piano and sat down beside her george moved into the baywindow he knew nothing of chessindeed he could not stand the game but from here without attracting attention he could watch mrs bellew  the air was drowsy and sweetscented a log of cedarwood had just been put on the fire the voices of his mother and mrs bellew talking of what he could not hear the voices of lady malden mrs brandwhite and gerald discussing some neighbours of mrs winlow dissenting or assenting in turn all mingled in a comfortable sleepy sound clipped now and then by the voice of general pendyce calling check and of bee saying oh uncle  a feeling of rage rose in george why should they all be so comfortable and cosy while this perpetual fire was burning in himself and he fastened his moody eyes on her who was keeping him thus dancing to her pipes  he made an awkward movement which shook the chesstable the general said behind him look out george whatwhat  george went up to his mother  lets have a look at that mother  mrs pendyce leaned back in her chair and handed up her work with a smile of pleased surprise  my dear boy you wont understand it a bit its for the front of my new frock  george took the piece of work he did not understand it but turning and twisting it he could breathe the warmth of the woman he loved in bending over the embroidery he touched mrs bellews shoulder it was not drawn away a faint pressure seemed to answer his own his mothers voice recalled him  oh my needle dear its so sweet of you but perhaps  george handed back the embroidery mrs pendyce received it with a grateful look it was the first time he had ever shown an interest in her work  mrs bellew had taken up a palmleaf fan to screen her face from the fire she said slowly  if we win tomorrow ill embroider you something george  and if we lose  mrs bellew raised her eyes and involuntarily george moved so that his mother could not see the sort of slow mesmerism that was in them  if we lose she said i shall sink into the earth we must win george  he gave an uneasy little laugh and glanced quickly at his mother mrs pendyce had begun to draw her needle in and out with a halfstartled look on her face  thats a most haunting little song you sang dear she said  mrs bellew answered the words are so true arent they  george felt her eyes on him and tried to look at her but those halfsmiling halfthreatening eyes seemed to twist and turn him about as his hands had twisted and turned about his mothers embroidery again across mrs pendyces face flitted that halfstartled look  suddenly general pendyces voice was heard saying very loud stale nonsense bee nonsense why damme so it is  a hum of voices from the centre of the room covered up that outburst and gerald stepping to the hearth threw another cedar log upon the fire the smoke came out in a puff  mrs pendyce leaned back in her chair smiling and wrinkling her fine thin nose  delicious she said but her eyes did not leave her sons face and in them was still that vague alarm     chapter iv  the happy huntingground  of all the places where by a judicious admixture of whip and spur oats

to the selfreliant secretiveness which defies intrusion and forms an integral part in the christianity of this countrynewmarket heath is beyond all others the happy huntingground of the landed classes  in the paddock half an hour before the rutlandshire handicap was to be run numbers of racingmen were gathered in little knots of two and three describing to each other with every precaution the points of strength in the horses they had laid against the points of weakness in the horses they had backed or vice versa together with the latest discrepancies of their trainers and jockeys at the far end george pendyce his trainer blacksmith and his jockey swells were talking in low tones many people have observed with surprise the closebuttoned secrecy of all who have to do with horses it is no matter for wonder the horse is one of those generous and somewhat careless animals that if not taken firmly from the first will surely give itself away essential to a man who has to do with horses is a complete closeness of physiognomy otherwise the animal will never know what is expected of him the more that is expected of him the closer must be the expression of his friends or a grave fiasco may have to be deplored  it was for these reasons that georges face wore more than its habitual composure and the faces of his trainer and his jockey were alert determined and expressionless blacksmith a little man had in his hand a short notched cane with which contrary to expectation he did not switch his legs his eyelids drooped over his shrewd eyes his upper lip advanced over the lower and he wore no hair on his face the jockey swells pinchedup countenance with jutting eyebrows and practically no cheeks had under georges racingcap of peacock blue a subfusc hue like that of old furniture  the ambler had been bought out of the stud of colonel dorking a man opposed on high grounds to the racing of twoyearolds and at the age of three had never run showing more than a suspicion of form in one or two home trials he ran a bye in the fane stakes when obviously not up to the mark and was then withdrawn from the public gaze the stable had from the start kept its eye on the rutlandshire handicap and no sooner was goodwood over than the commission was placed in the hands of barneys well known for their power to enlist at the most appropriate moment the sympathy of the public in a horses favour almost coincidentally with the completion of the stable commission it was found that the public were determined to support the ambler at any price over seven to one barneys at once proceeded judiciously to lay off the stable money and this having been done george found that he stood to win four thousand pounds to nothing if he had now chosen to bet this sum against the horse at the then current price of eight to one it is obvious that he could have made an absolute certainty of five hundred pounds and the horse need never even have started but george who would have been glad enough of such a sum was not the man to do this sort of thing it was against the tenets of his creed he believed too in his horse and had enough of the totteridge in him to like a race for a races sake even when beaten there was enjoyment to be had out of the imperturbability with which he could take that beating out of a sense of superiority to men not quite so sportsmanlike as himself  come and see the nag saddled he said to his brother gerald  in one of the long line of boxes the ambler was awaiting his toilette a darkbrown horse about sixteen hands with wellplaced shoulders straight hocks a small head and what is known as a rattail but of all his features the most remarkable was his eye in the depths of that full soft eye was an almost uncanny gleam and when he turned it halfcircled by a moon of white and gave bystanders that look of strange comprehension they felt that he saw to the bottom of all this that was going on around him he was still but three years old and had not yet attained the age when people apply to action the fruits of understanding yet there was little doubt that as he advanced in years he would manifest his disapproval of a system whereby men made money at his expense and with that eye halfcircled by the moon he looked at george and in silence george looked back at him strangely baffled by the horses long soft wild gaze on this heart beating deep within its warm dark satin sheath on the spirit gazing through that soft wild eye too much was hanging and he turned away  mount jockeys  through the crowd of hardlooking hatted muffled twolegged men those fourlegged creatures in their chestnut bay and brown and satin nakedness most beautiful in all the world filed proudly past as though going forth to death the last vanished through the gate the crowd dispersed  down by the rails of tattersalls george stood alone he had screwed himself into a corner whence he could watch through his long glasses that gaycoloured shifting wheel at the end of the mile and more of turf at this moment so pregnant with the future he could not bear the company of his fellows  theyre off  he looked no longer but hunched his shoulders holding his elbows stiff that none might see what he was feeling behind him a man said  the favourites beat whats that in blue on the rails  out by himself on the far rails out by himself sweeping along like a homecoming bird was the ambler and georges heart leaped as a fish leaps of a summer evening out of a dark pool  theyll never catch him the ambler wins its a walkover the ambler  silent amidst the shouting throng george thought my horse my horse and tears of pure emotion sprang into his eyes for a full minute he stood quite still then instinctively adjusting hat and tie made his way calmly to the paddock he left it to his trainer to lead the ambler back and joined him at the weighingroom  the little jockey was seated nursing his saddle negligent and saturnine awaiting the words all right  blacksmith said quietly  well sir weve pulled it off four lengths ive told swells he does no more riding for me theres a goldmine given away what on earth was he about to come in by himself like that we shant get into the city now under nine stone its enough to make a man cry  and looking at his trainer george saw the little mans lips quiver  in his stall streaked with sweat his hindlegs outstretched fretting under the ministrations of the groom the ambler stayed the whisking of his head to look at his owner and once more george met that long proud soft glance he laid his gloved hand on the horses latherflecked neck the ambler tossed his head and turned it away  george came out into the open and made his way towards the stand his trainers words had instilled a drop of poison into his cup a goldmine given away  he went up to swells on his lips were the words what made you give the show away like that he did not speak them for in his soul he felt it would not become him to ask his jockey why he had not dissembled and won by a length but the little jockey understood at once  mr blacksmiths been at me sir you take my tip hes a queer one that orse i thought it best to let him run his own race mark my words he knows whats what when theyre like that theyre best let alone  a voice behind him said  well george congratulate you not the way i should have ridden the race myself he should have lain off to the distance remarkable turn of speed that horse theres no riding nowadays  the squire and general pendyce were standing there erect and slim unlike and yet so very much alike the eyes of both of them seemed saying  i shall differ from you there are no two opinions about it i shall differ from you  behind them stood mrs bellew her eyes could not keep still under their lashes and their light and colour changed continually george walked on slowly at her side there was a look of triumph and softness about her the colour kept deepening in her cheeks her figure swayed they did not look at each other  against the paddock railings stood a man in ridingclothes of spare figure with a horsemans square high shoulders and thin long legs a trifle bowed his narrow thinlipped freckled face with closecropped sandy hair and clipped red moustache was of a strange dead pallor he followed the figures of george and his companion with little fiery darkbrown eyes in which devils seemed to dance someone tapped him on the arm  hallo bellew had a good race  devil take you no come and have a drink  still without looking at each other george and mrs bellew walked towards the gate  i dont want to see any more she said i should like to get away at once  well go after this race said george theres nothing running in the last  at the back of the grand stand in the midst of all the hurrying crowd he stopped  helen he said  mrs bellew raised her eyes and looked full into his  long and crosscountry is the drive from royston railway station to worsted skeynes to george pendyce driving the dog cart with helen bellew beside him it seemed but a minutethat strange minute when the heaven is opened and a vision shows between to some men that vision comes but once to some men many times it comes after long winter when the blossom hangs it comes after parched summer when the leaves are going gold and of what hues it is paintedof frostwhite and fire of wine and purple of mountain flowers or the shadowy green of still deep poolsthe seer alone can tell but this is certainthe vision steals from him who looks on it all images of other things all sense of law of order of the living past and the living present it is the future fairscented singing jewelled as when suddenly between high banks a bough of appleblossom hangs quivering in the wind loud with the song of bees  george pendyce gazed before him at this vision over the grey mares back and she who sat beside him muffled in her fur was touching his arm with hers and back to them the second groom hugging himself above the road that slipped away beneath saw another kind of vision for he had won five pounds and his eyes were closed and the grey mare saw a vision of her warm light stall and the oats dropping between her manger bars and fled with light hoofs along the lanes where the sidelamps shot two moving gleams over dark beechhedges that rustled crisply in the northeast wind again and again she sneezed in the pleasure of that homeward flight and the light foam of her nostrils flicked the faces of those behind and they sat silent thrilling at the touch of each others arms their cheeks glowing in the windy darkness their eyes shining and fixed before them  the second groom awoke suddenly from his dream  if i owned that orse like mr george and had such a topper as this ere mrs bellew beside me would i be sittin there without a word     chapter v  mrs pendyces dance  mrs pendyce believed in the practice of assembling county society for the purpose of inducing it to dance a hardy enterprise in a county where the souls and incidentally the feet of the inhabitants were shaped for more solid pursuits men were her chief difficulty for in spite of really national discouragement it was rare to find a girl who was not fond of dancing  ah dancing i did so love it oh poor cecil tharp and with a queer little smile she pointed to a strapping redfaced youth dancing with her daughter he nearly trips bee up every minute and he hugs her so as if he were afraid of falling on his head oh dear what a bump its lucky shes so nice and solid i like to see the dear boy here come george and helen bellew poor george is not quite up to her form but hes better than most of them doesnt she look lovely this evening  lady maiden raised her glasses to her eyes by the aid of a tortoiseshell handle  yes but shes one of those women you never can look at without seeing that she has aabody shes tootoodyou see what i mean its almostalmost like a frenchwoman  mrs bellew had passed so close that the skirt of her seagreen dress brushed their feet with a swish and a scent as of a flowerbed was wafted from it mrs pendyce wrinkled her nose  much nicer her figures so delicious she said  lady maiden pondered  shes a dangerous woman james quite agrees with me  mrs pendyce raised her eyebrows there was a touch of scorn in that gentle gesture  shes a very distant cousin of mine she said her father was quite a wonderful man its an old devonshire family the cheritons of bovey are mentioned in twisdom i like young people to enjoy themselves  a smile illumined softly the fine wrinkles round her eyes beneath her lavender satin bodice with strips of black velvet banding it at intervals her heart was beating faster than usual she was thinking of a night in her youth when her old playfellow young trefane of the blues danced with her nearly all the evening and of how at her window she saw the sun rise and gently wept because she was married to horace pendyce  i always feel sorry for a woman who can dance as she does i should have liked to have got some men from town but horace will only have the county people its not fair to the girls it isnt so much their dancing as their conversationall about the first meet and yesterdays cubbing and tomorrows covertshooting and their foxterriers though im awfully fond of the dear dogs and then that new golf course really its quite distressing to me at times again mrs pendyce looked out into the room with her patient smile and two little lines of wrinkles formed across her forehead between the regular arching of her eyebrows that were still darkbrown they dont seem able to be gay i feel they dont really care about it theyre only just waiting till tomorrow morning so that they can go out and kill something even bees like that  mrs pendyce was not exaggerating the guests at worsted skeynes on the night of the rutlandshire handicap were nearly all county people from the hon gertrude winlow revolving like a faintly coloured statue to young tharp with his clean face and his fair bullety head who danced as though he were riding at a bullfinch in a niche old lord quarryman the master of the gaddesdon could be discerned in conversation with sir james malden and the reverend hussell barter  mrs pendyce said  your husband and lord quarryman are talking of poachers i can tell that by the look of their hands i cant help sympathising a little with poachers  lady malden dropped her eyeglasses  james takes a very just view of them she said its such an insidious offence the more insidious the offence the more important it is to check it it seems hard to punish people for stealing bread or turnips though one must of course but ive no sympathy with poachers so many of them do it for sheer love of sport  mrs pendyce answered  thats captain maydew dancing with her now he is a good dancer dont their steps fit dont they look happy i do like people to enjoy themselves there is such a dreadful lot of unnecessary sadness and suffering in the world i think its really all because people wont make allowances for each other  lady malden looked at her sideways pursing her lips but mrs pendyce by race a totteridge continued to smile she had been born unconscious of her neighbours scrutinies  helen bellew she said was such a lovely girl her grandfather was my mothers cousin what does that make her anyway my cousin gregory vigil is her first cousin once removedthe hampshire vigils do you know him  lady malden answered  gregory vigil the man with a lot of greyish hair ive had to do with him in the srwc  but mrs pendyce was dancing mentally  such a good fellow what is thatthe  lady malden gave her a sharp look  society for the rescue of women and children of course surely you know about that  mrs pendyce continued to smile  ah yes that is nice what a beautiful figure she has its so refreshing i envy a woman with a figure like that it looks as if it would never grow old society for the regeneration of women gregorys so good about that sort of thing but he never seems quite successful have you noticed there was a woman he was very interested in this spring i think she drank  they all do said lady malden its the curse of the day  mrs pendyce wrinkled her forehead  most of the totteridges she said were great drinkers they ruined their constitutions do you know jaspar bellew  no  its such a pity he drinks he came to dinner here once and im afraid he must have come intoxicated he took me in his little eyes quite burned me up he drove his dog cart into a ditch on the way home that sort of thing gets about so its such a pity hes quite interesting horace cant stand him  the music of the waltz had ceased lady maiden put her glasses to her eyes from close beside them george and mrs bellew passed by they moved on out of hearing but the breeze of her fan had touched the arching hair on lady maidens forehead the down on her upper lip  why isnt she with her husband she asked abruptly  mrs pendyce lifted her brows  do you concern yourself to ask that which a wellbred woman leaves unanswered she seemed to say and a flush coloured her cheeks  lady maiden winced but as though it were forced through her mouth by some explosion in her soul she said  you have only to look and see how dangerous she is  the colour in mrs pendyces cheeks deepened to a blush like a girls  every man she said is in love with helen bellew shes so tremendously alive my cousin gregory has been in love with her for years though he is her guardian or trustee or whatever they call them now its quite romantic if i were a man i should be in love with her myself the flush vanished and left her cheeks to their true colour that of a faded rose  once more she was listening to the voice of young trefane ah margery i love youto her own half whispered answer poor boy once more she was looking back through that forest of her life where she had wandered so long and where every tree was horace pendyce  what a pity one cant always be young she said  through the conservatory door wide open to the lawn a full moon flooded the country with pale gold light and in that light the branches of the cedartrees seemed printed black on the greyblue paper of the sky all was cold still witchery out there and not very far away an owl was hooting  the reverend husell barter about to enter the conservatory for a breath of air was arrested by the sight of a couple halfhidden by a bushy plant side by side they were looking at the moonlight and he knew them for mrs bellew and george pendyce before he could either enter or retire he saw george seize her in his arms she seemed to bend her head back then bring her face to his the moonlight fell on it and on the full white curve of her neck the rector of worsted skeynes saw too that her eyes were closed her lips parted     chapter vi  influence of the reverend hussell barter  along the walls of the smokingroom above a leather dado were prints of horsemen in nightshirts and nightcaps or horsemen in red coats and tophats with words underneath such as  yeoicks says thruster yeoicks says dick my word these dd quornites shall now see the trick  two pairs of antlers surmounted the hearth mementoes of mr pendyces deerforest strathbegally now given up where with the assistance of his dear old gillie angus mcbane he had secured the heads of these monarchs of the glen between them was the print of a personage in trousers with a rifle under his arm and a smile on his lips while two large deerhounds worried a dying stag and a lady approached him on a pony  the squire and sir james malden had retired the remaining guests were seated round the fire gerald pendyce stood at a sidetable on which was a tray of decanters glasses and mineral water  whos for a dhrop of the craythur a wee dhrop of the craythur rector a dhrop of the craythur george a dhrop  george shook his head a smile was on his lips and that smile had in it a quality of remoteness as though it belonged to another sphere and had strayed on to the lips of this man of the world against his will he seemed trying to conquer it to twist his face into its habitual shape but like the spirit of a strange force the smile broke through it had mastered him his thoughts his habits and his creed he was stripped of fashion as on a thirsty noon a man stands stripped for a cool plunge from which he hardly cares if he come up again  and this smile not by intrinsic merit but by virtue of its strangeness attracted the eye of each man in the room so in a crowd the most foreignlooking face will draw all glances  the reverend husell barter with a frown watched that smile and strange thoughts chased through his mind  uncle charles a dhrop of the craythur a wee dhrop of the craythur  general pendyce caressed his whisker  the least touch he said the least touch i hear that our friend sir percival is going to stand again  mr barter rose and placed his back before the fire  outrageous he said he ought to be told at once that we cant have him  the hon geoffrey winlow answered from his chair  if he puts up hell get in they cant afford to lose him and with a leisurely puff of smoke i must say sir i dont quite see what it has to do with his public life  mr barter thrust forth his lower lip  an impenitent man he said  but a woman like that what chance has a fellow if she once gets hold of him  when i was stationed at halifax began general pendyce she was the belle of the place  again mr barter thrust out his lower lip  dont lets talk of herthe jade then suddenly to george lets hear your opinion george dreaming of your victories eh and the tone of his voice was peculiar  but george got up  im too sleepy he said goodnight curtly nodding he left the room  outside the door stood a dark oak table covered with silver candlesticks a single candle burned thereon and made a thin gold path in the velvet blackness george lighted his candle and a second gold path leaped out in front up this he began to ascend he carried his candle at the level of his breast and the light shone sideways and up over his white shirtfront and the comely bulldog face above it it shone too into his eyes grey and slightly bloodshot as though their surfaces concealed passions violently struggling for expression at the turning platform of the stair he paused in darkness above and in darkness below the country house was still all the little life of its day its petty sounds movements comings goings its very breathing seemed to have fallen into sleep the forces of its life had gathered into that pool of light where george stood listening the beating of his heart was the only sound in that small sound was all the pulse of this great slumbering space he stood there long motionless listening to the beating of his heart like a man fallen into a trance then floating up through the darkness came the echo of a laugh george started the dd parson he muttered and turned up the stairs again but now he moved like a man with a purpose and held his candle high so that the light fell far out into the darkness he went beyond his own room and stood still again the light of the candle showed the blood flushing his forehead beating and pulsing in the veins at the side of his temples showed too his lips quivering his shaking hand he stretched out that hand and touched the handle of a door then stood again like a man of stone listening for the laugh he raised the candle and it shone into every nook his throat clicked as though he found it hard to swallow  it was at barnard scrolls the next station to worsted skeynes on the following afternoon that a young man entered a firstclass compartment of the 310 train to town the young man wore a newmarket coat natty white gloves and carried an eyeglass his face was well coloured his chestnut moustache well brushed and his blue eyes with their loving expression seemed to say look at mecome look at mecan anyone be better fed his valise and hatbox of the best leather bore the inscription e maydew 8th lancers  there was a lady leaning back in a corner wrapped to the chin in a fur garment and the young man encountering through his eyeglass her cool ironical glance dropped it and held out his hand  ah mrs bellew great pleasure tsee you again so soon you goin up to town jolly dance last night wasnt it dear old sort the squire and mrs pendyce such an awfly nice woman  mrs bellew took his hand and leaned back again in her corner she was rather paler than usual but it became her and captain maydew thought he had never seen so charming a creature  got a weeks leave thank goodness most awfly slow time of year cubbins pretty well over an we dont open till the first  he turned to the window there in the sunlight the hedgerows ran golden and brown away from the clouds of trailing train smoke young maydew shook his head at their beauty  the countrys still very blind he said awful pity youve given up your huntin  mrs bellew did not trouble to answer and it was just that certainty over herself the cool assurance of a woman who has known the world her calm almost negligent eyes that fascinated this young man he looked at her quite shyly  i suppose you will become my slave those eyes seemed to say but i cant help you really  did you back georges horse i had an awfly good race i was at school with george charmin fellow old george  in mrs bellews eyes something seemed to stir down in the depths but young maydew was looking at his glove the handle of the carriage had left a mark that saddened him  you know him well i suppose old george  very well  some fellows if they have a good thing keep it so jolly dark you fond of racin mrs bellew  passionately  so am i and his eyes continued its ripping to like what you like for hypnotised they could not tear themselves away from that creamy face with its full lips and the clear faintly smiling eyes above the high collar of white fur  at the terminus his services were refused and rather crestfallen with his hat raised he watched her walk away but soon in his cab his face regained its normal look his eyes seemed saying to the little mirror look at me come look at mecan anyone be better fed     chapter vii  sabbath at worsted skeynes  in the white morningroom which served for her boudoir mrs pendyce sat with an opened letter in her lap it was her practice to sit there on sunday mornings for an hour before she went to her room adjoining to put on her hat for church it was her pleasure during that hour to do nothing but sit at the window open if the weather permitted and look over the home paddock and the squat spire of the village church rising among a group of elms it is not known what she thought about at those times unless of the countless sunday mornings she had sat there with her hands in her lap waiting to be roused at 1045 by the squires entrance and his now my dear youll be late she had sat there till her hair once darkbrown was turning grey she would sit there until it was white one day she would sit there no longer and as likely as not mr pendyce still well preserved would enter and say now my dear youll be late having for the moment forgotten  but this was all to be expected nothing out of the common the same thing was happening in hundreds of country houses throughout the three kingdoms and women were sitting waiting for their hair to turn white who long before at the altar of a fashionable church had parted with their imaginations and all the changes and chances of this mortal life  round her chair the dear dogs laythis was their practice too and now and again the skye he was getting very old would put out a long tongue and lick her little pointed shoe for mrs pendyce had been a pretty woman and her feet were as small as ever  beside her on a spindley table stood a china bowl filled with dried roseleaves whereon had been scattered an essence smelling like sweetbriar whose secret she had learned from her mother in the old warwickshire home of the totteridges long since sold to mr abraham brightman mrs pendyce born in the year 1840 loved sweet perfumes and was not ashamed of using them  the indian summer sun was soft and bright and wistful soft and bright were mrs pendyces eyes fixed on the letter in her lap she turned it over and began to read again a wrinkle visited her brow it was not often that a letter demanding decision or involving responsibility came to her hands past the kind and just censorship of horace pendyce many matters were under her control but were not so to speak connected with the outer world thus ran the letter   srwc hanover square  november 1 1891  dear margery  i want to see you and talk something over so im running down on sunday afternoon there is a train of sorts any loft will do for me to sleep in if your house is full as it may be i suppose at this time of year on second thoughts i will tell you what i want to see you about you know of course that since her father died i am helen bellews only guardian her present position is one in which no woman should be placed i am convinced it ought to be put an end to that man bellew deserves no consideration i cannot write of him coolly so i wont write at all it is two years now since they separated entirely as i consider through his fault the law has placed her in a cruel and helpless position all this time but now thank god i believe we can move for a divorce you know me well enough to realise what i have gone through before coming to this conclusion heaven knows if i could hit on some other way in which her future could be safeguarded i would take it in preference to this which is most repugnant but i cannot you are the only woman i can rely on to be interested in her and i must see bellew let not the fat and just benson and his estimable horses be disturbed on my account i will walk up and carry my toothbrush  affectionately your cousin  gregory vigil   mrs pendyce smiled she saw no joke but she knew from the wording of the last sentence that gregory saw one and she liked to give it a welcome so smiling and wrinkling her forehead she mused over the letter her thoughts wandered the last scandallady rose bethanys divorcehad upset the whole county and even now one had to be careful what one said horace would not like the idea of another divorcesuit and that so close to worsted skeynes when helen left on thursday he had said  im not sorry shes gone her position is a queer one people dont like it the maidens were quite  and mrs pendyce remembered with a glow at her heart how she had broken in  ellen maiden is too bourgeoise for anything  nor had mr pendyces look of displeasure effaced the comfort of that word  poor horace the children took after him except george who took after her brother hubert the dear boy had gone back to his club on fridaythe day after helen and the others went she wished he could have stayed she wishedthe wrinkle deepened on her brow too much london was bad for him too muchher fancy flew to the london which she saw now only for three weeks in june and july for the sake of the girls just when her garden was at its best and when really things were such a whirl that she never knew whether she was asleep or awake it was not like london at allnot like that london under spring skies or in early winter lamplight where all the passersby seemed so interesting living all sorts of strange and eager lives with strange and eager pleasures running all sorts of risks hungry sometimes homeless evenso fascinating so unlike  now my dear youll be late  mr pendyce in his norfolk jacket which he was on his way to change for a black coat passed through the room followed by the spaniel john he turned at the door and the spaniel john turned too  i hope to goodness barterll be short this morning i want to talk to old fox about that new chaffcutter  round their mistress the three terriers raised their heads the aged skye gave forth a gentle growl mrs pendyce leaned over and stroked his nose  roy roy how can you dear  mr pendyce said  the old dogs losing all his teeth hell have to be put away  his wife flushed painfully  oh no horaceoh no  the squire coughed  we must think of the dog he said  mrs pendyce rose and crumpling the letter nervously followed him from the room  a narrow path led through the home paddock towards the church and along it the household were making their way the maids in feathers hurried along guiltily by twos and threes the butler followed slowly by himself a footman and a groom came next leaving trails of pomatum in the air presently general pendyce in a high squaretopped bowler hat carrying a malacca cane and prayerbook appeared walking between bee and norah also carrying prayerbooks with foxterriers by their sides lastly the squire in a high hat six or seven paces in advance of his wife in a small velvet toque  the rooks had ceased their wheeling and their cawing the fiveminutes bell with its jerky toneless tolling alone broke the sunday hush an old horse not yet taken up from grass stood motionless resting a hindleg with his face turned towards the footpath within the churchyard wicket the rector firm and square a lowcrowned hat tilted up on his bald forehead was talking to a deaf old cottager he raised his hat and nodded to the ladies then leaving his remark unfinished disappeared within the vestry at the organ mrs barter was drawing out stops in readiness to play her husband into church and her eyes halfshining and halfanxious were fixed intently on the vestry door  the squire and mrs pendyce now almost abreast came down the aisle and took their seats beside their daughters and the general in the first pew on the left it was high and cushioned they knelt down on tall red hassocks mrs pendyce remained over a minute buried in thought mr pendyce rose sooner and looking down kicked the hassock that had been put too near the seat fixing his glasses on his nose he consulted a worn old bible then rising walked to the lectern and began to find the lessons the bell ceased a wheezing growling noise was heard mrs barter had begun to play the rector in a white surplice was coming in mr pendyce with his back turned continued to find the lessons the service began  through a plain glass window high up in the righthand aisle the sun shot a gleam athwart the pendyces pew it found its last restingplace on mrs barters face showing her soft crumpled cheeks painfully flushed the lines on her forehead and those shining eyes eager and anxious travelling ever from her husband to her music and back again at the least fold or frown on his face the music seemed to quiver as to some spasm in the players soul in the pendyces pew the two girls sang loudly and with a certain sweetness mr pendyce too sang and once or twice he looked in surprise at his brother as though he were not making a creditable noise  mrs pendyce did not sing but her lips moved and her eyes followed the millions of little dust atoms dancing in the long slanting sunbeam its gold path canted slowly from her then as by magic vanished mrs pendyce let her eyes fall something had fled from her soul with the sunbeam her lips moved no more  the squire sang two loud notes spoke three sang two again the psalms ceased he left his seat and placing his hands on the lecterns sides leaned forward and began to read the lesson he read the story of abraham and lot and of their flocks and herds and how they could not dwell together and as he read hypnotised by the sound of his own voice he was thinking  this lesson is well read by me horace pendyce i am horace pendycehorace pendyce amen horace pendyce  and in the first pew on the left mrs pendyce fixed her eyes upon him for this was her habit and she thought how when the spring came again she would run up to town alone and stay at greens hotel where she had always stayed with her father when a girl george had promised to look after her and take her round the theatres and forgetting that she had thought this every autumn for the last ten years she gently smiled and nodded mr pendyce said  and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord here endeth the first lesson  the sun reaching the second window again shot a gold pathway athwart the church again the millions of dust atoms danced and the service went on  there came a hush the spaniel john crouched close to the ground outside poked his long black nose under the churchyard gate the foxterriers seated patient in the grass pricked their ears a voice speaking on one note broke the hush the spaniel john sighed the foxterriers dropped their ears and lay down heavily against each other the rector had begun to preach he preached on fruitfulness and in the first righthand pew six of his children at once began to fidget mrs barter sideways and unsupported on her seat kept her starry eyes fixed on his cheek a line of perplexity furrowed her brow now and again she moved as though her back ached the rector quartered his congregation with his gaze lest any amongst them should incline to sleep he spoke in a loudsounding voice  godhe saidwished men to be fruitful intended them to be fruitful commanded them to be fruitful godhe saidmade men and made the earth he made man to be fruitful in the earth he made man neither to question nor answer nor argue he made him to be fruitful and possess the land as they had heard in that beautiful lesson this morning god had set bounds the bounds of marriage within which man should multiply within those bounds it was his duty to multiply and that exceedinglyeven as abraham multiplied in these days dangers pitfalls snares were rife in these days men went about and openly unashamedly advocated shameful doctrines let them beware it would be his sacred duty to exclude such men from within the precincts of that parish entrusted to his care by god in the language of their greatest poet such men were dangerousdangerous to christianity dangerous to their country and to national life they were not brought into this world to follow sinful inclination to obey their mortal reason god demanded sacrifices of men patriotism demanded sacrifices of men it demanded that they should curb their inclinations and desires it demanded of them their first duty as men and christians the duty of being fruitful and multiplying in order that they might till this fruitful earth not selfishly not for themselves alone it demanded of them the duty of multiplying in order that they and their children might be equipped to smite the enemies of their queen and country and uphold the name of england in whatever quarrel against all who rashly sought to drag her flag in the dust  the squire opened his eyes and looked at his watch folding his arms he coughed for he was thinking of the chaffcutter beside him mrs pendyce with her eyes on the altar smiled as if in sleep she was thinking skywards in bond street used to have lovely lace perhaps in the spring i couldor there was goblins their point de venise  behind them four rows back an aged cottage woman as upright as a girl sat with a rapt expression on her carved old face she never moved her eyes seemed drinking in the movements of the rectors lips her whole being seemed hanging on his words it is true her dim eyes saw nothing but a blur her poor deaf ears could not hear one word but she sat at the angle she was used to and thought of nothing at all and perhaps it was better so for she was near her end  outside the churchyard in the sunwarmed grass the foxterriers lay one against the other pretending to shiver with their small bright eyes fixed on the church door and the rubbery nostrils of the spaniel john worked ever busily beneath the wicket gate     chapter viii  gregory vigil proposes  about three oclock that afternoon a tall man walked up the avenue at worsted skeynes in one hand carrying his hat in the other a small brown bag he stopped now and then and took deep breaths expanding the nostrils of his straight nose he had a fine head with wings of grizzled hair his clothes were loose his stride was springy standing in the middle of the drive taking those long breaths with his moist blue eyes upon the sky he excited the attention of a robin who ran out of a rhododendron to see and when he had passed began to whistle gregory vigil turned and screwed up his humorous lips and except that he was completely lacking in embonpoint he had a certain resemblance to this bird which is supposed to be peculiarly british  he asked for mrs pendyce in a high light voice very pleasant to the ear and was at once shown to the white morningroom  she greeted him affectionately like many women who have grown used to hearing from their husbands the formula oh your peopleshe had a strong feeling for her kith and kin  you know grig she said when her cousin was seated your letter was rather disturbing her separation from captain bellew has caused such a lot of talk about here yes its very common i know that sort of thing but horace is so all the squires and parsons and county people we get about here are just the same of course im very fond of her shes so charming to look at but gregory i really dont dislike her husband hes a desperate sort of personi think thats rather refreshing and you know i do think shes a little like him in that  the blood rushed up into gregory vigils forehead he put his hand to his head and said  like him like that man is a rose like an artichoke  mrs pendyce went on  i enjoyed having her here immensely its the first time shes been here since she left the firs how long is that two years but you know grig the maidens were quite upset about her do you think a divorce is really necessary  gregory vigil answered im afraid it is  mrs pendyce met her cousins gaze serenely if anything her brows were uplifted more than usual but as at the stirring of secret trouble her fingers began to twine and twist before her rose a vision of george and mrs bellew side by side it was a vague maternal feeling an instinctive fear she stilled her fingers let her eyelids droop and said  of course dear grig if i can help you in any wayhorace does so dislike anything to do with the papers  gregory vigil drew in his breath  the papers he said how hateful it is to think that our civilisation should allow women to be cast to the dogs understand margery im thinking of her in this matter im not capable of considering anything else  mrs pendyce murmured of course dear grig i quite understand  her position is odious a woman should not have to live like that exposed to everyones foul gossip  but dear grig i dont think she minds she seemed to me in such excellent spirits  gregory ran his fingers through his hair  nobody understands her he said shes so plucky  mrs pendyce stole a glance at him and a little ironical smile flickered over her face  no one can look at her without seeing her spirit but grig perhaps you dont quite understand her either  gregory vigil put his hand to his head  i must open the window a moment he said  again mrs pendyces fingers began twisting again she stilled them  we were quite a large party last week and now theres only charles even george has gone back hell be so sorry to have missed you  gregory neither turned nor answered and a wistful look came into mrs pendyces face  it was so nice for the dear boy to win that race im afraid he bets rather its such a comfort horace doesnt know  still gregory did not speak  mrs pendyces face lost its anxious look and gained a sort of gentle admiration  dear grig she said where do you go about your hair it is so nice and long and wavy  gregory turned with a blush  ive been wanting to get it cut for ages do you really mean margery that your husband cant realise the position shes placed in  mrs pendyce fixed her eyes on her lap  you see grig she began she was here a good deal before she left the firs and of course shes related to methough its very distant with those horrid cases you never know what will happen horace is certain to say that she ought to go back to her husband or if thats impossible hell say she ought to think of society lady rose bethanys case has shaken everybody and horace is nervous i dont know how it is theres a great feeling amongst people about here against women asserting themselves you should hear mr barter and sir james maiden and dozens of others the funny thing is that the women take their side of course it seems odd to me because so many of the totteridges ran away or did something funny i cant help sympathising with her but i have to think ofofin the country you dont know how things that people do get about before theyve done them theres only that and hunting to talk of  gregory vigil clutched at his head  well if this is what chivalry has come to thank god im not a squire  mrs pendyces eyes flickered  ah she said ive thought like that so often  gregory broke the silence  i cant help the customs of the country my dutys plain theres nobody else to look after her  mrs pendyce sighed and rising from her chair said very well dear grig do let us go and have some tea  tea at worsted skeynes was served in the hall on sundays and was usually attended by the rector and his wife young cecil tharp had walked over with his dog which could be heard whimpering faintly outside the frontdoor  general pendyce with his knees crossed and the tips of his fingers pressed together was leaning back in his chair and staring at the wall the squire who held his latest birdsegg in his hand was showing its spots to the rector  in a corner by a harmonium on which no one ever played norah talked of the village hockey club to mrs barter who sat with her eyes fixed on her husband on the other side of the fire bee and young tharp whose chairs seemed very close together spoke of their horses in low tones stealing shy glances at each other the light was failing the wood logs crackled and now and then over the cosy hum of talk there fell short drowsy silencessilences of sheer warmth and comfort like the silence of the spaniel john asleep against his masters boot  well said gregory softly i must go and see this man  is it really necessary grig to see him at all i meanif youve made up your mind  gregory ran his hand through his hair  its only fair i think and crossing the hall he let himself out so quietly that no one but mrs pendyce noticed he had gone  an hour and a half later near the railwaystation on the road from the village back to worsted skeynes mr pendyce and his daughter bee were returning from their sunday visit to their old butler bigson the squire was talking  hes failing beedear old bigsons failing i cant hear what he says he mumbles so and he forgets fancy his forgetting that i was at oxford but we dont get servants like him nowadays that chap weve got now is a sleepy fellow sleepy heswhats that in the road theyve no business to be coming at that pace who is it i cant see  down the middle of the dark road a dog cart was approaching at top speed bee seized her fathers arm and pulled it vigorously for mr pendyce was standing stockstill in disapproval the dog cart passed within a foot of him and vanished swinging round into the station mr pendyce turned in his tracks  who was that disgraceful on sunday too the fellow must be drunk he nearly ran over my legs did you see bee he nearly ran over  bee answered  it was captain bellew father i saw his face bellew that drunken fellow i shall summons him did you see bee he nearly ran over my  perhaps hes had bad news said bee theres the train going out now i do hope he caught it  bad news is that an excuse for driving over me you hope he caught it i hope hes thrown himself out the ruffian i hope hes killed himself  in this strain mr pendyce continued until they reached the church on their way up the aisle they passed gregory vigil leaning forward with his elbows on the desk and his hand covering his eyes  at eleven oclock that night a man stood outside the door of mrs bellews flat in chelsea violently ringing the bell his face was deathly white but his little dark eyes sparkled the door was opened and helen bellew in evening dress stood there holding a candle in her hand  who are you what do you want  the man moved into the light  jaspar you what on earth  i want to talk  talk do you know what time it is  timetheres no such thing you might give me a kiss after two years ive been drinking but im not drunk  mrs bellew did not kiss him neither did she draw back her face no trace of alarm showed in her icegrey eyes she said if i let you in will you promise to say what you want to say quickly and go away  the little brown devils danced in bellews face he nodded they stood by the hearth in the sittingroom and on the lips of both came and went a peculiar smile  it was difficult to contemplate too seriously a person with whom one had lived for years with whom one had experienced in common the range of human passion intimacy and estrangement who knew all those little daily things that men and women living together know of each other and with whom in the end without hatred but because of ones nature one had ceased to live there was nothing for either of them to find out and with a little smile like the smile of knowledge itself jaspar bellew and helen his wife looked at each other  well she said again what have you come for  bellews face had changed its expression was furtive his mouth twitched a furrow had come between his eyes  howareyou he said in a thick muttering voice  mrs bellews clear voice answered  now jaspar what is it that you want  the little brown devils leaped up again in jaspars face  you look very pretty tonight  his wifes lips curled  im much the same as i always was she said  a violent shudder shook bellew he fixed his eyes on the floor a little beyond her to the left suddenly he raised them they were quite lifeless  im perfectly sober he murmured thickly then with startling quickness his eyes began to sparkle again he came a step nearer  youre my wife he said  mrs bellew smiled  come she answered you must go and she put out her bare arm to push him back but bellew recoiled of his own accord his eyes were fixed again on the floor a little beyond her to the left  whats that he stammered whats thatthat black  the devilry mockery admiration bemusement had gone out of his face it was white and calm and horribly pathetic  dont turn me out he stammered dont turn me out  mrs bellew looked at him hard the defiance in her eyes changed to a sort of pity she took a quick step and put her hand on his shoulder  its all right old boyall right she said theres nothing there     chapter ix  mr paramor disposes  mrs pendyce who in accordance with her husbands wish still occupied the same room as mr pendyce chose the ten minutes before he got up to break to him gregorys decision the moment was auspicious for he was only half awake  horace she said and her face looked young and anxious grig says that helen bellew ought not to go on in her present position of course i told him that youd be annoyed but grig says that she cant go on like this that she simply must divorce captain bellew  mr pendyce was lying on his back  whats that he said  mrs pendyce went on  i knew it would worry you but reallyshe fixed her eyes on the ceilingi suppose we ought only to think of her  the squire sat up  what was that he said about bellew  mrs pendyce went on in a languid voice and without moving her eyes  dont be angrier than you can help dear it is so wearing if grig says she ought to divorce captain bellew then im sure she ought  horace pendyce subsided on his pillow with a bounce and he too lay with his eyes fixed on the ceiling  divorce him he saidi should think so he ought to be hanged a fellow like that i told you last night he nearly drove over me living just as he likes setting an example of devilry to the whole neighbourhood if i hadnt kept my head hed have bowled me over like a ninepin and bee into the bargain  mrs pendyce sighed  it was a narrow escape she said  divorce him resumed mr pendycei should think so she ought to have divorced him long ago it was the nearest thing in the world another foot and i should have been knocked off my feet  mrs pendyce withdrew her glance from the ceiling  at first she said i wondered whether it was quitebut im very glad youve taken it like this  taken it i can tell you margery that sort of thing makes one think all the time barter was preaching last night i was wondering what on earth would have happened to this estate ifif and he looked round with a frown even as it is i barely make the two ends of it meet as to george hes no more fit at present to manage it than you are hed make a loss of thousands  im afraid george is too much in london thats the reason i wondered whetherim afraid he sees too much of  mrs pendyce stopped a flush suffused her cheeks she had pinched herself violently beneath the bedclothes  george said mr pendyce pursuing his own thoughts has no gumption hed never manage a man like peacockand you encourage him he ought to marry and settle down  mrs pendyce the flush dying in her cheeks said  george is very like poor hubert  horace pendyce drew his watch from beneath his pillow  ah but he refrained from adding your people for hubert totteridge had not been dead a year ten minutes to eight you keep me talking here its time i was in my bath  clad in pyjamas with a very wide blue stripe greyeyed greymoustached slim and erect he paused at the door  the girls havent a scrap of imagination what do you think bee said i hope he hasnt lost his train lost his train good god and i might havei might have the squire did not finish his sentence no words but what seemed to him violent and extreme would have fulfilled his conception of the danger he had escaped and it was against his nature and his training to exaggerate a physical risk  at breakfast he was more cordial than usual to gregory who was going up by the first train for as a rule mr pendyce rather distrusted him as one would a wifes cousin especially if he had a sense of humour  a very good fellow he was wont to say of him but an outandout radical it was the only label he could find for gregorys peculiarities  gregory departed without further allusion to the object of his visit he was driven to the station in a brougham by the first groom and sat with his hat off and his head at the open window as if trying to get something blown out of his brain indeed throughout the whole of his journey up to town he looked out of the window and expressions half humorous and half puzzled played on his face like a panorama slowly unrolled country house after country house church after church appeared before his eyes in the autumn sunlight among the hedgerows and the coverts that were all brown and gold and far away on the rising uplands the slow ploughman drove outlined against the sky  he took a cab from the station to his solicitors in lincolns inn fields he was shown into a room bare of all legal accessories except a series of law reports and a bunch of violets in a glass of fresh water edmund paramor the senior partner of paramor and herring a cleanshaven man of sixty with irongrey hair brushed in a cockscomb off his forehead greeted him with a smile  ah vigil how are you up from the country  from worsted skeynes  horace pendyce is a client of mine well what can we do for you your society up a tree  gregory vigil in the padded leather chair that had held so many aspirants for comfort sat a full minute without speaking and mr paramor too after one keen glance at his client that seemed to come from very far down in his soul sat motionless and grave there was at that moment something a little similar in the eyes of these two very different men a look of kindred honesty and aspiration gregory spoke at last  its a painful subject to me  mr paramor drew a face on his blottingpaper  i have come went on gregory about a divorce for my ward  mrs jaspar bellew  yes her position is intolerable  mr paramor gave him a searching look  let me see i think she and her husband have been separated for some time  yes for two years  youre acting with her consent of course  i have spoken to her  you know the law of divorce i suppose  gregory answered with a painful smile  im not very clear about it i hardly ever look at those cases in the paper i hate the whole idea  mr paramor smiled again became instantly grave and said  we shall want evidence of certain things have you got any evidence  gregory ran his hand through his hair  i dont think therell be any difficulty he said bellew agreesthey both agree  mr paramor stared  whats that to do with it  gregory caught him up  surely where both parties are anxious and theres no opposition it cant be difficult  good lord said mr paramor  but ive seen bellew i saw him yesterday im sure i can get him to admit anything you want  mr paramor drew his breath between his teeth  did you ever he said drily hear of whats called collusion  gregory got up and paced the room  i dont know that ive ever heard anything very exact about the thing at all he said the whole subject is hateful to me i regard marriage as sacred and when which god forbid it proves unsacred it is horrible to think of these formalities this is a christian country we are all flesh and blood what is this slime paramor  with this outburst he sank again into the chair and leaned his head on his hand and oddly instead of smiling mr paramor looked at him with haunting eyes  two unhappy persons must not seem to agree to be parted he said one must be believed to desire to keep hold of the other and must pose as an injured person there must be evidence of misconduct and in this case of cruelty or of desertion the evidence must be impartial this is the law  gregory said without looking up  but why  mr paramor took his violets out of the water and put them to his nose  how do you meanwhy  i mean why this underhand roundabout way  mr paramors face changed with startling speed from its haunting look back to his smile  well he said for the preservation of morality what do you suppose  do you call it moral so to imprison people that you drive them to sin in order to free themselves  mr paramor obliterated the face on his blottingpad  wheres your sense of humour he said  i see no joke paramor  mr paramor leaned forward  my dear friend he said earnestly i dont say for a minute that our system doesnt cause a great deal of quite unnecessary suffering i dont say that it doesnt need reform most lawyers and almost any thinking man will tell you that it does but thats a wide question which doesnt help us here well manage your business for you if it can be done youve made a bad start thats all the first thing is for us to write to mrs bellew and ask her to come and see us we shall have to get bellew watched  gregory said  thats detestable cant it be done without that  mr paramor bit his forefinger  not safe he said but dont bother well see to all that  gregory rose and went to the window he said suddenly  i cant bear this underhand work  mr paramor smiled  every honest man he said feels as you do but you see we must think of the law  gregory burst out again  can no one get a divorce then without making beasts or spies of themselves  mr paramor said gravely  it is difficult perhaps impossible you see the law is based on certain principles  principles  a smile wreathed mr paramors mouth but died instantly  ecclesiastical principles and according to these a person desiring a divorce ipso facto loses caste that they should have to make spies or beasts of themselves is not of grave importance  gregory came back to the table and again buried his head in his hands  dont joke please paramor he said its all so painful to me  mr paramors eyes haunted his clients bowed head  im not joking he said god forbid do you read poetry and opening a drawer he took out a book bound in red leather this is a man im fond of          life is mostly froth and bubble                two things stand like stone           kindness in anothers trouble                courage in your own  that seems to me the sum of all philosophy  paramor said gregory my ward is very dear to me she is dearer to me than any woman i know i am here in a most dreadful dilemma on the one hand there is this horrible underhand business with all its publicity and on the other there is her positiona beautiful woman fond of gaiety living alone in this london where every mans instincts and every womans tongue look upon her as fair game it has been brought home to me only too painfully of late god forgive me i have even advised her to go back to bellew but that seems out of the question what am i to do  mr paramor rose  i know he saidi know my dear friend i know and for a full minute he remained motionless a little turned from gregory it will be better he said suddenly for her to get rid of him ill go and see her myself well spare her all we can ill go this afternoon and let you know the result  as though by mutual instinct they put out their hands which they shook with averted faces then gregory seizing his hat strode out of the room  he went straight to the rooms of his society in hanover square they were on the top floor higher than the rooms of any other society in the buildingso high in fact that from their windows which began five feet up you could practically only see the sky  a girl with sloping shoulders red cheeks and dark eyes was working a typewriter in a corner and sideways to the sky at a bureau littered with addressed envelopes unanswered letters and copies of the societys publications was seated a greyhaired lady with a long thin weatherbeaten face and glowing eyes who was frowning at a page of manuscript  oh mr vigil she said im so glad youve come this paragraph mustnt go as it is it will never do  gregory took the manuscript and read the paragraph in question  this case of eva nevill is so horrible that we ask those of our women readers who live in the security luxury perhaps peace certainly of their country homes what they would have done finding themselves suddenly in the position of this poor girlin a great city without friends without money almost without clothes and exposed to all the craft of one of those fiends in human form who prey upon our womankind let each one ask herself should i have resisted where she fell  it will never do to send that out said the lady again  what is the matter with it mrs shortman  its too personal think of lady maiden or most of our subscribers you cant expect them to imagine themselves like poor eva im sure they wont like it  gregory clutched at his hair  is it possible they cant stand that he said  its only because youve given such horrible details of poor eva  gregory got up and paced the room  mrs shortman went on  youve not lived in the country for so long mr vigil that you dont remember you see i know people dont like to be harrowed besides think how difficult it is for them to imagine themselves in such a position itll only shock them and do our circulation harm  gregory snatched up the page and handed it to the girl who sat at the typewriter in the corner  read that please miss mallow  the girl read without raising her eyes  well is it what mrs shortman says  the girl handed it back with a blush  its perfect of course in itself but i think mrs shortman is right it might offend some people  gregory went quickly to the window threw it up and stood gazing at the sky both women looked at his back  mrs shortman said gently  i would only just alter it like this from after country homes whether they do not pity and forgive this poor girl in a great city without friends without money almost without clothes and exposed to all the craft of one of those fiends in human form who prey upon our womankind and just stop there  gregory returned to the table  not forgive he said not forgive  mrs shortman raised her pen  you dont know she said what a strong feeling there is mind it has to go to numbers of parsonages mr vigil our principle has always been to be very careful and you have been plainer than usual in stating the case its not as if they really could put themselves in her position thats impossible not one woman in a hundred could especially among those who live in the country and have never seen life im a squires daughter myself  and i a parsons said gregory with a smile  mrs shortman looked at him reproachfully  joking apart mr vigil its touch and go with our paper as it is we really cant afford it ive had lots of letters lately complaining that we put the cases unnecessarily strongly heres one   bournefield rectory  november 1  dear madam  while sympathising with your good work i am afraid i cannot become a subscriber to your paper while it takes its present form as i do not feel that it is always fit reading for my girls i cannot think it either wise or right that they should become acquainted with such dreadful aspects of life however true they may be  i am dear madam  respectfully yours  winifred tuddenham   psi could never feel sure too that my maids would not pick it up and perhaps take harm  i had that only this morning  gregory buried his face in his hands and sitting thus he looked so like a man praying that no one spoke when he raised his face it was to say  not forgive mrs shortman not forgive  mrs shortman ran her pen through the word  very well mr vigil she said its a risk  the sound of the typewriter which had been hushed began again from the corner  that case of drink mr vigilmillicent porterim afraid theres very little hope there  gregory asked  what now  relapsed again its the fifth time  gregory turned his face to the window and looked at the sky  i must go and see her just give me her address  mrs shortman read from a green book  mrs porter 2 bilcock buildings bloomsbury mr vigil  yes  mr vigil i do sometimes wish you would not persevere so long with those hopeless cases they never seem to come to anything and your time is so valuable  how can i give them up mrs shortman theres no choice  but mr vigil why is there no choice you must draw the line somewhere do forgive me for saying that i think you sometimes waste your time  gregory turned to the girl at the typewriter  miss mallow is mrs shortman right do i waste my time  the girl at the typewriter blushed vividly and without looking round said  how can i tell mr vigil but it does worry one  a humorous and perplexed smile passed over gregorys lips  now i know i shall cure her he said 2 bilcock buildings and he continued to look at the sky hows your neuralgia mrs shortman  mrs shortman smiled  awful  gregory turned quickly  you feel that window then im so sorry  mrs shortman shook her head  no but perhaps molly does  the girl at the typewriter said  oh no please mr vigil dont shut it for me  truth and honour  truth and honour replied both women and all three for a moment sat looking at the sky then mrs shortman said  you see you cant get to the root of the evilthat husband of hers  gregory turned  ah he said that man if she could only get rid of him that ought to have been done long ago before he drove her to drink like this why didnt she mrs shortman why didnt she  mrs shortman raised her eyes which had such a peculiar spiritual glow  i dont suppose she had the money she said and she must have been such a nice woman then a nice woman doesnt like to divorce  gregory looked at her  what mrs shortman you too you too among the pharisees  mrs shortman flushed  she wanted to save him she said she must have wanted to save him  then you and i but gregory did not finish and turned again to the window mrs shortman too biting her lips looked anxiously at the sky  miss mallow at the typewriter with a scared face plied her fingers faster than ever  gregory was the first to speak  you must please forgive me he said gently a personal matter i forgot myself  mrs shortman withdrew her gaze from the sky  oh mr vigil if i had known  gregory gregory smiled  dont dont he said weve quite frightened poor miss mallow  miss mallow looked round at him he looked at her and all three once more looked at the sky it was the chief recreation of this little society  gregory worked till nearly three and walked out to a bunshop where he lunched off a piece of cake and a cup of coffee he took an omnibus and getting on the top was driven west with a smile on his face and his hat in his hand he was thinking of helen bellew it had become a habit with him to think of her the best and most beautiful of her sexa habit in which he was growing grey and with which therefore he could not part and those women who saw him with his uncovered head smiled and thought  what a finelooking man  but george pendyce who saw him from the window of the stoics club smiled a different smile the sight of him was always a little unpleasant to george  nature who had made gregory vigil a man had long found that he had got out of her hands and was living in celibacy deprived of the comfort of woman even of those poor creatures whom he befriended and nature who cannot bear that man should escape her control avenged herself through his nerves and a habit of blood to the head extravagance she said i cannot have and when i made this man i made him quite extravagant enough for his temperament not uncommon in a misty climate had been born seven feet high and as a man cannot add a cubit to his stature so neither can he take one off gregory could not bear that a yellow man must always remain a yellow man but trusted by care and attention some day to see him white there lives no mortal who has not a philosophy as distinct from every other mortals as his face is different from their faces but gregory believed that philosophers unfortunately alien must gain in time a likeness to himself if he were careful to tell them often that they had been mistaken other men in this great britain had the same belief  to gregorys reforming instinct it was a constant grief that he had been born refined a natural delicacy would interfere and mar his noblest efforts hence failures deplored by mrs pendyce to lady maiden the night they danced at worsted skeynes  he left his bus near to the flat where mrs bellow lived with reverence he made the tour of the building and back again he had long fixed a rule which he never broke of seeing her only once a fortnight but to pass her windows he went out of his way most days and nights and having made this tour not conscious of having done anything ridiculous still smiling and with his hat on his knee perhaps really happier because he had not seen her was driven east once more passing george pendyce in the bowwindow of the stoics club and once more raising on his face a jeering smile  he had been back at his rooms in buckingham street half an hour when a club commissionaire arrived with mr paramors promised letter  he opened it hastily   the nelson club  trafalgar square  my dear vigil  ive just come from seeing your ward an embarrassing complexion is lent to affairs by what took place last night it appears that after your visit to him yesterday afternoon her husband came up to town and made his appearance at her flat about eleven oclock he was in a condition bordering on delirium tremens and mrs bellew was obliged to keep him for the night i could not she said to me have refused a dog in such a state the visit lasted until this afternoonin fact the man had only just gone when i arrived it is a piece of irony of which i must explain to you the importance i think i told you that the law of divorce is based on certain principles one of these excludes any forgiveness of offences by the party moving for a divorce in technical language any such forgiveness or overlooking is called condonation and it is a complete bar to further action for the time being the court is very jealous of this principle of nonforgiveness and will regard with grave suspicion any conduct on the part of the offended party which might be construed as amounting to condonation i fear that what your ward tells me will make it altogether inadvisable to apply for a divorce on any evidence that may lie in the past it is too dangerous in other words the court would almost certainly consider that she has condoned offences so far any further offence however will in technical language revive the past and under these circumstances though nothing can be done at present there may be hope in the future after seeing your ward i quite appreciate your anxiety in the matter though i am by no means sure that you are right in advising this divorce if you remain in the same mind however i will give the matter my best personal attention and my counsel to you is not to worry this is no matter for a layman especially not for one who like you judges of things rather as they ought to be than as they are  i am my dear vigil  very sincerely yours  edmund paramor  gregory vigil esq  if you want to see me i shall be at my club all the eveninge p   when gregory had read this note he walked to the window and stood looking out over the lights on the river his heart beat furiously his temples were crimson he went downstairs and took a cab to the nelson club  mr paramor who was about to dine invited his visitor to join him  gregory shook his head  no thanks he said i dont feel like dining what is this paramor surely theres some mistake do you mean to tell me that because she acted like a christian to that man she is to be punished for it in this way  mr paramor bit his finger  dont confuse yourself by dragging in christianity christianity has nothing to do with law  you talked of principles said gregoryecclesiastical  yes yes i meant principles imported from the old ecclesiastical conception of marriage which held man and wife to be undivorceable that conception has been abandoned by the law but the principles still haunt  i dont understand  mr paramor said slowly  i dont know that anyone does its our usual muddle but i know this vigilin such a case as your wards we must tread very carefully we must save face as the chinese say we must pretend we dont want to bring this divorce but that we have been so injured that we are obliged to come forward if bellew says nothing the judge will have to take whats put before him but theres always the queens proctor i dont know if you know anything about him  no said gregory i dont  well if he can find out anything against our getting this divorce he will it is not my habit to go into court with a case in which anybody can find out anything  do you mean to say  i mean to say that she must not ask for a divorce merely because she is miserable or placed in a position that no woman should be placed in but only if she has been offended in certain technical ways and ifby condonation for instanceshe has given the court technical reason for refusing her a divorce that divorce will be refused her to get a divorce vigil you must be as hard as nails and as wary as a cat now do you understand  gregory did not answer  mr paramor looked searchingly and rather pityingly in his face  it wont do to go for it at present he said are you still set on this divorce i told you in my letter that i am not sure you are right  how can you ask me paramor after that mans conduct last night i am more than ever set on it  then said mr paramor we must keep a sharp eye on bellew and hope for the best  gregory held out his hand  you spoke of morality he said i cant tell you how inexpressibly mean the whole thing seems to me goodnight  and turning rather quickly he went out  his mind was confused and his heart torn he thought of helen bellew as of the woman dearest to him in the coils of a great slimy serpent and the knowledge that each man and woman unhappily married was whether by his own his partners or by no fault at all in the same embrace afforded him no comfort whatsoever it was long before he left the windy streets to go to his home     chapter x  at blafards  there comes now and then to the surface of our modern civilisation one of those great and good men who unconscious like all great and good men of the goodness and greatness of their work leave behind a lasting memorial of themselves before they go bankrupt  it was so with the founder of the stoics club  he came to the surface in the year 187 with nothing in the world but his clothes and an idea in a single year he had floated the stoics club made ten thousand pounds lost more and gone down again  the stoics club lived after him by reason of the immortal beauty of his idea in 1891 it was a strong and corporate body not perhaps quite so exclusive as it had been but on the whole as smart and aristocratic as any club in london with the exception of that one or two into which nobody ever got the idea with which its founder had underpinned the edifice was like all great ideas simple permanent and perfectso simple permanent and perfect that it seemed amazing no one had ever thought of it before it was embodied in no 1 of the members rules  no member of this club shall have any occupation whatsoever  hence the name of a club renowned throughout london for the excellence of its wines and cuisine  its situation was in piccadilly fronting the green park and through the many windows of its groundfloor smokingroom the public were privileged to see at all hours of the day numbers of stoics in various attitudes reading the daily papers or gazing out of the window  some of them who did not direct companies grow fruit or own yachts wrote a book or took an interest in a theatre the greater part eked out existence by racing horses hunting foxes and shooting birds individuals among them however had been known to play the piano and take up the roman catholic religion many explored the same spots of the continent year after year at stated seasons some belonged to the yeomanry others called themselves barristers once in a way one painted a picture or devoted himself to good works they were in fact of all sorts and temperaments but their common characteristic was an independent income often so settled by providence that they could not in any way get rid of it  but though the principle of no occupation overruled all class distinctions the stoics were mainly derived from the landed gentry an instinct that the spirit of the club was safest with persons of this class guided them in their elections and eldest sons who became members almost as a matter of course lost no time in putting up their younger brothers thereby keeping the wine as pure as might be and preserving that fine old countryhouse flavour which is nowhere so appreciated as in london  after seeing gregory pass on the top of a bus george pendyce went into the cardroom and as it was still empty set to contemplation of the pictures on the walls they were effigies of all those members of the stoics club who from time to time had come under the notice of a celebrated caricaturist in a celebrated society paper whenever a stoic appeared he was at once cut out framed glassed and hung alongside his fellows in this room and george moved from one to another till he came to the last it was himself he was represented in very perfectly cut clothes with slightly crooked elbows and raceglasses slung across him his head disproportionately large was surmounted by a black billycock hat with a very flat brim the artist had thought long and carefully over the face the lips and cheeks and chin were moulded so as to convey a feeling of the unimaginative joy of life but to their shape and complexion was imparted a suggestion of obstinacy and choler to the eyes was given a glazed look and between them set a little line as though their owner were thinking  hard work hard work noblesse oblige i must keep it going  underneath was written the ambler  george stood long looking at the apotheosis of his fame his star was high in the heavens with the eye of his mind he saw a long procession of turf triumphs a long vista of days and nights and in them round them of themhelen bellow and by an odd coincidence as he stood there the artists glazed look came over his eyes the little line sprang up between them  he turned at the sound of voices and sank into a chair to have been caught thus gazing at himself would have jarred on his sense of what was right  it was twenty minutes past seven when in evening dress he left the club and took a shillingsworth to buckingham gate here he dismissed his cab and turned up the large fur collar of his coat between the brim of his operahat and the edge of that collar nothing but his eyes were visible he waited compressing his lips scrutinising each hansom that went by in the soft glow of one coming fast he saw a hand raised to the trap the cab stopped george stepped out of the shadow and got in the cab went on and mrs bellews arm was pressed against his own  it was their simple formula for arriving at a restaurant together  in the third of several little rooms where the lights were shaded they sat down at a table in a corner facing each a wall and underneath her shoe stole out along the floor and touched his patent leather boot in their eyes for all their wouldbe wariness a light smouldered which would not be put out an habitue sipping claret at a table across the little room watched them in a mirror and there came into his old heart a glow of warmth half ache half sympathy a smile of understanding stirred the crowsfeet round his eyes its sweetness ebbed and left a little grin about his shaven lips behind the archway in the neighbouring room two waiters met and in their nods and glances was that same unconscious sympathy the same conscious grin and the old habitue thought  how long will it last waiter some coffee and my bill  he had meant to go to the play but he lingered instead to look at mrs bellews white shoulders and bright eyes in the kindly mirror and he thought  young days at present ah young days  waiter a benedictine and hearing her laugh o his old heart ached no one he thought will ever laugh like that for me again here waiter hows this youve charged me for an ice but when the waiter had gone he glanced back into the mirror and saw them clink their glasses filled with golden bubbling wine and he thought wish you good luck for a flash of those teeth my dear id give  but his eyes fell on the paper flowers adorning his little tableyellow and red and green hard lifeless tawdry he saw them suddenly as they were with the dregs of wine in his glass the spill of gravy on the cloth the ruin of the nuts that he had eaten wheezing and coughing this place is not what it was he thought i shant come here again  he struggled into his coat to go but he looked once more in the mirror and met their eyes resting on himself in them he read the careless pity of the young for the old his eyes answered the reflection of their eyes wait wait it is young days yet i wish you no harm my dears and limpingfor one of his legs was lamehe went away  but george and his partner sat on and with every glass of wine the light in their eyes grew brighter for who was there now in the room to mind not a living soul only a tall dark young waiter a little crosseyed who was in consumption only the little winewaiter with a pallid face and a look as if he suffered and the whole world seemed of the colour of the wine they had been drinking but they talked of indifferent things and only their eyes bemused and shining really spoke the dark young waiter stood apart unmoving and his crosseyed glance fixed on her shoulders had all unconsciously the longing of a saint in some holy picture unseen behind the serving screen the little winewaiter poured out and drank a glass from a derelict bottle through a chink of the red blinds an eye peered in from the chill outside staring and curious till its owner passed on in the cold  it was long after nine when they rose the dark young waiter laid her cloak upon her with adoring hands she looked back at him and in her eyes was an infinite indulgence god knows she seemed to say if i could make you happy as well i would why should one suffer life is strong and good  the young waiters crosseyed glance fell before her and he bowed above the money in his hand quickly before them the little winewaiter hurried to the door his suffering face screwed into one long smile  goodnight madam goodnight sir thank you very much  and he too remained bowed over his hand and his smile relaxed  but in the cab georges arm stole round her underneath the cloak and they were borne on in the stream of hurrying hansoms carrying couples like themselves cut off from all but each others eyes from all but each others touch and with their eyes turned in the halfdark they spoke together in low tones     part ii     chapter i  gregory reopens the campaign  at one end of the walled garden which mr pendyce had formed in imitation of that at dear old strathbegally was a virgin orchard of pear and cherry trees they blossomed early and by the end of the third week in april the last of the cherries had broken into flower in the long grass underneath a wealth of daffodils jonquils and narcissus came up year after year and sunned their yellow stars in the light which dappled through the blossom  and here mrs pendyce would come tan gauntlets on her hands and stand her face a little flushed with stooping as though the sight of all that bloom was restful it was due to her that these old trees escaped year after year the pruning and improvements which the genius of the squire would otherwise have applied she had been brought up in an old totteridge tradition that fruittrees should be left to themselves while her husband possessed of a grasp of the subject not more than usually behind the times was all for newer methods she had fought for those trees they were as yet the only things she had fought for in her married life and horace pendyce still remembered with a discomfort robbed by time of poignancy how she had stood with her back to their bedroom door and said if you cut those poor trees horace i wont live here he had at once expressed his determination to have them pruned but having put off the action for a day or two the trees still stood unpruned thirtythree years later he had even come to feel rather proud of the fact that they continued to bear fruit and would speak of them thus queer fancy of my wifes never been cut and yet remarkable thing they do better than any of the others  this spring when all was so forward and the cuckoos already in full song when the scent of young larches in the new plantation planted the year of georges birth was in the air like the perfume of celestial lemons she came to the orchard more than usual and her spirit felt the stirring the old halfpainful yearning for she knew not what that she had felt so often in her first years at worsted skeynes and sitting there on a greenpainted seat under the largest of the cherrytrees she thought even more than her wont of george as though her sons spirit vibrating in its first real passion were calling to her for sympathy  he had been down so little all that winter twice for a couple of days shooting once for a weekend when she had thought him looking thinner and rather worn he had missed christmas for the first time with infinite precaution she had asked him casually if he had seen helen bellew and he had answered oh yes i see her once in a way  secretly all through the winter she consulted the times newspaper for mention of georges horse and was disappointed not to find any one day however in february discovering him absolutely at the head of several lists of horses with figures after them she wrote off at once with a joyful heart of five lists in which the amblers name appeared there was only one in which he was second georges answer came in the course of a week or so   my dear mother  what you saw were the weights for the spring handicaps theyve simply done me out of everything in great haste  your affectionate son  george pendyce   as the spring approached the vision of her independent visit to london which had sustained her throughout the winter having performed its annual function grew mistier and mistier and at last faded away she ceased even to dream of it as though it had never been nor did george remind her and as usual she ceased even to wonder whether he would remind her she thought instead of the season visit and its scurry of parties with a sort of languid fluttering for worsted skeynes and all that worsted skeynes stood for was like a heavy horseman guiding her with iron hands along a narrow lane she dreamed of throwing him in the open but the open she never reached  she woke at seven with her tea and from seven to eight made little notes on tablets while on his back mr pendyce snored lightly she rose at eight at nine she poured out coffee from halfpast nine to ten she attended to the housekeeper and her birds from ten to eleven she attended to the gardener and her dress from eleven to twelve she wrote invitations to persons for whom she did not care and acceptances to persons who did not care for her she drew out also and placed in due sequence cheques for mr pendyces signature and secured receipts carefully docketed on the back within an elastic band as a rule also she received a visit from mrs husell barter from twelve to one she walked with her and the dear dogs to the village where she stood hesitatingly in the cottage doors of persons who were shy of her from halfpast one to two she lunched from two to three she rested on a sofa in the white morningroom with the newspaper in her hand trying to read the parliamentary debate and thinking of other things from three to halfpast four she went to her dear flowers from whom she was liable to be summoned at any moment by the arrival of callers or getting into the carriage was driven to some neighbours mansion where she sat for half an hour and came away at halfpast four she poured out tea at five she knitted a tie or socks for george or gerald and listened with a gentle smile to what was going on from six to seven she received from the squire his impressions of parliament and things at large from seven to seventhirty she changed to a black low dress with old lace about the neck at seventhirty she dined at a quarter to nine she listened to norah playing two waltzes of chopins and a piece called serenade du printemps by baff and to bee singing the mikado or the saucy girl from nine to ten thirty she played a game called piquet which her father had taught her if she could get anyone with whom to play but as this was seldom she played as a rule patience by herself at tenthirty she went to bed at eleventhirty punctually the squire woke her at one oclock she went to sleep on mondays she wrote out in her clear totteridge hand with its fine straight strokes a list of library books made up without distinction of all that were recommended in the ladies paper that came weekly to worsted skeynes periodically mr pendyce would hand her a list of his own compiled out of the times and the field in the privacy of his study this she sent too  thus was the household supplied with literature unerringly adapted to its needs nor was it possible for any undesirable book to find its way into the housenot that this would have mattered much to mrs pendyce for as she often said with gentle regret my dear i have no time to read  this afternoon it was so warm that the bees were all around among the blossoms and two thrushes who had built in a yewtree that watched over the scotch garden were in a violent flutter because one of their chicks had fallen out of the nest the mother bird at the edge of the long orchard grass was silent trying by example to still the tiny creatures cheeping lest it might attract some large or human thing  mrs pendyce sitting under the oldest cherrytree looked for the sound and when she had located it picked up the baby bird and as she knew the whereabouts of all the nests put it back into its cradle to the loud terror and grief of the parent birds she went back to the bench and sat down again  she had in her soul something of the terror of the mother thrush the maidens had been paying the call that preceded their annual migration to town and the peculiar glow which lady maiden had the power of raising had not yet left her cheeks true she had the comfort of the thought ellen maiden is so bourgeoise but today it did not still her heart  accompanied by one pale daughter who never left her and two pale dogs forced to run all the way now lying under the carriage with their tongues out lady maiden had come and stayed full time and for threequarters of that time she had seemed as it were labouring under a sense of duty unfulfilled for the remaining quarter mrs pendyce had laboured under a sense of duty fulfilled  my dear lady maiden had said having told the pale daughter to go into the conservatory im the last person in the world to repeat gossip as you know but i think its only right to tell you that ive been hearing things you see my boy fred who would ultimately become sir frederick maiden belongs to the same club as your son georgethe stoics all young men belong there of coursei mean if theyre anybody im sorry to say theres no doubt about it your son has been seen dining atperhaps i ought not to mention the nameblafards with mrs bellew i dare say you dont know what sort of a place blafards isa lot of little rooms where people go when they dont want to be seen ive never been there of course but i can imagine it perfectly and not once but frequently i thought i would speak to you because i do think its so scandalous of her in her position  an azalea in a blue and white pot had stood between them and in this plant mrs pendyce buried her cheeks and eyes but when she raised her face her eyebrows were lifted to their utmost limit her lips trembled with anger  oh she said didnt you know theres nothing in that its the latest thing  for a moment lady maiden wavered then duskily flushed her temperament and principles had recovered themselves  if that she said with some dignity is the latest thing i think it is quite time we were back in town  she rose and as she rose such was her unfortunate conformation it flashed through mrs pendyces mind why was i afraid shes only and then as quickly poor woman how can she help her legs being short  but when she was gone side by side with the pale daughter the pale dogs once more running behind the carriage margery pendyce put her hand to her heart  and out here amongst the bees and blossom where the blackbirds were improving each minute their new songs and the air was so fainting sweet with scents her heart would not be stilled but throbbed as though danger were coming on herself and she saw her son as a little boy again in a dirty holland suit with a straw hat down the back of his neck flushed and sturdy as he came to her from some adventure  and suddenly a gush of emotion from deep within her heart and the heart of the spring day a sense of being severed from him by a great remorseless power came over her and taking out a tiny embroidered handkerchief she wept round her the bees hummed carelessly the blossom dropped the dappled sunlight covered her with a pattern as of her own fine lace from the home farm came the lowing of the cows on their way to milking and strange sound in that wellordered home a distant piping on a penny flute   mother mother moother  mrs pendyce passed her handkerchief across her eyes and instinctively obeying the laws of breeding her face lost all trace of its emotion she waited crumpling the tiny handkerchief in her gauntleted hand  mother oh there you are heres gregory vigil  norah a foxterrier on either side was coming down the path behind her unhatted showed gregorys sanguine face between his wings of grizzled hair  i suppose youre going to talk im going over to the rectory tato  and preceded by her dogs norah went on  mrs pendyce put out her hand  well grig she said this is a surprise  gregory seated himself beside her on the bench  ive brought you this he said i want you to look at it before i answer  mrs pendyce who vaguely felt that he would want her to see things as he was seeing them took a letter from him with a sinking heart   private  lincolns inn fields  april 21 1892  my dear vigil  i have now secured such evidence as should warrant our instituting a suit ive written your ward to that effect and am awaiting her instructions unfortunately we have no act of cruelty and ive been obliged to draw her attention to the fact that should her husband defend the suit it will be very difficult to get the court to accept their separation in the light of desertion on his partdifficult indeed even if he doesnt defend the suit in divorce cases one has to remember that what has to be kept out is often more important than what has to be got in and it would be useful to know therefore whether there is likelihood of opposition i do not advise any direct approaching of the husband but if you are possessed of the information you might let me know i hate humbug my dear vigil and i hate anything underhand but divorce is always a dirty business and while the law is shaped as at present and the linen washed in public it will remain impossible for anyone guilty or innocent and even for us lawyers to avoid soiling our hands in one way or another i regret it as much as you do  there is a new man writing verse in the tertiary some of it quite firstrate you might look at the last number my blossom this year is magnificent  with kind regards i am  very sincerely yours  edmund paramor  gregory vigil esq   mrs pendyce dropped the letter in her lap and looked at her cousin  he was at harrow with horace i do like him he is one of the very nicest men i know  it was clear that she was trying to gain time  gregory began pacing up and down  paramor is a man for whom i have the highest respect i would trust him before anyone  it was clear that he too was trying to gain time  oh mind my daffodils please  gregory went down on his knees and raised the bloom that he had trodden on he then offered it to mrs pendyce the action was one to which she was so unaccustomed that it struck her as slightly ridiculous  my dear grig youll get rheumatism and spoil that nice suit the grass comes off so terribly  gregory got up and looked shamefacedly at his knees  the knee is not what it used to be he said  mrs pendyce smiled  you should keep your knees for helen bellow grig i was always five years older than you  gregory rumpled up his hair  kneelings out of fashion but i thought in the country you wouldnt mind  you dont notice things dear grig in the country its still more out of fashion you wouldnt find a woman within thirty miles of here who would like a man to kneel to her weve lost the habit she would think she was being made fun of we soon grow out of vanity  in london said gregory i hear all women intend to be men but in the country i thought  in the country grig all women would like to be men but they dont dare to try they trot behind  as if she had been guilty of thoughts too insightful mrs pendyce blushed  gregory broke out suddenly  i cant bear to think of women like that  again mrs pendyce smiled  you see grig dear you are not married  i detest the idea that marriage changes our views margery i loathe it  mind my daffodils murmured mrs pendyce  she was thinking all the time that dreadful letter what am i to do  and as though he knew her thoughts gregory said  i shall assume that bellew will not defend the case if he has a spark of chivalry in him he will be only too glad to see her free i will never believe that any man could be such a soulless clod as to wish to keep her bound i dont pretend to understand the law but it seems to me that theres only one way for a man to act and after all bellews a gentleman youll see that he will act like one  mrs pendyce looked at the daffodil in her lap  i have only seen him three or four times but it seemed to me grig that he was a man who might act in one way today and another tomorrow he is so very different from all the men about here  when it comes to the deep things of life said gregory one man is much as another is there any man you know who would be so lacking in chivalry as to refuse in these circumstances  mrs pendyce looked at him with a confused expressionwonder admiration irony and even fear struggled in her eyes  i can think of dozens  gregory clutched his forehead  margery he said i hate your cynicism i dont know where you get it from  im so sorry i didnt mean to be cynicali didnt really i only spoke from what ive seen  seen said gregory if i were to go by what i saw daily hourly in london in the course of my work i should commit suicide within a week  but what else can one go by  without answering gregory walked to the edge of the orchard and stood gazing over the scotch garden with his face a little tilted towards the sky mrs pendyce felt he was grieving that she failed to see whatever it was he saw up there and she was sorry he came back and said  we wont discuss it any more  very dubiously she heard those words but as she could not express the anxiety and doubt torturing her soul she told him tea was ready but gregory would not come in just yet out of the sun  in the drawingroom beatrix was already giving tea to young tharp and the reverend husell barter and the sound of these wellknown voices restored to mrs pendyce something of her tranquillity the rector came towards her at once with a teacup in his hand  my wife has got a headache he said she wanted to come over with me but i made her lie down nothing like lying down for a headache we expect it in june you know let me get you your tea  mrs pendyce already aware even to the day of what he expected in june sat down and looked at mr barter with a slight feeling of surprise he was really a very good fellow it was nice of him to make his wife lie down she thought his broad redbrown face with its protecting not unhumorous lower lip looked very friendly roy the skye terrier at her feet was smelling at the reverend gentlemans legs with a slow movement of his tail  the old dog likes me said the rector they know a doglover when they see one wonderful creatures dogs im sometimes tempted to think they may have souls  mrs pendyce answered  horace says hes getting too old  the dog looked up in her face and her lip quivered  the rector laughed  dont you worry about that theres plenty of life in him and he added unexpectedly i couldnt bear to put a dog away the friend of man no no let nature see to that  over at the piano bee and young tharp were turning the pages of the saucy girl the room was full of the scent of azaleas and mr barter astride of a gilt chair looked almost sympathetic gazing tenderly at the old skye  mrs pendyce felt a sudden yearning to free her mind a sudden longing to ask a mans advice  oh mr barter she said my cousin gregory vigil has just brought me some news it is confidential please helen bellew is going to sue for a divorce i wanted to ask you whether you could tell me looking in the rectors face she stopped  a divorce hm really  a chill of terror came over mrs pendyce  of course you will not mention it to anyone not even to horace it has nothing to do with us  mr barter bowed his face wore the expression it so often wore in school on sunday mornings  hm he said again  it flashed through mrs pendyce that this man with the heavy jowl and menacing eyes who sat so square on that flimsy chair knew something it was as though he had answered  this is not a matter for women you will be good enough to leave it to me  with the exception of those few words of lady maldens and the recollection of georges face when he had said oh yes i see her now and then she had no evidence no knowledge nothing to go on but she knew from some instinctive source that her son was mrs bellews lover  so with terror and a strange hope she saw gregory entering the room  perhaps she thought he will make grig stop it  she poured out gregorys tea followed bee and cecil tharp into the conservatory and left the two men together     chapter ii  continued influence of the reverend hussell barter  to understand and sympathise with the feelings and action of the rector of worsted skeynes one must consider his origin and the circumstances of his life  the second son of an old suffolk family he had followed the routine of his house and having passed at oxford through certain examinations had been certificated at the age of twentyfour as a man fitted to impart to persons of both sexes rules of life and conduct after which they had been groping for twice or thrice that number of years his character never at any time undecided was by this fortunate circumstance crystallised and rendered immune from the necessity for selfsearch and spiritual struggle incidental to his neighbours since he was a man neither below nor above the average it did not occur to him to criticise or place himself in opposition to a system which had gone on so long and was about to do him so much good like all average men he was a believer in authority and none the less because authority placed a large portion of itself in his hands it would indeed have been unwarrantable to expect a man of his birth breeding and education to question the machine of which he was himself a wheel  he had dropped therefore at the age of twentysix insensibly on the death of an uncle into the family living at worsted skeynes he had been there ever since it was a constant and natural grief to him that on his death the living would go neither to his eldest nor his second son but to the second son of his elder brother the squire at the age of twentyseven he had married miss rose twining the fifth daughter of a huntingdonshire parson and in less than eighteen years begotten ten children and was expecting the eleventh all healthy and hearty like him self a family group hung over the fireplace in the study under the framed and illuminated text judge not that ye be not judged which he had chosen as his motto in the first year of his cure and never seen any reason to change in that family group mr barter sat in the centre with his dog between his legs his wife stood behind him and on both sides the children spread out like the wings of a fan or butterfly the bills of their schooling were beginning to weigh rather heavily and he complained a good deal but in principle he still approved of the habit into which he had got and his wife never complained of anything  the study was furnished with studious simplicity many a boy had been not unkindly caned there and in one place the old turkey carpet was rotted away but whether by their tears or by their knees not even mr barter knew in a cabinet on one side of the fire he kept all his religious books many of them well worn in a cabinet on the other side he kept his bats to which he was constantly attending a fishingrod and a guncase stood modestly in a corner the archway between the drawers of his writingtable held a mat for his bulldog a prize animal wont to lie there and guard his masters legs when he was writing his sermons like those of his dog the rectors good points were the old english virtues of obstinacy courage intolerance and humour his bad points owing to the circumstances of his life had never been brought to his notice  when therefore he found himself alone with gregory vigil he approached him as one dog will approach another and came at once to the matter in hand  its some time since i had the pleasure of meeting you mr vigil he said mrs pendyce has been giving me in confidence the news youve brought down im bound to tell you at once that im surprised  gregory made a little movement of recoil as though his delicacy had received a shock  indeed he said with a sort of quivering coldness  the rector quick to note opposition repeated emphatically  more than surprised in fact i think there must be some mistake  indeed said gregory again  a change came over mr barters face it had been grave but was now heavy and threatening  i have to say to you he said that somehowsomehow this divorce must be put a stop to  gregory flushed painfully  on what grounds i am not aware that my ward is a parishioner of yours mr barter or that if she were  the rector closed in on him his head thrust forward his lower lip projecting  if she were doing her duty he said she would be im not considering herim considering her husband he is a parishioner of mine and i say this divorce must be stopped  gregory retreated no longer  on what grounds he said again trembling all over  ive no wish to enter into particulars said mr barter but if you force me to i shall not hesitate  i regret that i must answered gregory  without mentioning names then i say that she is not a fit person to bring a suit for divorce  you say that said gregory you  he could not go on  you will not move me mr vigil said the rector with a grim little smile i have my duty to do  gregory recovered possession of himself with an effort  you have said that which no one but a clergyman could say with impunity he said freezingly be so good as to explain yourself  my explanation said mr barter is what i have seen with my own eyes  he raised those eyes to gregory their pupils were contracted to pinpoints the lightgrey irises around had a sort of swimming glitter and round these again the whites were injected with blood  if you must know with my own eyes ive seen her in that very conservatory over there kissing a man  gregory threw up his hand  how dare you he whispered  again mr barters humorous underlip shot out  i dare a good deal more than that mr vigil he said as you will find and i say this to youstop this divorce or ill stop it myself  gregory turned to the window when he came back he was outwardly calm  you have been guilty of indelicacy he said continue in your delusion think what you like do what you like the matter will go on goodevening sir  and turning on his heel he left the room  mr barter stepped forward the words you have been guilty of indelicacy whirled round his brain till every blood vessel in his face and neck was swollen to bursting and with a hoarse sound like that of an animal in pain he pursued gregory to the door it was shut in his face and since on taking orders he had abandoned for ever the use of bad language he was very near an apoplectic fit suddenly he became aware that mrs pendyce was looking at him from the conservatory door her face was painfully white her eyebrows lifted and before that look mr barter recovered a measure of selfpossession  is anything the matter mr barter  the rector smiled grimly  nothing nothing he said i must ask you to excuse me thats all ive a parish matter to attend to  when he found himself in the drive the feeling of vertigo and suffocation passed but left him unrelieved he had in fact happened on one of those psychological moments which enable a mans true nature to show itself accustomed to say of himself bluffly yes yes ive a hot temper soon over he had never owing to the autocracy of his position had a chance of knowing the tenacity of his soul so accustomed and so able for many years to vent displeasure at once he did not himself know the wealth of his old english spirit did not know of what an ugly grip he was capable he did not even know it at this minute conscious only of a sort of black wonder at this monstrous conduct to a man in his position doing his simple duty the more he reflected the more intolerable did it seem that a woman like this mrs bellew should have the impudence to invoke the law of the land in her favour a woman who was no better than a common baggagea woman he had seen kissing george pendyce to have suggested to mr barter that there was something pathetic in this black wonder of his pathetic in the spectacle of his little soul delivering its little judgments stumbling its little way along with such blind certainty under the huge heavens amongst millions of organisms as important as itself would have astounded him and with every step he took the blacker became his wonder the more fixed his determination to permit no such abuse of morality no such disregard of hussell barter  you have been guilty of indelicacy this indictment had a wriggling sting and lost no venom from the fact that he could in no wise have perceived where the indelicacy of his conduct lay but he did not try to perceive it against himself clergyman and gentleman the monstrosity of the charge was clear this was a point of morality he felt no anger against george it was the woman that excited his just wrath for so long he had been absolute among women with the power as it were over them of life and death this was flat immorality he had never approved of her leaving her husband he had never approved of her at all he turned his steps towards the firs  from above the hedges the sleepy cows looked down a yaffle laughed a field or two away in the sycamores which had come out before their time the bees hummed under the smile of the spring the innumerable life of the fields went carelessly on around that square black figure ploughing along the lane with head bent down under a widebrimmed hat  george pendyce in a fly drawn by an old grey horse the only vehicle that frequented the station at worsted skeynes passed him in the lane and leaned back to avoid observation he had not forgotten the tone of the rectors voice in the smokingroom on the night of the dance george was a man who could remember as well as another in the corner of the old fly that rattled and smelled of stables and stale tobacco he fixed his moody eyes on the drivers back and the ears of the old grey horse and never stirred till they set him down at the hall door  he went at once to his room sending word that he had come for the night his mother heard the news with feelings of joy and dread and she dressed quickly for dinner that she might see him the sooner the squire came into her room just as she was going down he had been engaged all day at sessions and was in one of the moods of apprehension as to the future which but seldom came over him  why didnt you keep vigil to dinner he said i could have given him things for the night i wanted to talk to him about insuring my life he knows about that therell be a lot of money wanted to pay my deathduties and if the radicals get in i shouldnt be surprised if they put them up fifty per cent  i wanted to keep him said mrs pendyce but he went away without saying goodbye  hes an odd fellow  for some moments mr pendyce made reflections on this breach of manners he had a nice standard of conduct in all social affairs  im having trouble with that man peacock again hes the most pigheadedwhat are you in such a hurry for margery  george is here  george well i suppose he can wait till dinner i have a lot of things i want to tell you about we had a case of arson today old quarryman was away and i was in the chair it was that fellow woodford that we convicted for poachinga very gross case and this is what he does when he comes out they tried to prove insanity its the rankest case of revenge that ever came before me we committed him of course hell get a swinging sentence of all dreadful crimes arson is the most  mr pendyce could find no word to characterise his opinion of this offence and drawing his breath between his teeth passed into his dressingroom mrs pendyce hastened quietly out and went to her sons room she found george in his shirtsleeves inserting the links of his cuffs  let me do that for you my dear boy how dreadfully they starch your cuffs it is so nice to do something for you sometimes  george answered her  well mother and how have you been  over mrs pendyces face came a look half sorrowful half arch but wholly pathetic what is it beginning already oh dont put me away from you she seemed to say  very well thank you dear and you  george did not meet her eyes  soso he said i took rather a nasty knock over the city last week  is that a race asked mrs pendyce  and by some secret process she knew that he had hurried out that piece of bad news to divert her attention from another subject for george had never been a crybaby  she sat down on the edge of the sofa and though the gong was about to sound incited him to dawdle and stay with her  and have you any other news dear it seems such an age since weve seen you i think ive told you all our budget in my letters you know theres going to be another event at the rectory  another i passed barter on the way up i thought he looked a bit blue  a look of pain shot into mrs pendyces eyes  oh im afraid that couldnt have been the reason dear and she stopped but to still her own fears hurried on again if id known youd been coming id have kept cecil tharp vic has had such dear little puppies would you like one theyve all got that nice black smudge round the eye  she was watching him as only a mother can watchstealthily minutely longingly every little movement every little change of his face and more than all that fixed something behind which showed the abiding temper and condition of his heart  something is making him unhappy she thought he is changed since i saw him last and i cant get at it i seem to be so far from himso far  and somehow she knew he had come down this evening because he was lonely and unhappy and instinct had made him turn to her  but she knew that trying to get nearer would only make him put her farther off and she could not bear this so she asked him nothing and bent all her strength on hiding from him the pain she felt  she went downstairs with her arm in his and leaned very heavily on it as though again trying to get close to him and forget the feeling she had had all that winterthe feeling of being barred away the feeling of secrecy and restraint  mr pendyce and the two girls were in the drawingroom  well george said the squire dryly im glad youve come how you can stick in london at this time of year now youre down youd better stay a couple of days i want to take you round the estate you know nothing about anything i might die at any moment for all you can tell just make up your mind to stay  george gave him a moody look  sorry he said ive got an engagement in town  mr pendyce rose and stood with his back to the fire  thats it he said i ask you to do a simple thing for your own goodandyouve got an engagement its always like that and your mother backs you up bee go and play me something  the squire could not bear being played to but it was the only command likely to be obeyed that came into his head  the absence of guests made little difference to a ceremony esteemed at worsted skeynes the crowning blessing of the day the courses however were limited to seven and champagne was not drunk the squire drank a glass or so of claret for as he said my dear old father took his bottle of port every night of his life and it never gave him a twinge if i were to go on at that rate it would kill me in a year  his daughters drank water mrs pendyce cherishing a secret preference for champagne drank sparingly of a spanish burgundy procured for her by mr pendyce at a very reasonable price and corked between meals with a special cork she offered it to george  try some of my burgundy dear its so nice  but george refused and asked for whiskyandsoda glancing at the butler who brought it in a very yellow state  under the influence of dinner the squire recovered equanimity though he still dwelt somewhat sadly on the future  you young fellows he said with a friendly look at george are such individualists you make a business of enjoying yourselves with your piquet and your racing and your billiards and what not youll be used up before youre fifty you dont let your imaginations work a green old age ought to be your ideal instead of which it seems to be a green youth ha mr pendyce looked at his daughters till they said  oh father how can you  norah who had the more character of the two added  isnt father rather dreadful mother  but mrs pendyce was looking at her son she had longed so many evenings to see him sitting there  well have a game of piquet tonight george  george looked up and nodded with a glum smile  on the thick soft carpet round the table the butler and second footman moved the light of the wax candles fell lustrous and subdued on the silver and fruit and flowers on the girls white necks on georges wellcoloured face and glossy shirtfront gleamed in the jewels on his mothers long white fingers showed off the squires erect and still spruce figure the air was languorously sweet with the perfume of azaleas and narcissus bloom bee with soft eyes was thinking of young tharp who today had told her that he loved her and wondering if father would object her mother was thinking of george stealing timid glances at his moody face there was no sound save the tinkle of forks and the voices of norah and the squire talking of little things outside through the long opened windows was the still wide country the full moon tinted apricot and figured like a coin hung above the cedartrees and by her light the whispering stretches of the silent fields lay half enchanted half asleep and all beyond that little ring of moonshine unfathomed and unknown was darknessa great darkness wrapping from their eyes the restless world     chapter iii  the sinister night  on the day of the big race at kempton park in which the ambler starting favourite was left at the post george pendyce had just put his latchkey in the door of the room he had taken near mrs bellew when a man stepping quickly from behind said  mr george pendyce i believe  george turned  yes what do you want  the man put into georges hand a long envelope  from messrs frost and tuckett  george opened it and read from the top of a slip of paper  admiralty probate and divorce the humble petition of jaspar bellew  he lifted his eyes and his look uncannily impassive unresenting unangered dogged caused the messenger to drop his gaze as though he had hit a man who was down  thanks goodnight  he shut the door and read the document through it contained some precise details and ended in a claim for damages and george smiled  had he received this document three months ago he would not have taken it thus three months ago he would have felt with rage that he was caught his thoughts would have run thus i have got her into a mess i have got myself into a mess i never thought this would happen this is the devil i must see someonei must stop it there must be a way out having but little imagination his thoughts would have beaten their wings against this cage and at once he would have tried to act but this was not three months ago and now  he lit a cigarette and sat down on the sofa and the chief feeling in his heart was a strange hope a sort of funereal gladness he would have to go and see her at once that very night an excuseno need to wait in hereto waitwait on the chance of her coming  he got up and drank some whisky then went back to the sofa and sat down again  if she is not here by eight he thought i will go round  opposite was a fulllength mirror and he turned to the wall to avoid it there was fixed on his face a look of gloomy determination as though he were thinking ill show them all that im not beaten yet  at the click of a latchkey he scrambled off the sofa and his face resumed its mask she came in as usual dropped her opera cloak and stood before him with bare shoulders looking in her face he wondered if she knew  i thought id better come she said i suppose youve had the same charming present  george nodded there was a minutes silence  its really rather funny im sorry for you george  george laughed too but his laugh was different  i will do all i can he said  mrs bellew came close to him  ive seen about the kempton race what shocking luck i suppose youve lost a lot poor boy it never rains but it pours  george looked down  thats all right nothing matters when i have you  he felt her arms fasten behind his neck but they were cool as marble he met her eyes and they were mocking and compassionate  their cab wheeling into the main thoroughfare joined in the race of cabs flying as for life toward the eastpast the park where the trees newleafed were swinging their skirts like balletdancers in the wind past the stoics and the other clubs rattling jingling jostling for the lead shooting past omnibuses that looked cosy in the halflight with their lamps and rows of figures solemnly opposed  at blafards the tall dark young waiter took her cloak with reverential fingers the little winewaiter smiled below the suffering in his eyes the same redshaded lights fell on her arms and shoulders the same flowers of green and yellow grew bravely in the same blue vases on the menu were written the same dishes the same idle eye peered through the chink at the corner of the red blinds with its stare of apathetic wonder  often during that dinner george looked at her face by stealth and its expression baffled him so careless was it and unlike her mood of late that had been glum and cold she was in the wildest spirits  people looked round from the other little tables all full now that the season had begun her laugh was so infectious and george felt a sort of disgust what was it in this woman that made her laugh when his own heart was heavy but he said nothing he dared not even look at her for fear his eyes should show his feeling  we ought to be squaring our accounts he thoughtlooking things in the face something must be done and here she is laughing and making everyone stare done but what could be done when it was all like quicksand  the other little tables emptied one by one  george she said take me somewhere where we can dance  george stared at her  my dear girl how can i there is no such place  take me to your bohemians  you cant possibly go to a place like that  why not who cares where we go or what we do  i care  ah my dear george you and your sort are only half alive  sullenly george answered  what do you take me for a cad  but there was fear not anger in his heart  well then lets drive into the east end for goodness sake lets do something not quite proper  they took a hansom and drove east it was the first time either had ever been in that unknown land  close your cloak dear it looks odd down here  mrs bellew laughed  youll be just like your father when youre sixty george  and she opened her cloak the wider round a barrelorgan at the corner of a street were girls in bright colours dancing  she called to the cabman to stop  lets watch those children  youll only make a show of us  mrs bellew put her hands on the cab door  ive a good mind to get out and dance with them  youre mad tonight said george sit still  he stretched out his arm and barred her way the passersby looked curiously at the little scene a crowd began to collect  go on cried george  there was a cheer from the crowd the driver whipped his horse they darted east again  it was striking twelve when the cab put them down at last near the old church on chelsea embankment and they had hardly spoken for an hour  and all that hour george was feeling  this is the woman for whom ive given it all up this is the woman to whom i shall be tied this is the woman i cannot tear myself away from if i could i would never see her again but i cant live without her i must go on suffering when shes with me suffering when shes away from me and god knows how its all to end  he took her hand in the darkness it was cold and unresponsive as a stone he tried to see her face but could read nothing in those greenish eyes staring before them like a cats into the darkness  when the cab was gone they stood looking at each other by the light of a street lamp and george thought  so i must leave her like this and what then  she put her latchkey in the door and turned round to him in the silent empty street where the wind was rustling and scraping round the corners of tall houses and the lamplight flickered her face and figure were so strange motionless sphinxlike only her eyes seemed alive fastened on his own  goodnight he muttered  she beckoned  take what you can of me george she said     chapter iv  mr pendyces head  mr pendyces head seen from behind at his library bureau where it was his practice to spend most mornings from halfpast nine to eleven or even twelve was observed to be of a shape to throw no small light upon his class and character its contour was almost national bulging at the back and sloping rapidly to a thin and wiry neck narrow between the ears and across the brow prominent in the jaw the length of a line drawn from the back headland to the promontory at the chin would have been extreme upon the observer there was impressed the conviction that here was a skull denoting by surplusage of length great precision of character and disposition to action and by deficiency of breadth a narrow tenacity which might at times amount to wrongheadedness the thin cantankerous neck on which little hairs grew low and the intelligent ears confirmed this impression and when his face with its clipped hair dry rosiness into which the east wind had driven a shade of yellow and the sun a shade of brown and grey rather discontented eyes came into view the observer had no longer any hesitation in saying that he was in the presence of an englishman a landed proprietor and but for mr pendyces rooted belief to the contrary an individualist his head indeed was like nothing so much as the admiralty pier at doverthat strange long narrow thing with a slight twist or bend at the end which first disturbs the comfort of foreigners arriving on these shores and strikes them with a sense of wonder and dismay  he sat very motionless at his bureau leaning a little over his papers like a man to whom things do not come too easily and every now and then he stopped to refer to the calendar at his left hand or to a paper in one of the many pigeonholes open and almost out of reach was a back volume of punch of which periodical as a landed proprietor he had an almost professional knowledge in leisure moments it was one of his chief recreations to peruse lovingly those aged pictures and at the image of john bull he never failed to think fancy making an englishman out a fat fellow like that  it was as though the artist had offered an insult to himself passing him over as the type and conferring that distinction on someone fast going out of fashion the rector whenever he heard mr pendyce say this strenuously opposed him for he was himself of a square stout build and getting stouter  with all their aspirations to the character of typical englishmen mr pendyce and mr barter thought themselves far from the old beef and beer port and pigskin types of the georgian and early victorian era they were men of the world abreast of the times who by virtue of a public school and varsity training had acquired a manner a knowledge of men and affairs a standard of thought on which it had really never been needful to improve both of them but especially mr pendyce kept up with all that was going forward by visiting the metropolis six or seven or even eight times a year on these occasions they rarely took their wives having almost always important business in handold college church or conservative dinners cricketmatches church congress the gaiety theatre and for mr barter the lyceum both too belonged to clubsthe rector to a comfortable oldfashioned place where he could get a rubber without gambling and mr pendyce to the temple of things as they had been as became a man who having turned all social problems over in his mind had decided that there was no real safety but in the past  they always went up to london grumbling but this was necessary and indeed salutary because of their wives and they always came back grumbling because of their livers which a good country rest always fortunately reduced in time for the next visit in this way they kept themselves free from the taint of provincialism  in the silence of his masters study the spaniel john whose head too was long and narrow had placed it over his paw as though suffering from that silence and when his master cleared his throat he guttered his tail and turned up an eye with a little moon of white without stirring his chin  the clock ticked at the end of the long narrow room the sunlight through the long narrow windows fell on the long narrow backs of books in the glassed bookcase that took up the whole of one wall and this room with its slightly leathery smell seemed a fitting place for some long narrow ideal to be worked out to its long and narrow ending  but mr pendyce would have scouted the notion of an ending to ideals having their basis in the hereditary principle  let me do my duty and carry on the estate as my dear old father did and hand it down to my son enlarged if possible was sometimes his saying very very often his thought not seldom his prayer i want to do no more than that  the times were bad and dangerous there was every chance of a radical government being returned and the country going to the dogs it was but natural and human that he should pray for the survival of the form of things which he believed in and knew the form of things bequeathed to him and embodied in the salutary words horace pendyce it was not his habit to welcome new ideas a new idea invading the country of the squires mind was at once met with a rising of the whole population and either prevented from landing or if already on shore instantly taken prisoner in course of time the unhappy creature causing its squeaks and groans to penetrate the prison walls would be released from sheer humaneness and love of a quiet life and even allowed certain privileges remaining however that poor queer devil of a foreigner one day in an inattentive moment the natives would suffer it to marry or find that in some disgraceful way it had caused the birth of children unrecognised by law and their respect for the accomplished fact for something that already lay in the past would then prevent their trying to unmarry it or restoring the children to an unborn state and very gradually they would tolerate this intrusive brood such was the process of mr pendyces mind indeed like the spaniel john a dog of conservative instincts at the approach of any strange thing he placed himself in the way barking and showing his teeth and sometimes truly he suffered at the thought that one day horace pendyce would no longer be there to bark but not often for he had not much imagination  all the morning he had been working at that old vexed subject of common rights on worsted scotton which his father had fenced in and taught him once for all to believe was part integral of worsted skeynes the matter was almost beyond doubt for the cottagersin a poor way at the time of the fencing owing to the price of breadhad looked on apathetically till the very last year required by law to give the old squire squatters rights when all of a sudden that man peacocks father had made a gap in the fence and driven in beasts which had reopened the whole unfortunate question this had been in 65 and ever since there had been continual friction bordering on a law suit mr pendyce never for a moment allowed it to escape his mind that the man peacock was at the bottom of it all for it was his way to discredit all principles as ground of action and to refer everything to facts and persons except indeed when he acted himself when he would somewhat proudly admit that it was on principle he never thought or spoke on an abstract question partly because his father had avoided them before him partly because he had been discouraged from doing so at school but mainly because he temperamentally took no interest in such unpractical things  it was therefore a source of wonder to him that tenants of his own should be ungrateful he did his duty by them as the rector in whose keeping were their souls would have been the first to affirm the books of his estate showed this recording year by year an average gross profit of some sixteen hundred pounds and deducting raw material incidental to the upkeep of worsted skeynes a net loss of three  in less earthly matters too such as nonattendance at church a predisposition to poaching or any inclination to moral laxity he could say with a clear conscience that the rector was sure of his support a striking instance had occurred within the last month when discovering that his underkeeper an excellent man at his work had got into a scrape with the postmans wife he had given the young fellow notice and cancelled the lease of his cottage  he rose and went to the plan of the estate fastened to the wall which he unrolled by pulling a green silk cord and stood there scrutinising it carefully and placing his finger here and there his spaniel rose too and settled himself unobtrusively on his masters foot mr pendyce moved and trod on him the spaniel yelped  dn the dog oh poor fellow john said mr pendyce he went back to his seat but since he had identified the wrong spot he was obliged in a minute to return again to the plan the spaniel john cherishing the hope that he had been justly treated approached in a half circle fluttering his tail he had scarcely reached mr pendyces foot when the door was opened and the first footman brought in a letter on a silver salver  mr pendyce took the note read it turned to his bureau and said no answer  he sat staring at this document in the silent room and over his face in turn passed anger alarm distrust bewilderment he had not the power of making very clear his thought except by speaking aloud and he muttered to himself the spaniel john who still nurtured a belief that he had sinned came and lay down very close against his leg  mr pendyce never having reflected profoundly on the working morality of his times had the less difficulty in accepting it of violating it he had practically no opportunity and this rendered his position stronger it was from habit and tradition rather than from principle and conviction that he was a man of good moral character  and as he sat reading this note over and over he suffered from a sense of nausea  it was couched in these terms   the firs  may 20  dear sir  you may or may not have heard that i have made your son mr george pendyce correspondent in a divorce suit against my wife neither for your sake nor your sons but for the sake of mrs pendyce who is the only woman in these parts that i respect i will withdraw the suit if your son will give his word not to see my wife again  please send me an early answer  i am  your obedient servant  jaspar bellew   the acceptance of tradition and to accept it was suitable to the squires temperament is occasionally marred by the impingement of tradition on private life and comfort it was legendary in his class that young mens peccadilloes must be accepted with a certain indulgence they would he said be young men they must he would remark sow their wild oats such was his theory the only difficulty he now had was in applying it to his own particular case a difficulty felt by others in times past and to be felt again in times to come but since he was not a philosopher he did not perceive the inconsistency between his theory and his dismay he saw his universe reeling before that note and he was not a man to suffer tamely he felt that others ought to suffer too it was monstrous that a fellow like this bellew a loose fish a drunkard a man who had nearly run over him should have it in his power to trouble the serenity of worsted skeynes it was like his impudence to bring such a charge against his son it was like his dd impudence and going abruptly to the bell he trod on his spaniels ear  dn the dog oh poor fellow john but the spaniel john convinced at last that he had sinned hid himself in a far corner whence he could see nothing and pressed his chin closely to the ground  ask your mistress to come here  standing by the hearth waiting for his wife the squire displayed to greater advantage than ever the shape of his long and narrow head his neck had grown conspicuously redder his eyes like those of an offended swan stabbed as it were at everything they saw  it was not seldom that mrs pendyce was summoned to the study to hear him say i want to ask your advice soandso has done such and such i have made up my mind  she came therefore in a few minutes in compliance with his look at that margery she read the note and gazed at him with distress in her eyes and he looked back at her with wrath in his for this was tragedy  not to everyone is it given to take a wide view of thingsto look over the far pale streams the purple heather and moonlit pools of the wild marches where reeds stand black against the sundown and from long distance comes the cry of a curlewnor to everyone to gaze from steep cliffs over the winedark shadowy seaor from high mountainsides to see crowned chaos smoking with mist or goldbright in the sun  to most it is given to watch assiduously a row of houses a backyard or like mrs and mr pendyce the green fields trim coverts and scotch garden of worsted skeynes and on that horizon the citation of their eldest son to appear in the divorce court loomed like a cloud heavy with destruction  so far as such an event could be realised imagination at worsted skeynes was not too vividit spelled ruin to an harmonious edifice of ideas and prejudice and aspiration it would be no use to say of that event what does it matter let people think what they like talk as they like at worsted skeynes and worsted skeynes was every country house there was but one set of people one church one pack of hounds one everything the importance of a clear escutcheon was too great and they who had lived together for thirtyfour years looked at each other with a new expression in their eyes their feelings were for once the same but since it is always the man who has the nicer sense of honour their thoughts were not the same for mr pendyce was thinking i wont believe itdisgracing us all and mrs pendyce was thinking my boy  it was she who spoke first  oh horace  the sound of her voice restored the squires fortitude  there you go margery dyou mean to say you believe what this fellow says he ought to be horsewhipped he knows my opinion of him  its a piece of his confounded impudence he nearly ran over me and now  mrs pendyce broke in  but horace im afraid its true ellen maiden  ellen maiden said mr pendyce what business has she he was silent staring gloomily at the plan of worsted skeynes still unrolled like an emblem of all there was at stake if george has really he burst out hes a greater fool than i took him for a fool hes a knave  again he was silent  mrs pendyce flushed at that word and bit her lips  george could never be a knave she said  mr pendyce answered heavily  disgracing his name  mrs pendyce bit deeper into her lips  whatever he has done she said george is sure to have behaved like a gentleman  an angry smile twisted the squires mouth  just like a woman he said  but the smile died away and on both their faces came a helpless look like people who have lived together without real sympathythough indeed they had long ceased to be conscious of thatnow that something had occurred in which their interests were actually at one they were filled with a sort of surprise it was no good to differ differing even silent differing would not help their son  i shall write to george said mr pendyce at last i shall believe nothing till ive heard from him hell tell us the truth i suppose  there was a quaver in his voice  mrs pendyce answered quickly  oh horace be careful what you say im sure he is suffering  her gentle soul disposed to pleasure was suffering too and the tears stole up in her eyes mr pendyces sight was too long to see them the infirmity had been growing on him ever since his marriage  i shall say what i think right he said i shall take time to consider what i shall say i wont be hurried by this ruffian  mrs pendyce wiped her lips with her laceedged handkerchief  i hope you will show me the letter she said  the squire looked at her and he realised that she was trembling and very white and though this irritated him he answered almost kindly  its not a matter for you my dear  mrs pendyce took a step towards him her gentle face expressed a strange determination  he is my son horace as well as yours  mr pendyce turned round uneasily  its no use your getting nervous margery i shall do whats best you women lose your heads that dd fellows lying if he isnt  at these words the spaniel john rose from his corner and advanced to the middle of the floor he stood there curved in a halfcircle and looked darkly at his master  confound it said mr pendyce itsits damnable  and as if answering for all that depended on worsted skeynes the spaniel john deeply wagged that which had been left him of his tail  mrs pendyce came nearer still  if george refuses to give you that promise what will you do horace  mr pendyce stared  promise what promise  mrs pendyce thrust forward the note  this promise not to see her again  mr pendyce motioned it aside  ill not be dictated to by that fellow bellew he said then by an afterthought it wont do to give him a chance george must promise me that in any case  mrs pendyce pressed her lips together  but do you think he will  thinkthink who will think he will what why cant you express yourself margery if george has really got us into this mess he must get us out again  mrs pendyce flushed  he would never leave her in the lurch  the squire said angrily  lurch who said anything about lurch he owes it to her not that she deserves any consideration if shes beenyou dont mean to say you think hell refuse hed never be such a donkey  mrs pendyce raised her hands and made what for her was a passionate gesture  oh horace she said you dont understand hes in love with her  mr pendyces lower lip trembled a sign with him of excitement or emotion all the conservative strength of his nature all the immense dumb force of belief in established things all that stubborn hatred and dread of change that incalculable power of imagining nothing which since the beginning of time had made horace pendyce the arbiter of his land rose up within his sorely tried soul  what on earths that to do with it he cried in a rage you women youve no sense of anything romantic idiotic immorali dont know what youre at for gods sake dont go putting ideas into his head  at this outburst mrs pendyces face became rigid only the flicker of her eyelids betrayed how her nerves were quivering suddenly she threw her hands up to her ears  horace she cried dooh poor john  the squire had stepped hastily and heavily on to his dogs paw the creature gave a grievous howl mr pendyce went down on his knees and raised the limb  damn the dog he stuttered oh poor fellow john  and the two long and narrow heads for a moment were close together     chapter v  rector and squire  the efforts of social man directed from immemorial time towards the stability of things have culminated in worsted skeynes beyond commercial competitionfor the estate no longer paid for living on itbeyond the power of expansion set with tradition and sentiment it was an undoubted jewel past need of warranty cradled within it were all those hereditary institutions of which the country was most proud and mr pendyce sometimes saw before him the time when for services to his party he should call himself lord worsted and after his own death continue sitting in the house of lords in the person of his son but there was another feeling in the squires heartthe air and the woods and the fields had passed into his blood a love for this his home and the home of his fathers  and so a terrible unrest pervaded the whole household after the receipt of jaspar bellews note nobody was told anything yet everybody knew there was something and each after his fashion down to the very dogs betrayed their sympathy with the master and mistress of the house  day after day the girls wandered about the new golf course knocking the balls aimlessly it was all they could do even cecil tharp who had received from bee the qualified affirmative natural under the circumstances was infected the off foreleg of her grey mare was being treated by a process he had recently discovered and in the stables he confided to bee that the dear old squire seemed off his feed he did not think it was any good worrying him at present bee stroking the mares neck looked at him shyly and slowly  its about george she said i know its about george oh cecil i do wish i had been a boy  young tharp assented in spite of himself  yes it must be beastly to be a girl  a faint flush coloured bees cheeks it hurt her a little that he should agree but her lover was passing his hand down the mares shin  father is rather trying she said i wish george would marry  cecil tharp raised his bullet head his blunt honest face was extremely red from stooping  clean as a whistle he said shes all right bee i expect george has too good a time  bee turned her face away and murmured  i should loathe living in london and she too stooped and felt the mares shin  to mrs pendyce in these days the hours passed with incredible slowness for thirty odd years she had waited at once for everything and nothing she had so to say everything she could wish for andnothing so that even waiting had been robbed of poignancy but to wait like this in direct suspense for something definite was terrible there was hardly a moment when she did not conjure up george lonely and torn by conflicting emotions for to her long paralysed by worsted skeynes and ignorant of the facts the proportions of the struggle in her sons soul appeared titanic her mother instinct was not deceived as to the strength of his passion strange and conflicting were the sensations with which she awaited the result at one moment thinking it is madness he must promiseit is too awful at another ah but how can he if he loves her so it is impossible and she tooah how awful it is  perhaps as mr pendyce had said she was romantic perhaps it was only the thought of the pain her boy must suffer the tooth was too big it seemed to her and as in old days when she took him to cornmarket to have an aching tooth out she ever sat with his hand in hers while the little dentist pulled and ever suffered the tug too in her own mouth so now she longed to share this other tug so terrible so fierce  against mrs bellew she felt only a sort of vague and jealous aching and this seemed strange even to herselfbut again perhaps she was romantic  now it was that she found the value of routine her days were so well and fully occupied that anxiety was forced below the surface the nights were far more terrible for then not only had she to bear her own suspense but as was natural in a wife the fears of horace pendyce as well the poor squire found this the only time when he could get relief from worry he came to bed much earlier on purpose by dint of reiterating dreads and speculation he at length obtained some rest why had not george answered what was the fellow about and so on and so on till by sheer monotony he caused in himself the need for slumber but his wifes torments lasted till after the birds starting with a sleepy cheeping were at full morning chorus then only turning softly for fear she should awaken him the poor lady fell asleep  for george had not answered  in her morning visits to the village mrs pendyce found herself for the first time since she had begun this practice driven by her own trouble over that line of diffident distrust which had always divided her from the hearts of her poorer neighbours she was astonished at her own indelicacy asking questions prying into their troubles pushed on by a secret aching for distraction and she was surprised how well they took ithow indeed they seemed to like it as though they knew that they were doing her good in one cottage where she had long noticed with pitying wonder a whitefaced blackeyed girl who seemed to crouch away from everyone she even received a request it was delivered with terrified secrecy in a backyard out of mrs barters hearing  oh maam get me away from here im in troubleits comin and i dont know what i shall do  mrs pendyce shivered and all the way home she thought poor little soulpoor little thing racking her brains to whom she might confide this case and ask for a solution and something of the whitefaced blackeyed girls terror and secrecy fell on her for she found no one not even mrs barter whose heart though soft belonged to the rector then by a sort of inspiration she thought of gregory  how can i write to him she mused when my son  but she did write for deep down the totteridge instinct felt that others should do things for her and she craved too to allude however distantly to what was on her mind and under the pendyce eagle and the motto strenuus aureaque penna thus her letter ran   dear grig  can you do anything for a poor little girl in the village here who is in troubleyou know what i mean it is such a terrible crime in this part of the country and she looks so wretched and frightened poor little thing she is twenty years old she wants a hidingplace for her misfortune and somewhere to go when it is over nobody she says will have anything to do with her where they know and really i have noticed for a long time how white and wretched she looks with great black frightened eyes i dont like to apply to our rector for though he is a good fellow in many ways he has such strong opinions and of course horace could do nothing i would like to do something for her and i could spare a little money but i cant find a place for her to go and that makes it difficult she seems to be haunted too by the idea that wherever she goes it will come out isnt it dreadful do do something if you can i am rather anxious about george i hope the dear boy is well if you are passing his club some day you might look in and just ask after him he is sometimes so naughty about writing i wish we could see you here dear grig the country is looking beautiful just nowthe oaktrees especiallyand the appleblossom isnt over but i suppose you are too busy how is helen bellew is she in town  your affectionate cousin  margery pendyce   it was four oclock this same afternoon when the second groom very much out of breath informed the butler that there was a fire at peacocks farm the butler repaired at once to the library mr pendyce who had been on horseback all the morning was standing in his ridingclothes tired and depressed before the plan of worsted skeynes  what do you want bester  there is a fire at peacocks farm sir mr pendyce stared  what he said a fire in broad daylight nonsense  you can see the flames from the front sir the worn and querulous look left mr pendyces face  ring the stablebell he said tell them all to run with buckets and ladders send higson off to cornmarket on the mare go and tell mr barter and rouse the village dont stand theregod bless me ring the stablebell and snatching up his ridingcrop and hat he ran past the butler closely followed by the spaniel john  over the stile and along the footpath which cut diagonally across a field of barley he moved at a stiff trot and his spaniel who had not grasped the situation frolicked ahead with a certain surprise the squire was soon out of breathit was twenty years or more since he had run a quarter of a mile he did not however relax his speed ahead of him in the distance ran the second groom behind him a labourer and a footman the stablebell at worsted skeynes began to ring mr pendyce crossed the stile and struck into the lane colliding with the rector who was running too his face flushed to the colour of tomatoes they ran on side by side  you go on gasped mr pendyce at last and tell them im coming  the rector hesitatedhe too was very out of breathand started again panting the squire with his hand to his side walked painfully on he had run himself to a standstill at a gap in the corner of the lane he suddenly saw palered tongues of flame against the sunlight  god bless me he gasped and in sheer horror started to run again those sinister tongues were licking at the air over a large barn some ricks and the roofs of stables and outbuildings half a dozen figures were dashing buckets of water on the flames the true insignificance of their efforts did not penetrate the squires mind trembling and with a sickening pain in his lungs he threw off his coat wrenched a bucket from a huge agricultural labourer who resigned it with awe and joined the string of workers peacock the farmer ran past him his face and round red beard were the colour of the flames he was trying to put out tears dropped continually from his eyes and ran down that fiery face his wife a little dark woman with a twisted mouth was working like a demon at the pump mr pendyce gasped to her  this is dreadful mrs peacockthis is dreadful  conspicuous in black clothes and white shirtsleeves the rector was hewing with an axe at the boarding of a cowhouse the door end of which was already in flames and his voice could be heard above the tumult shouting directions to which nobody paid any heed  whats in that cowhouse gasped mr pendyce  mrs peacock in a voice harsh with rage and grief answered  its the old horse and two of the cows  god bless me cried the squire rushing forward with his bucket  some villagers came running up and he shouted to these but what he said neither he nor they could tell the shrieks and snortings of the horse and cows the steady whirr of the flames drowned all lesser sounds of human cries the rectors voice alone was heard between the crashing blows of his axe upon the woodwork  mr pendyce tripped his bucket rolled out of his hand he lay where he had fallen too exhausted to move he could still hear the crash of the rectors axe the sound of his shouts somebody helped him up and trembling so that he could hardly stand he caught an axe out of the hand of a strapping young fellow who had just arrived and placing himself by the rectors side swung it feebly against the boarding the flames and smoke now filled the whole cowhouse and came rushing through the gap that they were making the squire and the rector stood their ground with a furious blow mr barter cleared a way a cheer rose behind them but no beast came forth all three were dead in the smoke and flames  the squire who could see in flung down his axe and covered his eyes with his hands the rector uttered a sound like a deep oath and he too flung down his axe  two hours later with torn and blackened clothes the squire stood by the ruins of the barn the fire was out but the ashes were still smouldering the spaniel john anxious panting was licking his masters boots as though begging forgiveness that he had been so frightened and kept so far away yet something in his eye seemed to be saying  must you really have these fires master  a black hand grasped the squires arm a hoarse voice said  i shant forget squire  god bless me peacock returned mr pendyce thats nothing youre insured i hope  aye im insured but its the beasts im thinking of  ah said the squire with a gesture of horror  the brougham took him and the rector back together under their feet crouched their respective dogs faintly growling at each other a cheer from the crowd greeted their departure  they started in silence deadly tired mr pendyce said suddenly  i cant get those poor beasts out of my head barter  the rector put his hand up to his eyes  i hope to god i shall never see such a sight again poor brutes poor brutes  and feeling secretly for his dogs muzzle he left his hand against the animals warm soft rubbery mouth to be licked again and again  on his side of the brougham mr pendyce also unseen was doing precisely the same thing  the carriage went first to the rectory where mrs barter and her children stood in the doorway the rector put his head back into the brougham to say  goodnight pendyce youll be stiff tomorrow i shall get my wife to rub me with elliman  mr pendyce nodded raised his hat and the carriage went on leaning back he closed his eyes a pleasanter sensation was stealing over him true he would be stiff tomorrow but he had done his duty he had shown them all that blood told done something to bolster up that system which washimself and he had a new and kindly feeling towards peacock too there was nothing like a little danger for bringing the lower classes closer then it was they felt the need for officers for something  the spaniel johns head rose between his knees turning up eyes with a crimson touch beneath  master he seemed to say i am feeling old i know there are things beyond me in this life but you who know all things will arrange that we shall be together even when we die  the carriage stopped at the entrance of the drive and the squires thoughts changed twenty years ago he would have beaten barter running down that lane barter was only fortyfive to give him fourteen years and a beating was a bit too much to expect he felt a strange irritation with barterthe fellow had cut a very good figure he had shirked nothing elliman was too strong homocea was the thing margery would have to rub him and suddenly as though springing naturally from the name of his wife george came into mr pendyces mind and the respite that he had enjoyed from care was over but the spaniel john who scented home began singing feebly for the brougham to stop and beating a careless tail against his masters boot  it was very stiffly with frowning brows and a shaking underlip that the squire descended from the brougham and began sorely to mount the staircase to his wifes room     chapter vi  the park  there comes a day each year in may when hyde park is possessed a cool wind swings the leaves a hot sun glistens on long water on every bough on every blade of grass the birds sing their small hearts out the band plays its gayest tunes the white clouds race in the high blue heaven exactly why and how this day differs from those that came before and those that will come after cannot be told it is as though the park said today i live the past is past i care not for the future  and on this day they who chance in the park cannot escape some measure of possession their steps quicken their skirts swing their sticks flourish even their eyes brightenthose eyes so dulled with looking at the streets and each one if he has a love thinks of her and here and there among the wandering throng he has her with him to these the park and all sweetblooded mortals in it nod and smile  there had been a meeting that afternoon at lady maidens in princes gate to consider the position of the workingclass woman it had provided a somewhat heated discussion for a person had got up and proved almost incontestably that the workingclass woman had no position whatsoever  gregory vigil and mrs shortman had left this meeting together and crossing the serpentine struck a line over the grass  mrs shortman said gregory dont you think were all a little mad  he was carrying his hat in his hand and his fine grizzled hair rumpled in the excitement of the meeting had not yet subsided on his head  yes mr vigil i dont exactly  we are all a little mad what did that woman lady maiden mean by talking as she did i detest her  oh mr vigil she has the best intentions  intentions said gregory i loathe her what did we go to her stuffy drawingroom for look at that sky  mrs shortman looked at the sky  but mr vigil she said earnestly things would never get done sometimes i think you look at everything too much in the light of the way it ought to be  the milky way said gregory  mrs shortman pursed her lips she found it impossible to habituate herself to gregorys habit of joking  they had scant talk for the rest of their journey to the s r w c where miss mallow at the typewriter was reading a novel  there are several letters for you mr vigil  mrs shortman says i am unpractical answered gregory is that true miss mallow  the colour in miss mallows cheeks spread to her sloping shoulders  oh no youre most practical onlyperhapsi dont know perhaps you do try to do rather impossible things mr vigil  bilcock buildings  there was a minutes silence then mrs shortman at her bureau beginning to dictate the typewriter started clicking  gregory who had opened a letter was seated with his head in his hands the voice ceased the typewriter ceased but gregory did not stir both women turning a little in their seats glanced at him their eyes caught each others and they looked away at once a few seconds later they were looking at him again still gregory did not stir an anxious appeal began to creep into the womens eyes  mr vigil said mrs shortman at last mr vigil do you think  gregory raised his face it was flushed to the roots of his hair  read that mrs shortman  handing her a pale grey letter stamped with an eagle and the motto strenuus aureaque penna he rose and paced the room and as with his long light stride he was passing to and fro the woman at the bureau conned steadily the writing the girl at the typewriter sat motionless with a red and jealous face  mrs shortman folded the letter placed it on the top of the bureau and said without raising her eyes  of course it is very sad for the poor little girl but surely mr vigil it must always be so as to check to check  gregory stopped and his shining eyes disconcerted her they seemed to her unpractical sharply lifting her voice she went on  if there were no disgrace there would be no way of stopping it i know the country better than you do mr vigil  gregory put his hands to his ears  we must find a place for her at once  the window was fully open so that he could not open it any more and he stood there as though looking for that place in the sky and the sky he looked at was very blue and large white birds of cloud were flying over it  he turned from the window and opened another letter   lincolns inn fields  may 24 1892  my dear vigil  i gathered from your ward when i saw her yesterday that she has not told you of what i fear will give you much pain i asked her pointblank whether she wished the matter kept from you and her answer was he had better knowonly im sorry for him in sum it is this bellow has either got wind of our watching him or someone must have put him up to it he has anticipated us and brought a suit against your ward joining george pendyce in the cause george brought the citation to me if necessary hes prepared to swear theres nothing in it he takes in fact the usual standpoint of the man of honour  i went at once to see your ward she admitted that the charge is true i asked her if she wished the suit defended and a countersuit brought against her husband her answer to that was i absolutely dont care i got nothing from her but this and though it sounds odd i believe it to be true she appears to be in a reckless mood and to have no particular illwill against her husband  i want to see you but only after you have turned this matter over carefully it is my duty to put some considerations before you the suit if brought will be a very unpleasant matter for george a still more unpleasant even disastrous one for his people the innocent in such cases are almost always the greatest sufferers if the crosssuit is instituted it will assume at once considering their position in society the proportions of a cause celebre and probably occupy the court and the daily presses anything from three days to a week perhaps more and you know what that means on the other hand not to defend the suit considering what we know is apart from ethics revolting to my instincts as a fighter my advice therefore is to make every effort to prevent matters being brought into court at all  i am an older man than you by thirteen years i have a sincere regard for you and i wish to save you pain in the course of our interviews i have observed your ward very closely and at the risk of giving you offence i am going to speak out my mind mrs bellew is a rather remarkable woman from two or three allusions that you have made in my presence i believe that she is altogether different from what you think she is in my opinion one of those very vital persons upon whom our judgments censures even our sympathies are wasted a woman of this sort if she comes of a county family and is thrown by circumstances with society people is always bound to be conspicuous if you would realise something of this it would i believe save you a great deal of pain in short i beg of you not to take her or her circumstances too seriously there are quite a number of such men and women as her husband and herself and they are always certain to be more or less before the public eye whoever else goes down she will swim simply because she cant help it i want you to see things as they are  i ask you again my dear vigil to forgive me for writing thus and to believe that my sole desire is to try and save you unnecessary suffering  come and see me as soon as you have reflected  i am  your sincere friend  edmund paramor   gregory made a movement like that of a blind man both women were on their feet at once  what is it mr vigil can i get you anything  thanks nothing nothing ive had some rather bad news ill go out and get some air i shant be back today  he found his hat and went  he walked towards the park unconsciously attracted towards the biggest space the freshest air his hands were folded behind him his head bowed and since of all things nature is ironical it was fitting that he should seek the park this day when it was gayest and far in the park as near the centre as might be he lay down on the grass for a long time he lay without moving his hands over his eyes and in spite of mr paramors reminder that his suffering was unnecessary he suffered  and mostly he suffered from black loneliness for he was a very lonely man and now he had lost that which he had thought he had it is difficult to divide suffering difficult to say how much he suffered because being in love with her he had secretly thought she must love him a little and how much he suffered because his private portrait of her the portrait that he and he alone had painted was scored through with the knife and he lay first on his face and then on his back with his hand always over his eyes and around him were other men lying on the grass and some were lonely and some hungry and some asleep and some were lying there for the pleasure of doing nothing and for the sake of the hot sun on their cheeks and by the side of some lay their girls and it was these that gregory could not bear to see for his spirit and his senses were ahungered in the plantations close by were pigeons and never for a moment did they stop cooing never did the blackbirds cease their courting songs the sun its hot sweet burning the clouds above their lovechase in the sky it was the day without a past without a future when it is not good for man to be alone and no man looked at him because it was no mans business but a woman here and there cast a glance on that long tweedsuited figure with the hand over the eyes and wondered perhaps what was behind that hand had they but known they would have smiled their womans smile that he should so have mistaken one of their sex  gregory lay quite still looking at the sky and because he was a loyal man he did not blame her but slowly very slowly his spirit like a spring stretched to the point of breaking came back upon itself and since he could not bear to see things as they were he began again to see them as they were not  she has been forced into this he thought it is george pendyces fault to me she is she must be the same  he turned again on to his face and a small dog who had lost its master sniffed at his boots and sat down a little way off to wait till gregory could do something for him because he smelled that he was that sort of man     chapter vii  doubtful position at worsted skeynes  then georges answer came at last the flags were in full bloom round the scotch garden at worsted skeynes they grew in masses and of all shades from deep purple to pale grey and their scent very penetrating very delicate floated on the wind  while waiting for that answer it had become mr pendyces habit to promenade between these beds his hand to his back for he was still a little stiff followed at a distance of seven paces by the spaniel john very black and moving his rubbery nostrils uneasily from side to side  in this way the two passed every day the hour from twelve to one neither could have said why they walked thus for mr pendyce had a horror of idleness and the spaniel john disliked the scent of irises both in fact obeyed that part of themselves which is superior to reason during this hour too mrs pendyce though longing to walk between her flowers also obeyed that part of her superior to reason which told her that it would be better not  but georges answer came at last   stoics club  dear father  yes bellew is bringing a suit i am taking steps in the matter as to the promise you ask for i can give no promise of the sort you may tell bellew i will see him dd first  your affectionate son  george pendyce   mr pendyce received this at the breakfasttable and while he read it there was a hush for all had seen the handwriting on the envelope  mr pendyce read it through twice once with his glasses on and once without and when he had finished the second reading he placed it in his breast pocket no word escaped him his eyes which had sunk a little the last few days rested angrily on his wifes white face bee and norah looked down and as if they understood the four dogs were still mr pendyce pushed his plate back rose and left the room  norah looked up  whats the matter mother  mrs pendyce was swaying she recovered herself in a moment  nothing dear its very hot this morning dont you think ill just go to my room and take some sal volatile  she went out followed by old roy the skye the spaniel john who had been cut off at the door by his masters abrupt exit preceded her norah and bee pushed back their plates  i cant eat norah said bee its horrible not to know whats going on  norah answered  its perfectly brutal not being a man you might just as well be a dog as a girl for anything anyone tells you  mrs pendyce did not go to her room she went to the library her husband seated at his table had georges letter before him a pen was in his hand but he was not writing  horace she said softly here is poor john  mr pendyce did not answer but put down the hand that did not hold his pen the spaniel john covered it with kisses  let me see the letter wont you  mr pendyce handed it to her without a word she touched his shoulder gratefully for his unusual silence went to her heart mr pendyce took no notice staring at his pen as though surprised that of its own accord it did not write his answer but suddenly he flung it down and looked round and his look seemed to say you brought this fellow into the world now see the result  he had had so many days to think and put his finger on the doubtful spots of his sons character all that week he had become more and more certain of how without his wife george would have been exactly like himself words sprang to his lips and kept on dying there the doubt whether she would agree with him the feeling that she sympathised with her son the certainty that something even in himself responded to those words you can tell bellew i will see him dd firstall this and the thought never out of his mind the namethe estate kept him silent he turned his head away and took up his pen again  mrs pendyce had read the letter now three times and instinctively had put it in her bosom it was not hers but horace must know it by heart and in his anger he might tear it up that letter for which they had waited so long told her nothing she had known all there was to tell her hand had fallen from mr pendyces shoulder and she did not put it back but ran her fingers through and through each other while the sunlight traversing the narrow windows caressed her from her hair down to her knees here and there that stream of sunlight formed little pools in her eyes giving them a touching anxious brightness in a curious heartshaped locket of carved steel worn by her mother and her grandmother before her containing now not locks of their sons hair but a curl of georges in her diamond rings and a bracelet of amethyst and pearl which she wore for the love of pretty things and the warm sunlight disengaged from her a scent of lavender through the library door a scratching noise told that the dear dogs knew she was not in her bedroom mr pendyce too caught that scent of lavender and in some vague way it augmented his discomfort her silence too distressed him it did not occur to him that his silence was distressing her he put down his pen  i cant write with you standing there margery  mrs pendyce moved out of the sunlight  george says he is taking steps what does that mean horace  this question focusing his doubts broke down the squires dumbness  i wont be treated like this he said ill go up and see him myself  he went by the 1020 saying that he would be down again by the 555  soon after seven the same evening a dogcart driven by a young groom and drawn by a raking chestnut mare with a blaze face swung into the railwaystation at worsted skeynes and drew up before the bookingoffice mr pendyces brougham behind a brown horse coming a little later was obliged to range itself behind a minute before the trains arrival a wagonette and a pair of bays belonging to lord quarryman wheeled in and filing past the other two took up its place in front outside this little row of vehicles the station fly and two farmers gigs presented their backs to the station buildings and in this arrangement there was something harmonious and fitting as though providence itself had guided them all and assigned to each its place and providence had only made one errorthat of placing captain bellews dogcart precisely opposite the bookingoffice instead of lord quarrymans wagonette with mr pendyces brougham next  mr pendyce came out first he stared angrily at the dogcart and moved to his own carriage lord quarryman came out second his massive sunburned headthe back of which sparsely adorned by hairs ran perfectly straight into his neckwas crowned by a grey tophat the skirts of his grey coat were squareshaped and so were the toes of his boots  hallo pendyce he called out heartily didnt see you on the platform hows your wife  mr pendyce turning to answer met the little burning eyes of captain bellew who came out third they failed to salute each other and bellow springing into his cart wrenched his mare round circled the farmers gigs and sitting forward drove off at a furious pace his groom running at full speed clung to the cart and leaped on to the step behind lord quarrymans wagonette backed itself into the place left vacant and the mistake of providence was rectified  cracked chap that fellow bellew dyou see anything of him  mr pendyce answered  no and i want to see less i wish hed take himself off  his lordship smiled  a huntin country seems to breed fellows like that theres always one of em to every pack of hounds wheres his wife now goodlookin woman rather warm member eh  it seemed to mr pendyce that lord quarrymans eyes searched his own with a knowing look and muttering god knows he vanished into his brougham  lord quarryman looked kindly at his horses  he was not a man who reflected on the whys the wherefores the becauses of this life the good god had made him lord quarryman had made his eldest son lord quantock the good god had made the gaddesdon houndsit was enough  when mr pendyce reached home he went to his dressingroom in a corner by the bath the spaniel john lay surrounded by an assortment of his masters slippers for it was thus alone that he could soothe in measure the bitterness of separation his dark brown eye was fixed upon the door and round it gleamed a crescent moon of white he came to the squire fluttering his tail with a slipper in his mouth and his eye said plainly oh master where have you been why have you been so long i have been expecting you ever since halfpast ten this morning  mr pendyces heart opened a moment and closed again he said john and began to dress for dinner  mrs pendyce found him tying his white tie she had plucked the first rosebud from her garden she had plucked it because she felt sorry for him and because of the excuse it would give her to go to his dressingroom at once  ive brought you a buttonhole horace did you see him  no  of all answers this was the one she dreaded most she had not believed that anything would come of an interview she had trembled all day long at the thought of their meeting but now that they had not met she knew by the sinking in her heart that anything was better than uncertainty she waited as long as she could then burst out  tell me something horace  mr pendyce gave her an angry glance  how can i tell you when theres nothing to tell i went to his club hes not living there now hes got rooms nobody knows where i waited all the afternoon left a message at last for him to come down here tomorrow ive sent for paramor and told him to come down too i wont put up with this sort of thing  mrs pendyce looked out of the window but there was nothing to see save the haha the coverts the village spire the cottage roofs which for so long had been her world  george wont come down here she said  george will do what i tell him  again mrs pendyce shook her head knowing by instinct that she was right  mr pendyce stopped putting on his waistcoat  george had better take care he said hes entirely dependent on me  and as if with those words he had summed up the situation the philosophy of a system vital to his son he no longer frowned on mrs pendyce those words had a strange effect they stirred within her terror it was like seeing her sons back bared to a lifted whiplash like seeing the door shut against him on a snowy night but besides terror they stirred within her a more poignant feeling yet as though someone had dared to show a whip to herself had dared to defy that something more precious than life in her soul that something which was of her blood so utterly and secretly passed by the centuries into her fibre that no one had ever thought of defying it before and there flashed before her with ridiculous concreteness the thought ive got three hundred a year of my own then the whole feeling left her just as in dreams a mordant sensation grips and passes leaving a dull ache whose cause is forgotten behind  theres the gong horace she said cecil tharp is here to dinner i asked the barters but poor rose didnt feel up to it of course they are expecting it very soon now they talk of the 15th of june  mr pendyce took from his wife his coat passing his arms down the satin sleeves  if i could get the cottagers to have families like that he said i shouldnt have much trouble about labour theyre a pigheaded lotdo nothing that theyre told give me some eaudecologne margery  mrs pendyce dabbed the wicker flask on her husbands handkerchief  your eyes look tired she said have you a headache dear     chapter viii  council at worsted skeynes  it was on the following eveningthe evening on which he was expecting his son and mr paramor that the squire leaned forward over the diningtable and asked  what do you say barter im speaking to you as a man of the world  the rector bent over his glass of port and moistened his lower lip  theres no excuse for that woman he answered i always thought she was a bad lot  mr pendyce went on  weve never had a scandal in my family i find the thought of it hard to bear barteri find it hard to bear  the rector emitted a low sound he had come from long usage to have a feeling like affection for his squire  mr pendyce pursued his thoughts  weve gone on he said father and son for hundreds of years its a blow to me barter  again the rector emitted that low sound  what will the village think said mr pendyce and the farmersi mind that more than anything most of them knew my dear old fathernot that he was popular its a bitter thing  the rector said  well well pendyce perhaps it wont come to that  he looked a little shamefaced and his light eyes were full of something like contrition  how does mrs pendyce take it  the squire looked at him for the first time  ah he said you never know anything about women id as soon trust a woman to be just as idid finish that magnum itd give me gout in no time  the rector emptied his glass  ive sent for george and my solicitor pursued the squire theyll be here directly  mr barter pushed his chair back and raising his right ankle on to his left leg clasped his hands round his right knee then leaning forward he stared up under his jutting brows at mr pendyce it was the attitude in which he thought best  mr pendyce ran on  ive nursed the estate ever since it came to me ive carried on the tradition as best i could ive not been as good a man perhaps as i should have wished but ive always tried to remember my old fathers words im done for horry the estates in your hands now he cleared his throat  for a full minute there was no sound save the ticking of the clock then the spaniel john coming silently from under the sideboard fell heavily down against his masters leg with a lengthy snore of satisfaction mr pendyce looked down  this fellow of mine he muttered is getting fat  it was evident from the tone of his voice that he desired his emotion to be forgotten something very deep in mr barter respected that desire  its a firstrate magnum he said  mr pendyce filled his rectors glass  i forget if you knew paramor he was before your time he was at harrow with me  the rector took a prolonged sip  i shall be in the way he said ill take myself off  the squire put out his hand affectionately  no no barter dont you go its all safe with you i mean to act i cant stand this uncertainty my wifes cousin vigil is coming toohes her guardian i wired for him you know vigil he was about your time  the rector turned crimson and set his underlip having scented his enemy nothing would now persuade him to withdraw and the conviction that he had only done his duty a little shaken by the squires confidence returned as though by magic  yes i know him  well have it all out here muttered mr pendyce over this port theres the carriage get up john  the spaniel john rose heavily looked sardonically at mr barter and again flopped down against his masters leg  get up john said mr pendyce again the spaniel john snored  if i move youll move too and uncertainty will begin for me again he seemed to say  mr pendyce disengaged his leg rose and went to the door before reaching it he turned and came back to the table  barter he said im not thinking of myselfim not thinking of myselfweve been here for generationsits the principle his face had the least twist to one side as though conforming to a kink in his philosophy his eyes looked sad and restless  and the rector watching the door for the sight of his enemy also thought  im not thinking of myselfim satisfied that i did rightim rector of this parish its the principle  the spaniel john gave three short barks one for each of the persons who entered the room they were mrs pendyce mr paramor and gregory vigil  wheres george asked the squire but no one answered him  the rector who had resumed his seat stared at a little gold cross which he had taken out of his waistcoat pocket mr paramor lifted a vase and sniffed at the rose it contained gregory walked to the window  when mr pendyce realised that his son had not come he went to the door and held it open  be good enough to take john out margery he said john  the spaniel john seeing what lay before him rolled over on his back  mrs pendyce fixed her eyes on her husband and in those eyes she put all the words which the nature of a lady did not suffer her to speak  i claim to be here let me stay it is my right dont send me away so her eyes spoke and so those of the spaniel john lying on his back in which attitude he knew that he was hard to move  mr pendyce turned him over with his foot  get up john be good enough to take john out margery  mrs pendyce flushed but did not move  john said mr pendyce go with your mistress the spaniel john fluttered a drooping tail mr pendyce pressed his foot to it  this is not a subject for women  mrs pendyce bent down  come john she said the spaniel john showing the whites of his eyes and trying to back through his collar was assisted from the room mr pendyce closed the door behind them  have a glass of port vigil its the 47 my father laid it down in 56 the year before he died cant drink it myselfive had to put down two hogsheads of the jubilee wine paramor fill your glass take that chair next to paramor vigil you know barter  both gregorys face and the rectors were very red  were all harrow men here went on mr pendyce and suddenly turning to mr paramor he said well  just as round the hereditary principle are grouped the state the church law and philanthropy so round the diningtable at worsted skeynes sat the squire the rector mr paramor and gregory vigil and none of them wished to be the first to speak at last mr paramor taking from his pocket bellews note and georges answer which were pinned in strange alliance returned them to the squire  i understand the position to be that george refuses to give her up at the same time he is prepared to defend the suit and deny everything those are his instructions to me taking up the vase again he sniffed long and deep at the rose  mr pendyce broke the silence  as a gentleman he said in a voice sharpened by the bitterness of his feelings i suppose hes obliged  gregory smiling painfully added  to tell lies  mr pendyce turned on him at once  ive nothing to say about that vigil george has behaved abominably i dont uphold him but if the woman wishes the suit defended he cant play the curthats what i was brought up to believe  gregory leaned his forehead on his hand  the whole system is odious he was beginning  mr paramor chimed in  let us keep to the facts without the system  the rector spoke for the first time  i dont know what you mean about the system both this man and this woman are guilty  gregory said in a voice that quivered with rage  be so kind as not to use the expression this woman  the rector glowered  what expression then  mr pendyces voice to which the intimate trouble of his thoughts lent a certain dignity broke in  gentlemen this is a question concerning the honour of my house  there was another and a longer silence during which mr paramors eyes haunted from face to face while beyond the rose a smile writhed on his lips  i suppose you have brought me down here pendyce to give you my opinion he said at last well dont let these matters come into court if there is anything you can do to prevent it do it if your pride stands in the way put it in your pocket if your sense of truth stands in the way forget it between personal delicacy and our law of divorce there is no relation between absolute truth and our law of divorce there is no relation i repeat dont let these matters come into court innocent and guilty you will all suffer the innocent will suffer more than the guilty and nobody will benefit i have come to this conclusion deliberately there are cases in which i should give the opposite opinion but in this case i repeat theres nothing to be gained by it once more then dont let these matters come into court dont give peoples tongues a chance take my advice appeal to george again to give you that promise if he refuses well we must try and bluff bellew out of it  mr pendyce had listened as he had formed the habit of listening to edmund paramor in silence he now looked up and said  its all that redhaired ruffians spite i dont know what you were about to stir things up vigil you must have put him on the scent he looked moodily at gregory mr barter too looked at gregory with a sort of halfashamed defiance  gregory who had been staring at his untouched wineglass turned his face very flushed and began speaking in a voice that emotion and anger caused to tremble he avoided looking at the rector and addressed himself to mr paramor  george cant give up the woman who has trusted herself to him that would be playing the cur if you like let them go and live together honestly until they can be married why do you all speak as if it were the man who mattered it is the woman that we should protect  the rector first recovered speech  youre talking rank immorality he said almost goodhumouredly  mr pendyce rose  marry her he cried what on earththats worse than allthe very thing were trying to prevent weve been here father and sonfather and sonfor generations  all the more shame burst out gregory if you cant stand by a woman at the end of them  mr paramor made a gesture of reproof  theres moderation in all things he said are you sure that mrs bellew requires protection if you are right i agree but are you right  i will answer for it said gregory  mr paramor paused a full minute with his head resting on his hand  i am sorry he said at last i must trust to my own judgment  the squire looked up  if the worst comes to the worst can i cut the entail paramor  no  what but thats all wrongthats  you cant have it both ways said mr paramor  the squire looked at him dubiously then blurted out  if i choose to leave him nothing but the estate hell soon find himself a beggar i beg your pardon gentlemen fill your glasses im forgetting everything  the rector filled his glass  ive said nothing so far he began i dont feel that its my business my conviction is that theres far too much divorce nowadays let this woman go back to her husband and let him show her where shes to blamehis voice and his eyes hardenedthen let them forgive each other like christians you talk he said to gregory about standing up for the woman ive no patience with that its the way immoralitys fostered in these days i raise my voice against this sentimentalism i always have and i always shall  gregory jumped to his feet  ive told you once before he said that you were indelicate i tell you so again  mr barter got up and stood bending over the table crimson in the face staring at gregory and unable to speak  either you or i he said at last stammering with passion must leave this room  gregory tried to speak then turning abruptly he stepped out on to the terrace and passed from the view of those within  the rector said  goodnight pendyce im going too  the squire shook the hand held out to him with a face perplexed to sadness there was silence when mr barter had left the room  the squire broke it with a sigh  i wish we were back at oxenhams paramor this serves me right for deserting the old house what on earth made me send george to eton  mr paramor buried his nose in the vase in this saying of his old schoolfellow was the whole of the squires creed  i believe in my father and his father and his fathers father the makers and keepers of my estate and i believe in myself and my son and my sons son and i believe that we have made the country and shall keep the country what it is and i believe in the public schools and especially the public school that i was at and i believe in my social equals and the country house and in things as they are for ever and ever amen  mr pendyce went on  im not a puritan paramor i dare say there are allowances to be made for george i dont even object to the woman herself she may be too good for bellew she must be too good for a fellow like that but for george to marry her would be ruination look at lady roses case anyone but a stargazing fellow like vigil must see that its taboo its sheer taboo and thinkthink of mymy grandson no no paramor no no by god  the squire covered his eyes with his hand  mr paramor who had no son himself answered with feeling  now now old fellow it wont come to that  god knows what it will come to paramor my nerves shaken you know yourself that if theres a divorce hell be bound to marry her  to this mr paramor made no reply but pressed his lips together  theres your poor dog whining he said  and without waiting for permission he opened the door mrs pendyce and the spaniel john came in the squire looked up and frowned the spaniel john panting with delight rubbed against him i have been through torment master he seemed to say a second separation at present is not possible for me  mrs pendyce stood waiting silently and mr paramor addressed himself to her  you can do more than any of us mrs pendyce both with george and with this man bellewand if i am not mistaken with his wife  the squire broke in  dont think that ill have any humble pie eaten to that fellow bellew  the look mr paramor gave him at those words was like that of a doctor diagnosing a disease yet there was nothing in the expression of the squires face with its thin grey whiskers and moustache its twist to the left its swanlike eyes decided jaw and sloping brow different from what this idea might bring on the face of any country gentleman  mrs pendyce said eagerly  oh mr paramor if i could only see george  she longed so for a sight of her son that her thoughts carried her no further  see him cried the squire youll go on spoiling him till hes disgraced us all  mrs pendyce turned from her husband to his solicitor excitement had fixed an unwonted colour in her cheeks her lips twitched as if she wished to speak  mr paramor answered for her  no pendyce if george is spoilt the system is to blame  system said the squire ive never had a system for him im no believer in systems i dont know what youre talking of i have another son thank god  mrs pendyce took a step forward  horace she said you would never  mr pendyce turned from his wife and said sharply  paramor are you sure i cant cut the entail  as sure said mr paramor as i sit here     chapter ix  definition of pendycitis  gregory walked long in the scotch garden with his eyes on the stars one larger than all the rest over the larches shone on him ironically for it was the star of love and on his beat between the yewtrees that living before pendyces came to worsted skeynes would live when they were gone he cooled his heart in the silver light of that big star the irises restrained their perfume lest it should whip his senses only the young larchtrees and the far fields sent him their fugitive sweetness through the dark and the same brown owl that had hooted when helen bellew kissed george pendyce in the conservatory hooted again now that gregory walked grieving over the fruits of that kiss  his thoughts were of mr barter and with the injustice natural to a man who took a warm and personal view of things he painted the rector in colours darker than his cloth  indelicate meddlesome he thought how dare he speak of her like that  mr paramors voice broke in on his meditations  still cooling your heels why did you play the deuce with us in there  i hate a sham said gregory this marriage of my wards is a sham she had better live honestly with the man she really loves  so you said just now returned mr paramor would you apply that to everyone  i would  well said mr paramor with a laugh there is nothing like an idealist formaking hay you once told me if i remember that marriage was sacred to you  those are my own private feelings paramor but here the mischiefs done already it is a sham a hateful sham and it ought to come to an end  thats all very well replied mr paramor but when you come to put it into practice in that wholesale way it leads to goodness knows what it means reconstructing marriage on a basis entirely different from the present its marriage on the basis of the heart and not on the basis of property are you prepared to go to that length  i am  youre as much of an extremist one way as barter is the other its you extremists who do all the harm theres a golden mean my friend i agree that something ought to be done but what you dont see is that laws must suit those they are intended to govern youre too much in the stars vigil medicine must be graduated to the patient come man wheres your sense of humour imagine your conception of marriage applied to pendyce and his sons or his rector or his tenants and the labourers on his estate  no no said gregory i refuse to believe  the country classes said mr paramor quietly are especially backward in such matters they have strong meatfed instincts and what with the county members the bishops the peers all the hereditary force of the country they still rule the roast and theres a certain diseaseto make a very poor joke call it pendycitis with which most of these people are infected theyre crass they do things but they do them the wrong way they muddle through with the greatest possible amount of unnecessary labour and suffering its part of the hereditary principle i havent had to do with them thirty five years for nothing  gregory turned his face away  your joke is very poor he said i dont believe they are like that i wont admit it if there is such a disease its our business to find a remedy  nothing but an operation will cure it said mr paramor and before operating theres a preliminary process to be gone through it was discovered by lister  gregory answered  paramor i hate your pessimism  mr paramors eyes haunted gregorys back  but i am not a pessimist he said far from it      when daisies pied and violets blue           and ladysmocks all silverwhite      and cuckoobuds of yellow hue           do paint the meadows with delight      the cuckoo then on every tree  gregory turned on him  how can you quote poetry and hold the views you do we ought to construct  you want to build before youve laid your foundations said mr paramor you let your feelings carry you away vigil the state of the marriage laws is only a symptom its this disease this grudging narrow spirit in men that makes such laws necessary unlovely men unlovely lawswhat can you expect  i will never believe that we shall be content to go on living in a slough ofof  provincialism said mr paramor you should take to gardening it makes one recognise what you idealists seem to pass overthat men my dear friend are like plants creatures of heredity and environment their growth is slow you cant get grapes from thorns vigil or figs from thistlesat least not in one generationhowever busy and hungry you may be  your theory degrades us all to the level of thistles  social laws depend for their strength on the harm they have it in their power to inflict and that harm depends for its strength on the ideals held by the man on whom the harm falls if you dispense with the marriage tie or give up your property and take to brotherhood youll have a very thistley time but you wont mind that if youre a fig and so on ad lib its odd though how soon the thistles that thought themselves figs get found out there are many things i hate vigil one is extravagance and another humbug  but gregory stood looking at the sky  we seem to have wandered from the point said mr paramor and i think we had better go in its nearly eleven  throughout the length of the low white house there were but three windows lighted three eyes looking at the moon a fairy shallop sailing the night sky the cedartrees stood black as pitch the old brown owl had ceased his hooting mr paramor gripped gregory by the arm  a nightingale did you hear him down in that spinney its a sweet place this i dont wonder pendyce is fond of it youre not a fisherman i think did you ever watch a school of fishes coasting along a bank how blind they are and how they follow their leader in our element we men know just about as much as the fishes do a blind lot vigil we take a mean view of things were damnably provincial  gregory pressed his hands to his forehead  im trying to think he said what will be the consequences to my ward of this divorce  my friend listen to some plain speaking your ward and her husband and george pendyce are just the sort of people for whom our law of divorce is framed theyve all three got courage theyre all reckless and obstinate andforgive methickskinned their case if fought will take a week of hard swearing a week of the publics money and time it will give admirable opportunities to eminent counsel excellent reading to the general public firstrate sport all round  the papers will have a regular carnival i repeat they are the very people for whom our law of divorce is framed theres a great deal to be said for publicity but all the same it puts a premium on insensibility and causes a vast amount of suffering to innocent people i told you once before to get a divorce even if you deserve it you mustnt be a sensitive person those three will go through it all splendidly but every scrap of skin will be torn off you and our poor friends down here and the result will be a drawn battle at the end thats if its fought and if it comes on i dont see how we can let it go unfought its contrary to my instincts if we let it go undefended mark my words your ward and george pendyce will be sick of each other before the law allows them to marry and george as his father says for the sake of morality will have to marry a woman who is tired of him or of whom he is tired now youve got it straight from the shoulder and im going up to bed its a heavy dew lock this door after you  mr paramor made his way into the conservatory he stopped and came back  pendyce he said perfectly understands all ive been telling you hed give his eyes for the case not to come on but youll see hell rub everything up the wrong way and itll be a miracle if we succeed thats pendycitis weve all got a touch of it goodnight  gregory was left alone outside the country house with his big star and as his thoughts were seldom of an impersonal kind he did not reflect on pendycitis but on helen bellew and the longer he thought the more he thought of her as he desired to think for this was natural to him and ever more ironical grew the twinkling of his star above the spinney where the nightingale was singing     chapter x  george goes for the gloves  on the thursday of the epsom summer meeting george pendyce sat in the corner of a firstclass railwaycarriage trying to make two and two into five on a sheet of stoics club notepaper his racingdebts were stated to a pennyone thousand and forty five pounds overdue and below seven hundred and fifty lost at the current meeting below these again his private debts were indicated by the round figure of one thousand pounds it was round by courtesy for he had only calculated those bills which had been sent in and providence which knows all things preferred the rounder figure of fifteen hundred in sum therefore he had against him a total of three thousand two hundred and ninetyfive pounds and since at tattersalls and the stock exchange where men are engaged in perpetual motion an almost absurd punctiliousness is required in the payment of those sums which have for the moment inadvertently been lost seventeen hundred and ninetyfive of this must infallibly be raised by monday next indeed only a certain liking for george a good loser and a good winner and the fear of dropping a good customer had induced the firm of bookmakers to let that debt of one thousand and fortyfive stand over the epsom meeting  to set against these sums in which he had not counted his current trainers bill and the expenses which he could not calculate of the divorce suit he had first a bank balance which he might still overdraw another twenty pounds secondly the ambler and two bad selling platers and thirdly more considerable item x or that which he might or indeed must win over the amblers race this afternoon  whatever else it was not pluck that was lacking in the character of george pendyce this quality was in his fibre in the consistency of his blood and confronted with a situation which to some men and especially to men not brought up on the hereditary plan might have seemed desperate he exhibited no sign of anxiety or distress into the consideration of his difficulties he imported certain principles 1 he did not intend to be posted at tattersalls sooner than that he would go to the jews the entail was all he could look to borrow on the hebrews would force him to pay through the nose 2 he did not intend to show the white feather and in backing his horse meant to go for the gloves 3 he did not intend to think of the future the thought of the present was quite bad enough  the train bounded and swung as though rushing onwards to a tune and george sat quietly in his corner  amongst his fellows in the carriage was the hon geoffrey winlow who though not a racingman took a kindly interest in our breed of horses which by attendance at the principal meetings he hoped to improve  your horse going to run george  george nodded  i shall have a fiver on him for luck i cant afford to bet saw your mother at the foxholme gardenparty last week you seen them lately  george shook his head and felt an odd squeeze at his heart  you know they had a fire at old peacocks farm i hear the squire and barter did wonders hes as game as a pebble the squire  again george nodded and again felt that squeeze at his heart  arent they coming to town this season  havent heard answered george have a cigar  winlow took the cigar and cutting it with a small penknife scrutinised georges square face with his leisurely eyes it needed a physiognomist to penetrate its impassivity winlow thought to himself  i shouldnt be surprised if what they say about old george is true had a good meeting so far  soso  they parted on the racecourse george went at once to see his trainer and thence into tattersalls ring he took with him that equation with x and sought the society of two gentlemen quietly dressed one of whom was making a note in a little book with a gold pencil they greeted him respectfully for it was to them that he owed the bulk of that seventeen hundred and ninetyfive pounds  what price will you lay against my horse  evens mr pendyce replied the gentleman with the gold pencil to a monkey  george booked the bet it was not his usual way of doing business but today everything seemed different and something stronger than custom was at work  i am going for the gloves he thought if it doesnt come off im done anyhow  he went to another quietly dressed gentleman with a diamond pin and a jewish face and as he went from one quietly dressed gentleman to another there preceded him some subtle messenger who breathed the words mr pendyce is going for the gloves so that at each visit he found they had greater confidence than ever in his horse soon he had promised to pay two thousand pounds if the ambler lost and received the assurance of eminent gentlemen quietly dressed that they would pay him fifteen hundred if the ambler won the odds now stood at two to one on and he had found it impossible to back the ambler for a place in accordance with his custom  made a fool of myself he thought ought never to have gone into the ring at all ought to have let barneys work it quietly it doesnt matter  he still required to win three hundred pounds to settle on the monday and laid a final bet of seven hundred to three hundred and fifty pounds upon his horse thus without spending a penny simply by making a few promises he had solved the equation with x  on leaving the ring he entered the bar and drank some whisky he then went to the paddock the startingbell for the second race had rung there was hardly anyone there but in a far corner the ambler was being led up and down by a boy  george glanced round to see that no acquaintances were near and joined in this promenade the ambler turned his black wild eye crescented with white threw up his head and gazed far into the distance  if one could only make him understand thought george  when his horse left the paddock for the startingpost george went back to the stand at the bar he drank some more whisky and heard someone say  i had to lay six to four i want to find pendyce they say hes backed it heavily  george put down his glass and instead of going to his usual place mounted slowly to the top of the stand  i dont want them buzzing round me he thought  at the top of the standthat national monument visible for twenty miles aroundhe knew himself to be safe only the many came here and amongst the many he thrust himself till at the very top he could rest his glasses on a rail and watch the colours besides his own peacock blue there was a straw a blue with white stripes a red with white stars  they say that through the minds of drowning men troop ghosts of past experience it was not so with george his soul was fastened on that little daub of peacock blue below the glasses his lips were colourless from hard compression he moistened them continually the four little coloured daubs stole into line the flag fell  theyre off that roar like the cry of a monster sounded all around george steadied his glasses on the rail blue with white stripes was leading the ambler lying last thus they came round the further bend and providence as though determined that someone should benefit by his absorption sent a hand sliding under georges elbows to remove the pin from his tie and slide away round tattenham corner george saw his horse take the lead so with straw closing up they came into the straight the amblers jockey looked back and raised his whip in that instant as if by magic straw drew level down came the whip on the amblers flank again as by magic straw was in front the saying of his old jockey darted through georges mind mark my words sir that orse knows whats what and when theyre like that theyre best let alone  sit still you fool he muttered  the whip came down again straw was two lengths in front  someone behind said  the favourites beat no hes not by jove for as though georges groan had found its way to the jockeys ears he dropped his whip the ambler sprang forward george saw that he was gaining all his soul went out to his horses struggle in each of those fifteen seconds he died and was born again with each stride all that was loyal and brave in his nature leaped into flame all that was base sank for he himself was racing with his horse and the sweat poured down his brow and his lips babbled broken sounds that no one heard for all around were babbling too  locked together the ambler and straw ran home then followed a hush for no one knew which of the two had won the numbers went up seventwofive  the favourites second beaten by a nose said a voice  george bowed his head and his whole spirit felt numb he closed his glasses and moved with the crowd to the stairs a voice behind him said  hed have won in another stride  another answered  i hate that sort of horse he curled up at the whip  george ground his teeth  curse you he muttered you little cockney what do you know about a horse  the crowd surged the speakers were lost to sight  the long descent from the stand gave him time no trace of emotion showed on his face when he appeared in the paddock blacksmith the trainer stood by the amblers stall  that idiot tipping lost us the race sir he began with quivering lips if hed only left him alone the horse would have won in a canter what on earth made him use his whip he deserves to lose his license he  the gall and bitterness of defeat surged into georges brain  its no good your talking blacksmith he said you put him up what the devil made you quarrel with swells  the little mans chin dropped in sheer surprise  george turned away and went up to the jockey but at the sick look on the poor youths face the angry words died off his tongue  all right tipping im not going to rag you and with the ghost of a smile he passed into the amblers stall the groom had just finished putting him to rights the horse stood ready to be led from the field of his defeat the groom moved out and george went to the amblers head there is no place no corner on a racecourse where a man may show his heart george did but lay his forehead against the velvet of his horses muzzle and for one short second hold it there the ambler awaited the end of that brief caress then with a snort threw up his head and with his wild soft eyes seemed saying you fools what do you know of me  george stepped to one side  take him away he said and his eyes followed the amblers receding form  a racingman of a different race whom he knew and did not like came up to him as he left the paddock  i suppothe you wont thell your horse pendythe he said ill give you five thou for him he ought never to have lotht the beating wont help him with the handicappers a little bit  you carrion crow thought george  thanks hes not for sale he answered  he went back to the stand but at every step and in each face he seemed to see the equation which now he could only solve with x2 thrice he went into the bar it was on the last of these occasions that he said to himself the horse must go i shall never have a horse like him again  over that green down which a hundred thousand feet had trodden brown which a hundred thousand hands had strewn with bits of paper cigarends and the fragments of discarded food over the great approaches to the battlefield where all was pathway leading to and from the fight those who make livelihood in such a fashion least and littlest followers were bawling hawking whining to the warriors flushed with victory or wearied by defeat over that green down between onelegged men and ragged acrobats women with babies at the breast thimbleriggers touts walked george pendyce his mouth hard set and his head bent down  good luck captain good luck tomorrow good luck good luck for the love of gawd your lordship roll bowl or pitch  the sun flaming out after long hiding scorched the back of his neck the free down wind fouled by foetid odours brought to his ears the monsters last cry theyre off  a voice hailed him  george turned and saw winlow and with a curse and a smile he answered  hallo  the hon geoffrey ranged alongside examining georges face at leisure  afraid you had a bad race old chap i hear youve sold the ambler to that fellow guilderstein  in georges heart something snapped  already he thought the brutes been crowing and its that little bounder that my horsemy horse  he answered calmly  wanted the money  winlow who was not lacking in cool discretion changed the subject  late that evening george sat in the stoics window overlooking piccadilly before his eyes shaded by his hand the hansoms passed flying east and west each with the single pale disc of face or the twin discs of faces close together and the gentle roar of the town came in and the cool air refreshed by night in the light of the lamps the trees of the green park stood burnished out of deep shadow where nothing moved and high over all the stars and purple sky seemed veiled with golden gauze figures without end filed by some glanced at the lighted windows and the man in the white shirtfront sitting there and many thought wish i were that swell with nothing to do but step into his fathers shoes and to many no thought came but now and then some passer murmured to himself looks lonely sitting there  and to those faces gazing up georges lips were grim and over them came and went a little bitter smile but on his forehead he felt still the touch of his horses muzzle and his eyes which none could see were dark with pain     chapter xi  mr barter takes a walk  the event at the rectory was expected every moment the rector who practically never suffered disliked the thought and sight of others suffering up to this day indeed there had been none to dislike for in answer to inquiries his wife had always said no dear no im all rightreally its nothing and she had always said it smiling even when her smiling lips were white but this morning in trying to say it she had failed to smile her eyes had lost their hopelessly hopeful shining and sharply between her teeth she said send for dr wilson russell  the rector kissed her shutting his eyes for he was afraid of her face with its lips drawn back and its discoloured cheeks in five minutes the groom was hastening to cornmarket on the roan cob and the rector stood in his study looking from one to another of his household gods as though calling them to his assistance at last he took down a bat and began oiling it sixteen years ago when husell was born he had been overtaken by sounds that he had never to this day forgotten they had clung to the nerves of his memory and for no reward would he hear them again they had never been uttered since for like most wives his wife was a heroine but used as he was to this event the rector had ever since suffered from panic it was as though providence storing all the anxiety which he might have felt throughout let him have it with a rush at the last moment he put the bat back into its case corked the oilbottle and again stood looking at his household gods none came to his aid and his thoughts were as they had nine times been before i ought not to go out i ought to wait for wilson suppose anything were to happen still nurse is with her and i can do nothing poor rosepoor darling its my duty towhats that im better out of the way  softly without knowing that it was softly he opened the door softly without knowing it was softly he stepped to the hatrack and took his black straw hat softly without knowing it was softly he went out and unfaltering hurried down the drive  three minutes later he appeared again approaching the house faster than he had set forth  he passed the hall door ran up the stairs and entered his wifes room  rose dear rose can i do anything  mrs barter put out her hand a gleam of malice shot into her eyes through her set lips came a vague murmur and the words  no dear nothing better go for your walk  mr barter pressed his lips to her quivering hand and backed from the room outside the door he struck at the air with his fist and running downstairs was once more lost to sight faster and faster he walked leaving the village behind and among the country sights and sounds and scentshis nerves began to recover he was able to think again of other things of cecils school reportfar from satisfactory of old hermon in the village whom he suspected of overdoing his bronchitis with an eye to port of the return match with coldingham and his belief that their lefthand bowler only wanted hitting of the new edition of hymnbooks and the slackness of the upper village in attending churchfive households less honest and ductile than the rest a foreign look about them dark people unenglish in thinking of these things he forgot what he wanted to forget but hearing the sound of wheels he entered a field as though to examine the crops until the vehicle had passed  it was not wilson but it might have been and at the next turning he unconsciously branched off the cornmarket road  it was noon when he came within sight of coldingham six miles from worsted skeynes he would have enjoyed a glass of beer but unable to enter the publichouse he went into the churchyard instead he sat down on a bench beneath a sycamore opposite the winlow graves for coldingham was lord montrossors seat and it was here that all the winlows lay bees were busy above them in the branches and mr barter thought  beautiful site weve nothing like this at worsted skeynes  but suddenly he found that he could not sit there and think suppose his wife were to die it happened sometimes the wife of john tharp of bletchingham had died in giving birth to her tenth child his forehead was wet and he wiped it casting an angry glance at the winlow graves he left the seat  he went down by the further path and came out on the green a cricketmatch was going on and in spite of himself the rector stopped the coldingham team were in the field mr barter watched as he had thought that lefthand bowler bowled a good pace and came in from the off but his length was poor very poor a determined batsman would soon knock him off he moved into line with the wickets to see how much the fellow came in and he grew so absorbed that he did not at first notice the hon geoffrey winlow in pads and a blue and green blazer smoking a cigarette astride of a campstool  ah winlow its your team against the village afraid i cant stop to see you bat i was just passingmatter i had to attend tomust get back  the real solemnity of his face excited winlows curiosity  cant you stop and have lunch with us  no no my wifemust get back  winlow murmured  ah yes of course his leisurely blue eyes always in command of the situation rested on the rectors heated face by the way he said im afraid george pendyce is rather hard hit been obliged to sell his horse i saw him at epsom the week before last  the rector brightened  i made certain hed come to grief over that betting he said im very sorryvery sorry indeed  they say went on winlow that he dropped four thousand over the thursday race  he was pretty well dipped before i know poor old george such an awfully good chap  ah repeated mr barter im very sorryvery sorry indeed things were bad enough as it was  a ray of interest illumined the leisureliness of the hon geoffreys eyes  you mean about mrshm yes he said people are talking you cant stop that im so sorry for the poor squire and mrs pendyce i hope somethingll be done  the rector frowned  ive done my best he said well hit sir ive always said that anyone with a little pluck can knock off that lefthand man you think so much of he comes in a bit but he bowls a shocking bad length here i am dawdling i must get back  and once more that real solemnity came over mr barters face  i suppose youll be playing for coldingham against us on thursday goodbye  nodding in response to winlows salute he walked away  he avoided the churchyard and took a path across the fields he was hungry and thirsty in one of his sermons there occurred this passage we should habituate ourselves to hold our appetites in check by constantly accustoming our selves to abstinence little abstinences in our daily lifewe alone can attain to that true spirituality without which we cannot hope to know god and it was well known throughout his household and the village that the rectors temper was almost dangerously spiritual if anything detained him from his meals for he was a man physiologically sane and healthy to the core whose digestion and functions strong regular and straightforward as the day made calls upon him which would not be denied after preaching that particular sermon he frequently for a week or more denied himself a second glass of ale at lunch or his afterdinner cigar smoking a pipe instead and he was perfectly honest in his belief that he attained a greater spirituality thereby and perhaps indeed he did but even if he did not there was no one to notice this for the majority of his flock accepted his spirituality as matter of course and of the insignificant minority there were few who did not make allowance for the fact that he was their pastor by virtue of necessity by virtue of a system which had placed him there almost mechanically whether he would or no indeed they respected him the more that he was their rector and could not be removed and were glad that theirs was no common vicar like that of coldingham dependent on the caprices of others for with the exception of two bad characters and one atheist the whole village conservatives or liberals there were liberals now that they were beginning to believe that the ballot was really secret were believers in the hereditary system  insensibly the rector directed himself towards bletchingham where there was a temperance house at heart he loathed lemonade and gingerbeer in the middle of the day both of which made his economy cold and uneasy but he felt he could go nowhere else and his spirits rose at the sight of bletchingham spire  bread and cheese he thought whats better than bread and cheese and they shall make me a cup of coffee  in that cup of coffee there was something symbolic and fitting to his mental state it was agitated and thick and impregnated with the peculiar flavour of country coffee he swallowed but little and resumed his march at the first turning he passed the village school whence issued a rhythmic but discordant hum suggestive of some dull machine that had served its time the rector paused to listen leaning on the wall of the little playyard he tried to make out the words that like a religious chant were being intoned within it sounded like twice twos four twice fours six twice sixs eight and he passed on thinking a fine thing but if we dont take care we shall go too far we shall unfit them for their stations and he frowned crossing a stile he took a footpath the air was full of the singing of larks and the bees were pulling down the cloverstalks at the bottom of the field was a little pond overhung with willows on a bare strip of pasture within thirty yards in the full sun an old horse was tethered to a peg it stood with its face towards the pond baring its yellow teeth and stretching out its head all bone and hollows to the water which it could not reach the rector stopped he did not know the horse personally for it was three fields short of his parish but he saw that the poor beast wanted water he went up and finding that the knot of the halter hurt his fingers stooped down and wrenched at the peg while he was thus straining and tugging crimson in the face the old horse stood still gazing at him out of his bleary eyes mr barter sprang upright with a jerk the peg in his hand and the old horse started back  so ho boy said the rector and angrily he muttered a shame to tie the poor beast up here in the sun i should like to give his owner a bit of my mind  he led the animal towards the water the old horse followed tranquilly enough but as he had done nothing to deserve his misfortune neither did he feel any gratitude towards his deliverer he drank his fill and fell to grazing the rector experienced a sense of disillusionment and drove the peg again into the softer earth under the willows then raising himself he looked hard at the old horse  the animal continued to graze the rector took out his handkerchief wiped the perspiration from his brow and frowned he hated ingratitude in man or beast  suddenly he realised that he was very tired  it must be over by now he said to himself and hastened on in the heat across the fields  the rectory door was open passing into the study he sat down a moment to collect his thoughts people were moving above he heard a long moaning sound that filled his heart with terror  he got up and rushed to the bell but did not ring it and ran upstairs instead outside his wifes room he met his childrens old nurse she was standing on the mat with her hands to her ears and the tears were rolling down her face  oh sir she saidoh sir  the rector glared  woman he criedwoman  he covered his ears and rushed downstairs again there was a lady in the hall it was mrs pendyce and he ran to her as a hurt child runs to its mother  my wife he saidmy poor wife god knows what theyre doing to her up there mrs pendyce and he hid his face in his hands  she who had been a totteridge stood motionless then very gently putting her gloved hand on his thick arm where the muscles stood out from the clenching of his hands she said  dear mr barter dr wilson is so clever come into the drawingroom  the rector stumbling like a blind man suffered himself to be led he sat down on the sofa and mrs pendyce sat down beside him her hand still on his arm over her face passed little quivers as though she were holding herself in she repeated in her gentle voice  it will be all rightit will be all right come come  in her concern and sympathy there was apparent not aloofness but a faint surprise that she should be sitting there stroking the rectors arm  mr barter took his hands from before his face  if she dies he said in a voice unlike his own ill not bear it  in answer to those words forced from him by that which is deeper than habit mrs pendyces hand slipped from his arm and rested on the shiny chintz covering of the sofa patterned with green and crimson her soul shrank from the violence in his voice  wait here she said i will go up and see  to command was foreign to her nature but mr barter with a look such as a little rueful boy might give obeyed  when she was gone he stood listening at the door for some soundfor any sound even the sound of her dressbut there was none for her petticoat was of lawn and the rector was alone with a silence that he could not bear he began to pace the room in his thick boots his hands clenched behind him his forehead butting the air his lips folded thus a bull penned for the first time turns and turns showing the whites of its full eyes  his thoughts drove here and there fearful angered without guidance he did not pray the words he had spoken so many times left him as though of malice we are all in the hands of godwe are all in the hands of god instead of them he could think of nothing but the old saying mr paramor had used in the squires diningroom there is moderation in all things and this with cruel irony kept humming in his ears moderation in all thingsmoderation in all things and his wife lying therehis doing and  there was a sound the rectors face so brown and red could not grow pale but his great fists relaxed mrs pendyce was standing in the doorway with a peculiar halfpitiful halfexcited smile  its all righta boy the poor dear has had a dreadful time  the rector looked at her but did not speak then abruptly he brushed past her in the doorway hurried into his study and locked the door then and then only he kneeled down and remained there many minutes thinking of nothing     chapter xii  the squire makes up his mind  that same evening at nine oclock sitting over the last glass of a pint of port mr barter felt an irresistible longing for enjoyment an impulse towards expansion and his fellowmen  taking his hat and buttoning his coatfor though the june evening was fine the easterly breeze was eagerhe walked towards the village  like an emblem of that path to god of which he spoke on sundays the grey road between trim hedges threaded the shadow of the elmtrees where the rooks had long since gone to bed a scent of woodsmoke clung in the air the cottages appeared the forge the little shops facing the village green lights in the doors and windows deepened a breeze which hardly stirred the chestnut leaves fled with a gentle rustling through the aspens houses and trees houses and trees shelter through the past and through the days to come  the rector stopped the first man he saw  fine weather for the hay aiken hows your wife doinga girl ah ha you want some boys you heard of our event at the rectory im thankful to say  from man to man and house to house he soothed his thirst for fellowship for the lost sense of dignity that should efface again the scar of suffering and above him the chestnuts in their breathing stillness the aspens with their tender rustling seemed to watch and whisper oh little men oh little men  the moon at the end of her first quarter sailed out of the shadow of the churchyardthe same young moon that had sailed in her silver irony when the first barter preached the first pendyce was squire at worsted skeynes the same young moon that serene ineffable would come again when the last barter slept the last pendyce was gone and on their gravestones through the amethystine air let fall her gentle light  the rector thought  i shall set stedman to work on that corner we must have more room the stones there are a hundred and fifty years old if theyre a day you cant read a single word theyd better be the first to go  he passed on along the paddock footway leading to the squires  day was gone and only the moonbeams lighted the tall grasses  at the hall the long french windows of the diningroom were open the squire was sitting there alone brooding sadly above the remnants of the fruit he had been eating flanking him on either wall hung a silent company the effigies of past pendyces and at the end above the oak and silver of the sideboard the portrait of his wife was looking at them under lifted brows with her faint wonder  he raised his head  ah barter hows your wife  doing as well as can be expected  glad to hear that a fine constitutionwonderful vitality port or claret  thanks just a glass of port  very trying for your nerves i know what it is were different from the last generation they thought nothing of it when charles was born my dear old father was out hunting all day when my wife had george it made me as nervous as a cat  the squire stopped then hurriedly added  but youre so used to it  mr barter frowned  i was passing coldingham today he said i saw winlow he asked after you  ah winlow his wifes a very nice woman theyve only the one child i think  the rector winced  winlow tells me he said abruptly that george has sold his horse  the squires face changed he glanced suspiciously at mr barter but the rector was looking at his glass  sold his horse whats the meaning of that he told you why i suppose  the rector drank off his wine  i never ask for reasons he said where racingmen are concerned its my belief they know no more what theyre about than so many dumb animals  ah racingmen said mr pendyce but george doesnt bet  a gleam of humour shot into the rectors eyes he pressed his lips together  the squire rose  come now barter he said  the rector blushed he hated talebearingthat is of course in the case of a man the case of a woman was differentand just as when he went to bellew he had been careful not to give george away so now he was still more on his guard  no no pendyce  the squire began to pace the room and mr barter felt something stir against his foot the spaniel john emerging at the end just where the moonlight shone a symbol of all that was subservient to the squire gazed up at his master with tragic eyes here again they seemed to say is something to disturb me  the squire broke the silence  ive always counted on you barter i count on you as i would on my own brother come now whats this about george  after all thought the rector its his fatheri know nothing but what they say he blurted forth they talk of his having lost a lot of money i dare say its all nonsense i never set much store by rumour and if hes sold the horse well so much the better he wont be tempted to gamble again  but horace pendyce made no answer a single thought possessed his bewildered angry mind  my son a gambler worsted skeynes in the hands of a gambler  the rector rose  its all rumour you shouldnt pay any attention i should hardly think hes been such a fool i only know that i must get back to my wife goodnight  and nodding but confused mr barter went away through the french window by which he had come  the squire stood motionless  a gambler  to him whose existence was bound up in worsted skeynes whose every thought had some direct or indirect connection with it whose son was but the occupier of that place he must at last vacate whose religion was ancestorworship whose dread was change no word could be so terrible a gambler  it did not occur to him that his system was in any way responsible for georges conduct he had said to mr paramor i never had a system im no believer in systems he had brought him up simply as a gentleman he would have preferred that george should go into the army but george had failed he would have preferred that george should devote himself to the estate marry and have a son instead of idling away his time in town but george had failed and so beyond furthering his desire to join the yeomanry and getting him proposed for the stoics club what was there he could have done to keep him out of mischief and now he was a gambler  once a gambler always a gambler  to his wifes face looking down from the wall he said  he gets it from you  but for all answer the face stared gently  turning abruptly he left the room and the spaniel john for whom he had been too quick stood with his nose to the shut door scenting for someone to come and open it  mr pendyce went to his study took some papers from a locked drawer and sat a long time looking at them one was the draft of his will another a list of the holdings at worsted skeynes their acreage and rents a third a fair copy of the settlement resettling the estate when he had married it was at this piece of supreme irony that mr pendyce looked longest he did not read it but he thought  and i cant cut it paramor says so a gambler  that crassness common to all men in this strange world and in the squire intensified was rather a process than a qualityobedience to an instinctive dread of what was foreign to himself an instinctive fear of seeing anothers point of view an instinctive belief in precedent and it was closely allied to his most deep and moral qualitythe power of making a decision those decisions might be crass and stupid conduce to unnecessary suffering have no relation to morality or reason but he could make them and he could stick to them by virtue of this power he was where he was had been for centuries and hoped to be for centuries to come it was in his blood by this alone he kept at bay the destroying forces that time brought against him his order his inheritance by this alone he could continue to hand down that inheritance to his son and at the document which did hand it down he looked with angry and resentful eyes  men who conceive great resolutions do not always bring them forth with the ease and silence which they themselves desire mr pendyce went to his bedroom determined to say no word of what he had resolved to do his wife was asleep the squires entrance wakened her but she remained motionless with her eyes closed and it was the sight of that immobility when he himself was so disturbed which drew from him the words  did you know that george was a gambler  by the light of the candle in his silver candlestick her dark eyes seemed suddenly alive  hes been betting hes sold his horse hed never have sold that horse unless he were pushed for all i know he may be posted at tattersalls  the sheets shivered as though she who lay within them were struggling then came her voice cool and gentle  all young men bet horace you must know that  the squire at the foot of the bed held up the candle the movement had a sinister significance  do you defend him it seemed to say do you defy me  gripping the bedrail he cried  ill have no gambler and profligate for my son ill not risk the estate  mrs pendyce raised herself and for many seconds stared at her husband her heart beat furiously it had come what she had been expecting all these days had come her pale lips answered  what do you mean i dont understand you horace  mr pendyces eyes searched here and therefor what he did not know  this has decided me he said ill have no halfmeasures until he can show me hes done with that woman until he can prove hes given up this betting untiluntil the heavens fallen ill have no more to do with him  to margery pendyce with all her senses quivering that saying until the heavens fallen was frightening beyond the rest on the lips of her husband those lips which had never spoken in metaphors never swerved from the direct and commonplace nor deserted the shibboleth of his order such words had an evil and malignant sound  he went on  ive brought him up as i was brought up myself i never thought to have had a scamp for my son  mrs pendyces heart stopped fluttering  how dare you horace she cried  the squire letting go the bedrail paced to and fro there was something savage in the sound of his footsteps through the utter silence  ive made up my mind he said the estate  there broke from mrs pendyce a torrent of words  you talk of the way you brought george up youyou never understood him youyou never did anything for him he just grew up like you all grow up in this but no word followed for she did not know herself what was that against which her soul had blindly fluttered its wings you never loved him as i do what do i care about the estate i wish it were sold dyou think i like living here dyou think ive ever liked it dyou think ive ever but she did not finish that saying dyou think ive ever loved you my boy a scamp ive heard you laugh and shake your head and say a hundred times young men will be young men you think i dont know how youd all go on if you dared you think i dont know how you talk among yourselves as for gambling youd gamble too if you werent afraid and now george is in trouble  as suddenly as it had broken forth the torrent of her words dried up  mr pendyce had come back to the foot of the bed and once more gripped the rail whereon the candle still and bright showed them each others faces very changed from the faces that they knew in the squires lean brown throat between the parted points of his stiff collar a string seemed working he stammered  youyoure talking like a madwoman my father would have cut me off his father would have cut him off by god do you think ill stand quietly by and see it all played ducks and drakes with and see that woman here and see her son aa bastard or as bad as a bastard in my place you dont know me  the last words came through his teeth like the growl of a dog mrs pendyce made the crouching movement of one who gathers herself to spring  if you give him up i shall go to him i will never come back  the squires grip on the rail relaxed in the light of the candle still and steady and brighthis jaw could be seen to fall he snapped his teeth together and turning abruptly said  dont talk such rubbish  then taking the candle he went into his dressingroom  and at first his feelings were simple enough he had merely that sore sensation that sense of raw offence as at some gross and violent breach of taste  what madness he thought gets into women it would serve her right if i slept here  he looked around him there was no place where he could sleep not even a sofa and taking up the candle he moved towards the door but a feeling of hesitation and forlornness rising he knew not whence made him pause irresolute before the window  the young moon riding low shot her light upon his still lean figure and in that light it was strange to see how grey he lookedgrey from head to foot grey and sad and old as though in summary of all the squires who in turn had looked upon that prospect frosted with young moonlight to the boundary of their lands out in the paddock he saw his old hunter bob with his head turned towards the house and from the very bottom of his heart he sighed  in answer to that sigh came a sound of something falling outside against the door he opened it to see what might be there the spaniel john lying on a cushion of blue linen with his head propped up against the wall darkly turned his eyes  i am here master he seemed to say it is latei was about to go to sleep it has done me good however to see you and hiding his eyes from the light under a long black ear he drew a stertorous breath mr pendyce shutto the door he had forgotten the existence of his dog but as though with the sight of that faithful creature he had regained belief in all that he was used to in all that he was master of in all that washimself he opened the bedroom door and took his place beside his wife  and soon he was asleep     part iii     chapter i  mrs pendyces odyssey  but mrs pendyce did not sleep that blessed anodyne of the long day spent in his farmyards and fields was on her husbands eyesno anodyne on hers and through them all that was deep most hidden sacred was laid open to the darkness if only those eyes could have been seen that night but if the darkness had been light nothing of all this so deep and sacred would have been there to see for more deep more sacred still in margery pendyce was the instinct of a lady so elastic and so subtle so interwoven of consideration for others and consideration for herself so old so very old this instinct wrapped her from all eyes like a suit of armour of the finest chain the night must have been black indeed when she took that off and lay without it in the darkness  with the first light she put it on again and stealing from bed bathed long and stealthily those eyes which felt as though they had been burned all night thence went to the open window and leaned out dawn had passed the birds were at morning music down there in the garden her flowers were meshed with the grey dew and the trees were grey spun with haze dim and spectrelike the old hunter with his nose on the paddock rail dozed in the summer mist  and all that had been to her like prison out there and all that she had loved stole up on the breath of the unaired morning and kept beating in her face fluttering at the white linen above her heart like the wings of birds flying  the first morning song ceased and at the silence the sun smiled out in golden irony and everything was shot with colour a wan glow fell on mrs pendyces spirit that for so many hours had been heavy and grey in lonely resolution for to her gentle soul unused to action shrinking from violence whose strength was the gift of the ages passed into it against her very nature the resolution she had formed was full of pain yet painful even terrible in its demand for action it did not waver but shone like a star behind the dark and heavy clouds in margery pendyce who had been a totteridge there was no irascible and acrid peoples blood no fierce misgivings no illdigested beer and ciderit was pure claret in her veinsshe had nothing thick and angry in her soul to help her that which she had resolved she must carry out by virtue of a thin fine flame breathing far down in herso far that nothing could extinguish it so far that it had little warmth it was not i will not be overridden that her spirit felt but i must not be overridden for if i am overridden i and in me something beyond me more important than myself is all undone and though she was far from knowing this that something was her countrys civilisation its very soul the meaning of it all gentleness balance her spirit of that quality so little gross that it would never set up a mean or petty quarrel make mountains out of molehills distort proportion or get images awry had taken its stand unconsciously no sooner than it must no later than it ought and from that stand would not recede the issue had passed beyond mother love to that selflove deepest of all which says  do this or forfeit the essence of your soul  and now that she stole to her bed again she looked at her sleeping husband whom she had resolved to leave with no anger no reproach but rather with a long incurious look which told nothing even to herself  so when the morning came of age and it was time to rise by no action look or sign did she betray the presence of the unusual in her soul if this which was before her must be done it would be carried out as though it were of no import as though it were a daily action nor did she force herself to quietude or pride herself thereon but acted thus from instinct the instinct for avoiding fuss and unnecessary suffering that was bred in her  mr pendyce went out at halfpast ten accompanied by his bailiff and the spaniel john he had not the least notion that his wife still meant the words she had spoken overnight he had told her again while dressing that he would have no more to do with george that he would cut him out of his will that he would force him by sheer rigour to come to heel that in short he meant to keep his word and it would have been unreasonable in him to believe that a woman still less his wife meant to keep hers  mrs pendyce spent the early part of the morning in the usual way half an hour after the squire went out she ordered the carriage round had two small trunks which she had packed herself brought down and leisurely with her little green bag got in to her maid to the butler bester to the coachman benson she said that she was going up to stay with mr george norah and bee were at the tharps so that there was no one to take leave of but old roy the skye and lest that leavetaking should prove too much for her she took him with her to the station  for her husband she left a little note placing it where she knew he must see it at once and no one else see it at all   dear horace  i have gone up to london to be with george my address will be greens hotel bond street you will remember what i said last night perhaps you did not quite realise that i meant it take care of poor old roy and dont let them give him too much meat this hot weather jackman knows better than ellis how to manage the roses this year i should like to be told how poor rose barter gets on please do not worry about me i shall write to dear gerald when necessary but i dont feel like writing to him or the girls at present  goodbye dear horace i am sorry if i grieve you  your wife  margery pendyce   just as there was nothing violent in her manner of taking this step so there was nothing violent in her conception of it to her it was not running away a setting of her husband at defiance there was no concealment of address no melodramatic i cannot come back to you such methods such pistolholdings would have seemed to her ridiculous it is true that practical details such as the financial consequences escaped the grasp of her mind but even in this her view or rather lack of view was really the wide the even one horace would not let her starve the idea was inconceivable there was too her own three hundred a year she had indeed no idea how much this meant or what it represented neither was she concerned for she said to herself i should be quite happy in a cottage with roy and my flowers and though of course she had not the smallest experience to go by it was quite possible that she was right things which to others came only by money to a totteridge came without and even if they came not could well be dispensed withfor to this quality of soul this gentle selfsufficiency had the ages worked to bring her  yet it was hastily and with her head bent that she stepped from the carriage at the station and the old skye who from the brougham seat could just see out of the window from the tears on his nose that were not his own from something in his heart that was knew this was no common parting and whined behind the glass  mrs pendyce told her cabman to drive to greens hotel and it was only after she had arrived arranged her things washed and had lunch that the beginnings of confusion and homesickness stirred within her up to then a simmering excitement had kept her from thinking of how she was to act or of what she had hoped expected dreamed would come of her proceedings taking her sunshade she walked out into bond street  a passing man took off his hat  dear me she thought who was that i ought to know  she had a rather vague memory for faces and though she could not recall his name felt more at home at once not so lonely and adrift soon a quaint brightness showed in her eyes looking at the toilettes of the passersby and at each shopfront more engrossing than the last pleasure like that which touches the soul of a young girl at her first dance the souls of men landing on strange shores touched margery pendyce a delicious sense of entering the unknown of braving the unexpected and of the power to go on doing this delightfully for ever enveloped her with the gay london air of this bright june day she passed a perfume shop and thought she had never smelt anything so nice and next door she lingered long looking at some lace and though she said to herself i must not buy anything i shall want all my money for poor george it made no difference to that sensation of having all things to her hand  a list of theatres concerts operas confronted her in the next window together with the effigies of prominent artistes she looked at them with an eagerness that might have seemed absurd to anyone who saw her standing there was there indeed all this going on all day and every day to be seen and heard for so few shillings every year religiously she had visited the opera once the theatre twice and no concerts her husband did not care for music that was classical while she was standing there a woman begged of her looking very tired and hot with a baby in her arms so shrivelled and so small that it could hardly be seen mrs pendyce took out her purse and gave her half a crown and as she did so felt a gush of feeling which was almost rage  poor little baby she thought there must be thousands like that and i know nothing of them  she smiled to the woman who smiled back at her and a fat jewish youth in a shop doorway seeing them smile smiled too as though he found them charming mrs pendyce had a feeling that the town was saying pretty things to her and this was so strange and pleasant that she could hardly believe it for worsted skeynes had omitted to say that sort of thing to her for over thirty years she looked in the window of a hat shop and found pleasure in the sight of herself the window was kind to her grey linen with black velvet knots and guipure though it was two years old but then she had only been able to wear it once last summer owing to poor huberts death the window was kind too to her cheeks and eyes which had that touching brightness and to the silverpowdered darkness of her hair and she thought i dont look so very old but her own hat reflected in the hatshop window displeased her now it turned down all round and though she loved that shape she was afraid it was not fashionable this year and she looked long in the window of that shop trying to persuade herself that the hats in there would suit her and that she liked what she did not like in other shop windows she looked too it was a year since she had seen any and for thirtyfour years past she had only seen them in company with the squire or with her daughters none of whom cared much for shops  the people too were different from the people that she saw when she went about with horace or her girls almost all seemed charming having a new strange life in which shemargery pendycehad unaccountably a little part as though really she might come to know them as though they might tell her something of themselves of what they felt and thought and even might stand listening taking a kindly interest in what she said this too was strange and a friendly smile became fixed upon her face and of those who saw itshopgirls women of fashion coachmen clubmen policemenmost felt a little warmth about their hearts it was pleasant to see on the lips of that faded lady with the silvered arching hair under a hat whose brim turned down all round  so mrs pendyce came to piccadilly and turned westward towards georges club she knew it well for she never failed to look at the windows when she passed and onceon the occasion of queen victorias jubileehad spent a whole day there to see that royal show  she began to tremble as she neared it for though she did not like the squire torture her mind with what might or might not come to pass care had nested in her heart  george was not in his club and the porter could not tell her where he was mrs pendyce stood motionless he was her son how could she ask for his address the porter waited knowing a lady when he saw one mrs pendyce said gently  is there a room where i could write a note or would it be  certainly not maam i can show you to a room at once  and though it was only a mother to a son the porter preceded her with the quiet discretion of one who aids a mistress to her lover and perhaps he was right in his view of the relative values of love for he had great experience having lived long in the best society  on paper headed with the fat white stoics club so well known on georges letters mrs pendyce wrote what she had to say the little dark room where she sat was without sound save for the buzzing of a largish fly in a streak of sunlight below the blind it was dingy in colour its furniture was old at the stoics was found neither the new art nor the resplendent drapings of those larger clubs sacred to the middle classes the little writingroom had an air of mourning i am so seldom used but be at home in me you might find me tucked away in almost any countryhouse  yet many a solitary stoic had sat there and written many a note to many a woman george perhaps had written to helen bellew at that very table with that very pen and mrs pendyces heart ached jealously   dearest george she wrote  i have something very particular to tell you do come to me at greens hotel come soon my dear i shall be lonely and unhappy till i see you  your loving  margery pendyce   and this note which was just what she would have sent to a lover took that form perhaps unconsciously because she had never had a lover thus to write to  she slipped the note and half a crown diffidently into the porters hand refused his offer of some tea and walked vaguely towards the park  it was five oclock the sun was brighter than ever people in carriages and people on foot in one leisurely unending stream were filing in at hyde park corner mrs pendyce went too and timidlyshe was unused to trafficcrossed to the further side and took a chair perhaps george was in the park and she might see him perhaps helen bellew was there and she might see her and the thought of this made her heart beat and her eyes under their uplifted brows stare gently at each figureold men and young men women of the world fresh young girls how charming they looked how sweetly they were dressed a feeling of envy mingled with the joy she ever felt at seeing pretty things she was quite unconscious that she herself was pretty under that hat whose brim turned down all round but as she sat a leaden feeling slowly closed her heart varied by nervous flutterings when she saw someone whom she ought to know and whenever in response to a salute she was forced to bow her head a blush rose in her cheeks a wan smile seemed to make confession  i know i look a guy i know its odd for me to be sitting here alone  she felt oldolder than she had ever felt before in the midst of this gay crowd of all this life and sunshine a feeling of loneliness which was almost feara feeling of being utterly adrift cut off from all the worldcame over her and she felt like one of her own plants plucked up from its native earth with all its poor roots hanging bare as though groping for the earth to cling to she knew now that she had lived too long in the soil that she had hated and was too old to be transplanted the custom of the countrythat weighty wingless creature born of time and of the earthhad its limbs fast twined around her it had made of her its mistress and was not going to let her go     chapter ii  the son and the mother  harder than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle is it for a man to become a member of the stoics club except by virtue of the hereditary principle for unless he be nourished he cannot be elected and since by the clubs first rule he may have no occupation whatsoever he must be nourished by the efforts of those who have gone before and the longer they have gone before the more likely he is to receive no blackballs  yet without entering into the stoics club it is difficult for a man to attain that supreme outward control which is necessary to conceal his lack of control within and indeed the club is an admirable instance of how nature places the remedy to hand for the disease for perceiving how george pendyce and hundreds of other young men to the manner born had lived from their birth up in no connection whatever with the struggles and sufferings of life and fearing lest when life in her careless and ironical fashion brought them into abrupt contact with illbred events they should make themselves a nuisance by their cries of dismay and wonder nature had devised a mask and shaped it to its highest form within the portals of the stoics club with this mask she clothed the faces of these young men whose souls she doubted and called themgentlemen and when she and she alone heard their poor squeaks behind that mask as life placed clumsy feet on them she pitied them knowing that it was not they who were in fault but the unpruned system which had made them what they were and in her pity she endowed many of them with thick skins steady feet and complacent souls so that treading in wellworn paths their lives long they might slumber to their deaths in those halls where their fathers had slumbered to their deaths before them but sometimes nature who was not yet a socialist rustled her wings and heaved a sigh lest the excesses and excrescences of their system should bring about excesses and excrescences of the opposite sort for extravagance of all kinds was what she hated and of that particular form of extravagance which mr paramor so vulgarly called pendycitis she had a horror  it may happen that for long years the likeness between father and son will lie dormant and only when disintegrating forces threaten the links of the chain binding them together will that likeness leap forth and by a piece of natures irony become the main factor in destroying the hereditary principle for which it is the silent the most worthy excuse  it is certain that neither george nor his father knew the depth to which this pendycitis was rooted in the other neither suspected not even in themselves the amount of essential bulldog at the bottom of their souls the strength of their determination to hold their own in the way that would cause the greatest amount of unnecessary suffering they did not deliberately desire to cause unnecessary suffering they simply could not help an instinct passed by time into their fibre through atrophy of the reasoning powers and the constant mating generation after generation of those whose motto had been kings of our own dunghills and now george came forward defying his mothers belief that he was a totteridge as champion of the principle in tail male for in the totteridges from whom in this stress he diverged more and more towards his fathers line there was some freer strain something nonprovincial and this had been so ever since hubert detotteridge had led his private crusade from which he had neglected to return with the pendyces it had been otherwise from immemorial time a county family they had construed the phrase literally had taken no poetical licences like innumerable other county families they were perforce what their tradition decreedprovincial in their souls  george a manabouttown would have stared at being called provincial but a man cannot stare away his nature he was provincial enough to keep mrs bellew bound when she herself was tired of him and consideration for her and for his own selfrespect asked him to give her up he had been keeping her bound for two months or more but there was much excuse for him his heart was sore to breakingpoint he was sick with longing and deep angry wonder that he of all men should be cast aside like a wornout glove men tired of women dailythat was the law but what was this his dogged instinct had fought against the knowledge as long as he could and now that it was certain he fought against it still george was a true pendyce  to the world however he behaved as usual he came to the club about ten oclock to eat his breakfast and read the sporting papers towards noon a hansom took him to the railwaystation appropriate to whatever racemeeting was in progress or failing that to the cricketground at lords or princes tennis club halfpast six saw him mounting the staircase at the stoics to that cardroom where his effigy still hung with its look of hard work hard work but i must keep it going at eight he dined a bottle of champagne screwed deep down into ice his face flushed with the days sun his shirtfront and his hair shining with gloss what happier man in all great london  but with the dark the clubs swingdoors opened for his passage into the lighted streets and till next morning the world knew him no more it was then that he took revenge for all the hours he wore a mask he would walk the pavements for miles trying to wear himself out or in the park fling himself down on a chair in the deep shadow of the trees and sit there with his arms folded and his head bowed down on other nights he would go into some musichall and amongst the glaring lights the vulgar laughter the scent of painted women try for a moment to forget the face the laugh the scent of that woman for whom he craved and all the time he was jealous with a dumb vague jealousy of he knew not whom it was not his nature to think impersonally and he could not believe that a woman would drop him except for another man often he went to her mansions and walked round and round casting a stealthy stare at her windows twice he went up to her door but came away without ringing the bell one evening seeing a light in her sittingroom he rang but there came no answer then an evil spirit leaped up in him and he rang again and again at last he went away to his rooma studio he had taken nearand began to write to her he was long composing that letter and many times tore it up he despised the expression of feelings in writing he only tried because his heart wanted relief so badly and this in the end was all that he produced   i know you were in tonight its the only time ive come why couldnt you have let me in youve no right to treat me like this you are leading me the life of a dog  george   the first light was silvering the gloom above the river the lamps were paling to the day when george went out and dropped this missive in the letterbox he came back to the river and lay down on an empty bench under the planetrees of the embankment and while he lay there one of those without refuge or home who lie there night after night came up unseen and looked at him  but morning comes and with it that sense of the ridiculous so merciful to suffering men george got up lest anyone should see a stoic lying there in his evening clothes and when it became time he put on his mask and sallied forth at the club he found his mothers note and set out for her hotel  mrs pendyce was not yet down but sent to ask him to come up george found her standing in her dressinggown in the middle of the room as though she knew not where to place herself for this their meeting only when he was quite close did she move and throw her arms round his neck george could not see her face and his own was hidden from her but through the thin dressinggown he felt her straining to him and her arms that had pulled his head down quivering and for a moment it seemed to him as if he were dropping a burden but only for a moment for at the clinging of those arms his instinct took fright and though she was smiling the tears were in her eyes and this offended him  dont mother  mrs pendyces answer was a long look george could not bear it and turned away  well he said gruffly when you can tell me whats brought you up  mrs pendyce sat down on the sofa she had been brushing her hair though silvered it was still thick and soft and the sight of it about her shoulders struck george he had never thought of her having hair that would hang down  sitting on the sofa beside her he felt her fingers stroking his begging him not to take offence and leave her he felt her eyes trying to see his eyes and saw her lips trembling but a stubborn almost evil smile was fixed upon his face  and so dearand so she stammered i told your father that i couldnt see that done and so i came up to you  many sons have found no hardship in accepting all that their mothers do for them as a matter of right no difficulty in assuming their devotion a matter of course no trouble in leaving their own affections to be understood but most sons have found great difficulty in permitting their mothers to diverge one inch from the conventional to swerve one hairs breadth from the standard of propriety appropriate to mothers of men of their importance  it is decreed of mothers that their birth pangs shall not cease until they die  and george was shocked to hear his mother say that she had left his father to come to him it affected his selfesteem in a strange and subtle way the thought that tongues might wag about her revolted his manhood and his sense of form it seemed strange incomprehensible and wholly wrong the thought too gashed through his mind she is trying to put pressure on me  if you think ill give her up mother he said  mrs pendyces fingers tightened  no dear she answered painfully of course if she loves you so much i couldnt ask you thats why i  george gave a grim little laugh  what on earth can you do then whats the good of your coming up like this how are you to get on here all alone i can fight my own battles youd much better go back  mrs pendyce broke in  oh george i cant see you cast off from us i must be with you  george felt her trembling all over he got up and walked to the window mrs pendyces voice followed  i wont try to separate you george i promise dear i couldnt if she loves you and you love her so  again george laughed that grim little laugh and the fact that he was deceiving her meant to go on deceiving her made him as hard as iron  go back mother he said youll only make things worse this isnt a womans business let father do what he likes i can hold on  mrs pendyce did not answer and he was obliged to look round she was sitting perfectly still with her hands in her lap and his mans hatred of anything conspicuous happening to a woman to his own mother of all people took fiercer fire  go back he repeated before theres any fuss what good can you possibly do you cant leave father thats absurd you must go  mrs pendyce answered  i cant do that dear  george made an angry sound but she was so motionless and pale that he dimly perceived how she was suffering and how little he knew of her who had borne him  mrs pendyce broke the silence  but you george dear what is going to happen how are you going to manage and suddenly clasping her hands oh what is coming  those words embodying all that had been in his heart so long were too much for george he went abruptly to the door  i cant stop now he said ill come again this evening  mrs pendyce looked up  oh george  but as she had the habit of subordinating her feelings to the feelings of others she said no more but tried to smile  that smile smote george to the heart  dont worry mother try and cheer up well go to the theatre you get the tickets  and trying to smile too but turning lest he should lose his selfcontrol he went away  in the hall he came on his uncle general pendyce he came on him from behind but knew him at once by that look of feeble activity about the back of his knees by his sloping yet upright shoulders and the sound of his voice with its dry and querulous precision as of a man whose occupation has been taken from him  the general turned round  ah george he said your mothers here isnt she look at this that your fathers sent me  he held out a telegram in a shaky hand   margery up at greens hotel go and see her at once  horace   and while george read the general looked at his nephew with eyes that were ringed by little circles of darker pigment and had crowsfooted purses of skin beneath earned by serving his country in tropical climes  whats the meaning of it he said go and see her of course ill go and see her always glad to see your mother but wheres all the hurry  george perceived well enough that his fathers pride would not let him write to her and though it was for himself that his mother had taken this step he sympathised with his father the general fortunately gave him little time to answer  shes up to get herself some dresses i suppose ive seen nothing of you for a long time when are you coming to dine with me i heard at epsom that youd sold your horse what made you do that whats your father telegraphing to me like this for its not like him your mothers not ill is she  george shook his head and muttering something about sorry an engagementawful hurry was gone  left thus abruptly to himself general pendyce summoned a page slowly pencilled something on his card and with his back to the only persons in the hall waited his hands folded on the handle of his cane and while he waited he tried as far as possible to think of nothing having served his country his time now was nearly all devoted to waiting and to think fatigued and made him feel discontented for he had had sunstroke once and fever several times in the perfect precision of his collar his boots his dress his figure in the way from time to time he cleared his throat in the strange yellow driedness of his face between his carefully brushed whiskers in the immobility of his white hands on his cane he gave the impression of a man sucked dry by a system only his eyes restless and opinionated betrayed the essential pendyce that was behind  he went up to the ladies drawingroom clutching that telegram it worried him there was something odd about it and he was not accustomed to pay calls in the morning he found his sisterinlaw seated at an open window her face unusually pink her eyes rather defiantly bright she greeted him gently and general pendyce was not the man to discern what was not put under his nose fortunately for him that had never been his practice  how are you margery he said glad to see you in town hows horace look here what hes sent me he offered her the telegram with the air of slightly avenging an offence then added in surprise as though he had just thought of it is there anything i can do for you  mrs pendyce read the telegram and she too like george felt sorry for the sender  nothing thanks dear charles she said slowly im all right horace gets so nervous  general pendyce looked at her for a moment his eyes flickered then since the truth was so improbable and so utterly in any case beyond his philosophy he accepted her statement  he shouldnt go sending telegrams like this he said you might have been ill for all i could tell it spoiled my breakfast for though as a fact it had not prevented his completing a hearty meal he fancied that he felt hungry when i was quartered at halifax there was a fellow who never sent anything but telegrams telegraph jo they called him he commanded the old bluebottles you know the old bluebottles if horace is going to take to this sort of thing hed better see a specialist its almost certain to mean a breakdown youre up about dresses i see when do you come to town the seasons getting on  mrs pendyce was not afraid of her husbands brother for though punctilious and accustomed to his own way with inferiors he was hardly a man to inspire awe in his social equals it was therefore not through fear that she did not tell him the truth but through an instinct for avoiding all unnecessary suffering too strong for her and because the truth was really untellable even to herself it seemed slightly ridiculous and she knew the poor general would take it so dreadfully to heart  i dont know about coming up this season the garden is looking so beautiful and theres bees engagement the dear child is so happy  the general caressed a whisker with his white hand  ah yes he saidyoung tharp lets see hes not the eldest his brothers in my old corps what does this young fellow do with himself  mrs pendyce answered  hes only farming im afraid hell have nothing to speak of but hes a dear good boy itll be a long engagement of course theres nothing in farming and horace insists on their having a thousand a year it depends so much on mr tharp i think they could do perfectly well on seven hundred to start with dont you charles  general pendyces answer was not more conspicuously to the point than usual for he was a man who loved to pursue his own trains of thought  what about george he said i met him in the hall as i was coming in but he ran off in the very deuce of a hurry they told me at epsom that he was hard hit  his eyes distracted by a fly for which he had taken a dislike failed to observe his sisterinlaws face  hard hit she repeated  lost a lot of money that wont do you know margerythat wont do a little mild gamblings one thing  mrs pendyce said nothing her face was rigid it was the face of a woman on the point of saying do not compel me to hint that you are boring me  the general went on  a lot of new men have taken to racing that no one knows anything about that fellow who bought georges horse for instance youd never have seen his nose in tattersalls when i was a young man i find when i go racing i dont know half the colours it spoils the pleasure its no longer the close borough that it was george had better take care what hes about i cant imagine what were coming to  on margery pendyces hearing those words i cant imagine what were coming to had fallen for fourandthirty years in every sort of connection from many persons it had become part of her life indeed to take it for granted that people could imagine nothing just as the solid food and solid comfort of worsted skeynes and the misty mornings and the rain had become part of her life and it was only the fact that her nerves were on edge and her heart bursting that made those words seem intolerable that morning but habit was even now too strong and she kept silence  the general to whom an answer was of no great moment pursued his thoughts  and you mark my words margery the elections will go against us the countrys in a dangerous state  mrs pendyce said  oh do you think the liberals will really get in  from custom there was a shade of anxiety in her voice which she did not feel  think repeated general pendyce i pray every night to god they wont  folding both hands on the silver knob of his malacca cane he stared over them at the opposing wall and there was something universal in that fixed stare a sort of blank and not quite selfish apprehension behind his personal interests his ancestors had drilled into him the impossibility of imagining that he did not stand for the welfare of his country mrs pendyce who had so often seen her husband look like that leaned out of the window above the noisy street  the general rose  well he said if i cant do anything for you margery ill take myself off youre busy with your dressmakers give my love to horace and tell him not to send me another telegram like that  and bending stiffly he pressed her hand with a touch of real courtesy and kindness took up his hat and went away mrs pendyce watching him descend the stairs watching his stiff sloping shoulders his head with its grey hair brushed carefully away from the centre parting the backs of his feeble active knees put her hand to her breast and sighed for with him she seemed to see descending all her past life and that one cannot see unmoved     chapter iii  mrs bellew squares her accounts  mrs bellew sat on her bed smoothing out the halves of a letter by her side was her jewelcase taking from it an amethyst necklet an emerald pendant and a diamond ring she wrapped them in cottonwool and put them in an envelope the other jewels she dropped one by one into her lap and sat looking at them at last putting two necklets and two rings back into the jewelcase she placed the rest in a little green box and taking that and the envelope went out she called a hansom drove to a postoffice and sent a telegram   pendyce stoics club  be at studio six to sevenh   from the postoffice she drove to her jewellers and many a man who saw her pass with the flush on her cheeks and the smouldering look in her eyes as though a fire were alight within her turned in his tracks and bitterly regretted that he knew not who she was or whither going the jeweller took the jewels from the green box weighed them one by one and slowly examined each through his lens he was a little man with a yellow wrinkled face and a weak little beard and having fixed in his mind the sum that he would give he looked at his client prepared to mention less she was sitting with her elbows on the counter her chin resting in her hands and her eyes were fixed on him he decided somehow to mention the exact sum  is that all  yes madam that is the utmost  very well but i must have it now in cash  the jewellers eyes flickered  its a large sum he saidmost unusual i havent got such a sum in the place  then please send out and get it or i must go elsewhere  the jeweller brought his hands together and washed them nervously  excuse me a moment ill consult my partner  he went away and from afar he and his partner spied her nervously he came back with a forced smile mrs bellew was sitting as he had left her  its a fortunate chance i think we can just do it madam  give me notes please and a sheet of paper the jeweller brought them  mrs bellew wrote a letter enclosed it with the bank notes in the bulky envelope she had brought addressed it and sealed the whole  call a cab please  the jeweller called a cab  chelsea embankment  the cab bore her away  again in the crowded streets so full of traffic people turned to look after her the cabman who put her down at the albert bridge gazed alternately at the coins in his hands and the figure of his fare and wheeling his cab towards the stand jerked his thumb in her direction  mrs bellew walked fast down a street till turning a corner she came suddenly on a small garden with three poplartrees in a row she opened its green gate without pausing went down a path and stopped at the first of three green doors a young man with a beard resembling an artist who was standing behind the last of the three doors watched her with a knowing smile on his face she took out a latchkey put it in the lock opened the door and passed in  the sight of her face seemed to have given the artist an idea propping his door open he brought an easel and canvas and setting them so that he could see the corner where she had gone in began to sketch  an old stone fountain with three stone frogs stood in the garden near that corner and beyond it was a flowering currantbush and beyond this again the green door on which a slanting gleam of sunlight fell he worked for an hour then put his easel back and went out to get his tea  mrs bellew came out soon after he was gone she closed the door behind her and stood still taking from her pocket the bulky envelope she slipped it into the letterbox then bending down picked up a twig and placed it in the slit to prevent the lid falling with a rattle having done this she swept her hands down her face and breast as though to brush something from her and walked away beyond the outer gate she turned to the left and took the same street back to the river she walked slowly luxuriously looking about her once or twice she stopped and drew a deep breath as though she could not have enough of the air she went as far as the embankment and stood leaning her elbows on the parapet between the finger and thumb of one hand she held a small object on which the sun was shining it was a key slowly luxuriously she stretched her hand out over the water parted her thumb and finger and let it fall     chapter iv  mrs pendyces inspiration  but george did not come to take his mother to the theatre and she whose day had been passed in looking forward to the evening passed that evening in a drawingroom full of furniture whose history she did not know and a diningroom full of people eating in twos and threes and fours at whom she might look but to whom she must not speak to whom she did not even want to speak so soon had the wheel of life rolled over her wonder and her expectation leaving it lifeless in her breast and all that night with one short interval of sleep she ate of bitter isolation and futility and of the still more bitter knowledge george does not want me im no good to him  her heart seeking consolation went back again and again to the time when he had wanted her but it was far to go to the days of holland suits when all those things that he desiredslices of pineapple bensons old carriagewhip the daily reading out of tom browns schooldays the rub with elliman when he sprained his little ankle the tuckup in bedwere in her power alone to give  this night she saw with fatal clearness that since he went to school he had never wanted her at all she had tried so many years to believe that he did till it had become part of her life as it was part of her life to say her prayers night and morning and now she found it was all pretence but lying awake she still tried to believe it because to that she had been bound when she brought him firstborn into the world her other son her daughters she loved them too but it was not the same thing quite she had never wanted them to want her because that part of her had been given once for all to george  the street noises died down at last she had slept two hours when they began again she lay listening and the noises and her thoughts became tangled in her exhausted brainone great web of weariness a feeling that it was all senseless and unnecessary the emanation of crosspurposes and crossgrainedness the negation of that gentle moderation her own most sacred instinct and an early wasp attracted by the sweet perfumes of her dressingtable roused himself from the corner where he had spent the night and began to hum and hover over the bed mrs pendyce was a little afraid of wasps so taking a moment when he was otherwise engaged she stole out and fanned him with her nightdresscase till perceiving her to be a lady he went away lying down again she thought people will worry them until they sting and then kill them its so unreasonable not knowing that she was putting all her thoughts on suffering in a single nutshell  she breakfasted upstairs unsolaced by any news from george then with no definite hope but a sort of inner certainty she formed the resolution to call on mrs bellew she determined however first to visit mr paramor and having but a hazy notion of the hour when men begin to work she did not dare to start till past eleven and told her cabman to drive her slowly he drove her therefore faster than his wont in leicester square the passage of a personage between two stations blocked the traffic and on the footways were gathered a crowd of simple folk with much in their hearts and little in their stomachs who raised a cheer as the personage passed mrs pendyce looked eagerly from her cab for she too loved a show  the crowd dispersed and the cab went on  it was the first time she had ever found herself in the business apartment of any professional man less important than a dentist from the little waitingroom where they handed her the times which she could not read from excitement she caught sight of rooms lined to the ceilings with leather books and black tin boxes initialed in white to indicate the brand and of young men seated behind lumps of paper that had been written on she heard a perpetual clicking noise which roused her interest and smelled a peculiar odour of leather and disinfectant which impressed her disagreeably a youth with reddish hair and a pen in his hand passed through and looked at her with a curious stare immediately averted she suddenly felt sorry for him and all those other young men behind the lumps of paper and the thought went flashing through her mind i suppose its all because people cant agree  she was shown in to mr paramor at last in his large empty room with its air of past grandeur she sat gazing at three la france roses in a tumbler of water with the feeling that she would never be able to begin  mr paramors eyebrows which jutted from his clean brown face like little clumps of pothooks were irongrey and irongrey his hair brushed back from his high forehead mrs pendyce wondered why he looked five years younger than horace who was his junior and ten years younger than charles who of course was younger still his eyes which from irongrey some inner process of spiritual manufacture had made into steel colour looked young too although they were grave and the smile which twisted up the corners of his mouth looked very young  well he said its a great pleasure to see you  mrs pendyce could only answer with a smile  mr paramor put the roses to his nose  not so good as yours he said are they but the best i can do  mrs pendyce blushed with pleasure  my garden is looking so beautiful then remembering that she no longer had a garden she stopped but remembering also that though she had lost her garden mr paramor still had his she added quickly and yours mr paramorim sure it must be looking lovely  mr paramor drew out a kind of dagger with which he had stabbed some papers to his desk and took a letter from the bundle  yes he said its looking very nice youd like to see this i expect  bellew v bellew and pendyce was written at the top mrs pendyce stared at those words as though fascinated by their beauty it was long before she got beyond them for the first time the full horror of these matters pierced the kindly armour that lies between mortals and what they do not like to think of two men and a woman wrangling fighting tearing each other before the eyes of all the world a woman and two men stripped of charity and gentleness of moderation and sympathystripped of all that made life decent and lovable squabbling like savages before the eyes of all the world two men and one of them her son and between them a woman whom both of them had loved bellew v bellew and pendyce and this would go down to fame in company with the pitiful stories she had read from time to time with a sort of offended interest in company with snooks v snooks and stiles horaday v horaday bethany v bethany and sweetenham in company with all those cases where everybody seemed so dreadful yet where she had often and often felt so sorry as if these poor creatures had been fastened in the stocks by some malignant loutish spirit for all that would to come and jeer at and horror filled her heart it was all so mean and gross and common  the letter contained but a few words from a firm of solicitors confirming an appointment she looked up at mr paramor he stopped pencilling on his blottingpaper and said at once  i shall be seeing these people myself tomorrow afternoon i shall do my best to make them see reason  she felt from his eyes that he knew what she was suffering and was even suffering with her  and ifif they wont  then i shall go on a different tack altogether and they must look out for themselves  mrs pendyce sank back in her chair she seemed to smell again that smell of leather and disinfectant and hear a sound of incessant clicking she felt faint and to disguise that faintness asked at random what does without prejudice in this letter mean  mr paramor smiled  thats an expression we always use he said it means that when we give a thing away we reserve to ourselves the right of taking it back again  mrs pendyce who did not understand murmured  i see but what have they given away  paramor put his elbows on the desk and lightly pressed his fingertips together  well he said properly speaking in a matter like this the other side and i are cat and dog  we are supposed to know nothing about each other and to want to know less so that when we do each other a courtesy we are obliged to save our faces by saying we dont really do you one dyou understand  again mrs pendyce murmured  i see  it sounds a little provincial but we lawyers exist by reason of provincialism if people were once to begin making allowances for each other i dont know where we should be  mrs pendyces eyes fell again on those words bellew v bellew and pendyce and again as though fascinated by their beauty rested there  but you wanted to see me about something else too perhaps said mr paramor  a sudden panic came over her  oh no thank you i just wanted to know what had been done ive come up on purpose to see george you told me that i  mr paramor hastened to her aid  yes yes quite rightquite right  horace hasnt come with me  good  he and george sometimes dont quite  hit it off theyre too much alike  do you think so i never saw  not in face not in face but theyve both got  mr paramors meaning was lost in a smile and mrs pendyce who did not know that the word pendycitis was on the tip of his tongue smiled vaguely too  george is very determined she said do you thinkoh do you think mr paramor that you will be able to persuade captain bellews solicitors  mr paramor threw himself back in his chair and his hand covered what he had written on his blottingpaper  yes he said slowlyoh yes yes  but mrs pendyce had had her answer she had meant to speak of her visit to helen bellew but now her thought was  he wont persuade them i feel it let me get away  again she seemed to hear the incessant clicking to smell leather and disinfectant to see those words bellew v bellew and pendyce  she held out her hand  mr paramor took it in his own and looked at the floor  goodbye he saidgoodbye whats your addressgreens hotel ill come and tell you what i do i knowi know  mrs pendyce on whom those words i knowi know had a strange emotionalising effect as though no one had ever known before went away with quivering lips in her life no one had ever knownnot indeed that she could or would complain of such a trifle but the fact remained and at this moment oddly she thought of her husband and wondered what he was doing and felt sorry for him  but mr paramor went back to his seat and stared at what he had written on his blotting paper it ran thus       we stand on our petty rights here      and our potty dignity there      we make no allowance for others      they make no allowance for us      we catch hold of them by the ear      they grab hold of us by the hair      the result is a bit of a muddle      that ends in a bit of a fuss  he saw that it neither rhymed nor scanned and with a grave face he tore it up  again mrs pendyce told her cabman to drive slowly and again he drove her faster than usual yet that drive to chelsea seemed to last for ever and interminable were the turnings which the cabman took each one shorter than the last as if he had resolved to see how much his horses mouth could bear  poor thing thought mrs pendyce its mouth must be so sore and its quite unnecessary she put her hand up through the trap please take me in a straight line i dont like corners  the cabman obeyed it worried him terribly to take one corner instead of the six he had purposed on his way and when she asked him his fare he charged her a shilling extra for the distance he had saved by going straight mrs pendyce paid it knowing no better and gave him sixpence over thinking it might benefit the horse and the cabman touching his hat said  thank you my lady for to say my lady was his principle when he received eighteen pence above his fare  mrs pendyce stood quite a minute on the pavement stroking the horses nose and thinking  i must go in its silly to come all this way and not go in  but her heart beat so that she could hardly swallow  at last she rang  mrs bellew was seated on the sofa in her little drawingroom whistling to a canary in the open window in the affairs of men there is an irony constant and deep mingled with the very springs of life the expectations of mrs pendyce those timid apprehensions of this meeting which had racked her all the way were lamentably unfulfilled she had rehearsed the scene ever since it came into her head the reality seemed unfamiliar she felt no nervousness and no hostility only a sort of painful interest and admiration and how could this or any other woman help falling in love with george  the first uncertain minute over mrs bellews eyes were as friendly as if she had been quite within her rights in all she had done and mrs pendyce could not help meeting friendliness halfway  dont be angry with me for coming george doesnt know i felt i must come to see you do you think that you two quite know all youre doing it seems so dreadful and its not only yourselves is it  mrs bellews smile vanished  please dont say you two she said  mrs pendyce stammered  i dont understand  mrs bellew looked her in the face and smiled and as she smiled she seemed to become a little coarser  well i think its quite time you did i dont love your son i did once but i dont now i told him so yesterday once for all  mrs pendyce heard those words which made so vast so wonderful a differencewords which should have been like water in a wildernesswith a sort of horror and all her spirit flamed up into her eyes  you dont love him she cried  she felt only a blind sense of insult and affront  this woman tire of george tire of her son she looked at mrs bellew on whose face was a kind of inquisitive compassion with eyes that had never before held hatred  you have tired of him you have given him up then the sooner i go to him the better give me the address of his rooms please  helen bellew knelt down at the bureau and wrote on an envelope and the grace of the woman pierced mrs pendyce to the heart  she took the paper she had never learned the art of abuse and no words could express what was in her heart so she turned and went out  mrs bellews voice sounded quick and fierce behind her  how could i help getting tired i am not you now go  mrs pendyce wrenched open the outer door descending the stairs she felt for the bannister she had that awful sense of physical soreness and shrinking which violence whether their own or others brings to gentle souls     chapter v  the mother and the son  to mrs pendyce chelsea was an unknown land and to find her way to georges rooms would have taken her long had she been by nature what she was by name for pendyces never asked their way to anything or believed what they were told but found out for themselves with much unnecessary trouble of which they afterwards complained  a policeman first and then a young man with a beard resembling an artist guided her footsteps the latter who was leaning by a gate opened it  in here he said the door in the corner on the right  mrs pendyce walked down the little path past the ruined fountain with its three stone frogs and stood by the first green door and waited and while she waited she struggled between fear and joy for now that she was away from mrs bellew she no longer felt a sense of insult it was the actual sight of her that had aroused it so personal is even the most gentle heart  she found the rusty handle of a bell amongst the creeperleaves and pulled it a cracked metallic tinkle answered her but no one came only a faint sound as of someone pacing to and fro then in the street beyond the outer gate a coster began calling to the sky and in the music of his prayers the sound was lost the young man with a beard resembling an artist came down the path  perhaps you could tell me sir if my son is out  ive not seen him go out and ive been painting here all the morning  mrs pendyce looked with wonder at an easel which stood outside another door a little further on it seemed to her strange that her son should live in such a place  shall i knock for you said the artist all these knockers are stiff  if you would be so kind  the artist knocked  he must be in he said i havent taken my eyes off his door because ive been painting it  mrs pendyce gazed at the door  i cant get it said the artist its worrying me to death  mrs pendyce looked at him doubtfully  has he no servant she said  oh no said the artist its a studio the lights all wrong i wonder if you would mind standing just as you are for one second it would help me a lot  he moved back and curved his hand over his eyes and through mrs pendyce there passed a shiver  why doesnt george open the door she thought whatwhat is this man doing  the artist dropped his hand  thanks so much he said ill knock again there that would raise the dead  and he laughed  an unreasoning terror seized on mrs pendyce  oh she stammered i must get ini must get in  she took the knocker herself and fluttered it against the door  you see said the artist theyre all alike these knockers are as stiff as pokers  he again curved his hand over his eyes mrs pendyce leaned against the door her knees were trembling violently  what is happening she thought perhaps hes only asleep perhapsoh god  she beat the knocker with all her force the door yielded and in the space stood george choking back a sob mrs pendyce went in he banged the door behind her  for a full minute she did not speak possessed still by that strange terror and by a sort of shame she did not even look at her son but cast timid glances round his room she saw a gallery at the far end and a conical roof half made of glass she saw curtains hanging all the gallery length a table with teathings and decanters a round iron stove rugs on the floor and a large fulllength mirror in the centre of the wall a silver cup of flowers was reflected in that mirror mrs pendyce saw that they were dead and the sense of their vague and nauseating odour was her first definite sensation  your flowers are dead my darling she said i must get you some fresh  not till then did she look at george there were circles under his eyes his face was yellow it seemed to her that it had shrunk this terrified her and she thought  i must show nothing i must keep my head  she was afraidafraid of something desperate in his face of something desperate and headlong and she was afraid of his stubbornness the dumb unthinking stubbornness that holds to what has been because it has been that holds to its own when its own is dead she had so little of this quality herself that she could not divine where it might lead him but she had lived in the midst of it all her married life and it seemed natural that her son should be in danger from it now  her terror called up her selfpossession she drew george down on the sofa by her side and the thought flashed through her how many times has he not sat here with that woman in his arms  you didnt come for me last night dear i got the tickets such good ones  george smiled  no he said i had something else to see to  at sight of that smile margery pendyces heart beat till she felt sick but she too smiled  what a nice place you have here darling  theres room to walk about  mrs pendyce remembered the sound she had heard of pacing to and fro from his not asking her how she had found out where he lived she knew that he must have guessed where she had been that there was nothing for either of them to tell the other and though this was a relief it added to her terrorthe terror of that which is desperate all sorts of images passed through her mind she saw george back in her bedroom after his first run with the hounds his chubby cheek scratched from forehead to jaw and the bloodstained pad of a cub fox in his little gloved hand she saw him sauntering into her room the last day of the 1880 match at lords with a battered tophat a blackened eye and a cane with a lightblue tassel she saw him deadly pale with tightened lips that afternoon after he had escaped from her half cured of laryngitis and stolen out shooting by himself and she remembered his words well mother i couldnt stand it any longer it was too beastly slow  suppose he could not stand it now suppose he should do something rash she took out her handkerchief  its very hot in here dear your forehead is quite wet  she saw his eyes turn on her suspiciously and all her womans wit stole into her own eyes so that they did not flicker but looked at him with matteroffact concern  that skylight is what does it he said the sun gets full on there  mrs pendyce looked at the skylight  it seems odd to see you here dear but its very niceso unconventional you must let me put away those poor flowers she went to the silver cup and bent over them my dear boy theyre quite nasty do throw them outside somewhere its so dreadful the smell of old flowers  she held the cup out covering her nose with her handkerchief  george took the cup and like a cat spying a mouse mrs pendyce watched him take it out into the garden as the door closed quicker more noiseless than a cat she slipped behind the curtains  i know he has a pistol she thought  she was back in an instant gliding round the room hunting with her eyes and hands but she saw nothing and her heart lightened for she was terrified of all such things  its only these terrible first hours she thought  when george came back she was standing where he had left her they sat down in silence and in that silence the longest of her life she seemed to feel all that was in his heart all the blackness and bitter aching the rage of defeat and starved possession the lost delight the sensation of ashes and disgust and yet her heart was full enough already of relief and shame compassion jealousy love and deep longing only twice was the silence broken once when he asked her whether she had lunched and she who had eaten nothing all day answered  yes dearyes  once when he said  you shouldnt have come here mother im a bit out of sorts  she watched his face dearest to her in all the world bent towards the floor and she so yearned to hold it to her breast that since she dared not the tears stole up and silently rolled down her cheeks the stillness in that room chosen for remoteness was like the stillness of a tomb and as in a tomb there was no outlook on the world for the glass of the skylight was opaque  that deathly stillness settled round her heart her eyes fixed themselves on the skylight as though beseeching it to break and let in sound a cat making a pilgrimage from roof to roof the four dark moving spots of its paws the faint blur of its body was all she saw and suddenly unable to bear it any longer she cried  oh george speak to me dont put me away from you like this  george answered  what do you want me to say mother  nothingonly  and falling on her knees beside her son she pulled his head down against her breast and stayed rocking herself to and fro silently shifting closer till she could feel his head lie comfortably so she had his face against her heart and she could not bear to let it go her knees hurt her on the boarded floor her back and all her body ached but not for worlds would she relax an inch believing that she could comfort him with her pain and her tears fell on his neck when at last he drew his face away she sank down on the floor and could not rise but her fingers felt that the bosom of her dress was wet he said hoarsely  its all right mother you neednt worry  for no reward would she have looked at him just then but with a deeper certainty than reason she knew that he was safe  stealthily on the sloping skylight the cat retraced her steps its four paws dark moving spots its body a faint blur  mrs pendyce rose  i wont stay now darling may i use your glass  standing before that mirror smoothing back her hair passing her handkerchief over her cheeks and eyes and lips she thought  that woman has stood here that woman has smoothed her hair looking in this glass and wiped his kisses from her cheeks may god give to her the pain that she has given to my son  but when she had wished that wish she shivered  she turned to george at the door with a smile that seemed to say  its no good to weep or try and tell you what is in my heart and so you see im smiling please smile too so as to comfort me a little  george put a small paper parcel in her hand and tried to smile  mrs pendyce went quickly out bewildered by the sunlight she did not look at this parcel till she was beyond the outer gate it contained an amethyst necklace an emerald pendant and a diamond ring in the little grey street that led to this garden with its poplars old fountain and green gate the jewels glowed and sparkled as though all light and life had settled there mrs pendyce who loved colour and glowing things saw that they were beautiful  that woman had taken them used their light and colour and then flung them back she wrapped them again in the paper tied the string and went towards the river she did not hurry but walked with her eyes steadily before her she crossed the embankment and stood leaning on the parapet with her hands over the grey water her thumb and fingers unclosed the white parcel dropped floated a second and then disappeared  mrs pendyce looked round her with a start  a young man with a beard whose face was familiar was raising his hat  so your son was in he said im very glad i must thank you again for standing to me just that minute it made all the difference it was the relation between the figure and the door that i wanted to get goodmorning  mrs pendyce murmured goodmorning following him with startled eyes as though he had caught her in the commission of a crime she had a vision of those jewels buried poor things in the grey slime a prey to gloom and robbed for ever of their light and colour and as though she had sinned wronged the gentle essence of her nature she hurried away     chapter vi  gregory looks at the sky  gregory vigil called mr paramor a pessimist it was because like other people he did not know the meaning of the term for with a confusion common to the minds of many persons who have been conceived in misty moments he thought that to see things as they were meant to try and make them worse gregory had his own way of seeing things that was very dear to himso dear that he would shut his eyes sooner than see them any other way and since things to him were not the same as things to mr paramor it cannot after all be said that he did not see things as they were but dirt upon a face that he wished to be clean he could not seea fluid in his blue eyes dissolved that dirt while the image of the face was passing on to their retinae the process was unconscious and has been called idealism this was why the longer he reflected the more agonisedly certain he became that his ward was right to be faithful to the man she loved right to join her life to his and he went about pressing the blade of this thought into his soul  about four oclock on the day of mrs pendyces visit to the studio a letter was brought him by a pageboy   greens hotel  thursday  dear grig  i have seen helen bellew and have just come from george we have all been living in a bad dream she does not love himperhaps has never loved him i do not know i do not wish to judge she has given him up i will not trust myself to say anything about that from beginning to end it all seems so unnecessary such a needless crossgrained muddle i write this line to tell you how things really are and to beg you if you have a moment to spare to look in at georges club this evening and let me know if he is there and how he seems there is no one else that i could possibly ask to do this for me forgive me if this letter pains you  your affectionate cousin  margery pendyce   to those with the single eye the narrow personal view of all things human by whom the irony underlying the affairs of men is unseen and unenjoyed whose simple hearts afford that irony its most precious smiles who vanquished by that irony remain invincibleto these no blow of fate no reversal of their ideas can long retain importance the darts stick quaver and fall off like arrows from chainarmour and the last dart slipping upwards under the harness quivers into the heart to the cry of whatyou no no i dont believe youre here  such as these have done much of what has had to be done in this old world and perhaps still more of what has had to be undone  when gregory received this letter he was working on the case of a woman with the morphia habit he put it into his pocket and went on working it was all he was capable of doing  here is the memorandum mrs shortman let them take her for six weeks she will come out a different woman  mrs shortman supporting her thin face in her thin hand rested her glowing eyes on gregory  im afraid she has lost all moral sense she said do you know mr vigil im almost afraid she never had any  what do you mean  mrs shortman turned her eyes away  im sometimes tempted to think she said that there are such people i wonder whether we allow enough for that when i was a girl in the country i remember the daughter of our vicar a very pretty creature there were dreadful stories about her even before she was married and then we heard she was divorced she came up to london and earned her own living by playing the piano until she married again i wont tell you her name but she is very well known and nobody has ever seen her show the slightest signs of being ashamed if there is one woman like that there may be dozens and i sometimes think we waste  gregory said dryly  i have heard you say that before  mrs shortman bit her lips  i dont think she said that i grudge my efforts or my time  gregory went quickly up and took her hand  i know thatoh i know that he said with feeling  the sound of miss mallow furiously typing rose suddenly from the corner gregory removed his hat from the peg on which it hung  i must go now he said goodnight  without warning as is the way with hearts his heart had begun to bleed and he felt that he must be in the open air he took no omnibus or cab but strode along with all his might trying to think trying to understand but he could only feelconfused and battered feelings with now and then odd throbs of pleasure of which he was ashamed whether he knew it or not he was making his way to chelsea for though a mans eyes may be fixed on the stars his feet cannot take him there and chelsea seemed to them the best alternative he was not alone upon this journey for many another man was going there and many a man had been and was coming now away and the streets were the one long streaming crowd of the summer afternoon and the men he met looked at gregory and gregory looked at them and neither saw the other for so it is written of men lest they pay attention to cares that are not their own the sun that scorched his face fell on their backs the breeze that cooled his back blew on their cheeks for the careless world too was on its way along the pavement of the universe one of millions going to chelsea meeting millions coming away  mrs bellew at home  he went into a room fifteen feet square and perhaps ten high with a sulky canary in a small gilt cage an upright piano with an open operatic score a sofa with piledup cushions and on it a woman with a flushed and sullen face whose elbows were resting on her knees whose chin was resting on her hand whose gaze was fixed on nothing it was a room of that size with all these things but gregory took into it with him some thing that made it all seem different to gregory he sat down by the window with his eyes carefully averted and spoke in soft tones broken by something that sounded like emotion he began by telling her of his woman with the morphia habit and then he told her that he knew everything when he had said this he looked out of the window where builders had left by inadvertence a narrow strip of sky and thus he avoided seeing the look on her face contemptuous impatient as though she were thinking you are a good fellow gregory but for heavens sake do see things for once as they are i have had enough of it and he avoided seeing her stretch her arms out and spread the fingers as an angry cat will stretch and spread its toes he told her that he did not want to worry her but that when she wanted him for anything she must send for himhe was always there and he looked at her feet so that he did not see her lip curl he told her that she would always be the same to him and he asked her to believe that he did not see the smile which never left her lips again while he was therethe smile he could not read because it was the smile of life and of a woman that he did not understand but he did see on that sofa a beautiful creature for whom he had longed for years and so he went away and left her standing at the door with her teeth fastened on her lip and since with him gregory took his eyes he did not see her reseated on the sofa just as she had been before he came in her elbows on her knees her chin in her hand her moody eyes like those of a gambler staring into the distance  in the streets of tall houses leading away from chelsea were many men some like gregory hungry for love and some hungry for breadmen in twos and threes in crowds or by themselves some with their eyes on the ground some with their eyes level some with their eyes on the sky but all with courage and loyalty of one poor kind or another in their hearts for by courage and loyalty alone it is written that man shall live whether he goes to chelsea or whether he comes away of all these men not one but would have smiled to hear gregory saying to himself she will always be the same to me she will always be the same to me and not one that would have grinned  it was getting on for the stoics dinner hour when gregory found himself in piccadilly and stoic after stoic they were getting out of cabs and passing the club doors the poor fellows had been working hard all day on the racecourse the cricketground at hurlingham or in the park some had been to the royal academy and on their faces was a pleasant look ah god is goodwe can rest at last and many of them had had no lunch hoping to keep their weights down and many who had lunched had not done themselves as well as might be hoped and some had done themselves too well but in all their hearts the trust burned bright that they might do themselves better at dinner for their god was good and dwelt between the kitchen and the cellar of the stoics club and allfor all had poetry in their soulslooked forward to those hours in paradise when with cigars between their lips good wine below they might dream the daily dream that comes to all true stoics for about fifteen shillings or even less all told  from a little back slum within two stones throw of the god of the stoics club there had come out two seamstresses to take the air one was in consumption having neglected to earn enough to feed herself properly for some years past and the other looked as if she would be in consumption shortly for the same reason they stood on the pavement watching the cabs drive up some of the stoics saw them and thought poor girls they look awfully bad three or four said to themselves it oughtnt to be allowed i mean its so painful to see and its not as if one could do anything theyre not beggars dont you know and so what can one do  but most of the stoics did not look at them at all feeling that their soft hearts could not stand these painful sights and anxious not to spoil their dinners gregory did not see them either for it so happened that he was looking at the sky and just then the two girls crossed the road and were lost among the passersby for they were not dogs who could smell out the kind of man he was  mr pendyce is in the club i will send your name up sir and rolling a little as though gregorys name were heavy the porter gave it to the boy who went away with it  gregory stood by the empty hearth and waited and while he waited nothing struck him at all for the stoics seemed very natural just mere men like himself except that their clothes were better which made him think i shouldnt care to belong here and have to dress for dinner every night  mr pendyce is very sorry sir but hes engaged  gregory bit his lip said thank you and went away  thats all margery wants he thought the rest is nothing to me and getting on a bus he fixed his eyes once more on the sky  but george was not engaged like a wounded animal taking its hurt for refuge to its lair he sat in his favourite window overlooking piccadilly he sat there as though youth had left him unmoving never lifting his eyes in his stubborn mind a wheel seemed turning grinding out his memories to the last grain and stoics who could not bear to see a man sit thus throughout that sacred hour came up from time to time  arent you going to dine pendyce  dumb brutes tell no one of their pains the law is silence so with george and as each stoic came up he only set his teeth and said  presently old chap     chapter vii  tour with the spaniel john  now the spaniel johnwhose habit was to smell of heather and baked biscuits when he rose from a nights sleepwas in disgrace that thursday into his long and narrow head it took time for any new idea to enter and not till forty hours after mrs pendyce had gone did he recognise fully that something definite had happened to his master during the agitated minutes that this conviction took in forming he worked hard taking two and a half brace of his masters shoes and slippers and placing them in unaccustomed spots he lay on them one by one till they were warm then left them for some bird or other to hatch out and returned to mr pendyces door it was for all this that the squire said john several times and threatened him with a razorstrop and partly because he could not bear to leave his master for a single secondthe scolding had made him love him soand partly because of that new idea which let him have no peace he lay in the hall waiting  having once in his hot youth inadvertently followed the squires horse he could never be induced to follow it again he both personally disliked this needlessly large and swift form of animal and suspected it of designs upon his master for when the creature had taken his master up there was not a smell of him left anywherenot a whiff of that pleasant scent that so endeared him to the heart as soon therefore as the horse appeared the spaniel john would lie down on his stomach with his forepaws close to his nose and his nose close to the ground nor until the animal vanished could he be induced to abandon an attitude in which he resembled a couching sphinx  but this afternoon with his tail down his lips pouting his shoulders making heavy work of it his nose lifted in deprecation of that ridiculous and unnecessary plane on which his master sat he followed at a measured distance in suchwise aforetime the village had followed the squire and mr barter when they introduced into it its one and only drain  mr pendyce rode slowly his feet in their wellblacked boots his nervous legs in bedford cord and mahoganycoloured leggings moved in rhyme to the horses trot a longtailed coat fell clean and full over his thighs his back and shoulders were a wee bit bent to lessen motion and above his neat white stock under a grey bowler hat his lean greywhiskered and moustachioed face with harassed eyes was preoccupied and sad his horse a brown blood mare ambled lazily head raking forward and bang tail floating outward from her hocks and so in the june sunshine they went all three along the leafy lane to worsted scotton  on tuesday the day that mrs pendyce had left the squire had come in later than usual for he felt that after their difference of the night before a little coolness would do her no harm the first hour of discovery had been as one confused and angry minute ending in a burst of nerves and the telegram to general pendyce he took the telegram himself returning from the village with his head down a sudden prey to a feeling of shamean odd and terrible feeling that he never remembered to have felt before a sort of fear of his fellowcreatures he would have chosen a secret way but there was none only the highroad or the path across the village green and through the churchyard to his paddocks an old cottager was standing at the turnstile and the squire made for him with his head down as a bull makes for a fence he had meant to pass in silence but between him and this old broken husbandman there was a bond forged by the ages had it meant death mr pendyce could not have passed one whose fathers had toiled for his fathers eaten his fathers bread died with his fathers without a word and a movement of his hand  evenin squire nice evenin faine weather fur th hay  the voice was warped and wavery  this is my squire it seemed to say whatever ther be agin him  mr pendyces hand went up to his hat  evenin hermon aye fine weather for the hay mrs pendyce has gone up to london we young bachelors ha  he passed on  not until he had gone some way did he perceive why he had made that announcement it was simply because he must tell everyone everyone then no one could be astonished  he hurried on to the house to dress in time for dinner and show all that nothing was amiss seven courses would have been served him had the sky fallen but he ate little and drank more claret than was his wont after dinner he sat in his study with the windows open and in the mingled day and lamp light read his wifes letter over again as it was with the spaniel john so with his mastera new idea penetrated but slowly into his long and narrow head  she was cracked about george she did not know what she was doing would soon come to her senses it was not for him to take any steps what steps indeed could he take without confessing that horace pendyce had gone too far that horace pendyce was in the wrong that had never been his habit and he could not alter now if she and george chose to be stubborn they must take the consequences and fend for themselves  in the silence and the lamplight growing mellower each minute under the green silk shade he sat confusedly thinking of the past and in that dumb reverie as though of fixed malice there came to him no memories that were not pleasant no images that were not fair he tried to think of her unkindly he tried to paint her black but with the perversity born into the world when he was born to die when he was dead she came to him softly like the ghost of gentleness to haunt his fancy she came to him smelling of sweet scents with a slight rustling of silk and the sound of her expectant voice saying yes dear as though she were not bored he remembered when he brought her first to worsted skeynes thirtyfour years ago that timid and like a rose but a lady every hinch the love as his old nurse had said  he remembered her when george was born like wax for whiteness and transparency with eyes that were all pupils and a hovering smile so many other times he remembered her throughout those years but never as a woman faded old never as a woman of the past now that he had not got her for the first time mr pendyce realised that she had not grown old that she was still to him timid and like a rose but a lady every hinch the love and he could not bear this thought it made him feel so miserable and lonely in the lamplight with the grey moths hovering round and the spaniel john asleep upon his foot  so taking his candle he went up to bed the doors that barred away the servants wing were closed in all that great remaining space of house his was the only candle the only sounding footstep slowly he mounted as he had mounted many thousand times but never once like this and behind him like a shadow mounted the spaniel john  and she that knows the hearts of men and dogs the mother from whom all things come to whom they all go home was watching and presently when they were laid the one in his deserted bed the other on blue linen propped against the door she gathered them to sleep  but wednesday came and with it wednesday duties they who have passed the windows of the stoics club and seen the stoics sitting there have haunting visions of the idle landed classes these visions will not let them sleep will not let their tongues to cease from bitterness for they so long to lead that idle life themselves but though in a misty land illusions be our cherished lot that we may all think falsely of our neighbours and enjoy ourselves the word idle is not at all the word  many and heavy tasks weighed on the squire at worsted skeynes there was the visit to the stables to decide as to firing beldames hock or selling the new bay horse because he did not draw men fast enough and the vexed question of bruggans oats or beals talked out with benson in a leather belt and flannel shirtsleeves like a corpulent whitewhiskered boy then the long sitting in the study with memorandums and accounts all needing care lest soandso should give too little for too little or too little for too much and the smart walk across to jarvis the head keeper to ask after the health of the new hungarian bird or discuss a scheme whereby in the last drive so many of those creatures he had nurtured from their youth up might be deterred from flying over to his friend lord quarryman and this took long for jarviss feelings forced him to say six times well mr pendyce sir what i say is we didnt oughter lose smany birds in that last drive and mr pendyce to answer no jarvis certainly not well what do you suggest and that other grievous questionhow to get plenty of pheasants and plenty of foxes to dwell together in perfect harmonydiscussed with endless sympathy for as the squire would say jarvis is quite safe with foxes he could not bear his covers to be drawn blank  then back to a sparing lunch or perhaps no lunch at all that he might keep fit and hard and out again at once on horseback or on foot to the home farm or further as need might take him and a long afternoon with eyes fixed on the ribs of bullocks the colour of swedes the surfaces of walls or gates or fences  then home again to tea and to the times which had as yet received but fleeting glances with close attention to all those parliamentary measures threatening remotely the existing state of things except of course that future tax on wheat so needful to the betterment of worsted skeynes there were occasions too when they brought him tramps to deal with to whom his one remark would be hold out your hands my man which being found unwarped by honest toil were promptly sent to gaol when found so warped mr pendyce was at a loss and would walk up and down earnestly trying to discover what his duty was to them there were days too almost entirely occupied by sessions when many classes of offenders came before him to whom he meted justice according to the heinousness of the offence from poaching at the top down and down to wifebeating at the bottom for though a humane man tradition did not suffer him to look on this form of sport as really criminalat any rate not in the country  it was true that all these matters could have been settled in a fraction of the time by a young and trained intelligence but this would have wronged tradition disturbed the squires settled conviction that he was doing his duty and given cause for slanderous tongues to hint at idleness and though further it was true that all this daily labour was devoted directly or indirectly to interests of his own what was that but doing his duty to the country and asserting the prerogative of every englishman at all costs to be provincial  but on this wednesday the flavour of the dish was gone to be alone amongst his acres quite aloneto have no one to care whether he did anything at all no one to whom he might confide that beldames hock was to be fired that peacock was asking for more gates was almost more than he could bear he would have wired to the girls to come home but he could not bring himself to face their questions gerald was at gib georgegeorge was no son of hisand his pride forbade him to write to her who had left him thus to solitude and shame for deep down below his stubborn anger it was shame that the squire feltshame that he should have to shun his neighbours lest they should ask him questions which for his own good name and his own pride he must answer with a lie shame that he should not be master in his own housestill more shame that anyone should see that he was not to be sure he did not know that he felt shame being unused to introspection having always kept it at arms length for he always meditated concretely as for instance when he looked up and did not see his wife at breakfast but saw bester making coffee he thought that fellow knows all about it i shouldnt wonder and he felt angry for thinking that when he saw mr barter coming down the drive he thought confound it i cant meet him and slipped out and felt angry that he had thus avoided him when in the scotch garden he came on jackman syringing the rosetrees he said to him your mistress has gone to london and abruptly turned away angry that he had been obliged by a mysterious impulse to tell him that  so it was all through that long sad day and the only thing that gave him comfort was to score through in the draft of his will bequests to his eldest son and busy himself over drafting a clause to take their place  forasmuch as my eldest son george hubert has by conduct unbecoming to a gentleman and a pendyce proved himself unworthy of my confidence and forasmuch as to my regret i am unable to cut the entail of my estate i hereby declare that he shall in no way participate in any division of my other property or of my personal effects conscientiously believing that it is my duty so to do in the interests of my family and of the country and i make this declaration without anger  for all the anger that he was balked of feeling against his wife because he missed her so was added to that already felt against his son  by the last post came a letter from general pendyce he opened it with fingers as shaky as his brothers writing   army and navy club  dear horace  what the deuce and all made you send that telegram it spoiled my breakfast and sent me off in a tearing hurry to find margery perfectly well if shed been seedy or anything i should have been delighted but there she was busy about her dresses and what not and i dare say she thought me a lunatic for coming at that time in the morning you shouldnt get into the habit of sending telegrams a telegram is a thing that means somethingat least ive always thought so i met george coming away from her in a deuce of a hurry i cant write any more now im just going to have my lunch  your affectionate brother  charles pendyce   she was well she had been seeing george with a hardened heart the squire went up to bed  and wednesday came to an end  and so on the thursday afternoon the brown blood mare carried mr pendyce along the lane followed by the spaniel john they passed the firs where bellew lived and bending sharply to the right began to mount towards the common and with them mounted the image of that fellow who was at the bottom of it allan image that ever haunted the squires mind nowadays a ghost highshouldered with little burning eyes clipped red moustaches thin bowed legs a plague spot on that system which he loved a whippingpost to heredity a scourge like attila the hun a sort of damnable caricature of all that a country gentleman should beof his love of sport and open air of his hardness and his pluck of his powers of knowing his own mind and taking his liquor like a man of his creed now out of date of gallantry yesa kind of cursed bogey of a man a spectral follower of the hounds a desperate charactera man that in old days someone would have shot a drinking whitefaced devil who despised horace pendyce whom horace pendyce hated yet could not quite despise always one like that in a hunting country a black dog on the shoulders of his order post equitem sedet jaspar bellew  the squire came out on the top of the rise and all worsted scotton was in sight it was a sandy stretch of broom and gorse and heather with a few scotch firs it had no value at all and he longed for it as a boy might long for the bite someone else had snatched out of his apple it distressed him lying there his and yet not his like a wife who was no wifeas though fortune were enjoying her at his expense thus was he deprived of the fulness of his mental image for as with all men so with the squire that which he loved and owned took definite forma some thing that he saw whenever the words worsted skeynes were in his mindand that was almost alwaysthere rose before him an image defined and concrete however indescribable and what ever this image was he knew that worsted scotton spoiled it it was true that he could not think of any use to which to put the common but he felt deeply that it was pure doginthemangerism of the cottagers and this he could not stand not one beast in two years had fattened on its barrenness three old donkeys alone eked out the remnants of their days a bundle of firewood or old bracken a few peat sods from one especial corner were all the selfish peasants gathered but the cottagers were no great matterhe could soon have settled them it was that fellow peacock whom he could not settle just because he happened to abut on the common and his fathers had been nasty before him mr pendyce rode round looking at the fence his father had put up until he came to the portion that peacocks father had pulled down and here by a strange fatalitysuch as will happen even in printed recordshe came on peacock himself standing in the gap as though he had foreseen this visit of the squires the mare stopped of her own accord the spaniel john at a measured distance lay down to think and all those yards away he could be heard doing it and now and then swallowing his tongue  peacock stood with his hands in his breeches pockets an old straw hat was on his head his little eyes were turned towards the ground and his cob which he had tied to what his father had left standing of the fence had his eyes too turned towards the ground for he was eating grass mr pendyces fight with his burning stable had stuck in the farmers gizzard ever since he felt that he was forgetting it day by daywould soon forget it altogether he felt the old sacred doubts inherited from his fathers rising every hour within him and so he had come up to see what looking at the gap would do for his sense of gratitude at sight of the squire his little eyes turned here and there as a pigs eyes turn when it receives a blow behind that mr pendyce should have chosen this moment to come up was as though providence that knoweth all things knew the natural thing for mr pendyce to do  afternoon squire dry weather rains badly wanted ill get no feed if this goes on  mr pendyce answered  afternoon peacock why your fields are firstrate for grass  they hastily turned their eyes away for at that moment they could not bear to see each other  there was a silence then peacock said  what about those gates of mine squire and his voice quavered as though gratitude might yet get the better of him  the squires irritable glance swept over the unfenced space to right and left and the thought flashed through his mind  suppose i were to give the beggar those gates would hewould he let me enclose the scotton again  he looked at that square bearded man and the infallible instinct christened so wickedly by mr paramor guided him  whats wrong with your gates man i should like to know  peacock looked at him full this time there was no longer any quaver in his voice but a sort of rough goodhumour  wy the arf o thems as rotten as matchwood he said and he took a breath of relief for he knew that gratitude was dead within his soul  well i wish mine at the home farm were half as good come john and touching the mare with his heel mr pendyce turned but before he had gone a dozen paces he was back  mrs peacock well i hope mrs pendyce has gone up to london  and touching his hat without waiting for peacocks answer he rode away he took the lane past peacocks farm across the home paddocks emerging on the cricketground a field of his own which he had caused to be converted  the return match with coldingham was going on and motionless on his horse the squire stopped to watch a tall figure in the long field came leisurely towards him it was the hon geoffrey winlow mr pendyce subdued an impulse to turn the mare and ride away  were going to give you a licking squire hows mrs pendyce my wife sent her love  on the squires face in the full sun was more than the suns flush  thanks he said shes very well shes gone up to london  and arent you going up yourself this season  the squire crossed those leisurely eyes with his own  i dont think so he said slowly  the hon geoffrey returned to his duties  we got poor old barter for a blob he said over his shoulder  the squire became aware that mr barter was approaching from behind  you see that lefthand fellow he said pouting just watch his foot dyou mean to say that wasnt a noball he bowled me with a noball hes a rank nobatter that fellow lockes no more an umpire than  he stopped and looked earnestly at the bowler  the squire did not answer sitting on his mare as though carved in stone suddenly his throat clicked  hows your wife he said margery would have come to see her butbut shes gone up to london  the rector did not turn his head  my wife oh going on firstrate theres another i say winlow this is too bad  the hon geoffreys pleasant voice was heard  please not to speak to the man at the wheel  the squire turned the mare and rode away and the spaniel john who had been watching from a measured distance followed after his tongue lolling from his mouth  the squire turned through a gate down the main aisle of the home covert and the nose and the tail of the spaniel john who scented creatures to the left and right were in perpetual motion it was cool in there the june foliage made one long colonnade broken by a winding river of sky among the oaks and hazels the beeches and the elms the ghostly body of a birchtree shone here and there captured by those grosser trees which seemed to cluster round her proud of their prisoner loth to let her go that subtle spirit of their wood they knew that were she gone their forest lady wilder and yet gentler than themselvesthey would lose credit lose the grace and essence of their corporate being  the squire dismounted tethered his horse and sat under one of those birchtrees on the fallen body of an elm the spaniel john also sat and loved him with his eyes and sitting there they thought their thoughts but their thoughts were different  for under this birchtree horace pendyce had stood and kissed his wife the very day he brought her home to worsted skeynes and though he did not see the parallel between her and the birchtree that some poor imaginative creature might have drawn yet was he thinking of that long past afternoon but the spaniel john was not thinking of it his recollection was too dim for he had been at that time twentyeight years short of being born  mr pendyce sat there long with his horse and with his dog and from out the blackness of the spaniel john who was more than less asleep there shone at times an eye turned on his master like some devoted star the sun shining too gilded the stem of the birchtree the birds and beasts began their evening stir all through the undergrowth and rabbits popping out into the ride looked with surprise at the spaniel john and popped in back again they knew that men with horses had no guns but could not bring themselves to trust that black and hairy thing whose nose so twitched whenever they appeared the gnats came out to dance and at their dancing every sound and scent and shape became the sounds and scents and shapes of evening and there was evening in the squires heart  slowly and stiffly he got up from the log and mounted to ride home it would be just as lonely when he got there but a house is better than a wood where the gnats dance the birds and creatures stir and stir and shadows lengthen where the sun steals upwards on the treestems and all is careless of its owner man  it was past seven oclock when he went to his study there was a lady standing at the window and mr pendyce said  i beg your pardon  the lady turned it was his wife the squire stopped with a hoarse sound and stood silent covering his eyes with his hand     chapter viii  acute attack of pendycitis  mrs pendyce felt very faint when she hurried away from chelsea she had passed through hours of great emotion and eaten nothing  like sunset clouds or the colours in motheropearl so it is written shall be the moods of meninterwoven as the threads of an embroidery less certain than an april day yet with a rhythm of their own that never fails and no one can quite scan  a single cup of tea on her way home and her spirit revived it seemed suddenly as if there had been a great ado about nothing as if someone had known how stupid men could be and been playing a fantasia on that stupidity but this gaiety of spirit soon died away confronted by the problem of what she should do next  she reached her hotel without making a decision she sat down in the readingroom to write to gregory and while she sat there with her pen in her hand a dreadful temptation came over her to say bitter things to him because by not seeing people as they were he had brought all this upon them but she had so little practice in saying bitter things that she could not think of any that were nice enough and in the end she was obliged to leave them out after finishing and sending off the note she felt better and it came to her suddenly that if she packed at once there was just time to catch the 555 to worsted skeynes  as in leaving her home so in returning she followed her instinct and her instinct told her to avoid unnecessary fuss and suffering  the decrepit station fly mouldy and smelling of stables bore her almost lovingly towards the hall its old driver cleanfaced cheery somewhat like a bird drove her almost furiously for though he knew nothing he felt that two whole days and half a day were quite long enough for her to be away at the lodge gate old roy the skye was seated on his haunches and the sight of him set mrs pendyce trembling as though till then she had not realised that she was coming home  home the long narrow lane without a turning the mists and stillness the driving rain and hot bright afternoons the scents of wood smoke and hay and the scent of her flowers the squires voice the dry rattle of grasscutters the barking of dogs and distant hum of threshing and sunday soundschurch bells and rooks and mr barters preaching the tastes too of the very dishes and all these scents and sounds and tastes and the feel of the air to her cheeks seemed to have been for ever in the past and to be going on for ever in the time to come  she turned red and white by turns and felt neither joy nor sadness for in a wave the old life came over her she went at once to the study to wait for her husband to come in at the hoarse sound he made her heart beat fast while old roy and the spaniel john growled gently at each other  john she murmured arent you glad to see me dear  the spaniel john without moving beat his tail against his masters foot  the squire raised his head at last  well margery was all he said  it shot through her mind that he looked older and very tired  the dinnergong began to sound and as though attracted by its long monotonous beating a swallow flew in at one of the narrow windows and fluttered round the room mrs pendyces eyes followed its flight  the squire stepped forward suddenly and took her hand  dont run away from me again margery he said and stooping down he kissed it  at this action so unlike her husband mrs pendyce blushed like a girl her eyes above his grey and closecropped head seemed grateful that he did not reproach her glad of that caress  i have some news to tell you horace helen bellew has given george up  the squire dropped her hand  and quite time too he said i dare say george has refused to take his dismissal hes as obstinate as a mule  i found him in a dreadful state  mr pendyce asked uneasily  what whats that  he looked so desperate  desperate said the squire with a sort of startled anger  mrs pendyce went on  it was dreadful to see his face i was with him this afternoon  the squire said suddenly  hes not ill is he  no not ill oh horace dont you understand i was afraid he might do something rash he was somiserable  the squire began to walk up and down  is he is he safe now he burst out  mrs pendyce sat down rather suddenly in the nearest chair  yes she said with difficulty ii think so  think whats the good of that whatare you feeling faint margery  mrs pendyce who had closed her eyes said  no dear its all right  mr pendyce came close and since air and quiet were essential to her at that moment he bent over and tried by every means in his power to rouse her and she who longed to be let alone sympathised with him for she knew that it was natural that he should do this in spite of his efforts the feeling of faintness passed and taking his hand she stroked it gratefully  what is to be done now horace  done cried the squire good god how should i know here you are in this state all because of that dd fellow bellew and his dd wife what you want is some dinner  so saying he put his arm around her and half leading half carrying took her to her room  they did not talk much at dinner and of indifferent things of mrs barter peacock the roses and beldames hock only once they came too near to that which instinct told them to avoid for the squire said suddenly  i suppose you saw that woman  and mrs pendyce murmured  yes  she soon went to her room and had barely got into bed when he appeared saying as though ashamed  im very early  she lay awake and every now and then the squire would ask her are you asleep margery hoping that she might have dropped off for he himself could not sleep and she knew that he meant to be nice to her and she knew too that as he lay awake turning from side to side he was thinking like herself whats to be done next and that his fancy too was haunted by a ghost highshouldered with little burning eyes red hair and white freckled face for save that george was miserable nothing was altered and the cloud of vengeance still hung over worsted skeynes like some weary lesson she rehearsed her thoughts now horace can answer that letter of captain bellows can tell him that george will notindeed cannotsee her again he must answer it but will he  she groped after the secret springs of her husbands character turning and turning and trying to understand that she might know the best way of approaching him and she could not feel sure for behind all the little outside points of his nature that she thought so funny yet could comprehend there was something which seemed to her as unknown as impenetrable as the dark a sort of thickness of soul a sort of hardness a sort of barbaricwhat and as when in working at her embroidery the point of her needle would often come to a stop against stiff buckram so now was the point of her soul brought to a stop against the soul of her husband perhaps she thought horace feels like that with me she need not so have thought for the squire never worked embroideries nor did the needle of his soul make voyages of discovery  by lunchtime the next day she had not dared to say a word if i say nothing she thought he may write it of his own accord  without attracting his attention therefore she watched every movement of his morning she saw him sitting at his bureau with a creased and crumpled letter and knew it was bellews and she hovered about coming softly in and out doing little things here and there and in the hall outside but the squire gave no sign motionless as the spaniel john couched along the ground with his nose between his paws  after lunch she could bear it no longer  what do you think ought to be done now horace  the squire looked at her fixedly  if you imagine he said at last that ill have anything to do with that fellow bellew youre very much mistaken  mrs pendyce was arranging a vase of flowers and her hand shook so that some of the water was spilled over the cloth she took out her handkerchief and dabbed it up  you never answered his letter dear she said  the squire put his back against the sideboard his stiff figure with lean neck and angry eyes whose pupils were mere pinpoints had a certain dignity  nothing shall induce me he said and his voice was harsh and strong as though he spoke for something bigger than himself ive thought it over all the morning and im dd if i do the man is a ruffian i wont knuckle under to him  mrs pendyce clasped her hands  oh horace she said but for the sake of us all only just give him that assurance  and let him crow over me cried the squire by jove no  but horace i thought that was what you wanted george to do you wrote to him and asked him to promise  the squire answered  you know nothing about it margery you know nothing about me dyou think im going to tell him that his wife has thrown my son overlet him keep me gasping like a fish all this time and then get the best of it in the end not if i have to leave the countynot if i  but as though he had imagined the most bitter fate of all he stopped  mrs pendyce putting her hands on the lapels of his coat stood with her head bent the colour had gushed into her cheeks her eyes were bright with tears and there came from her in her emotion a warmth and fragrance a charm as though she were again young like the portrait under which they stood  not if i ask you horace  the squires face was suffused with dusky colour he clenched his hands and seemed to sway and hesitate  no margery he said hoarsely itsitsi cant  and breaking away from her he left the room  mrs pendyce looked after him her fingers from which he had torn his coat began twining the one with the other     chapter ix  bellew bows to a lady  there was silence at the firs and in that silent house where only five rooms were used an old manservant sat in his pantry on a wooden chair reading from an article out of rural life there was no one to disturb him for the master was asleep and the housekeeper had not yet come to cook the dinner he read slowly through spectacles engraving the words for ever on the tablets of his mind he read about the construction and habits of the owl in the tawny or brown owl there is a manubrial process the furcula far from being joined to the keel of the sternum consists of two stylets which do not even meet while the posterior margin of the sternum presents two pairs of projections with corresponding fissures between the old manservant paused resting his blinking eyes on the pale sunlight through the bars of his narrow window so that a little bird on the windowsill looked at him and instantly flew away  the old manservant read on again the pterylological characters of photodilus seem not to have been investigated but it has been found to want the tarsal loop as well as the manubrial process while its clavicles are not joined in a furcula nor do they meet the keel and the posterior margin of the sternum has processes and fissures like the tawny section again he paused and his gaze was satisfied and bland  up in the little smokingroom in a leather chair his master sat asleep in front of him were stretched his legs in dusty ridingboots his lips were closed but through a little hole at one corner came a tiny puffing sound on the floor by his side was an empty glass between his feet a spanish bulldog on a shelf above his head reposed some frayed and yellow novels with sporting titles written by persons in their inattentive moments over the chimneypiece presided the portrait of mr jorrocks persuading his horse to cross a stream  and the face of jaspar bellew asleep was the face of a man who has ridden far to get away from himself and tomorrow will have to ride far again his sandy eyebrows twitched with his dreams against the deadwhite freckled skin above high cheekbones and two hard ridges were fixed between his brows now and then over the sleeping face came the look of one riding at a gate  in the stables behind the house she who had carried him on his ride having rummaged out her last grains of corn lifted her nose and poked it through the bars of her loosebox to see what he was doing who had not carried her master that sweltering afternoon and seeing that he was awake she snorted lightly to tell him there was thunder in the air all else in the stables was deadly quiet the shrubberies around were still and in the hushed house the master slept  but on the edge of his wooden chair in the silence of his pantry the old manservant read this bird is a voracious feeder and he paused blinking his eyes and nervously puckering his lips for he had partially understood  mrs pendyce was crossing the fields she had on her prettiest frock of smokygrey crepe and she looked a little anxiously at the sky gathered in the west a coming storm was chasing the whitened sunlight against its purple the trees stood blackishgreen everything was very still not even the poplars stirred yet the purple grew with sinister unmoving speed mrs pendyce hurried grasping her skirts in both her hands and she noticed that the cattle were all grouped under the hedge  what dreadfullooking clouds she thought i wonder if i shall get to the firs before it comes but though her frock made her hasten her heart made her stand still it fluttered so and was so full suppose he were not sober she remembered those little burning eyes which had frightened her so the night he dined at worsted skeynes and fell out of his dogcart afterwards a kind of legendary malevolence clung about his image  suppose he is horrid to me she thought  she could not go back now but she wishedhow she wishedthat it were over a heatdrop splashed her glove she crossed the lane and opened the firs gate throwing frightened glances at the sky she hastened down the drive the purple was couched like a pall on the treetops and these had begun to sway and moan as though struggling and weeping at their fate some splashes of warm rain were falling a streak of lightning tore the firmament mrs pendyce rushed into the porch covering her ears with her hands  how long will it last she thought im so frightened  a very old manservant whose face was all puckers opened the door suddenly to peer out at the storm but seeing mrs pendyce he peered at her instead  is captain bellew at home  yes maam the captains in the study we dont use the drawingroom now nasty storm coming on maamnasty storm will you please to sit down a minute while i let the captain know  the hall was low and dark the whole house was low and dark and smelled a little of woodrot mrs pendyce did not sit down but stood under an arrangement of three foxes heads supporting two huntingcrops with their lashes hanging down and the heads of those animals suggested to her the thought poor man he must be very lonely here  she started something was rubbing against her knees it was only an enormous bulldog she stooped down to pat it and having once begun found it impossible to leave off for when she took her hand away the creature pressed against her and she was afraid for her frock  poor old boypoor old boy she kept on murmuring did he want a little attention  a voice behind her said  get out sam sorry to have kept you waiting wont you come in here  mrs pendyce blushing and turning pale by turns passed into a low small panelled room smelling of cigars and spirits through the window which was cut up into little panes she could see the rain driving past the shrubs bent and dripping from the downpour  wont you sit down  mrs pendyce sat down she had clasped her hands together she now raised her eyes and looked timidly at her host  she saw a thin highshouldered figure with bowed legs a little apart rumpled sandy hair a pale freckled face and little dark blinking eyes  sorry the rooms in such a mess dont often have the pleasure of seeing a lady i was asleep generally am at this time of year  the bristly red moustache was contorted as though his lips were smiling  mrs pendyce murmured vaguely  it seemed to her that nothing of this was real but all some horrid dream a clap of thunder made her cover her ears  bellew walked to the window glanced at the sky and came back to the hearth his little burning eyes seemed to look her through and through if i dont speak at once she thought i never shall speak at all  ive come she began and with those words she lost her fright her voice that had been so uncertain hitherto regained its trick of speech her eyes all pupil stared dark and gentle at this man who had them all in his powerive come to tell you something captain bellew  the figure by the hearth bowed and her fright like some evil bird came guttering down on her again it was dreadful it was barbarous that she that anyone should have to speak of such things it was barbarous that men and women should so misunderstand each other and have so little sympathy and consideration it was barbarous that she margery pendyce should have to talk on this subject that must give them both such pain it was all so mean and gross and common she took out her handkerchief and passed it over her lips  please forgive me for speaking your wife has given my son up captain bellew  bellew did not move  she does not love him she told me so herself he will never see her again  how hateful how horrible how odious  and still bellew did not speak but stood devouring her with his little eyes and how long this went on she could not tell  he turned his back suddenly and leaned against the mantelpiece  mrs pendyce passed her hand over her brow to get rid of a feeling of unreality  that is all she said  her voice sounded to herself unlike her own  if that is really all she thought i suppose i must get up and go and it flashed through her mind my poor dress will be ruined  bellew turned round  will you have some tea  mrs pendyce smiled a pale little smile  no thank you i dont think i could drink any tea  i wrote a letter to your husband  yes  he didnt answer it  no  mrs pendyce saw him staring at her and a desperate struggle began within her should she not ask him to keep his promise now that george was not that what she had come for ought she notought she not for all their sakes  bellew went up to the table poured out some whisky and drank it off  you dont ask me to stop the proceedings he said  mrs pendyces lips were parted but nothing came through those parted lips her eyes black as sloes in her white face never moved from his she made no sound  bellew dashed his hand across his brow  well i will he said for your sake theres my hand on it youre the only lady i know  he gripped her gloved fingers brushed past her and she saw that she was alone  she found her own way out with the tears running down her face very gently she shut the hall door  my poor dress she thought i wonder if i might stand here a little the rain looks nearly over  the purple cloud had passed and sunk behind the house and a bright white sky was pouring down a sparkling rain a patch of deep blue showed behind the firtrees in the drive the thrushes were out already after worms a squirrel scampering along a branch stopped and looked at mrs pendyce and mrs pendyce looked absently at the squirrel from behind the little handkerchief with which she was drying her eyes  that poor man she thought poor solitary creature theres the sun  and it seemed to her that it was the first time the sun had shone all this fine hot year gathering her dress in both hands she stepped into the drive and soon was back again in the fields  every green thing glittered and the air was so rainsweet that all the summer scents were gone before the crystal scent of nothing mrs pendyces shoes were soon wet through  how happy i am she thought how glad and happy i am  and the feeling which was not as definite as this possessed her to the exclusion of all other feelings in the rainsoaked fields  the cloud that had hung over worsted skeynes so long had spent itself and gone every sound seemed to be music every moving thing danced she longed to get to her early roses and see how the rain had treated them she had a stile to cross and when she was safely over she paused a minute to gather her skirts more firmly it was a homefield she was in now and right before her lay the country house long and low and white it stood in the glamourous evening haze with two bright panes where the sunlight fell watching like eyes the confines of its acres and behind it to the left broad square and grey among its elms the village church around above beyond was peacethe sleepy misty peace of the english afternoon  mrs pendyce walked towards her garden when she was near it away to the right she saw the squire and mr barter they were standing together looking at a tree andsymbol of a subservient underworldthe spaniel john was seated on his tail and he too was looking at the tree the faces of the rector and mr pendyce were turned up at the same angle and different as those faces and figures were in their eternal rivalry of type a sort of essential likeness struck her with a feeling of surprise it was as though a single spirit seeking for a body had met with these two shapes and becoming confused decided to inhabit both  mrs pendyce did not wave to them but passed quickly between the yewtrees through the wicketgate  in her garden bright drops were falling one by one from every roseleaf and in the petals of each rose were jewels of water a little down the path a weed caught her eye she looked closer and saw that there were several  oh she thought how dreadfully theyve let the weeds i must really speak to jackman  a rosetree that she herself had planted rustled close by letting fall a shower of drops  mrs pendyce bent down and took a white rose in her fingers with her smiling lips she kissed its face 1907
