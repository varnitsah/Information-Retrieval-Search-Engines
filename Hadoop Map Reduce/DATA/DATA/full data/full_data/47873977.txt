suddenly it seemed to her that she should not be able to wait even till churchtime for relief breakfast at waterbath was a punctual meal and she had still nearly an hour on her hands knowing the church to be near she prepared in her room for the little rural walk and on her way down again passing through corridors and observing imbecilities of decoration the æsthetic misery of the big commodious house she felt a return of the tide of last nights irritation a renewal of everything she could secretly suffer from ugliness and stupidity why did she consent to such contacts why did she so rashly expose herself she had had heaven knew her reasons but the whole experience was to be sharper than she had feared to get away from it and out into the air into the presence of sky and trees flowers and birds was a necessity of every nerve the flowers at waterbath would probably go wrong in color and the nightingales sing out of tune but she remembered to have heard the place described as possessing those advantages that are usually spoken of as natural there were advantages enough it clearly didnt possess it was hard for her to believe that a woman could look presentable who had been kept awake for hours by the wallpaper in her room yet none the less as in her fresh widows weeds she rustled across the hall she was sustained by the consciousness which always added to the unction of her social sundays that she was as usual the only person in the house incapable of wearing in her preparation the horrible stamp of the same exceptional smartness that would be conspicuous in a grocers wife she would rather have perished than have looked endimanchée  she was fortunately not challenged the hall being empty of the other women who were engaged precisely in arraying themselves to that dire end once in the grounds she recognized that with a site a view that struck the note set an example to its inmates waterbath ought to have been charming how she herself with such elements to handle would have taken the fine hint of nature suddenly at the turn of a walk she came on a member of the party a young lady seated on a bench in deep and lonely meditation she had observed the girl at dinner and afterwards she was always looking at girls with an apprehensive or speculative reference to her son deep in her heart was a conviction that owen would in spite of all her spells marry at last a frump and this from no evidence that she could have represented as adequate but simply from her deep uneasiness her belief that such a special sensibility as her own could have been inflicted on a woman only as a source of anguish it would be her fate her discipline her cross to have a frump brought hideously home to her this girl one of the two vetches had no beauty but mrs gereth scanning the dullness for a sign of life had been straightway able to classify such a figure as the least for the moment of her afflictions fleda vetch was dressed with an idea though perhaps with not much else and that made a bond when there was none other especially as in this case the idea was real not imitation mrs gereth had long ago generalized the truth that the temperament of the frump is amply consistent with a certain usual prettiness there were five girls in the party and the prettiness of this one slim pale and blackhaired was less likely than that of the others ever to occasion an exchange of platitudes the two less developed brigstocks daughters of the house were in particular tiresomely lovely a second glance this morning at the young lady before her conveyed to mrs gereth the soothing assurance that she also was guiltless of looking hot and fine they had had no talk as yet but this was a note that would effectually introduce them if the girl should show herself in the least conscious of their community she got up from her seat with a smile that but partly dissipated the prostration mrs gereth had recognized in her attitude the elder woman drew her down again and for a minute as they sat together their eyes met and sent out mutual soundings are you safe can i utter it each of them said to the other quickly recognizing almost proclaiming their common need to escape the tremendous fancy as it came to be called that mrs gereth was destined to take to fleda vetch virtually began with this discovery that the poor child had been moved to flight even more promptly than herself that the poor child no less quickly perceived how far she could now go was proved by the immense friendliness with which she instantly broke out isnt it too dreadful  horriblehorrible cried mrs gereth with a laugh and its really a comfort to be able to say it she had an idea for it was her ambition that she successfully made a secret of that awkward oddity her proneness to be rendered unhappy by the presence of the dreadful her passion for the exquisite was the cause of this but it was a passion she considered that she never advertised nor gloried in contenting herself with letting it regulate her steps and show quietly in her life remembering at all times that there are few things more soundless than a deep devotion she was therefore struck with the acuteness of the little girl who had already put a finger on her hidden spring what was dreadful now what was horrible was the intimate ugliness of waterbath and it was of that phenomenon these ladies talked while they sat in the shade and drew refreshment from the great tranquil sky from which no blue saucers were suspended it was an ugliness fundamental and systematic the result of the abnormal nature of the brigstocks from whose composition the principle of taste had been extravagantly omitted in the arrangement of their home some other principle remarkably active but uncanny and obscure had operated instead with consequences depressing to behold consequences that took the form of a universal futility the house was bad in all conscience but it might have passed if they had only let it alone this saving mercy was beyond them they had smothered it with trumpery ornament and scrapbook art with strange excrescences and bunchy draperies with gimcracks that might have been keepsakes for maidservants and nondescript conveniences that might have been prizes for the blind they had gone wildly astray over carpets and curtains they had an infallible instinct for disaster and were so cruelly doomridden that it rendered them almost tragic their drawingroom mrs gereth lowered her voice to mention caused her face to burn and each of the new friends confided to the other that in her own apartment she had given way to tears there was in the elder ladys a set of comic watercolors a family joke by a family genius and in the youngers a souvenir from some centennial or other exhibition that they shudderingly alluded to the house was perversely full of souvenirs of places even more ugly than itself and of things it would have been a pious duty to forget the worst horror was the acres of varnish something advertised and smelly with which everything was smeared it was fleda vetchs conviction that the application of it by their own hands and hilariously shoving each other was the amusement of the brigstocks on rainy days  when as criticism deepened fleda dropped the suggestion that some people would perhaps see something in mona mrs gereth caught her up with a groan of protest a smothered familiar cry of oh my dear mona was the eldest of the three the one mrs gereth most suspected she confided to her young friend that it was her suspicion that had brought her to waterbath and this was going very far for on the spot as a refuge a remedy she had clutched at the idea that something might be done with the girl before her it was her fancied exposure at any rate that had sharpened the shock made her ask herself with a terrible chill if fate could really be plotting to saddle her with a daughterinlaw brought up in such a place she had seen mona in her appropriate setting and she had seen owen handsome and heavy dangle beside her but the effect of these first hours had happily not been to darken the prospect it was clearer to her that she could never accept mona but it was after all by no means certain that owen would ask her to he had sat by somebody else at dinner and afterwards he had talked to mrs firmin who was as dreadful as all the rest but redeemingly married his heaviness which in her need of expansion she freely named had two aspects one of them his monstrous lack of taste the other his exaggerated prudence if it should come to a question of carrying mona with a high hand there would be no need to worry for that was rarely his manner of proceeding  invited by her companion who had asked if it werent wonderful mrs gereth had begun to say a word about poynton but she heard a sound of voices that made her stop short the next moment she rose to her feet and fleda could see that her alarm was by no means quenched behind the place where they had been sitting the ground dropped with a certain steepness forming a long grassy bank up which owen gereth and mona brigstock dressed for church but making a familiar joke of it were in the act of scrambling and helping each other when they had reached the even ground fleda was able to read the meaning of the exclamation in which mrs gereth had expressed her reserves on the subject of miss brigstocks personality miss brigstock had been laughing and even romping but the circumstance hadnt contributed the ghost of an expression to her countenance tall straight and fair longlimbed and strangely festooned she stood there without a look in her eye or any perceptible intention of any sort in any other feature she belonged to the type in which speech is an unaided emission of sound and the secret of being is impenetrably and incorruptibly kept her expression would probably have been beautiful if she had had one but whatever she communicated she communicated in a manner best known to herself without signs this was not the case with owen gereth who had plenty of them and all very simple and immediate robust and artless eminently natural yet perfectly correct he looked pointlessly active and pleasantly dull like his mother and like fleda vetch but not for the same reason this young pair had come out to take a turn before church  the meeting of the two couples was sensibly awkward and fleda who was sagacious took the measure of the shock inflicted on mrs gereth there had been intimacyoh yes intimacy as well as puerilityin the horseplay of which they had just had a glimpse the party began to stroll together to the house and fleda had again a sense of mrs gereths quick management in the way the lovers or whatever they were found themselves separated she strolled behind with mona the mother possessing herself of her son her exchange of remarks with whom however remained as they went suggestively inaudible that member of the party in whose intenser consciousness we shall most profitably seek a reflection of the little drama with which we are concerned received an even livelier impression of mrs gereths intervention from the fact that ten minutes later on the way to church still another pairing had been effected owen walked with fleda and it was an amusement to the girl to feel sure that this was by his mothers direction fleda had other amusements as well such as noting that mrs gereth was now with mona brigstock such as observing that she was all affability to that young woman such as reflecting that masterful and clever with a great bright spirit she was one of those who impose themselves as an influence such as feeling finally that owen gereth was absolutely beautiful and delightfully dense this young person had even from herself wonderful secrets of delicacy and pride but she came as near distinctness as in the consideration of such matters she had ever come at all in now surrendering herself to the idea that it was of a pleasant effect and rather remarkable to be stupid without offenseof a pleasanter effect and more remarkable indeed than to be clever and horrid owen gereth at any rate with his inches his features and his lapses was neither of these latter things she herself was prepared if she should ever marry to contribute all the cleverness and she liked to think that her husband would be a force grateful for direction she was in her small way a spirit of the same family as mrs gereth on that flushed and huddled sunday a great matter occurred her little life became aware of a singular quickening her meagre past fell away from her like a garment of the wrong fashion and as she came up to town on the monday what she stared at in the suburban fields from the train was a future full of the things she particularly loved     ii   these were neither more nor less than the things with which she had had time to learn from mrs gereth that poynton overflowed poynton in the south of england was this ladys established or rather her disestablished home having recently passed into the possession of her son the father of the boy an only child had died two years before and in london with his mother owen was occupying for may and june a house goodnaturedly lent them by colonel gereth their uncle and brotherinlaw his mother had laid her hand so engagingly on fleda vetch that in a very few days the girl knew it was possible they should suffer together in cadogan place almost as much as they had suffered together at waterbath the kind colonels house was also an ordeal but the two women for the ensuing month had at least the relief of their confessions the great drawback of mrs gereths situation was that thanks to the rare perfection of poynton she was condemned to wince wherever she turned she had lived for a quarter of a century in such warm closeness with the beautiful that as she frankly admitted life had become for her a kind of fools paradise she couldnt leave her own house without peril of exposure she didnt say it in so many words but fleda could see she held that there was nothing in england really to compare to poynton there were places much grander and richer but there was no such complete work of art nothing that would appeal so to those who were really informed in putting such elements into her hand fortune had given her an inestimable chance she knew how rarely well things had gone with her and that she had tasted a happiness altogether rare  there had been in the first place the exquisite old house itself early jacobean supreme in every part it was a provocation an inspiration a matchless canvas for the picture then there had been her husbands sympathy and generosity his knowledge and love their perfect accord and beautiful life together twentysix years of planning and seeking a long sunny harvest of taste and curiosity lastly she never denied there had been her personal gift the genius the passion the patience of the collectora patience an almost infernal cunning that had enabled her to do it all with a limited command of money there wouldnt have been money enough for any one else she said with pride but there had been money enough for her they had saved on lots of things in life and there were lots of things they hadnt had but they had had in every corner of europe their swing among the jews it was fascinating to poor fleda who hadnt a penny in the world nor anything nice at home and whose only treasure was her subtle mind to hear this genuine english lady fresh and fair young in the fifties declare with gayety and conviction that she was herself the greatest jew who had ever tracked a victim fleda with her mother dead hadnt so much even as a home and her nearest chance of one was that there was some appearance her sister would become engaged to a curate whose eldest brother was supposed to have property and would perhaps allow him something her father paid some of her bills but he didnt like her to live with him and she had lately in paris with several hundred other young women spent a year in a studio arming herself for the battle of life by a course with an impressionist painter she was determined to work but her impressions or somebodys else were as yet her only material mrs gereth had told her she liked her because she had an extraordinary flair but under the circumstances a flair was a questionable boon in the dry places in which she had mainly moved she could have borne a chronic catarrh she was constantly summoned to cadogan place and before the month was out was kept to stay to pay a visit of which the end it was agreed should have nothing to do with the beginning she had a sense partly exultant and partly alarmed of having quickly become necessary to her imperious friend who indeed gave a reason quite sufficient for it in telling her there was nobody else who understood from mrs gereth there was in these days an immense deal to understand though it might be freely summed up in the circumstance that she was wretched she told fleda that she couldnt completely know why till she should have seen the things at poynton fleda could perfectly grasp this connection which was exactly one of the matters that in their inner mystery were a blank to everybody else  the girl had a promise that the wonderful house should be shown her early in july when mrs gereth would return to it as to her home but even before this initiation she put her finger on the spot that in the poor ladys troubled soul ached hardest this was the misery that haunted her the dread of the inevitable surrender what fleda had to sit up to was the confirmed appearance that owen gereth would marry mona brigstock marry her in his mothers teeth and that such an act would have incalculable bearings they were present to mrs gereth her companion could see with a vividness that at moments almost ceased to be that of sanity she would have to give up poynton and give it up to a product of waterbaththat was the wrong that rankled the humiliation at which fleda would be able adequately to shudder only when she should know the place she did know waterbath and she despised itshe had that qualification for sympathy her sympathy was intelligent for she read deep into the matter she stared aghast as it came home to her for the first time at the cruel english custom of the expropriation of the lonely mother mr gereth had apparently been a very amiable man but mr gereth had left things in a way that made the girl marvel the house and its contents had been treated as a single splendid object everything was to go straight to his son and his widow was to have a maintenance and a cottage in another county no account whatever had been taken of her relation to her treasures of the passion with which she had waited for them worked for them picked them over made them worthy of each other and the house watched them loved them lived with them he appeared to have assumed that she would settle questions with her son that he could depend upon owens affection and in truth as poor mrs gereth inquired how could he possibly have had a previsionhe who turned his eyes instinctively from everything repulsiveof anything so abnormal as a waterbath brigstock he had been in ugly houses enough but had escaped that particular nightmare nothing so perverse could have been expected to happen as that the heir to the loveliest thing in england should be inspired to hand it over to a girl so exceptionally tainted mrs gereth spoke of poor monas taint as if to mention it were almost a violation of decency and a person who had listened without enlightenment would have wondered of what fault the girl had been or had indeed not been guilty but owen had from a boy never cared had never had the least pride or pleasure in his home  well then if he doesnt carefleda exclaimed with some impetuosity stopping short however before she completed her sentence  mrs gereth looked at her rather hard if he doesnt care  fleda hesitated she had not quite had a definite idea wellhell give them up  give what up  why those beautiful things  give them up to whom mrs gereth more boldly stared  to you of courseto enjoy to keep for yourself  and leave his house as bare as your hand theres nothing in it that isnt precious  fleda considered her friend had taken her up with a smothered ferocity by which she was slightly disconcerted i dont mean of course that he should surrender everything but he might let you pick out the things to which youre most attached  i think he would if he were free said mrs gereth  and do you mean as it is that shell prevent him mona brigstock between these ladies was now nothing but she  by every means in her power  but surely not because she understands and appreciates them  no mrs gereth replied but because they belong to the house and the house belongs to owen if i should wish to take anything she would simply say with that motionless mask it goes with the house and day after day in the face of every argument of every consideration of generosity she would repeat without winking in that voice like the squeeze of a dolls stomach it goes with the houseit goes with the house in that attitude theyll shut themselves up  fleda was struck was even a little startled with the way mrs gereth had turned this overhad faced if indeed only to recognize its futility the notion of a battle with her only son these words led her to make an inquiry which she had not thought it discreet to make before she brought out the idea of the possibility after all of her friends continuing to live at poynton would they really wish to proceed to extremities was no goodhumored graceful compromise to be imagined or brought about couldnt the same roof cover them was it so very inconceivable that a married son should for the rest of her days share with so charming a mother the home she had devoted more than a score of years to making beautiful for him mrs gereth hailed this question with a wan compassionate smile she replied that a common household in such a case was exactly so inconceivable that fleda had only to glance over the fair face of the english land to see how few people had ever conceived it it was always thought a wonder a mistake a piece of overstrained sentiment and she confessed that she was as little capable of a flight of that sort as owen himself even if they both had been capable they would still have monas hatred to reckon with fledas breath was sometimes taken away by the great bounds and elisions which on mrs gereths lips the course of discussion could take this was the first she had heard of monas hatred though she certainly had not needed mrs gereth to tell her that in close quarters that young lady would prove secretly mulish later fleda perceived indeed that perhaps almost any girl would hate a person who should be so markedly averse to having anything to do with her before this however in conversation with her young friend mrs gereth furnished a more vivid motive for her despair by asking how she could possibly be expected to sit there with the new proprietors and acceptor call it for a day endurethe horrors they would perpetrate in the house fleda reasoned that they wouldnt after all smash things nor burn them up and mrs gereth admitted when pushed that she didnt quite suppose they would what she meant was that they would neglect them ignore them leave them to clumsy servants there wasnt an object of them all but should be handled with perfect love and in many cases probably wish to replace them by pieces answerable to some vulgar modern notion of the convenient above all she saw in advance with dilated eyes the abominations they would inevitably mix up with themthe maddening relics of waterbath the little brackets and pink vases the sweepings of bazaars the family photographs and illuminated texts the household art and household piety of monas hideous home wasnt it enough simply to contend that mona would approach poynton in the spirit of a brigstock and that in the spirit of a brigstock she would deal with her acquisition did fleda really see her mrs gereth demanded spending the remainder of her days with such a creatures elbow in her eye  fleda had to declare that she certainly didnt and that waterbath had been a warning it would be frivolous to overlook at the same time she privately reflected that they were taking a great deal for granted and that inasmuch as to her knowledge owen gereth had positively denied his betrothal the ground of their speculations was by no means firm it seemed to our young lady that in a difficult position owen conducted himself with some natural art treating this domesticated confidant of his mothers wrongs with a simple civility that almost troubled her conscience so deeply she felt that she might have had for him the air of siding with that lady against him she wondered if he would ever know how little really she did this and that she was there since mrs gereth had insisted not to betray but essentially to confirm and protect the fact that his mother disliked mona brigstock might have made him dislike the object of her preference and it was detestable to fleda to remember that she might have appeared to him to offer herself as an exemplary contrast it was clear enough however that the happy youth had no more sense for a motive than a deaf man for a tune a limitation by which after all she could gain as well as lose he came and went very freely on the business with which london abundantly furnished him but he found time more than once to say to her its awfully nice of you to look after poor mummy as well as his quick speech which shyness made obscureit was usually as desperate as a rush at some violent gamehis childs eyes in his mans face put it to her that you know this really meant a good deal for him and that he hoped she would stay on with a person in the house who like herself was clever poor mummy was conveniently occupied and fleda found a beauty in the candor and even in the modesty which apparently kept him from suspecting that two such wiseheads could possibly be occupied with owen gereth     iii   they went at last the wiseheads down to poynton where the palpitating girl had the full revelation now do you know how i feel mrs gereth asked when in the wonderful hall three minutes after their arrival her pretty associate dropped on a seat with a soft gasp and a roll of dilated eyes the answer came clearly enough and in the rapture of that first walk through the house fleda took a prodigious span she perfectly understood how mrs gereth feltshe had understood but meagrely before and the two women embraced with tears over the tightening of their bondtears which on the younger ones part were the natural and usual sign of her submission to perfect beauty it was not the first time she had cried for the joy of admiration but it was the first time the mistress of poynton often as she had shown her house had been present at such an exhibition she exulted in it it quickened her own tears she assured her companion that such an occasion made the poor old place fresh to her again and more precious than ever yes nobody had ever that way felt what she had achieved people were so grossly ignorant and everybody even the knowing ones as they thought themselves more or less dense what mrs gereth had achieved was indeed an exquisite work and in such an art of the treasurehunter in selection and comparison refined to that point there was an element of creation of personality she had commended fledas flair and fleda now gave herself up to satiety preoccupations and scruples fell away from her she had never known a greater happiness than the week she passed in this initiation  wandering through clear chambers where the general effect made preferences almost as impossible as if they had been shocks pausing at open doors where vistas were long and bland she would even if she had not already known have discovered for herself that poynton was the record of a life it was written in great syllables of color and form the tongues of other countries and the hands of rare artists it was all france and italy with their ages composed to rest for england you looked out of old windowsit was england that was the wide embrace while outside on the low terraces she contradicted gardeners and refined on nature mrs gereth left her guest to finger fondly the brasses that louis quinze might have thumbed to sit with venetian velvets just held in a loving palm to hang over cases of enamels and pass and repass before cabinets there were not many picturesthe panels and the stuffs were themselves the picture and in all the great wainscoted house there was not an inch of pasted paper what struck fleda most in it was the high pride of her friends taste a fine arrogance a sense of style which however amused and amusing never compromised nor stooped she felt indeed as this lady had intimated to her that she would both a respect and a compassion that she had not known before the vision of the coming surrender filled her with an equal pain to give it all up to die to itthat thought ached in her breast she herself could imagine clinging there with a closeness separate from dignity to have created such a place was to have had dignity enough when there was a question of defending it the fiercest attitude was the right one after so intense a taking of possession she too was to give it up for she reflected that if mrs gereths remaining there would have offered her a sort of futurestretching away in safe years on the other side of a gulfthe advent of the others could only be by the same law a great vague menace the ruffling of a still water such were the emotions of a hungry girl whose sensibility was almost as great as her opportunities for comparison had been small the museums had done something for her but nature had done more  if owen had not come down with them nor joined them later it was because he still found london jolly yet the question remained of whether the jollity of london was not merely the only name his small vocabulary yielded for the jollity of mona brigstock there was indeed in his conduct another ambiguitysomething that required explaining so long as his motive didnt come to the surface if he was in love what was the matter and what was the matter still more if he wasnt the mystery was at last cleared up this fleda gathered from the tone in which one morning at breakfast a letter just opened made mrs gereth cry out her dismay was almost a shriek why hes bringing her downhe wants her to see the house they flew the two women into each others arms and with their heads together soon made out that the reason the baffling reason why nothing had yet happened was that mona didnt know or owen didnt whether poynton would really please her she was coming down to judge and could anything in the world be more like poor owen than the ponderous probity which had kept him from pressing her for a reply till she should have learned whether she approved what he had to offer her that was a scruple it had naturally been impossible to impute if only they might fondly hope mrs gereth wailed that the girls expectations would be dashed there was a fine consistency a sincerity quite affecting in her arguing that the better the place should happen to look and to express the conceptions to which it owed its origin the less it would speak to an intelligence so primitive how could a brigstock possibly understand what it was all about how really could a brigstock logically do anything but hate it mrs gereth even as she whisked away linen shrouds persuaded herself of the possibility on monas part of some bewildered blankness some collapse of admiration that would prove disconcerting to her swaina hope of which fleda at least could see the absurdity and which gave the measure of the poor ladys strange almost maniacal disposition to thrust in everywhere the question of things to read all behavior in the light of some fancied relation to them things were of course the sum of the world only for mrs gereth the sum of the world was rare french furniture and oriental china she could at a stretch imagine peoples not having but she couldnt imagine their not wanting and not missing  the young couple were to be accompanied by mrs brigstock and with a prevision of how fiercely they would be watched fleda became conscious before the party arrived of an amused diplomatic pity for them almost as much as mrs gereths her taste was her life but her life was somehow the larger for it besides she had another care now there was some one she wouldnt have liked to see humiliated even in the form of a young lady who would contribute to his never suspecting so much delicacy when this young lady appeared fleda tried so far as the wish to efface herself allowed to be mainly the person to take her about show her the house and cover up her ignorance owens announcement had been that as trains made it convenient they would present themselves for luncheon and depart before dinner but mrs gereth true to her system of glaring civility proposed and obtained an extension a dining and spending of the night she made her young friend wonder against what rebellion of fact she was sacrificing in advance so profusely to form fleda was appalled after the first hour by the rash innocence with which mona had accepted the responsibility of observation and indeed by the large levity with which sitting there like a bored tourist in fine scenery she exercised it she felt in her nerves the effect of such a manner on her companions and it was this that made her want to entice the girl away give her some merciful warning or some jocular cue mona met intense looks however with eyes that might have been blue beads the only ones she hadeyes into which fleda thought it strange owen gereth should have to plunge for his fate and his mother for a confession of whether poynton was a success she made no remark that helped to supply this light her impression at any rate had nothing in common with the feeling that as the beauty of the place throbbed out like music had caused fleda vetch to burst into tears she was as content to say nothing as if mrs gereth afterwards exclaimed she had been keeping her mouth shut in a railwaytunnel mrs gereth contrived at the end of an hour to convey to fleda that it was plain she was brutally ignorant but fleda more subtly discovered that her ignorance was obscurely active  she was not so stupid as not to see that something though she scarcely knew what was expected of her that she couldnt give and the only mode her intelligence suggested of meeting the expectation was to plant her big feet and pull another way mrs gereth wanted her to rise somehow or somewhere and was prepared to hate her if she didnt very well she couldnt she wouldnt rise she already moved at the altitude that suited her and was able to see that since she was exposed to the hatred she might at least enjoy the calm the smallest trouble for a girl with no nonsense about her was to earn what she incurred so that a dim instinct teaching her she would earn it best by not being effusive and combining with the conviction that she now held owen and therefore the place she had the pleasure of her honesty as well as of her security didnt her very honesty lead her to be belligerently blank about poynton inasmuch as it was just poynton that was forced upon her as a subject for effusiveness such subjects to mona brigstock had an air almost of indecency and the house became uncanny to her through such an appealan appeal that somewhere in the twilight of her being as fleda was sure she thanked heaven she was the girl stiffly to draw back from she was a person whom pressure at a given point infallibly caused to expand in the wrong place instead of as it is usually administered in the hope of doing the right one her mother to make up for this broke out universally pronounced everything most striking and was visibly happy that owens captor should be so far on the way to strike but she jarred upon mrs gereth by her formula of admiration which was that anything she looked at was in the style of something else this was to show how much she had seen but it only showed she had seen nothing everything at poynton was in the style of poynton and poor mrs brigstock who at least was determined to rise and had brought with her a trophy of her journey a ladys magazine purchased at the station a horrible thing with patterns for antimacassars which as it was quite new the first number and seemed so clever she kindly offered to leave for the house was in the style of a vulgar old woman who wore silver jewelry and tried to pass off a gross avidity as a sense of the beautiful  by the days end it was clear to fleda vetch that however mona judged the day had been determinant whether or no she felt the charm she felt the challenge at an early moment owen gereth would be able to tell his mother the worst nevertheless when the elder lady at bedtime coming in a dressinggown and a high fever to the younger ones room cried out she hates it but what will she do fleda pretended vagueness played at obscurity and assented disingenuously to the proposition that they at least had a respite the future was dark to her but there was a silken thread she could clutch in the gloomshe would never give owen away he might give himselfhe even certainly would but that was his own affair and his blunders his innocence only added to the appeal he made to her she would cover him she would protect him and beyond thinking her a cheerful inmate he would never guess her intention any more than beyond thinking her clever enough for anything his acute mother would discover it from this hour with mrs gereth there was a flaw in her frankness her admirable friend continued to know everything she did what was to remain unknown was the general motive  from the window of her room the next morning before breakfast the girl saw owen in the garden with mona who strolled beside him with a listening parasol but without a visible look for the great florid picture that had been hung there by mrs gereths hand mona kept dropping her eyes as she walked to catch the sheen of her patentleather shoes which resembled a mans and which she kicked forward a littleit gave her an odd movementto help her see what she thought of them when fleda came down mrs gereth was in the breakfastroom and at that moment owen through a long window passed in alone from the terrace and very endearingly kissed his mother it immediately struck the girl that she was in their way for hadnt he been borne on a wave of joy exactly to announce before the brigstocks departed that mona had at last faltered out the sweet word he had been waiting for he shook hands with his friendly violence but fleda contrived not to look into his face what she liked most to see in it was not the reflection of monas big boottoes she could bear well enough that young lady herself but she couldnt bear owens opinion of her she was on the point of slipping into the garden when the movement was checked by mrs gereths suddenly drawing her close as if for the morning embrace and then while she kept her there with the bravery of the nights repose breaking out well my dear boy what does your young friend there make of our odds and ends  oh she thinks theyre all right  fleda immediately guessed from his tone that he had not come in to say what she supposed there was even something in it to confirm mrs gereths belief that their danger had dropped she was sure moreover that his tribute to monas taste was a repetition of the eloquent words in which the girl had herself recorded it she could indeed hear with all vividness the pretty passage between the pair dont you think its rather jolly the old shop oh its all right mona had graciously remarked and then they had probably with a slap on a back run another race up or down a green bank fleda knew mrs gereth had not yet uttered a word to her son that would have shown him how much she feared but it was impossible to feel her friends arm round her and not become aware that this friend was now throbbing with a strange intention owens reply had scarcely been of a nature to usher in a discussion of monas sensibilities but mrs gereth went on in a moment with an innocence of which fleda could measure the cold hypocrisy has she any sort of feeling for nice old things the question was as fresh as the morning light  oh of course she likes everything thats nice and owen who constitutionally disliked questionsan answer was almost as hateful to him as a trick to a big dogsmiled kindly at fleda and conveyed that she would understand what he meant even if his mother didnt fleda however mainly understood that mrs gereth with an odd wild laugh held her so hard that she hurt her  i could give up everything without a pang i think to a person i could trust i could respect the girl heard her voice tremble under the effort to show nothing but what she wanted to show and felt the sincerity of her implication that the piety most real to her was to be on ones knees before ones high standard the best things here as you know are the things your father and i collected things all that we worked for and waited for and suffered for yes cried mrs gereth with a fine freedom of fancy there are things in the house that we almost starved for they were our religion they were our life they were us and now theyre only meexcept that theyre also you thank god a little you dear she continued suddenly inflicting on fleda a kiss apparently intended to knock her into position there isnt one of them i dont know and loveyes as one remembers and cherishes the happiest moments of ones life blindfold in the dark with the brush of a finger i could tell one from another theyre living things to me they know me they return the touch of my hand but i could let them all go since i have to so strangely to another affection another conscience theres a care they want theres a sympathy that draws out their beauty rather than make them over to a woman ignorant and vulgar i think id deface them with my own hands cant you see me fleda and wouldnt you do it yourselfshe appealed to her companion with glittering eyes i couldnt bear the thought of such a woman herei couldnt i dont know what shed do shed be sure to invent some deviltry if it should be only to bring in her own little belongings and horrors the world is full of cheap gimcracks in this awful age and theyre thrust in at one at every turn theyd be thrust in here on top of my treasures my own who would save them for mei ask you who would and she turned again to fleda with a dry strained smile her handsome highnosed excited face might have been that of don quixote tilting at a windmill drawn into the eddy of this outpouring the girl scared and embarrassed laughed off her exposure but only to feel herself more passionately caught up and as it seemed to her thrust down the fine open mouth it showed such perfect teeth with which poor owens slow cerebration gaped you would of courseonly you in all the world because you know you feel as i do myself whats good and true and pure no severity of the moral law could have taken a higher tone in this implication of the young lady who had not the only virtue mrs gereth actively esteemed you would replace me you would watch over them you would keep the place right she austerely pursued and with you hereyes with you i believe i might rest at last in my grave she threw herself on fledas neck and before fleda horribly shamed could shake her off had burst into tears which couldnt have been explained but which might perhaps have been understood     iv   a week later owen gereth came down to inform his mother that he had settled with mona brigstock but it was not at all a joy to fleda conscious how much to himself it would be a surprise that he should find her still in the house that dreadful scene before breakfast had made her position false and odious it had been followed after they were left alone by a scene of her own making with her extravagant friend she notified mrs gereth of her instant departure she couldnt possibly remain after being offered to owen that way before her very face as his mothers candidate for the honor of his hand that was all he could have seen in such an outbreak and in the indecency of her standing there to enjoy it fleda had on the prior occasion dashed out of the room by the shortest course and in her confusion had fallen upon mona in the garden she had taken an aimless turn with her and they had had some talk rendered at first difficult and almost disagreeable by monas apparent suspicion that she had been sent out to spy as mrs gereth had tried to spy into her opinions fleda was sagacious enough to treat these opinions as a mystery almost awful which had an effect so much more than reassuring that at the end of five minutes the young lady from waterbath suddenly and perversely said why has she never had a winter garden thrown out if ever i have a place of my own i mean to have one fleda dismayed could see the thingsomething glazed and piped on iron pillars with untidy plants and cane sofas a shiny excrescence on the noble face of poynton she remembered at waterbath a conservatory where she had caught a bad cold in the company of a stuffed cockatoo fastened to a tropical bough and a waterless fountain composed of shells stuck into some hardened paste she asked mona if her idea would be to make something like this conservatory to which mona replied oh no much finer we havent got a winter garden at waterbath fleda wondered if she meant to convey that it was the only grandeur they lacked and in a moment mona went on but we have got a billiardroomthat i will say for us there was no billiardroom at poynton but there would evidently be one and it would have hung on its walls framed at the stores caricatureportraits of celebrities taken from a societypaper  when the two girls had gone in to breakfast it was for fleda to see at a glance that there had been a further passage of some high color between owen and his mother and she had turned pale in guessing to what extremity at her expense mrs gereth had found occasion to proceed hadnt she after her clumsy flight been pressed upon owen in still clearer terms mrs gereth would practically have said to him if youll take her ill move away without a sound but if you take any one else any one im not sure of as i am of herheaven help me ill fight to the death breakfast this morning at poynton had been a meal singularly silent in spite of the vague little cries with which mrs brigstock turned up the underside of plates and the knowing but alarming raps administered by her big knuckles to porcelain cups some one had to respond to her and the duty assigned itself to fleda who while pretending to meet her on the ground of explanation wondered what owen thought of a girl still indelicately anxious after she had been grossly hurled at him to prove by exhibitions of her fine taste that she was really what his mother pretended this time at any rate their fate was sealed owen as soon as he should get out of the house would describe to mona that ladys extraordinary conduct and if anything more had been wanted to fetch mona as he would call it the deficiency was now made up mrs gereth in fact took care of thattook care of it by the way at the last on the threshold she said to the younger of her departing guests with an irony of which the sting was wholly in the sense not at all in the sound we havent had the talk we might have had have we youll feel that ive neglected you and youll treasure it up against me dont because really you know it has been quite an accident and ive all sorts of information at your disposal if you should come down again only you wont everi feel that i should give you plenty of time to worry it out of me indeed there are some things i should quite insist on your learning not permit you at all in any settled way not to learn yes indeed youd put me through and i should put you my dear we should have each other to reckon with and you would see me as i really am im not a bit the vague mooning easy creature i dare say you think however if you wont come you wont nen parlons plus it is stupid here after what youre accustomed to we can only all round do what we can eh for heavens sake dont let your mother forget her precious publication the female magazine with the whatdoyoucallemthe greasecatchers there  mrs gereth delivering herself from the doorstep had tossed the periodical higher in air than was absolutely needfultossed it toward the carriage the retreating party was about to enter mona from the force of habit the reflex action of the custom of sport had popped out with a little spring a long arm and intercepted the missile as easily as she would have caused a tennisball to rebound from a racket good catch owen had cried so genuinely pleased that practically no notice was taken of his mothers impressive remarks it was to the accompaniment of romping laughter as mrs gereth afterwards said that the carriage had rolled away but it was while that laughter was still in the air that fleda vetch white and terrible had turned upon her hostess with her scorching how could you great god how could you this ladys perfect blankness was from the first a sign of her serene conscience and the fact that till indoctrinated she didnt even know what fleda meant by resenting her late offense to every susceptibility gave our young woman a sore scared perception that her own value in the house was just the value as one might say of a good agent mrs gereth was generously sorry but she was still more surprisedsurprised at fledas not having liked to be shown off to owen as the right sort of wife for him why not in the name of wonder if she absolutely was the right sort she had admitted on explanation that she could see what her young friend meant by having been laid as fleda called it at his feet but it struck the girl that the admission was only made to please her and that mrs gereth was secretly surprised at her not being as happy to be sacrificed to the supremacy of a high standard as she was happy to sacrifice her she had taken a tremendous fancy to her but that was on account of the fancyto poynton of coursefleda herself had taken wasnt this latter fancy then so great after all fleda felt that she could declare it to be great indeed when really for the sake of it she could forgive what she had suffered and after reproaches and tears asseverations and kisses after learning that she was cared for only as a priestess of the altar and a view of her bruised dignity which left no alternative to flight could accept the shame with the balm consent not to depart take refuge in the thin comfort of at least knowing the truth the truth was simply that all mrs gereths scruples were on one side and that her ruling passion had in a manner despoiled her of her humanity on the second day after the tide of emotion had somewhat ebbed she said soothingly to her companion but you would after all marry him you know darling wouldnt you if that girl were not there i mean of course if he were to ask you mrs gereth had thoughtfully added  marry him if he were to ask me most distinctly not  the question had not come up with this definiteness before and mrs gereth was clearly more surprised than ever she marveled a moment not even to have poynton  not even to have poynton  but why on earth mrs gereths sad eyes were fixed on her  fleda colored she hesitated because hes too stupid save on one other occasion at which we shall in time arrive little as the reader may believe it she never came nearer to betraying to mrs gereth that she was in love with owen she found a dim amusement in reflecting that if mona had not been there and he had not been too stupid and he verily had asked her she might should she have wished to keep her secret have found it possible to pass off the motive of her action as a mere passion for poynton  mrs gereth evidently thought in these days of little but things hymeneal for she broke out with sudden rapture in the middle of the week i know what theyll do they will marry but theyll go and live at waterbath there was positive joy in that form of the idea which she embroidered and developed it seemed so much the safest thing that could happen yes ill have you but i wont go there mona would have said with a vicious nod at the southern horizon well leave your horrid mother alone there for life it would be an ideal solution this ingress the lively pair with their spiritual need of a warmer medium would playfully punch in the ribs of her ancestral home for it would not only prevent recurring panic at poyntonit would offer them as in one of their gimcrack baskets or other vessels of ugliness a definite daily felicity that poynton could never give owen might manage his estate just as he managed it now and mrs gereth would manage everything else when in the hall on the unforgettable day of his return she had heard his voice ring out like a call to a terrier she had still as fleda afterwards learned clutched frantically at the conceit that he had come at the worst to announce some compromise to tell her she would have to put up with the girl yes but that some way would be arrived at of leaving her in personal possession fleda vetch whom from the first hour no illusion had brushed with its wing now held her breath went on tiptoe wandered in outlying parts of the house and through delicate muffled rooms while the mother and son faced each other below from time to time she stopped to listen but all was so quiet she was almost frightened she had vaguely expected a sound of contention it lasted longer than she would have supposed whatever it was they were doing and when finally from a window she saw owen stroll out of the house stop and light a cigarette and then pensively lose himself in the plantations she found other matter for trepidation in the fact that mrs gereth didnt immediately come rushing up into her arms she wondered whether she oughtnt to go down to her and measured the gravity of what had occurred by the circumstance which she presently ascertained that the poor lady had retired to her room and wished not to be disturbed this admonition had been for her maid with whom fleda conferred as at the door of a deathchamber but the girl without either fatuity or resentment judged that since it could render mrs gereth indifferent even to the ministrations of disinterested attachment the scene had been tremendous  she was absent from luncheon where indeed fleda had enough to do to look owen in the face there would be so much to make that hateful in their common memory of the passage in which his last visit had terminated this had been her apprehension at least but as soon as he stood there she was constrained to wonder at the practical simplicity of the ordeala simplicity which was really just his own simplicity the particular thing that for fleda vetch some other things of course aiding made almost any direct relation with him pleasant he had neither wit nor tact nor inspiration all she could say was that when they were together the alienation these charms were usually depended on to allay didnt occur on this occasion for instance he did so much better than carry off an awkward remembrance he simply didnt have it he had clean forgotten that she was the girl his mother would have fobbed off on him he was conscious only that she was there in a manner for serviceconscious of the dumb instinct that from the first had made him regard her not as complicating his intercourse with that personage but as simplifying it fleda found beautiful that this theory should have survived the incident of the other day found exquisite that whereas she was conscious through faint reverberations that for her kind little circle at large whom it didnt concern her tendency had begun to define itself as parasitical this strong young man who had a right to judge and even a reason to loathe her didnt judge and didnt loathe let her down gently treated her as if she pleased him and in fact evidently liked her to be just where she was she asked herself what he did when mona denounced her and the only answer to the question was that perhaps mona didnt denounce her if mona was inarticulate he wasnt such a fool then to marry her that he was glad fleda was there was at any rate sufficiently shown by the domestic familiarity with which he said to her i must tell you ive been having an awful row with my mother im engaged to be married to miss brigstock  ah really cried fleda achieving a radiance of which she was secretly proud how very exciting  too exciting for poor mummy she wont hear of it she has been slating her fearfully she says shes a barbarian  why shes lovely fleda exclaimed  oh shes all right mother must come round  only give her time said fleda she had advanced to the threshold of the door thus thrown open to her and without exactly crossing it she threw in an appreciative glance she asked owen when his marriage would take place and in the light of his reply read that mrs gereths wretched attitude would have no influence at all on the event absolutely fixed when he came down and distant by only three months he liked fledas seeming to be on his side though that was a secondary matter for what really most concerned him now was the line his mother took about poynton her declared unwillingness to give it up  naturally i want my own house you know he said and my father made every arrangement for me to have it but she may make it devilish awkward what in the worlds a fellow to do this it was that owen wanted to know and there could be no better proof of his friendliness than his air of depending on fleda vetch to tell him she questioned him they spent an hour together and as he gave her the scale of the concussion from which he had rebounded she found herself saddened and frightened by the material he seemed to offer her to deal with it was devilish awkward and it was so in part because owen had no imagination it had lodged itself in that empty chamber that his mother hated the surrender because she hated mona he didnt of course understand why she hated mona but this belonged to an order of mysteries that never troubled him there were lots of things especially in peoples minds that a fellow didnt understand poor owen went through life with a frank dread of peoples minds there were explanations he would have been almost as shy of receiving as of giving there was therefore nothing that accounted for anything though in its way it was vivid enough in his picture to fleda of his mothers virtual refusal to move that was simply what it was for didnt she refuse to move when she as good as declared that she would move only with the furniture it was the furniture she wouldnt give up and what was the good of poynton without the furniture besides the furniture happened to be his just as everything else happened to be the furniturethe word on his lips had somehow for fleda the sound of washingstands and copious bedding and she could well imagine the note it might have struck for mrs gereth the girl in this interview with him spoke of the contents of the house only as the works of art it didnt however in the least matter to owen what they were called what did matter she easily guessed was that it had been laid upon him by mona been made in effect a condition of her consent that he should hold his mother to the strictest accountability for them mona had already entered upon the enjoyment of her rights she had made him feel that mrs gereth had been liberally provided for and had asked him cogently what room there would be at ricks for the innumerable treasures of the big house ricks the sweet little place offered to the mistress of poynton as the refuge of her declining years had been left to the late mr gereth a considerable time before his death by an old maternal aunt a good lady who had spent most of her life there the house had in recent times been let but it was amply furnished it contained all the defunct aunts possessions owen had lately inspected it and he communicated to fleda that he had quietly taken mona to see it it wasnt a place like poyntonwhat dowerhouse ever wasbut it was an awfully jolly little place and mona had taken a tremendous fancy to it if there were a few things at poynton that were mrs gereths peculiar property of course she must take them away with her but one of the matters that became clear to fleda was that this transfer would be immediately subject to miss brigstocks approval the special business that she herself now became aware of being charged with was that of seeing mrs gereth safely and singly off the premises  her heart failed her after owen had returned to london with the ugliness of this dutywith the ugliness indeed of the whole close conflict she saw nothing of mrs gereth that day she spent it in roaming with sick sighs in feeling as she passed from room to room that what was expected of her companion was really dreadful it would have been better never to have had such a place than to have had it and lose it it was odious to her to have to look for solutions what a strange relation between mother and son when there was no fundamental tenderness out of which a solution would irrepressibly spring was it owen who was mainly responsible for that poverty fleda couldnt think so when she remembered that so far as he was concerned mrs gereth would still have been welcome to have her seat by the poynton fire the fact that from the moment one accepted his marrying one saw no very different course for owen to take made her all the rest of that aching day find her best relief in the mercy of not having yet to face her hostess she dodged and dreamed and romanced away the time instead of inventing a remedy or a compromise instead of preparing a plan by which a scandal might be averted she gave herself in her sentient solitude up to a mere fairy tale up to the very taste of the beautiful peace with which she would have filled the air if only something might have been that could never have been     v   ill give up the house if theyll let me take what i require that on the morrow was what mrs gereths stifled night had qualified her to say with a tragic face at breakfast fleda reflected that what she required was simply every object that surrounded them the poor woman would have admitted this truth and accepted the conclusion to be drawn from it the reduction to the absurd of her attitude the exaltation of her revolt the girls dread of a scandal of spectators and critics diminished the more she saw how little vulgar avidity had to do with this rigor it was not the crude love of possession it was the need to be faithful to a trust and loyal to an idea the idea was surely noble it was that of the beauty mrs gereth had so patiently and consummately wrought pale but radiant with her back to the wall she rose there like a heroine guarding a treasure to give up the ship was to flinch from her duty there was something in her eyes that declared she would die at her post if their difference should become public the shame would be all for the others if waterbath thought it could afford to expose itself then waterbath was welcome to the folly her fanaticism gave her a new distinction and fleda perceived almost with awe that she had never carried herself so well she trod the place like a reigning queen or a proud usurper full as it was of splendid pieces it could show in these days no ornament so effective as its menaced mistress  our young ladys spirit was strangely divided she had a tenderness for owen which she deeply concealed yet it left her occasion to marvel at the way a man was made who could care in any relation for a creature like mona brigstock when he had known in any relation a creature like adela gereth with such a mother to give him the pitch how could he take it so low she wondered that she didnt despise him for this but there was something that kept her from it if there had been nothing else it would have sufficed that she really found herself from this moment the medium of communication with him  hell come back to assert himself mrs gereth had said and the following week owen in fact reappeared he might merely have written fleda could see but he had come in person because it was at once nicer for his mother and stronger for his cause he didnt like the row though mona probably did if he hadnt a sense of beauty he had after all a sense of justice but it was inevitable he should clearly announce at poynton the date at which he must look to find the house vacant you dont think im rough or hard do you he asked of fleda his impatience shining in his idle eyes as the dininghour shines in clubwindows the place at ricks stands there with open arms and then i give her lots of time tell her she can remove everything that belongs to her fleda recognized the elements of what the newspapers call a deadlock in the circumstance that nothing at poynton belonged to mrs gereth either more or less than anything else she must either take everything or nothing and the girls suggestion was that it might perhaps be an inspiration to do the latter and begin again on a clean page what however was the poor woman in that case to begin with what was she to do at all on her meagre income but make the best of the objets dart of ricks the treasures collected by mr gereths maiden aunt she had never been near the place for long years it had been let to strangers and after that the foreboding that it would be her doom had kept her from the abasement of it she had felt that she should see it soon enough but fleda who was careful not to betray to her that mona had seen it and had been gratified knew her reasons for believing that the maiden aunts principles had had much in common with the principles of waterbath the only thing in short that she would ever have to do with the objets dart of ricks would be to turn them out into the road what belonged to her at poynton as owen said would conveniently mitigate the void resulting from that demonstration  the exchange of observations between the friends had grown very direct by the time fleda asked mrs gereth whether she literally meant to shut herself up and stand a siege or whether it was her idea to expose herself more informally to be dragged out of the house by constables oh i prefer the constables and the dragging the heroine of poynton had answered i want to make owen and mona do everything that will be most publicly odious she gave it out that it was her one thought now to force them to a line that would dishonor them and dishonor the tradition they embodied though fleda was privately sure that she had visions of an alternative policy the strange thing was that proud and fastidious all her life she now showed so little distaste for the worlds hearing of the squabble what had taken place in her above all was that a long resentment had ripened she hated the effacement to which english usage reduced the widowed mother she had discoursed of it passionately to fleda contrasted it with the beautiful homage paid in other countries to women in that position women no better than herself whom she had seen acclaimed and enthroned whom she had known and envied made in short as little as possible a secret of the injury the bitterness she found in it the great wrong owen had done her was not his taking up with monathat was disgusting but it was a detail an accidental form it was his failure from the first to understand what it was to have a mother at all to appreciate the beauty and sanctity of the character she was just his mother as his nose was just his nose and he had never had the least imagination or tenderness or gallantry about her ones mother gracious heaven if one were the kind of fine young man one ought to be the only kind mrs gereth cared for was a subject for poetry for idolatry hadnt she often told fleda of her friend madame de jaume the wittiest of women but a small black crooked person each of whose three boys when absent wrote to her every day of their lives she had the house in paris she had the house in poitou she had more than in the lifetime of her husband to whom in spite of her appearance she had afforded repeated cause for jealousy because she had to the end of her days the supreme word about everything it was easy to see that mrs gereth would have given again and again her complexion her figure and even perhaps the spotless virtue she had still more successfully retained to have been the consecrated madame de jaume she wasnt alas and this was what she had at present a magnificent occasion to protest against she was of course fully aware of owens concession his willingness to let her take away with her the few things she liked best but as yet she only declared that to meet him on this ground would be to give him a triumph to put him impossibly in the right liked best there wasnt a thing in the house that she didnt like best and what she liked better still was to be left where she was how could owen use such an expression without being conscious of his hypocrisy mrs gereth whose criticism was often gay dilated with sardonic humor on the happy look a dozen objects from poynton would wear and the charming effect they would conduce to when interspersed with the peculiar features of ricks what had her whole life been but an effort toward completeness and perfection better waterbath at once in its cynical unity than the ignominy of such a mixture  all this was of no great help to fleda in so far as fleda tried to rise to her mission of finding a way out when at the end of a fortnight owen came down once more it was ostensibly to tackle a farmer whose proceedings had been irregular the girl was sure however that he had really come on the instance of mona to see what his mother was doing he wished to satisfy himself that she was preparing her departure and he wished to perform a duty distinct but not less imperative in regard to the question of the perquisites with which she would retreat the tension between them was now such that he had to perpetrate these offenses without meeting his adversary mrs gereth was as willing as himself that he should address to fleda vetch whatever cruel remarks he might have to make she only pitied her poor young friend for repeated encounters with a person as to whom she perfectly understood the girls repulsion fleda thought it nice of owen not to have expected her to write to him he wouldnt have wished any more than herself that she should have the air of spying on his mother in his interest what made it comfortable to deal with him in this more familiar way was the sense that she understood so perfectly how poor mrs gereth suffered and that she measured so adequately the sacrifice the other side did take rather monstrously for granted she understood equally how owen himself suffered now that mona had already begun to make him do things he didnt like vividly fleda apprehended how she would have first made him like anything she would have made him do anything even as disagreeable as this appearing there to state virtually on monas behalf that of course there must be a definite limit to the number of articles appropriated she took a longish stroll with him in order to talk the matter over to say if she didnt think a dozen pieces chosen absolutely at will would be a handsome allowance and above all to consider the very delicate question of whether the advantage enjoyed by mrs gereth mightnt be left to her honor to leave it so was what owen wished but there was plainly a young lady at waterbath to whom on his side he already had to render an account he was as touching in his offhand annoyance as his mother was tragic in her intensity for if he couldnt help having a sense of propriety about the whole matter so he could as little help hating it it was for his hating it fleda reasoned that she liked him so and her insistence to his mother on the hatred perilously resembled on one or two occasions a revelation of the liking there were moments when in conscience that revelation pressed her inasmuch as it was just on the ground of her not liking him that mrs gereth trusted her so much mrs gereth herself didnt in these days like him at all and she was of course and always on mrs gereths side he ended really while the preparations for his marriage went on by quite a little custom of coming and going but on no one of these occasions would his mother receive him he talked only with fleda and strolled with fleda and when he asked her in regard to the great matter if mrs gereth were really doing nothing the girl usually replied she pretends not to be if i may say so but i think shes really thinking over what shell take when her friend asked her what owen was doing she could have but one answer hes waiting dear lady to see what you do  mrs gereth a month after she had received her great shock did something abrupt and extraordinary she caught up her companion and went to have a look at ricks they had come to london first and taken a train from liverpool street and the least of the sufferings they were armed against was that of passing the night fledas admirable dressingbag had been given her by her friend why its charming she exclaimed a few hours later turning back again into the small prim parlor from a friendly advance to the single plate of the window mrs gereth hated such windows the one flat glass sliding up and down especially when they enjoyed a view of four iron pots on pedestals painted white and containing ugly geraniums ranged on the edge of a gravelpath and doing their best to give it the air of a terrace fleda had instantly averted her eyes from these ornaments but mrs gereth grimly gazed wondering of course how a place in the deepest depths of essex and three miles from a small station could contrive to look so suburban the room was practically a shallow box with the junction of the walls and ceiling guiltless of curve or cornice and marked merely by the little band of crimson paper glued round the top of the other paper a turbid gray sprigged with silver flowers this decoration was rather new and quite fresh and there was in the centre of the ceiling a big square beam papered over in white as to which fleda hesitated about venturing to remark that it was rather picturesque she recognized in time that this remark would be weak and that throughout she should be able to say nothing either for the mantelpieces or for the doors of which she saw her companion become sensible with a soundless moan on the subject of doors especially mrs gereth had the finest views the thing in the world she most despised was the meanness of the single flap from end to end at poynton there were high double leaves at ricks the entrances to the rooms were like the holes of rabbithutches  it was all none the less not so bad as fleda had feared it was faded and melancholy whereas there had been a danger that it would be contradictious and positive cheerful and loud the house was crowded with objects of which the aggregation somehow made a thinness and the futility a grace things that told her they had been gathered as slowly and as lovingly as the golden flowers of poynton she too for a home could have lived with them they made her fond of the old maidenaunt they made her even wonder if it didnt work more for happiness not to have tasted as she herself had done of knowledge without resources without a stick as she said of her own fleda was moved after all to some secret surprise at the pretensions of a shipwrecked woman who could hold such an asylum cheap the more she looked about the surer she felt of the character of the maidenaunt the sense of whose dim presence urged her to pacification the maidenaunt had been a dear she would have adored the maidenaunt the poor lady had had some tender little story she had been sensitive and ignorant and exquisite that too was a sort of origin a sort of atmosphere for relics and rarities though different from the sorts most prized at poynton mrs gereth had of course more than once said that one of the deepest mysteries of life was the way that by certain natures hideous objects could be loved but it wasnt a question of love now for these it was only a question of a certain practical patience perhaps some thought of that kind had stolen over mrs gereth when at the end of a brooding hour she exclaimed taking in the house with a strenuous sigh well something can be done with it fleda had repeated to her more than once the indulgent fancy about the maidenauntshe was so sure she had deeply suffered im sure i hope she did was however all that mrs gereth had replied     vi   it was a great relief to the girl at last to perceive that the dreadful move would really be made what might happen if it shouldnt had been from the first indefinite it was absurd to pretend that any violence was probablea tussel dishevelment shrieks yet fleda had an imagination of a drama a great scene a thing somehow of indignity and misery of wounds inflicted and received in which indeed though mrs gereths presence with movements and sounds loomed large to her owen remained indistinct and on the whole unaggressive he wouldnt be there with a cigarette in his teeth very handsome and insolently quiet that was only the way he would be in a novel across whose interesting page some such figure as she half closed her eyes seemed to her to walk fleda had rather and indeed with shame a confused pitying vision of mrs gereth with her great scene left in a manner on her hands mrs gereth missing her effect and having to appear merely hot and injured and in the wrong the symptoms that she would be spared even that spectacle resided not so much through the chambers of poynton in an air of concentration as in the hum of buzzing alternatives there was no common preparation but one day at the turn of a corridor she found her hostess standing very still with the hanging hands of an invalid and the active eyes of an adventurer these eyes appeared to fleda to meet her own with a strange dim bravado and there was a silence almost awkward before either of the friends spoke the girl afterwards thought of the moment as one in which her hostess mutely accused her of an accusation meeting it however at the same time by a kind of defiant acceptance yet it was with mere melancholy candor that mrs gereth at last sighingly exclaimed im thinking over what i had better take fleda could have embraced her for this virtual promise of a concession the announcement that she had finally accepted the problem of knocking together a shelter with the small salvage of the wreck  it was true that when after their return from ricks they tried to lighten the ship the great embarrassment was still immutably there the odiousness of sacrificing the exquisite things one wouldnt take to the exquisite things one would this immediately made the things one wouldnt take the very things one ought to and as mrs gereth said condemned one in the whole business to an eternal vicious circle in such a circle for days she had been tormentedly moving prowling up and down comparing incomparables it was for that one had to cling to them and their faces of supplication fleda herself could judge of these faces so conscious of their race and their danger and she had little enough to say when her companion asked her if the whole place perversely fair on october afternoons looked like a place to give up it looked to begin with through some effect of season and light larger than ever immense and it was filled with the hush of sorrow which in turn was all charged with memories everything was in the airevery history of every find every circumstance of every struggle mrs gereth had drawn back every curtain and removed every cover she prolonged the vistas opened wide the whole house gave it an appearance of awaiting a royal visit the shimmer of wrought substances spent itself in the brightness the old golds and brasses old ivories and bronzes the fresh old tapestries and deep old damasks threw out a radiance in which the poor woman saw in solution all her old loves and patiences all her old tricks and triumphs  fleda had a depressed sense of not after all helping her much this was lightened indeed by the fact that mrs gereth letting her off easily didnt now seem to expect it her sympathy her interest her feeling for everything for which mrs gereth felt were a force that really worked to prolong the deadlock i only wish i bored you and my possessions bored you that lady with some humor declared then youd make short work with me bundle me off tell me just to pile certain things into a cart and have done fledas sharpest difficulty was in having to act up to the character of thinking owen a brute or at least to carry off the inconsistency of seeing him when he came down by good fortune it was her duty her function as well as a protection to mrs gereth she thought of him perpetually and her eyes had come to rejoice in his manly magnificence more even than they rejoiced in the royal cabinets of the red saloon she wondered very faintly at first why he came so often but of course she knew nothing about the business he had in hand over which with men redfaced and leatherlegged he was sometimes closeted for an hour in a room of his own that was the one monstrosity of poynton all tobaccopots and bootjacks his mother had saidsuch an array of arms of aggression and castigation that he himself had confessed to eighteen rifles and forty whips he was arranging for settlements on his wife he was doing things that would meet the views of the brigstocks considering the house was his own fleda thought it nice of him to keep himself in the background while his mother remained making his visits at some cost of ingenuity about trains from town only between meals doing everything to let it press lightly upon her that he was there this was rather a stoppage to her meeting mrs gereth on the ground of his being a brute the most she really at last could do was not to contradict her when she repeated that he was watchingjust insultingly watching he was watching no doubt but he watched somehow with his head turned away he knew that fleda knew at present what he wanted of her so that it would be gross of him to say it over and over it existed as a confidence between them and made him sometimes with his wandering stare meet her eyes as if a silence so pleasant could only unite them the more he had no great flow of speech certainly and at first the girl took for granted that this was all there was to be said about the matter little by little she speculated as to whether with a person who like herself could put him after all at a sort of domestic ease it was not supposable that he would have more conversation if he were not keeping some of it back for mona  from the moment she suspected he might be thinking what mona would say to his chattering so to an underhand companion who was all but paid this young ladys repressed emotion began to require still more repression she grew impatient of her situation at poynton she privately pronounced it false and horrid she said to herself that she had let owen know that she had to the best of her power directed his mother in the general sense he desired that he quite understood it and that he also understood how unworthy it was of either of them to stand over the good lady with a notebook and a lash wasnt this practical unanimity just practical success fleda became aware of a sudden desire as well as of pressing reasons to bring her stay at poynton to a close she had not on the one hand like a minion of the law undertaken to see mrs gereth down to the train and locked in sign of her abdication into a compartment neither had she on the other committed herself to hold owen indefinitely in dalliance while his mother gained time or dug a countermine besides people were saying that she fastened like a leech on other peoplepeople who had houses where something was to be picked up this revelation was frankly made her by her sister now distinctly doomed to the curate and in view of whose nuptials she had almost finished as a present a wonderful piece of embroidery suggested at poynton by an old spanish altarcloth she would have to exert herself still further for the intended recipient of this offering turn her out for her marriage with more than that drapery she would go up to town in short to dress maggie and their father in lodgings at west kensington would stretch a point and take them in he to do him justice never reproached her with profitable devotions so far as they existed he consciously profited by them mrs gereth gave her up as heroically as if she had been a great bargain and fleda knew that she wouldnt at present miss any visit of owens for owen was shooting at waterbath owen shooting was owen lost and there was scant sport at poynton  the first news she had from mrs gereth was news of that ladys having accomplished in form at least her migration the letter was dated from ricks to which place she had been transported by an impulse apparently as sudden as the inspiration she had obeyed before yes ive literally come she wrote with a bandbox and a kitchenmaid ive crossed the rubicon ive taken possession it has been like plumping into cold water i saw the only thing was to do it not to stand shivering i shall have warmed the place a little by simply being here for a week when i come back the ice will have been broken i didnt write to you to meet me on my way through town because i know how busy you are and because besides im too savage and odious to be fit company even for you youd say i really go too far and theres no doubt whatever i do im here at any rate just to look round once more to see that certain things are done before i enter in force i shall probably be at poynton all next week theres more room than i quite measured the other day and a rather good set of old worcester but what are space and time whats even old worcester to your wretched and affectionate a g  the day after fleda received this letter she had occasion to go into a big shop in oxford streeta journey that she achieved circuitously first on foot and then by the aid of two omnibuses the second of these vehicles put her down on the side of the street opposite her shop and while on the curbstone she humbly waited with a parcel an umbrella and a tuckedup frock to cross in security she became aware that close beside her a hansom had pulled up short in obedience to the brandished stick of a demonstrative occupant this occupant was owen gereth who had caught sight of her as he rattled along and who with an exhibition of white teeth that from under the hood of the cab had almost flashed through the fog now alighted to ask her if he couldnt give her a lift on finding that her destination was only over the way he dismissed his vehicle and joined her not only piloting her to the shop but taking her in with the assurance that his errands didnt matter that it amused him to be concerned with hers she told him she had come to buy a trimming for her sisters frock and he expressed an hilarious interest in the purchase his hilarity was almost always out of proportion to the case but it struck her at present as more so than ever especially when she had suggested that he might find it a good time to buy a garnishment of some sort for mona after wondering an instant whether he gave the full satiric meaning such as it was to this remark fleda dismissed the possibility as inconceivable he stammered out that it was for her he would like to buy something something ripping and that she must give him the pleasure of telling him what would best please her he couldnt have a better opportunity for making her a presentthe present in recognition of all she had done for mummy that he had had in his head for weeks  fleda had more than one small errand in the big bazaar and he went up and down with her pointedly patient pretending to be interested in questions of tape and of change she had now not the least hesitation in wondering what mona would think of such proceedings but they were not her doingthey were owens and owen inconsequent and even extravagant was unlike anything she had ever seen him before he broke off he came back he repeated questions without heeding answers he made vague abrupt remarks about the resemblances of shopgirls and the uses of chiffon he unduly prolonged their business together giving fleda a sense that he was putting off something particular that he had to face if she had ever dreamed of owen gereth as nervous she would have seen him with some such manner as this but why should he be nervous even at the height of the crisis his mother hadnt made him so and at present he was satisfied about his mother the one idea he stuck to was that fleda should mention something she would let him give her there was everything in the world in the wonderful place and he made her incongruous offersa travelingrug a massive clock a table for breakfast in bed and above all in a resplendent binding a set of somebodys works his notion was a testimonial a tribute and the works would be a graceful intimation that it was her cleverness he wished above all to commemorate he was immensely in earnest but the articles he pressed upon her betrayed a delicacy that went to her heart what he would really have liked as he saw them tumbled about was one of the splendid stuffs for a gowna choice proscribed by his fear of seeming to patronize her to refer to her small means and her deficiencies fleda found it easy to chaff him about his exaggeration of her deserts she gave the just measure of them in consenting to accept a small pincushion costing sixpence in which the letter f was marked out with pins a sense of loyalty to mona was not needed to enforce this discretion and after that first allusion to her she never sounded her name she noticed on this occasion more things in owen gereth than she had ever noticed before but what she noticed most was that he said no word of his intended she asked herself what he had done in so long a parenthesis with his loyalty or at least his form and then reflected that even if he had done something very good with them the situation in which such a question could come up was already a little strange of course he wasnt doing anything so vulgar as making love to her but there was a kind of punctilio for a man who was engaged  that punctilio didnt prevent owen from remaining with her after they had left the shop from hoping she had a lot more to do and from pressing her to look with him for a possible glimpse of something she might really let him give her into the windows of other establishments there was a moment when under this pressure she made up her mind that his tribute would be if analyzed a tribute to her insignificance but all the same he wanted her to come somewhere and have luncheon with him what was that a tribute to she must have counted very little if she didnt count too much for a romp in a restaurant she had to get home with her trimming and the most in his company she was amenable to was a retracing of her steps to the marble arch and then after a discussion when they had reached it a walk with him across the park she knew mona would have considered that she ought to take the omnibus again but she had now to think for owen as well as for herselfshe couldnt think for mona even in the park the autumn air was thick and as they moved westward over the grass which was what owen preferred the cool grayness made their words soft made them at last rare and everything else dim he wanted to stay with herhe wanted not to leave her he had dropped into complete silence but that was what his silence said what was it he had postponed what was it he wanted still to postpone she grew a little scared as they strolled together and she thought it was too confused to be believed but it was as if somehow he felt differently fleda vetch didnt suspect him at first of feeling differently to her but only of feeling differently to mona yet she was not unconscious that this latter difference would have had something to do with his being on the grass beside her she had read in novels about gentlemen who on the eve of marriage winding up the past had surrendered themselves for the occasion to the influence of a former tie and there was something in owens behavior now something in his very face that suggested a resemblance to one of those gentlemen but whom and what in that case would fleda herself resemble she wasnt a former tie she wasnt any tie at all she was only a deep little person for whom happiness was a kind of pearldiving plunge it was down at the very bottom of all that had lately happened for all that had lately happened was that owen gereth had come and gone at poynton that was the small sum of her experience and what it had made for her was her own affair quite consistent with her not having dreamed it had made a tieat least what she called onefor owen the old one at any rate was monamona whom he had known so very much longer  they walked far to the southwest corner of the great gardens where by the old round pond and the old red palace when she had put out her hand to him in farewell declaring that from the gate she must positively take a conveyance it seemed suddenly to rise between them that this was a real separation she was on his mothers side she belonged to his mothers life and his mother in the future would never come to poynton after what had passed she wouldnt even be at his wedding and it was not possible now that mrs gereth should mention that ceremony to the girl much less express a wish that the girl should be present at it mona from decorum and with reference less to the bridegroom than to the bridegrooms mother would of course not invite any such girl as fleda everything therefore was ended they would go their different ways this was the last time they would stand face to face they looked at each other with the fuller sense of it and on owens part with an expression of dumb trouble the intensification of his usual appeal to any interlocutor to add the right thing to what he said to fleda at this moment it appeared that the right thing might easily be the wrong he only said at any rate i want you to understand you knowi want you to understand  what did he want her to understand he seemed unable to bring it out and this understanding was moreover exactly what she wished not to arrive at bewildered as she was she had already taken in as much as she should know what to do with the blood also was rushing into her face he liked herit was stupefyingmore than he really ought that was what was the matter with him and what he desired her to assimilate so that she was suddenly as frightened as some thoughtless girl who finds herself the object of an overture from a married man  goodbye mr gerethi must get on she declared with a cheerfulness that she felt to be an unnatural grimace she broke away from him sharply smiling backing across the grass and then turning altogether and moving as fast as she could goodbye goodbye she threw off again as she went wondering if he would overtake her before she reached the gate conscious with a red disgust that her movement was almost a run conscious too of just the confused handsome face with which he would look after her she felt as if she had answered a kindness with a great flouncing snub but at any rate she had got away though the distance to the gate her ugly gallop down the broad walk every graceless jerk of which hurt her seemed endless she signed from afar to a cab on the stand in the kensington road and scrambled into it glad of the encompassment of the fourwheeler that had officiously obeyed her summons and that at the end of twenty yards when she had violently pulled up a glass permitted her to recognize the fact that she was on the point of bursting into tears     vii   as soon as her sister was married she went down to mrs gereth at ricksa promise to this effect having been promptly exacted and given and her inner vision was much more fixed on the alterations there complete now as she understood than on the success of her plotting and pinching for maggies happiness her imagination in the interval had indeed had plenty to do and numerous scenes to visit for when on the summons just mentioned it had taken a flight from west kensington to ricks it had hung but an hour over the terrace of painted pots and then yielded to a current of the upper air that swept it straight off to poynton and to waterbath not a sound had reached her of any supreme clash and mrs gereth had communicated next to nothing giving out that as was easily conceivable she was too busy too bitter and too tired for vain civilities all she had written was that she had got the new place well in hand and that fleda would be surprised at the way it was turning out everything was even yet upside down nevertheless in the sense of having passed the threshold of poynton for the last time the amputation as she called it had been performed her leg had come offshe had now begun to stump along with the lovely wooden substitute she would stump for life and what her young friend was to come and admire was the beauty of her movement and the noise she made about the house the reserve of poynton and waterbath had been matched by the austerity of fledas own secret under the discipline of which she had repeated to herself a hundred times a day that she rejoiced at having cares that excluded all thought of it she had lavished herself in act on maggie and the curate and had opposed to her fathers selfishness a sweetness quite ecstatic the young couple wondered why they had waited so long since everything was after all so easy she had thought of everything even to how the quietness of the wedding should be relieved by champagne and her father kept brilliant on a single bottle fleda knew in short and liked the knowledge that for several weeks she had appeared exemplary in every relation of life  she had been perfectly prepared to be surprised at ricks for mrs gereth was a wonderworking wizard with a command when all was said of good material but the impression in wait for her on the threshold made her catch her breath and falter dusk had fallen when she arrived and in the plain square hall one of the few good features the glow of a venetian lamp just showed on either wall the richness of an admirable tapestry this instant perception that the place had been dressed at the expense of poynton was a shock it was as if she had abruptly seen herself in the light of an accomplice the next moment folded in mrs gereths arms her eyes were diverted but she had already had in a flash the vision of the great gaps in the other house the two tapestries not the largest but those most splendidly toned by time had been on the whole its most uplifted pride when she could really see again she was on a sofa in the drawingroom staring with intensity at an object soon distinct as the great italian cabinet that at poynton had been in the red saloon without looking she was sure the room was occupied with other objects like it stuffed with as many as it could hold of the trophies of her friends struggle by this time the very fingers of her glove resting on the seat of the sofa had thrilled at the touch of an old velvet brocade a wondrous texture that she could recognize would have recognized among a thousand without dropping her eyes on it they stuck to the cabinet with a kind of dissimulated dread while she painfully asked herself whether she should notice it notice everything or just pretend not to be affected how could she pretend not to be affected with the very pendants of the lustres tinkling at her and with mrs gereth beside her and staring at her even as she herself stared at the cabinet hunching up a back like atlas under his globe she was appalled at this image of what mrs gereth had on her shoulders that lady was waiting and watching her bracing herself and preparing the same face of confession and defiance she had shown the day at poynton she had been surprised in the corridor it was farcical not to speak and yet to exclaim to participate would give one a bad sense of being mixed up with a theft this ugly word sounded for herself in fledas silence and the very violence of it jarred her into a scared glance as of a creature detected to right and left but what again the full picture most showed her was the faraway empty sockets a scandal of nakedness in high bare walls she at last uttered something formal and incoherentshe didnt know what it had no relation to either house then she felt mrs gereths hand once more on her arm ive arranged a charming room for youits really lovely youll be very happy there this was spoken with extraordinary sweetness and with a smile that meant oh i know what youre thinking but what does it matter when youre so loyally on my side it had come indeed to a question of sides fleda thought for the whole place was in battle array in the soft lamplight with one fine feature after another looming up into sombre richness it defied her not to pronounce it a triumph of taste her passion for beauty leaped back into life and was not what now most appealed to it a certain gorgeous audacity mrs gereths high hand was as mere great effect the climax of the impression  its too wonderful what youve done with the housethe visitor met her friends eyes they lighted up with joythat friend herself so pleased with what she had done this was not at all in its accidental air of enthusiasm what fleda wanted to have said it offered her as stupidly announcing from the first minute on whose side she was such was clearly the way mrs gereth took it she threw herself upon the delightful girl and tenderly embraced her again so that fleda soon went on with a studied difference and a cooler inspection why you brought away absolutely everything  oh no not everything i saw how little i could get into this scrap of a house i only brought away what i required  fleda had got up she took a turn round the room you required the very best piecesthe morceaux de musée the individual gems  i certainly didnt want the rubbish if thats what you mean mrs gereth on the sofa followed the direction of her companions eyes with the light of her satisfaction still in her face she slowly rubbed her large handsome hands wherever she was she was herself the great piece in the gallery it was the first fleda had heard of there being rubbish at poynton but she didnt for the moment take up this insincerity she only from where she stood in the room called out one after the other as if she had had a list in her hand the pieces that in the great house had been scattered and that now if they had a fault were too much like a minuet danced on a hearthrug she knew them each in every chink and charmknew them by the personal name their distinctive sign or story had given them and a second time she felt how against her intention this uttered knowledge struck her hostess as so much free approval mrs gereth was never indifferent to approval and there was nothing she could so love you for as for doing justice to her deep morality there was a particular gleam in her eyes when fleda exclaimed at last dazzled by the display and even the maltese cross that description though technically incorrect had always been applied at poynton to a small but marvelous crucifix of ivory a masterpiece of delicacy of expression and of the great spanish period the existence and precarious accessibility of which she had heard of at malta years before by an odd and romantic chancea clue followed through mazes of secrecy till the treasure was at last unearthed  even the maltese cross mrs gereth rose as she sharply echoed the words my dear child you dont suppose id have sacrificed that for what in the world would you have taken me  a bibelot the more or the less fleda said could have made little difference in this grand general view of you i take you simply for the greatest of all conjurers youve operated with a quicknessand with a quietness her voice trembled a little as she spoke for the plain meaning of her words was that what her friend had achieved belonged to the class of operation essentially involving the protection of darkness fleda felt she really could say nothing at all if she couldnt say that she knew what the danger had been she completed her thought by a resolute and perfectly candid question how in the world did you get off with them  mrs gereth confessed to the fact of danger with a cynicism that surprised the girl by calculating by choosing my time i was quiet and i was quick i manoeuvred then at the last rushed fleda drew a long breath she saw in the poor woman something much better than sophistical ease a crude elation that was a comparatively simple state to deal with her elation it was true was not so much from what she had done as from the way she had done itby as brilliant a stroke as any commemorated in the annals of crime i succeeded because i had thought it all out and left nothing to chance the whole process was organized in advance so that the mere carrying it into effect took but a few hours it was largely a matter of money oh i was horribly extravaganti had to turn on so many people but they were all to be hada little army of workers the packers the porters the helpers of every sort the men with the mighty vans it was a question of arranging in tottenham court road and of paying the price i havent paid it yet therell be a horrid bill but at least the things done expedition pure and simple was the essence of the bargain i can give you two days i said i cant give you another second they undertook the job and the two days saw them through the people came down on a tuesday morning they were off on the thursday i admit that some of them worked all wednesday night i had thought it all out i stood over them i showed them how yes i coaxed them i made love to them oh i was inspiredthey found me wonderful i neither ate nor slept but i was as calm as i am now i didnt know what was in me it was worth finding out im very remarkable my dear i lifted tons with my own arms im tired very very tired but theres neither a scratch nor a nick there isnt a teacup missing magnificent both in her exhaustion and in her triumph mrs gereth sank on the sofa again the sweep of her eyes a rich synthesis and the restless friction of her hands a clear betrayal upon my word she laughed they really look better here  fleda had listened in awe and no one at poynton said anything there was no alarm  what alarm should there have been owen left me almost defiantly alone i had taken a time that i had reason to believe was safe from a descent fleda had another wonder which she hesitated to express it would scarcely do to ask mrs gereth if she hadnt stood in fear of her servants she knew moreover some of the secrets of her humorous household rule all made up of shocks to shyness and provocations to curiositya diplomacy so artful that several of the maids quite yearned to accompany her to ricks mrs gereth reading sharply the whole of her visitors thought caught it up with fine frankness you mean that i was watchedthat he had his myrmidons pledged to wire him if they should see what i was up to precisely i know the three persons you have in mind i had them in mind myself well i took a line with themi settled them  fleda had had no one in particular in mind she had never believed in the myrmidons but the tone in which mrs gereth spoke added to her suspense what did you do to them  i took hold of them hardi put them in the forefront i made them work  to move the furniture  to help and to help so as to please me that was the way to take them it was what they had least expected i marched up to them and looked each straight in the eye giving him the chance to choose if hed gratify me or gratify my son he gratified me they were too stupid  mrs gereth massed herself there more and more as an immoral woman but fleda had to recognize that she too would have been stupid and she too would have gratified her and when did all this take place  only last week it seems a hundred years weve worked here as fast as we worked there but im not settled yet youll see in the rest of the house however the worst is over  do you really think so fleda presently inquired i mean does he after the fact as it were accept it  owenwhat ive done i havent the least idea said mrs gereth  does mona  you mean that shell be the soul of the row  i hardly see mona as the soul of anything the girl replied but have they made no sound have you heard nothing at all  not a whisper not a step in all the eight days perhaps they dont know perhaps theyre crouching for a leap  but wouldnt they have gone down as soon as you left  they may not have known of my leaving fleda wondered afresh it struck her as scarcely supposable that some sign shouldnt have flashed from poynton to london if the storm was taking this term of silence to gather even in monas breast it would probably discharge itself in some startling form the great hush of every one concerned was strange but when she pressed mrs gereth for some explanation of it that lady only replied with her brave irony oh i took their breath away she had no illusions however she was still prepared to fight what indeed was her spoliation of poynton but the first engagement of a campaign  all this was exciting but fledas spirit dropped at bedtime in the chamber embellished for her pleasure where she found several of the objects that in her earlier room she had most admired these had been reinforced by other pieces from other rooms so that the quiet air of it was a harmony without a break the finished picture of a maidens bower it was the sweetest louis seize all assorted and combinedold chastened figured faded france fleda was impressed anew with her friends genius for composition she could say to herself that no girl in england that night went to rest with so picked a guard but there was no joy for her in her privilege no sleep even for the tired hours that made the place in the embers of the fire and the winter dawn look gray somehow and loveless she couldnt care for such things when they came to her in such ways there was a wrong about them all that turned them to ugliness in the watches of the night she saw poynton dishonored she had cared for it as a happy whole she reasoned and the parts of it now around her seemed to suffer like chopped limbs before going to bed she had walked about with mrs gereth and seen at whose expense the whole house had been furnished at poor owens from top to bottomthere wasnt a chair he hadnt sat upon the maiden aunt had been exterminatedno trace of her to tell her tale fleda tried to think of some of the things at poynton still unappropriated but her memory was a blank about them and in trying to focus the old combinations she saw again nothing but gaps and scars a vacancy that gathered at moments into something worse this concrete image was her greatest trouble for it was owen gereths face his sad strange eyes fixed upon her now as they had never been they stared at her out of the darkness and their expression was more than she could bear it seemed to say that he was in pain and that it was somehow her fault he had looked to her to help him and this was what her help had been he had done her the honor to ask her to exert herself in his interest confiding to her a task of difficulty but of the highest delicacy hadnt that been exactly the sort of service she longed to render him well her way of rendering it had been simply to betray him and hand him over to his enemy shame pity resentment oppressed her in turn in the last of these feelings the others were quickly submerged mrs gereth had imprisoned her in that torment of taste but it was clear to her for an hour at least that she might hate mrs gereth  something else however when morning came was even more intensely definite the most odious thing in the world for her would be ever again to meet owen she took on the spot a resolve to neglect no precaution that could lead to her going through life without that accident after this while she dressed she took still another her position had become in a few hours intolerably false in as few more hours as possible she would therefore put an end to it the way to put an end to it would be to inform mrs gereth that to her great regret she couldnt be with her now couldnt cleave to her to the point that everything about her so plainly urged she dressed with a sort of violence a symbol of the manner in which this purpose was precipitated the more they parted company the less likely she was to come across owen for owen would be drawn closer to his mother now by the very necessity of bringing her down fleda in the inconsequence of distress wished to have nothing to do with her fall she had had too much to do with everything she was well aware of the importance before breakfast and in view of any light they might shed on the question of motive of not suffering her invidious expression of a difference to be accompanied by the traces of tears but it none the less came to pass downstairs that after she had subtly put her back to the window to make a mystery of the state of her eyes she stupidly let a rich sob escape her before she could properly meet the consequences of being asked if she wasnt delighted with her room this accident struck her on the spot as so grave that she felt the only refuge to be instant hypocrisy some graceful impulse that would charge her emotion to the quickened sense of her friends generositya demonstration entailing a flutter round the table and a renewed embrace and not so successfully improvised but that fleda fancied mrs gereth to have been only half reassured she had been startled at any rate and she might remain suspicious this reflection interposed by the time after breakfast the girl had recovered sufficiently to say what was in her heart she accordingly didnt say it that morning at all she had absurdly veered about she had encountered the shock of the fear that mrs gereth with sharpened eyes might wonder why the deuce she often wondered in that phrase she had grown so warm about owens rights she would doubtless at a pinch be able to defend them on abstract grounds but that would involve a discussion and the idea of a discussion made her nervous for her secret until in some way poynton should return the blow and give her a cue she must keep nervousness down and she called herself a fool for having forgotten however briefly that her one safety was in silence  directly after luncheon mrs gereth took her into the garden for a glimpse of the revolutionor at least said the mistress of ricks of the great rowthat had been decreed there but the ladies had scarcely placed themselves for this view before the younger one found herself embracing a prospect that opened in quite another quarter her attention was called to it oddly by the streamers of the parlormaids cap which flying straight behind the neat young woman who unexpectedly burst from the house and showed a long red face as she ambled over the grass seemed to articulate in their flutter the name that fleda lived at present only to catch poyntonpoynton said the morsels of muslin so that the parlormaid became on the instant an actress in the drama and fleda assuming pusillanimously that she herself was only a spectator looked across the footlights at the exponent of the principal part the manner in which this artist returned her look showed that she was equally preoccupied both were haunted alike by possibilities but the apprehension of neither before the announcement was made took the form of the arrival at ricks in the flesh of mrs gereths victim when the messenger informed them that mr gereth was in the drawingroom the blank oh emitted by fleda was quite as precipitate as the sound on her hostesss lips besides being as she felt much less pertinent i thought it would be somebody that lady afterwards said but i expected on the whole a solicitors clerk fleda didnt mention that she herself had expected on the whole a pair of constables she was surprised by mrs gereths question to the parlormaid  for whom did he ask  why for you of course dearest friend fleda interjected falling instinctively into the address that embodied the intensest pressure she wanted to put mrs gereth between her and her danger  he asked for miss vetch mum the girl replied with a face that brought startlingly to fledas ear the muffled chorus of the kitchen  quite proper said mrs gereth austerely then to fleda please go to him  but what to do  what you always doto see what he wants mrs gereth dismissed the maid tell him miss vetch will come fleda saw that nothing was in the mothers imagination at this moment but the desire not to meet her son she had completely broken with him and there was little in what had just happened to repair the rupture it would now take more to do so than his presenting himself uninvited at her door hes right in asking for youhes aware that youre still our communicator nothing has occurred to alter that to what he wishes to transmit through you im ready as ive been ready before to listen as far as im concerned if i couldnt meet him a month ago how am i to meet him today if he has come to say my dear mother youre here in the hovel into which ive flung you with consolations that give me pleasure ill listen to him but on no other footing thats what youre to ascertain please youll oblige me as youve obliged me before there mrs gereth turned her back and with a fine imitation of superiority began to redress the miseries immediately before her fleda meanwhile hesitated lingered for some minutes where she had been left feeling secretly that her fate still had her in hand it had put her face to face with owen gereth and it evidently meant to keep her so she was reminded afresh of two things one of which was that though she judged her friends rigor she had never really had the story of the scene enacted in the great awestricken house between the mother and the son weeks beforethe day the former took to her bed in her overthrow the other was that at ricks as at poynton it was before all things her place to accept thankfully a usefulness not she must remember universally acknowledged what determined her at the last while mrs gereth disappeared in the shrubbery was that though she was at a distance from the house and the drawingroom was turned the other way she could absolutely see the young man alone there with the sources of his pain she saw his simple stare at his tapestries heard his heavy tread on his carpets and the hard breath of his sense of unfairness at this she went to him fast     viii   i asked for you he said when she stood there because i heard from the flyman who drove me from the station to the inn that he had brought you here yesterday we had some talk and he mentioned it  you didnt know i was here  no i knew only that you had had in london all that you told me that day to do and it was monas idea that after your sisters marriage you were staying on with your father so i thought you were with him still  i am fleda replied idealizing a little the fact im here only for a moment but do you mean she went on that if you had known i was with your mother you wouldnt have come down  the way owen hung fire at this question made it sound more playful than she had intended she had in fact no consciousness of any intention but that of confining herself rigidly to her function she could already see that in whatever he had now braced himself for she was an element he had not reckoned with his preparation had been of a different sortthe sort congruous with his having been careful to go first and lunch solidly at the inn he had not been forced to ask for her but she became aware in his presence of a particular desire to make him feel that no harm could really come to him she might upset him as people called it but she would take no advantage of having done so she had never seen a person with whom she wished more to be light and easy to be exceptionally human the account he presently gave of the matter was that he indeed wouldnt have come if he had known she was on the spot because then didnt she see he could have written to her he would have had her there to let fly at his mother  that would have saved mewell it would have saved me a lot of course i would rather see you than her he somewhat awkwardly added when the fellow spoke of you i assure you i quite jumped at you in fact ive no real desire to see mummy at all if she thinks i like it he sighed disgustedly i only came down because it seemed better than any other way i didnt want her to be able to say i hadnt been all right i dare say you know she has taken everything or if not quite everything why a lot more than one ever dreamed you can see for yourselfshe has got half the place down she has got them crammedyou can see for yourself he had his old trick of artless repetition his helpless iteration of the obvious but he was sensibly different for fleda if only by the difference of his clear face mottled over and almost disfigured by little points of pain he might have been a fine young man with a bad toothache with the first even of his life what ailed him above all she felt was that trouble was new to him he had never known a difficulty he had taken all his fences his world wholly the world of the personally possible rounded indeed by a gray suburb into which he had never had occasion to stray in this vulgar and illlighted region he had evidently now lost himself we left it quite to her honor you know he said ruefully  perhaps youve a right to say that you left it a little to mine mixed up with the spoils there rising before him as if she were in a manner their keeper she felt that she must absolutely dissociate herself mrs gereth had made it impossible to do anything but give her away i can only tell you that on my side i left it to her i never dreamed either that she would pick out so many things  and you dont really think its fair do you you dont he spoke very quickly he really seemed to plead  fleda faltered a moment i think she has gone too far then she added i shall immediately tell her that ive said that to you  he appeared puzzled by this statement but he presently rejoined you havent then said to mamma what you think  not yet remember that i only got here last night she appeared to herself ignobly weak i had had no idea what she was doing i was taken completely by surprise she managed it wonderfully  its the sharpest thing i ever saw in my life they looked at each other with intelligence in appreciation of the sharpness and owen quickly broke into a loud laugh the laugh was in itself natural but the occasion of it strange and stranger still to fleda so that she too almost laughed the inconsequent charity with which he added poor dear old mummy thats one of the reasons i asked for you he went onto see if youd back her up  whatever he said or did she somehow liked him the better for it how can i back her up mr gereth when i think as i tell you that she has made a great mistake  a great mistake thats all right he spokeit wasnt clear to her whyas if this declaration were a great point gained  of course there are many things she hasnt taken fleda continued  oh yes a lot of things but you wouldnt know the place all the same he looked about the room with his discolored swindled face which deepened fledas compassion for him conjuring away any smile at so candid an image of the dupe youd know this one soon enough wouldnt you these are just the things she ought to have left is the whole house full of them  the whole house said fleda uncompromisingly she thought of her lovely room  i never knew how much i cared for them theyre awfully valuable arent they owens manner mystified her she was conscious of a return of the agitation he had produced in her on that last bewildering day and she reminded herself that now she was warned it would be inexcusable of her to allow him to justify the fear that had dropped on her mother thinks i never took any notice but i assure you i was awfully proud of everything upon my honor i was proud miss vetch  there was an oddity in his helplessness he appeared to wish to persuade her and to satisfy himself that she sincerely felt how worthy he really was to treat what had happened as an injury she could only exclaim almost as helplessly as himself of course you did justice its all most painful i shall instantly let your mother know she again declared the way ive spoken of her to you she clung to that idea as to the sign of her straightness  youll tell her what you think she ought to do he asked with some eagerness  what she ought to do  dont you think iti mean that she ought to give them up  to give them up fleda hesitated again  to send them backto keep it quiet the girl had not felt the impulse to ask him to sit down among the monuments of his wrong so that nervously awkwardly he fidgeted about the room with his hands in his pockets and an effect of returning a little into possession through the formulation of his view to have them packed and dispatched again since she knows so well how she does it beautifullyhe looked close at two or three precious pieces whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander  he had laughed at his way of putting it but fleda remained grave is that what you came to say to her  not exactly those words but i did come to sayhe stammered then brought it outi did come to say we must have them right back  and did you think your mother would see you  i wasnt sure but i thought it right to tryto put it to her kindly dont you see if she wont see me then she has herself to thank the only other way would have been to set the lawyers at her  im glad you didnt do that  im dashed if i want to owen honestly declared but whats a fellow to do if she wont meet a fellow  what do you call meeting a fellow fleda asked with a smile  why letting me tell her a dozen things she can have  this was a transaction that fleda after a moment had to give up trying to represent to herself if she wont do that she went on  ill leave it all to my solicitor he wont let her off by jove i know the fellow  thats horrible said fleda looking at him in woe  its utterly beastly  his want of logic as well as his vehemence startled her and with her eyes still on his she considered before asking him the question these things suggested at last she asked it is mona very angry  oh dear yes said owen  she had perceived that he wouldnt speak of mona without her beginning after waiting fruitlessly now for him to say more she continued she has been there again she has seen the state of the house  oh dear yes owen repeated  fleda disliked to appear not to take account of his brevity but it was just because she was struck by it that she felt the pressure of the desire to know more what it suggested was simply what her intelligence supplied for he was incapable of any art of insinuation wasnt it at all events the rule of communication with him to say for him what he couldnt say this truth was present to the girl as she inquired if mona greatly resented what mrs gereth had done he satisfied her promptly he was standing before the fire his back to it his long legs apart his hands behind him rather violently jiggling his gloves she hates it awfully in fact she refuses to put up with it at all dont you seeshe saw the place with all the things  so that of course she misses them  misses themrather she was awfully sweet on them fleda remembered how sweet mona had been and reflected that if that was the sort of plea he had prepared it was indeed as well he shouldnt see his mother this was not all she wanted to know but it came over her that it was all she needed you see it puts me in the position of not carrying out what i promised owen said as she says herselfhe hesitated an instantits just as if i had obtained her under false pretenses just before when he spoke with more drollery than he knew it had left fleda serious but now his own clear gravity had the effect of exciting her mirth she laughed out and he looked surprised but went on she regards it as a regular sell  fleda was silent but finally as he added nothing she exclaimed of course it makes a great difference she knew all she needed but none the less she risked after another pause an interrogative remark i forget when it is that your marriage takes place  owen came away from the fire and apparently at a loss where to turn ended by directing himself to one of the windows its a little uncertain the date isnt quite fixed  oh i thought i remembered that at poynton you had told me a day and that it was near at hand  i dare say i did it was for the 19th but weve altered thatshe wants to shift it he looked out of the window then he said in fact it wont come off till mummy has come round  come round  put the place as it was in his offhand way he added you know what i mean  he spoke not impatiently but with a kind of intimate familiarity the sweetness of which made her feel a pang for having forced him to tell her what was embarrassing to him what was even humiliating yes indeed she knew all she needed all she needed was that mona had proved apt at putting down that wonderful patentleather foot her type was misleading only to the superficial and no one in the world was less superficial than fleda she had guessed the truth at waterbath and she had suffered from it at poynton at ricks the only thing she could do was to accept it with the dumb exaltation that she felt rising mona had been prompt with her exercise of the member in question for it might be called prompt to do that sort of thing before marriage that she had indeed been premature who should say save those who should have read the matter in the full light of results neither at waterbath nor at poynton had even fledas thoroughness discovered all that there wasor rather all that there was notin owen gereth of course it makes all the difference she said in answer to his last words she pursued after considering what you wish me to say from you then to your mother is that you demand immediate and practically complete restitution  yes please its tremendously good of you  very well then will you wait  for mummys answer owen stared and looked perplexed he was more and more fevered with so much vivid expression of his case dont you think that if im here she may hate it worsethink i may want to make her reply bang off  fleda thought you dont then  i want to take her in the right way dont you knowtreat her as if i gave her more than just an hour or two  i see said fleda then if you dont waitgoodbye  this again seemed not what he wanted must you do it bang off  im only thinking shell be impatienti mean you know to learn what will have passed between us  i see said owen looking at his gloves i can give her a day or two you know of course i didnt come down to sleep he went on the inn seems a horrid hole i know all about the trainshaving no idea you were here almost as soon as his interlocutress he was struck with the absence of the visible in this as between effect and cause i mean because in that case i should have felt i could stop over i should have felt i could talk with you a blessed sight longer than with mummy  weve already talked a long time smiled fleda  awfully havent we he spoke with the stupidity she didnt object to inarticulate as he was he had more to say he lingered perhaps because he was vaguely aware of the want of sincerity in her encouragement to him to go theres one thing please he mentioned as if there might be a great many others too please dont say anything about mona  she didnt understand about mona  about its being her that thinks she has gone too far this was still slightly obscure but now fleda understood it mustnt seem to come from her at all dont you know that would only make mummy worse  fleda knew exactly how much worse but she felt a delicacy about explicitly assenting she was already immersed moreover in the deep consideration of what might make mummy better she couldnt see as yet at all she could only clutch at the hope of some inspiration after he should go oh there was a remedy to be sure but it was out of the question in spite of which in the strong light of owens troubled presence of his anxious face and restless step it hung there before her for some minutes she felt that remarkably beneath the decent rigor of his errand the poor young man for reasons for weariness for disgust would have been ready not to insist his fitness to fight his mother had left himhe wasnt in fighting trim he had no natural avidity and even no special wrath he had none that had not been taught him and it was doing his best to learn the lesson that had made him so sick he had his delicacies but he hid them away like presents before christmas he was hollow perfunctory pathetic he had been girded by another hand that hand had naturally been monas and it was heavy even now on his strong broad back why then had he originally rejoiced so in its touch fleda dashed aside this question for it had nothing to do with her problem her problem was to help him to live as a gentleman and carry through what he had undertaken her problem was to reinstate him in his rights it was quite irrelevant that mona had no intelligence of what she had lostquite irrelevant that she was moved not by the privation but by the insult she had every reason to be moved though she was so much more movable in the vindictive way at any rate than one might have supposedassuredly more than owen himself had imagined  certainly i shall not mention mona fleda said and there wont be the slightest necessity for it the wrongs quite sufficiently yours and the demand you make is perfectly justified by it  i cant tell you what it is to me to feel you on my side owen exclaimed  up to this time said fleda after a pause your mother has had no doubt of my being on hers  then of course she wont like your changing  i dare say she wont like it at all  do you mean to say youll have a regular kickup with her  i dont exactly know what you mean by a regular kickup we shall naturally have a great deal of discussionif she consents to discuss the matter at all thats why you must decidedly give her two or three days  i see you think she may refuse to discuss it at all said owen  im only trying to be prepared for the worst you must remember that to have to withdraw from the ground she has taken to make a public surrender of what she has publicly appropriated will go uncommonly hard with her pride  owen considered his face seemed to broaden but not into a smile i suppose shes tremendously proud isnt she this might have been the first time it had occurred to him  you know better than i said fleda speaking with high extravagance  i dont know anything in the world half so well as you if i were as clever as you i might hope to get round her owen hesitated then he went on in fact i dont quite see what even you can say or do that will really fetch her  neither do i as yet i must thinki must pray the girl pursued smiling i can only say to you that ill try i want to try you knowi want to help you he stood looking at her so long on this that she added with much distinctness so you must leave me please quite alone with her you must go straight back  back to the inn  oh no back to town ill write to you tomorrow  he turned about vaguely for his hat  theres the chance of course that she may be afraid  afraid you mean of the legal steps you may take  ive got a perfect casei could have her up the brigstocks say its simple stealing  i can easily fancy what the brigstocks say fleda permitted herself to remark without solemnity  its none of their business is it was owens unexpected rejoinder fleda had already noted that no one so slow could ever have had such rapid transitions  she showed her amusement theyve a much better right to say its none of mine  well at any rate you dont call her names  fleda wondered whether mona did and this made it all the finer of her to exclaim in a moment you dont know what i shall call her if she holds out  owen gave her a gloomy glance then he blew a speck off the crown of his hat but if you do have a setto with her  he paused so long for a reply that fleda said i dont think i know what you mean by a setto  well if she calls you names  i dont think shell do that  what i mean to say is if shes angry at your backing me upwhat will you do then she cant possibly like it you know  she may very well not like it but everything depends i must see what i shall do you mustnt worry about me  she spoke with decision but owen seemed still unsatisfied you wont go away i hope  go away  if she does take it ill of you  fleda moved to the door and opened it im not prepared to say you must have patience and see  of course i must said owenof course of course but he took no more advantage of the open door than to say you want me to be off and im off in a minute only before i go please answer me a question if you should leave my mother where would you go  fleda smiled again i havent the least idea  i suppose youd go back to london  i havent the least idea fleda repeated  you dontalive anywhere in particular do you the young man went on he looked conscious as soon as he had spoken she could see that he felt himself to have alluded more grossly than he meant to the circumstance of her having if one were plain about it no home of her own he had meant it as an allusion of a tender sort to all that she would sacrifice in the case of a quarrel with his mother but there was indeed no graceful way of touching on that one just couldnt be plain about it  fleda wound up as she was shrank from any treatment at all of the matter and she made no answer to his question i wont leave your mother she said ill produce an effect on her ill convince her absolutely  i believe you will if you look at her like that  she was wound up to such a height that there might well be a light in her pale fine little facea light that while for all return at first she simply shone back at him was intensely reflected in his own ill make her see itill make her see it she rang out like a silver bell she had at that moment a perfect faith that she should succeed but it passed into something else when the next instant she became aware that owen quickly getting between her and the door she had opened was sharply closing it as might be said in her face he had done this before she could stop him and he stood there with his hand on the knob and smiled at her strangely clearer than he could have spoken it was the sense of those seconds of silence  when i got into this i didnt know you and now that i know you how can i tell you the difference and shes so different so ugly and vulgar in the light of this squabble no like you ive never known one its another thing its a new thing altogether listen to me a little cant something be done it was what had been in the air in those moments at kensington and it only wanted words to be a committed act the more reason to the girls excited mind why it shouldnt have words her one thought was not to hear to keep the act uncommitted she would do this if she had to be horrid  please let me out mr gereth she said on which he opened the door with an hesitation so very brief that in thinking of these things afterwardsfor she was to think of them forevershe wondered in what tone she could have spoken they went into the hall where she encountered the parlormaid of whom she inquired whether mrs gereth had come in  no miss and i think she has left the garden she has gone up the back road in other words they had the whole place to themselves it would have been a pleasure in a different mood to converse with that parlormaid  please open the housedoor said fleda  owen as if in quest of his umbrella looked vaguely about the halllooked even wistfully up the staircasewhile the neat young woman complied with fledas request owens eyes then wandered out of the open door i think its awfully nice here he observed i assure you i could do with it myself  i should think you might with half your things here its poynton itselfalmost goodbye mr gereth fleda added her intention had naturally been that the neat young woman opening the front door should remain to close it on the departing guest that functionary however had acutely vanished behind a stiff flap of green baize which mrs gereth had not yet had time to abolish fleda put out her hand but owen turned awayhe couldnt find his umbrella she passed into the open airshe was determined to get him out and in a moment he joined her in the little plastered portico which had small resemblance to any feature of poynton it was as mrs gereth had said like the portico of a house in brompton  oh i dont mean with all the things here he explained in regard to the opinion he had just expressed i mean i could put up with it just as it was it had a lot of good things dont you think i mean if everything was back at poynton if everything was all right he brought out these last words with a sort of smothered sigh fleda didnt understand his explanation unless it had reference to another and more wonderful exchangethe restoration to the great house not only of its tables and chairs but of its alienated mistress this would imply the installation of his own life at ricks and obviously that of another person such another person could scarcely be mona brigstock he put out his hand now and once more she heard his unsounded words with everything patched up at the other place i could live here with you dont you see what i mean  fleda saw perfectly and with a face in which she flattered herself that nothing of this vision appeared gave him her hand and said goodbye goodbye  owen held her hand very firmly and kept it even after an effort made by her to recover itan effort not repeated as she felt it best not to show she was flurried that solutionof her living with him at ricksdisposed of him beautifully and disposed not less so of herself it disposed admirably too of mrs gereth fleda could only vainly wonder how it provided for poor mona while he looked at her grasping her hand she felt that now indeed she was paying for his mothers extravagance at poyntonthe vividness of that ladys public plea that little fleda vetch was the person to insure the general peace it was to that vividness poor owen had come back and if mrs gereth had had more discretion little fleda vetch wouldnt have been in a predicament she saw that owen had at this moment his sharpest necessity of speech and so long as he didnt release her hand she could only submit to him her defense would be perhaps to look blank and hard so she looked as blank and as hard as she could with the reward of an immediate sense that this was not a bit what he wanted it even made him hang fire as if he were suddenly ashamed of himself were recalled to some idea of duty and of honor yet he none the less brought it out theres one thing i dare say i ought to tell you if youre going so kindly to act for me though of course youll see for yourself its a thing it wont do to tell her what was it he made her wait for it again and while she waited under firm coercion she had the extraordinary impression that owens simplicity was in eclipse his natural honesty was like the scent of a flower and she felt at this moment as if her nose had been brushed by the bloom without the odor the allusion was undoubtedly to his mother and was not what he meant about the matter in question the opposite of what he saidthat it just would do to tell her it would have been the first time he had said the opposite of what he meant and there was certainly a fascination in the phenomenon as well as a challenge to suspense in the ambiguity its just that i understand from mona you know he stammered its just that she has made no bones about bringing home to me he tried to laugh and in the effort he faltered again  about bringing home to youfleda encouraged him  he was sensible of it he achieved his performance why that if i dont get the things backevery blessed one of them except a few shell pick outshe wont have anything more to say to me  fleda after an instant encouraged him again to say to you  why she simply wont marry me dont you see  owens legs not to mention his voice had wavered while he spoke and she felt his possession of her hand loosen so that she was free again her stare of perception broke into a lively laugh oh youre all right for you will get them you will youre quite safe dont worry she fell back into the house with her hand on the door goodbye goodbye she repeated it several times laughing bravely quite waving him away and as he didnt move and save that he was on the other side of it closing the door in his face quite as he had closed that of the drawingroom in hers never had a face never at least had such a handsome one been so presented to that offense she even held the door a minute lest he should try to come in again at last as she heard nothing she made a dash for the stairs and ran up     ix   in knowing a while before all she needed fleda had been far from knowing as much as that so that once upstairs where in her room with her sense of danger and trouble the age of louis seize suddenly struck her as wanting in taste and point she felt that she now for the first time knew her temptation owen had put it before her with an art beyond his own dream mona would cast him off if he didnt proceed to extremities if his negotiation with his mother should fail he would be completely free that negotiation depended on a young lady to whom he had pressingly suggested the condition of his freedom and as if to aggravate the young ladys predicament designing fate had sent mrs gereth as the parlormaid said up the back road this would give the young lady more time to make up her mind that nothing should come of the negotiation there would be different ways of putting the question to mrs gereth and fleda might profitably devote the moments before her return to a selection of the way that would most surely be tantamount to failure this selection indeed required no great adroitness it was so conspicuous that failure would be the reward of an effective introduction of mona if that abhorred name should be properly invoked mrs gereth would resist to the death and before envenomed resistance owen would certainly retire his retirement would be into single life and fleda reflected that he had now gone away conscious of having practically told her so she could only say as she waited for the back road to disgorge that she hoped it was a consciousness he enjoyed there was something she enjoyed but that was a very different matter to know that she had become to him an object of desire gave her wings that she felt herself flutter in the air it was like the rush of a flood into her own accumulations these stored depths had been fathomless and still but now for half an hour in the empty house they spread till they overflowed he seemed to have made it right for her to confess to herself her secret strange then there should be for him in return nothing that such a confession could make right how could it make right that he should give up mona for another woman his attitude was a sorry appeal to fleda to legitimate that but he didnt believe it himself and he had none of the courage of his suggestion she could easily see how wrong everything must be when a man so made to be manly was wanting in courage she had upset him as people called it and he had spoken out from the force of the jar of finding her there he had upset her too heaven knew but she was one of those who could pick themselves up she had the real advantage she considered of having kept him from seeing that she had been overthrown  she had moreover at present completely recovered her feet though there was in the intensity of the effort required to do so a vibration which throbbed away into an immense allowance for the young man how could she after all know what in the disturbance wrought by his mother monas relations with him might have become if he had been able to keep his wits such as they were more about him he would probably have feltas sharply as she felt on his behalfthat so long as those relations were not ended he had no right to say even the little he had said he had no right to appear to wish to draw in another girl to help him to an escape if he was in a plight he must get out of the plight himself he must get out of it first and anything he should have to say to any one else must be deferred and detached she herself at any rateit was her own case that was in questioncouldnt dream of assisting him save in the sense of their common honor she could never be the girl to be drawn in she could never lift her finger against mona there was something in her that would make it a shame to her forever to have owed her happiness to an interference it would seem intolerably vulgar to her to have ousted the daughter of the brigstocks and merely to have abstained even wouldnt assure her that she had been straight nothing was really straight but to justify her little pensioned presence by her use and now won over as she was to heroism she could see her use only as some high and delicate deed she couldnt do anything at all in short unless she could do it with a kind of pride and there would be nothing to be proud of in having arranged for poor owen to get off easily nobody had a right to get off easily from pledges so deep so sacred how could fleda doubt they had been tremendous when she knew so well what any pledge of her own would be if mona was so formed that she could hold such vows light that was monas peculiar business to have loved owen apparently and yet to have loved him only so much only to the extent of a few tables and chairs was not a thing she could so much as try to grasp of a different way of loving him she was herself ready to give an instance an instance of which the beauty indeed would not be generally known it would not perhaps if revealed be generally understood inasmuch as the effect of the particular pressure she proposed to exercise would be should success attend it to keep him tied to an affection that had died a sudden and violent death even in the ardor of her meditation fleda remained in sight of the truth that it would be an odd result of her magnanimity to prevent her friends shaking off a woman he disliked if he didnt dislike mona what was the matter with him and if he did fleda asked what was the matter with her own silly self  our young lady met this branch of the temptation it pleased her frankly to recognize by declaring that to encourage any such cruelty would be tortuous and base she had nothing to do with his dislikes she had only to do with his goodnature and his good name she had joy of him just as he was but it was of these things she had the greatest the worst aversion and the liveliest reaction moreover wouldnt alter the factsince one was facing factsthat but the other day his strong arms must have clasped a remarkably handsome girl as close as she had permitted fledas emotion at this time was a wondrous mixture in which monas permissions and monas beauty figured powerfully as aids to reflection she herself had no beauty and her permissions were the stony stares she had just practiced in the drawingrooma consciousness of a kind appreciably to add to the particular sense of triumph that made her generous i may not perhaps too much diminish the merit of that generosity if i mention that it could take the flight we are considering just because really with the telescope of her long thought fleda saw what might bring her out of the wood mona herself would bring her out at the least mona possibly might deep down plunged the idea that even should she achieve what she had promised owen there was still the contingency of monas independent action she might by that time under stress of temper or of whatever it was that was now moving her have said or done the things there is no patching up if the rupture should come from waterbath they might all be happy yet this was a calculation that fleda wouldnt have committed to paper but it affected the total of her sentiments she was meanwhile so remarkably constituted that while she refused to profit by owens mistake even while she judged it and hastened to cover it up she could drink a sweetness from it that consorted little with her wishing it mightnt have been made there was no harm done because he had instinctively known poor dear with whom to make it and it was a compensation for seeing him worried that he hadnt made it with some horrid mean girl who would immediately have dished him by making a still bigger one their protected error for she indulged a fancy that it was hers too was like some dangerous lovely living thing that she had caught and could keepkeep vivid and helpless in the cage of her own passion and look at and talk to all day long she had got it well locked up there by the time that from an upper window she saw mrs gereth again in the garden at this she went down to meet her     x   fledas line had been taken her word was quite ready on the terrace of the painted pots she broke out before her interlocutress could put a question his errand was perfectly simple he came to demand that you shall pack everything straight up again and send it back as fast as the railway will carry it  the back road had apparently been fatiguing to mrs gereth she rose there rather white and wan with her walk a certain sharp thinness was in her ejaculation of ohafter which she glanced about her for a place to sit down the movement was a criticism of the order of events that offered such a piece of news to a lady coming in tired but fleda could see that in turning over the possibilities this particular peril was the one that during the last hour her friend had turned up oftenest at the end of the short gray day which had been moist and mild the sun was out the terrace looked to the south and a bench formed as to legs and arms of iron representing knotted boughs stood against the warmest wall of the house the mistress of ricks sank upon it and presented to her companion the handsome face she had composed to hear everything strangely enough it was just this fine vessel of her attention that made the girl most nervous about what she must drop in quite a demand dear is it asked mrs gereth drawing in her cloak  oh thats what i should call it fleda laughed to her own surprise  i mean with the threat of enforcement and that sort of thing  distinctly with the threat of enforcementwhat would be called i suppose coercion  what sort of coercion said mrs gereth  why legal dont you knowwhat he calls setting the lawyers at you  is that what he calls it she seemed to speak with disinterested curiosity  thats what he calls it said fleda  mrs gereth considered an instant oh the lawyers she exclaimed lightly seated there almost cosily in the reddening winter sunset only with her shoulders raised a little and her mantle tightened as if from a slight chill she had never yet looked to fleda so much in possession nor so far from meeting unsuspectedness halfway is he going to send them down here  i dare say he thinks it may come to that  the lawyers can scarcely do the packing mrs gereth humorously remarked  i suppose he means themin the first place at leastto try to talk you over  in the first place eh and what does he mean in the second  fleda hesitated she had not foreseen that so simple an inquiry could disconcert her im afraid i dont know  didnt you ask mrs gereth spoke as if she might have said what then were you doing all the while  i didnt ask very much said her companion he has been gone some time the great thing seemed to be to understand clearly that he wouldnt be content with anything less than what he mentioned  my just giving everything back  your just giving everything back  well darling what did you tell him mrs gereth blandly inquired  fleda faltered again wincing at the term of endearment at what the words took for granted charged with the confidence she had now committed herself to betray i told him i would tell you she smiled but she felt that her smile was rather hollow and even that mrs gereth had begun to look at her with some fixedness  did he seem very angry  he seemed very sad he takes it very hard fleda added  and how does she take it  ah thatthat i felt a delicacy about asking  so you didnt ask the words had the note of surprise  fleda was embarrassed she had not made up her mind definitely to lie i didnt think youd care that small untruth she would risk  welli dont mrs gereth declared and fleda felt less guilty to hear her for the statement was as inexact as her own didnt you say anything in return mrs gereth presently continued  do you mean in the way of justifying you  i didnt mean to trouble you to do that my justification said mrs gereth sitting there warmly and in the lucidity of her thought which nevertheless hung back a little dropping her eyes on the gravelmy justification was all the past my justification was the cruelty but at this with a short sharp gesture she checked herself its too good of me to talknow she produced these sentences with a cold patience as if addressing fleda in the girls virtual and actual character of owens representative our young lady crept to and fro before the bench combating the sense that it was occupied by a judge looking at her boottoes reminding herself in doing so of mona and lightly crunching the pebbles as she walked she moved about because she was afraid putting off from moment to moment the exercise of the courage she had been sure she possessed that courage would all come to her if she could only be equally sure that what she should be called upon to do for owen would be to suffer she had wondered while mrs gereth spoke how that lady would describe her justification she had described it as if to be irreproachably fair give her adversary the benefit of every doubt and then dismiss the question forever of course mrs gereth went on if we didnt succeed in showing him at poynton the ground we took its simply that he shuts his eyes what i supposed was that you would have given him your opinion that if i was the woman so signally to assert myself im also the woman to rest upon it imperturbably enough  fleda stopped in front of her hostess i gave him my opinion that youre very logical very obstinate and very proud  quite right my dear im a rank bigotabout that sort of thing and mrs gereth jerked her head at the contents of the house ive never denied it id kidnapto save them to convert themthe children of heretics when i know im right i go to the stake oh he may burn me alive she cried with a happy face did he abuse me she then demanded  fleda had remained there gathering in her purpose how little you know him  mrs gereth stared then broke into a laugh that her companion had not expected ah my dear certainly not so well as you the girl at this turned away againshe felt she looked too conscious and she was aware that during a pause mrs gereths eyes watched her as she went she faced about afresh to meet them but what she met was a question that reinforced them why had you a delicacy as to speaking of mona  she stopped again before the bench and an inspiration came to her i should think you would know she said with proper dignity  blankness was for a moment on mrs gereths brow then light brokeshe visibly remembered the scene in the breakfastroom after monas night at poynton because i contrasted youtold him you were the one her eyes looked deep you wereyou are still  fleda gave a bold dramatic laugh thank you my lovewith all the best things at ricks  mrs gereth considered trying to penetrate as it seemed but at last she brought out roundly for you you know id send them back  the girls heart gave a tremendous bound the right way dawned upon her in a flash obscurity indeed the next moment engulfed this course but for a few thrilled seconds she had understood to send the things back for her meant of course to send them back if there were even a dim chance that she might become mistress of them fledas palpitation was not allayed as she asked herself what portent mrs gereth had suddenly perceived of such a chance that perception could come only from a sudden suspicion of her secret this suspicion in turn was a tolerably straight consequence of that implied view of the propriety of surrender from which she was well aware she could say nothing to dissociate herself what she first felt was that if she wished to rescue the spoils she wished also to rescue her secret so she looked as innocent as she could and said as quickly as possible for me why in the world for me  because youre so awfully keen  am i do i strike you so you know i hate him fleda went on  she had the sense for a while of mrs gereths regarding her with the detachment of some stern clever stranger then whats the matter with you why do you want me to give in  fleda hesitated she felt herself reddening ive only said your son wants it i havent said i do  then say it and have done with it  this was more peremptory than any word her friend though often speaking in her presence with much point had ever yet directly addressed to her it affected her like the crack of a whip but she confined herself with an effort to taking it as a reminder that she must keep her head i know he has his engagement to carry out  his engagement to marry why its just that engagement we loathe  why should i loathe it fleda asked with a strained smile then before mrs gereth could reply she pursued im thinking of his general undertakingto give her the house as she originally saw it  to give her the house mrs gereth brought up the words from the depth of the unspeakable the effort was like the moan of an autumn wind it was in the power of such an image to make her turn pale  im thinking fleda continued of the simple question of his keeping faith on an important clause of his contract it doesnt matter whether its with a stupid girl or with a monster of cleverness im thinking of his honor and his good name  the honor and good name of a man you hate  certainly the girl resolutely answered i dont see why you should talk as if one had a petty mind you dont think so its not on that assumption youve ever dealt with me i can do your son justice as he put his case to me  ah then he did put his case to you mrs gereth exclaimed with an accent of triumph you seemed to speak just now as if really nothing of any consequence had passed between you  something always passes when one has a little imagination our young lady declared  i take it you dont mean that owen has any mrs gereth cried with her large laugh  fleda was silent a moment no i dont mean that owen has any she returned at last  why is it you hate him so her hostess abruptly inquired  should i love him for all he has made you suffer  mrs gereth slowly rose at this and coming across the walk took her young friend in her arms and kissed her she then passed into one of fledas an arm perversely and imperiously sociable let us move a little she said holding her close and giving a slight shiver they strolled along the terrace and she brought out another question he was eloquent then poor dearhe poured forth the story of his wrongs  fleda smiled down at her companion who cloaked and perceptibly bowed leaned on her heavily and gave her an odd unwonted sense of age and cunning she took refuge in an evasion he couldnt tell me anything that i didnt know pretty well already  its very true that you know everything no dear you havent a petty mind youve a lovely imagination and youre the nicest creature in the world if you were inane like most girlslike every one in facti would have insulted you i would have outraged you and then you would have fled from me in terror no now that i think of it mrs gereth went on you wouldnt have fled from me nothing on the contrary would have made you budge you would have cuddled into your warm corner but you would have been wounded and weeping and martyrized and you would have taken every opportunity to tell people im a bruteas indeed i should have been they went to and fro and she would not allow fleda who laughed and protested to attenuate with any light civility this spirited picture she praised her cleverness and her patience then she said it was getting cold and dark and they must go in to tea she delayed quitting the place however and reverted instead to owens ultimatum about which she asked another question or two in particular whether it had struck fleda that he really believed she would comply with such a summons  i think he really believes that if i try hard enough i can make you after uttering which words our young lady stopped short and emulated the embrace she had received a few moments before  and youve promised to try i see you didnt tell me that either mrs gereth added as they went on but youre rascal enough for anything while fleda was occupied in thinking in what terms she could explain why she had indeed been rascal enough for the reticence thus denounced her companion broke out with an inquiry somewhat irrelevant and even in form somewhat profane why the devil at any rate doesnt it come off  fleda hesitated you mean their marriage  of course i mean their marriage fleda hesitated again i havent the least idea  you didnt ask him  oh how in the world can you fancy she spoke in a shocked tone  fancy your putting a question so indelicate i should have put iti mean in your place but im quite coarse thank god fleda felt privately that she herself was coarse or at any rate would presently have to be and mrs gereth with a purpose that struck the girl as increasing continued what then was the day to be wasnt it just one of these  im sure i dont remember  it was part of the great rupture and an effect of mrs gereths character that up to this moment she had been completely and haughtily indifferent to that detail now however she had a visible reason for being clear about it she bethought herself and she broke outisnt the day past then stopping short she added upon my word they must have put it off as fleda made no answer to this she sharply went on have they put it off  i havent the least idea said the girl  her hostess was looking at her hard again didnt he tell youdidnt he say anything about it  fleda meanwhile had had time to make her reflections which were moreover the continued throb of those that had occupied the interval between owens departure and his mothers return if she should now repeat his words this wouldnt at all play the game of her definite vow it would only play the game of her little gagged and blinded desire she could calculate well enough the effect of telling mrs gereth how she had had it from owens troubled lips that mona was only waiting for the restitution and would do nothing without it the thing was to obtain the restitution without imparting that knowledge the only way also not to impart it was not to tell any truth at all about it and the only way to meet this last condition was to reply to her companion as she presently did he told me nothing whatever he didnt touch on the subject  not in any way  not in any way  mrs gereth watched fleda and considered you havent any idea if they are waiting for the things  how should i have im not in their counsels  i dare say they areor that mona is mrs gereth reflected again she had a bright idea if i dont give in ill be hanged if shell not break off  shell never never break off said fleda  are you sure  i cant be sure but its my belief  derived from him  the girl hung fire a few seconds derived from him  mrs gereth gave her a long last look then turned abruptly away its an awful bore you didnt really get it out of him well come to tea she added rather dryly passing straight into the house     xi   the sense of her adversarys dryness which was ominous of something she couldnt read made fleda before complying linger a little on the terrace she felt the need moreover of taking breath after such a flight into the cold air of denial when at last she rejoined mrs gereth she found her erect before the drawingroom fire their tea had been set out in the same quarter and the mistress of the house for whom the preparation of it was in general a high and undelegated function was in an attitude to which the hissing urn made no appeal this omission for fleda was such a further sign of something to come that to disguise her apprehension she immediately and without an apology took the duty in hand only however to be promptly reminded that she was performing it confusedly and not counting the journeys of the little silver shovel she emptied into the pot not five my dearthe usual three said her hostess with the same dryness watching her then in silence while she clumsily corrected her mistake the tea took some minutes to draw and mrs gereth availed herself of them suddenly to exclaim you havent yet told me you know how it is you propose to make me  give everything back fleda looked into the pot again and uttered her question with a briskness that she felt to be a little overdone why by putting the question well before you by being so eloquent that i shall persuade you shall act upon you by making you sorry for having gone so far she said boldly by simply and earnestly asking it of you in short and by reminding you at the same time that its the first thing i ever have so asked oh youve done things for meendless and beautiful things she exclaimed but youve done them all from your own generous impulse ive never so much as hinted to you to lend me a postagestamp  give me a cup of tea said mrs gereth a moment later taking the cup she replied no youve never asked me for a postagestamp  that gives me a pull fleda returned smiling  puts you in the situation of expecting that i shall do this thing just simply to oblige you  the girl hesitated you said a while ago that for me you would do it  for you but not for your eloquence do you understand what i mean by the difference mrs gereth asked as she stood stirring her tea  fleda to postpone answering looked round while she drank it at the beautiful room i dont in the least like you know your having taken so much it was a great shock to me on my arrival here to find you had done so  give me some more tea said mrs gereth and there was a moments silence as fleda poured out another cup if you were shocked my dear im bound to say you concealed your shock  i know i did i was afraid to show it  mrs gereth drank off her second cup and youre not afraid now  no im not afraid now  what has made the difference  ive pulled myself together fleda paused then she added and ive seen mr owen  youve seen mr owenmrs gereth concurred she put down her cup and sank into a chair in which she leaned back resting her head and gazing at her young friend yes i did tell you a while ago that for you id do it but you havent told me yet what youll do in return  fleda thought an instant anything in the wide world you may require  oh anything is nothing at all thats too easily said mrs gereth reclining more completely closed her eyes with an air of disgust an air indeed of inviting slumber  fleda looked at her quiet face which the appearance of slumber always made particularly handsome she noted how much the ordeal of the last few weeks had added to its indications of age well then try me with something what is it you demand  at this opening her eyes mrs gereth sprang straight up get him away from her  fleda marveled her companion had in an instant become young again away from mona how in the world  by not looking like a fool cried mrs gereth very sharply she kissed her however on the spot to make up for this roughness and summarily took off her hat which on coming into the house our young lady had not removed she applied a friendly touch to the girls hair and gave a businesslike pull to her jacket i say dont look like an idiot because you happen not to be one not the least bit im idiotic ive been so ive just discovered ever since our first days together ive been a precious donkey but thats another affair  fleda as if she humbly assented went through no form of controverting this she simply stood passive to her companions sudden refreshment of her appearance how can i get him away from her she presently demanded  by letting yourself go  by letting myself go she spoke mechanically still more like an idiot and felt as if her face flamed out the insincerity of her question it was vividly back again the vision of the real way to act upon mrs gereth this ladys movements were now rapid she turned off from her as quickly as she had seized her and fleda sat down to steady herself for full responsibility  her hostess without taking up her ejaculation gave a violent poke at the fire and then faced her again youve done two things then todayhavent youthat youve never done before one has been asking me the service or favor or concessionwhatever you call itthat you just mentioned the other has been telling mecertainly too for the first timean immense little fib  an immense little fib fleda felt weak she was glad of the support of her seat  an immense big one then said mrs gereth irritatedly you dont in the least hate owen my darling you care for him very much in fact my own youre in love with himthere dont tell me any more lies cried mrs gereth with a voice and a face in the presence of which fleda recognized that there was nothing for her but to hold herself and take them when once the truth was out it was out and she could see more and more every instant that it would be the only way she accepted therefore what had to come she leaned back her head and closed her eyes as her companion had done just before she would have covered her face with her hands but for the still greater shame oh youre a wonder a wonder said mrs gereth youre magnificent and i was right as soon as i saw you to pick you out and trust you fleda closed her eyes tighter at this last word but her friend kept it up i never dreamed of it till a while ago when after he had come and gone we were face to face then something stuck out of you it strongly impressed me and i didnt know at first quite what to make of it it was that you had just been with him and that you were not natural not natural to me she added with a smile i pricked up my ears and all that this might mean dawned upon me when you said you had asked nothing about mona it put me on the scent but i didnt show you did i i felt it was in you deep down and that i must draw it out well i have drawn it and its a blessing yesterday when you shed tears at breakfast i was awfully puzzled what has been the matter with you all the while why fleda it isnt a crime dont you know that cried the delighted woman when i was a girl i was always in love and not always with such nice people as owen i didnt behave as well as you compared with you i think i must have been horrid but if youre proud and reserved its your own affair im proud too though im not reservedthats what spoils it im stupid above allthats what i am so dense that i really blush for it however no one but you could have deceived me if i trusted you moreover it was exactly to be cleverer than myself you must be so now more than ever suddenly fleda felt her hands grasped mrs gereth had plumped down at her feet and was leaning on her knees save himsave him you can she passionately pleaded how could you not like him when hes such a dear he is a dear darling theres no harm in my own boy you can do what you will with himyou know you can what else does he give us all this time for get him away from her its as if he besought you to poor wretch dont abandon him to such a fate and ill never abandon you think of him with that creature that future if youll take him ill give up everything there its a solemn promise the most sacred of my life get the better of her and he shall have every stick i removed give me your word and ill accept it ill write for the packers tonight  fleda before this had fallen forward on her companions neck and the two women clinging together had got up while the younger wailed on the others bosom you smooth it down because you see more in it than there can ever be but after my hideous double game how will you be able to believe in me again  i see in it simply what must be if youve a single spark of pity where on earth was the double game when youve behaved like such a saint youve been beautiful youve been exquisite and all our trouble is over  fleda drying her eyes shook her head ever so sadly no mrs gereth it isnt over i cant do what you aski cant meet your condition  mrs gereth stared the cloud gathered in her face again why in the name of goodness when you adore him i know what you see in him she declared in another tone youre right  fleda gave a faint stubborn smile he cares for her too much  then why doesnt he marry her hes giving you an extraordinary chance  he doesnt dream ive ever thought of him said fleda why should he if you didnt  it wasnt with me you were in love my duck then mrs gereth added ill go and tell him  if you do any such thing you shall never see me againabsolutely literally never  mrs gereth looked hard at her young friend showing she saw she must believe her then youre perverse youre wicked will you swear he doesnt know  of course he doesnt know cried fleda indignantly  her interlocutress was silent a little and that he has no feeling on his side  for me fleda stared before he has even married her  mrs gereth gave a sharp laugh at this he ought at least to appreciate your wit oh my dear you are a treasure doesnt he appreciate anything has he given you absolutely no symptomnot looked a look not breathed a sigh  the case said fleda coldly is as ive had the honor to state it  then hes as big a donkey as his mother but you know you must account for their delay mrs gereth remarked  why must i fleda asked after a moment  because you were closeted with him here so long you cant pretend at present you know not to have any art  the girl hesitated an instant she was conscious that she must choose between two risks she had had a secret and the secret was gone owen had one which was still unbruised and the greater risk now was that his mother should lay her formidable hand upon it all fledas tenderness for him moved her to protect it so she faced the smaller peril their delay she brought herself to reply may perhaps be monas doing i mean because he has lost her the things  mrs gereth jumped at this so that shell break altogether if i keep them  fleda winced ive told you what i believe about that shell make scenes and conditions shell worry him but shell hold him fast shell never give him up  mrs gereth turned it over well ill keep them to try her she finally pronounced at which fleda felt quite sick as if she had given everything and got nothing     xii   i must in common decency let him know that ive talked of the matter with you she said to her hostess that evening what answer do you wish me to write to him  write to him that you must see him again said mrs gereth  fleda looked very blank what on earth am i to see him for  for anything you like  the girl would have been struck with the levity of this had she not already in an hour felt the extent of the change suddenly wrought in her commerce with her friendwrought above all to that friends view in her relation to the great issue the effect of what had followed owens visit was to make that relation the very key of the crisis pressed upon her goodness knew the crisis had been but it now seemed to put forth big encircling armsarms that squeezed till they hurt and she must cry out it was as if everything at ricks had been poured into a common receptacle a public ferment of emotion and zeal out of which it was ladled up to be tasted and talked about everything at least but the one little treasure of knowledge that she kept back she ought to have liked this she reflected because it meant sympathy meant a closer union with the source of so much in her life that had been beautiful and renovating but there were fine instincts in her that stood off she had hadand it was not merely at this timeto recognize that there were things for which mrs gereths flair was not so happy as for bargains and marks it wouldnt be happy now as to the best action on the knowledge she had just gained yet as from this moment they were still more intimately together so a person deeply in her debt would simply have to stand and meet what was to come there were ways in which she could sharply incommode such a person and not only with the best conscience in the world but with a sort of brutality of good intentions one of the straightest of these strokes fleda saw would be the dance of delight over the mystery mrs gereth had laid barethe loud lawful tactless joy of the explorer leaping upon the strand like any other lucky discoverer she would take possession of the fortunate island she was nothing if not practical almost the only thing she took account of in her young friends soft secret was the excellent use she could make of ita use so much to her taste that she refused to feel a hindrance in the quality of the material fleda put into mrs gereths answer to her question a good deal more meaning than it would have occurred to her a few hours before that she was prepared to put but she had on the spot a foreboding that even so broad a hint would live to be bettered  do you suggest that i shall propose to him to come down here again she presently inquired  dear no say that youll go up to town and meet him it was bettered the broad hint and fleda felt this to be still more the case when returning to the subject before they went to bed her companion said i make him over to you wholly you knowto do what you please with deal with him in your own clever wayi ask no questions all i ask is that you succeed  thats charming fleda replied but it doesnt tell me a bit youll be so good as to consider in what terms to write to him its not an answer from you to the message i was to give you  the answer to his message is perfectly distinct he shall have everything in the place the minute hell say hell marry you  you really pretend fleda asked to think me capable of transmitting him that news  what else can i really pretend when you threaten so to cast me off if i speak the word myself  oh if you speak the word the girl murmured very gravely but happy at least to know that in this direction mrs gereth confessed herself warned and helpless then she added how can i go on living with you on a footing of which i so deeply disapprove thinking as i do that youve despoiled him far more than is just or mercifulfor if i expected you to take something i didnt in the least expect you to take everythinghow can i stay here without a sense that im backing you up in your cruelty and participating in your illgotten gains fleda was determined that if she had the chill of her exposed and investigated state she would also have the convenience of it and that if mrs gereth popped in and out of the chamber of her soul she would at least return the freedom i shall quite hate you know in a day or two every object that surrounds youbecome blind to all the beauty and rarity that i formerly delighted in dont think me harsh theres no use in my not being frank now if i leave you everythings at an end  mrs gereth however was imperturbable fleda had to recognize that her advantage had become too real its too beautiful the way you care for him its music in my ears nothing else but such a passion could make you say such things thats the way i should have been too my dear why didnt you tell me sooner id have gone right in for you i never would have moved a candlestick dont stay with me if it torments you dont if you suffer be where you see the old rubbish go up to towngo back for a little to your fathers it need be only for a little two or three weeks will see us through your father will take you and be glad if you only will make him understand what its a question ofof your getting yourself off his hands forever ill make him understand you know if you feel shy id take you up myself id go with you to spare your being bored wed put up at an hotel and we might amuse ourselves a bit we havent had much pleasure since we met have we but of course that wouldnt suit our book i should be a bugaboo to oweni should be fatally in the way your chance is thereyour chance is to be alone for gods sake use it to the right end if youre in want of money ive a little i can give you but i ask no questionsnot a question as small as your shoe  she asked no questions but she took the most extraordinary things for granted fleda felt this still more at the end of a couple of days on the second of these our young lady wrote to owen her emotion had to a certain degree cleared itselfthere was something she could say briefly if she had given everything to mrs gereth and as yet got nothing so she had on the other hand quickly reactedit took but a nightagainst the discouragement of her first check her desire to serve him was too passionate the sense that he counted upon her too sweet these things caught her up again and gave her a new patience and a new subtlety it shouldnt really be for nothing that she had given so much deep within her burned again the resolve to get something back so what she wrote to owen was simply that she had had a great scene with his mother but that he must be patient and give her time it was difficult as they both had expected but she was working her hardest for him she had made an impressionshe would do everything to follow it up meanwhile he must keep intensely quiet and take no other steps he must only trust her and pray for her and believe in her perfect loyalty she made no allusion whatever to monas attitude nor to his not being as regarded that young lady master of the situation but she said in a postscript in reference to his mother of course she wonders a good deal why your marriage doesnt take place after the letter had gone she regretted having used the word loyalty there were two or three milder terms which she might as well have employed the answer she immediately received from owen was a little note of which she met all the deficiencies by describing it to herself as pathetically simple but which to prove that mrs gereth might ask as many questions as she liked she at once made his mother read he had no art with his pen he had not even a good hand and his letter a short profession of friendly confidence consisted of but a few familiar and colorless words of acknowledgment and assent the gist of it was that he would certainly since miss vetch recommended it not hurry mamma too much he would not for the present cause her to be approached by any one else but he would nevertheless continue to hope that she would see she must come round of course you know he added she cant keep me waiting indefinitely please give her my love and tell her that if it can be done peaceably i know youre just the one to do it  fleda had awaited his rejoinder in deep suspense such was her imagination of the possibility of his having as she tacitly phrased it let himself go on paper that when it arrived she was at first almost afraid to open it there was indeed a distinct danger for if he should take it into his head to write her loveletters the whole chance of aiding him would drop she would have to return them she would have to decline all further communication with him it would be quite the end of the business this imagination of fledas was a faculty that easily embraced all the heights and depths and extremities of things that made a single mouthful in particular of any tragic or desperate necessity she was perhaps at first just a trifle disappointed not to find in the note in question a syllable that strayed from the text but the next moment she had risen to a point of view from which it presented itself as a production almost inspired in its simplicity it was simple even for owen and she wondered what had given him the cue to be more so than usual then she saw how natures that are right just do the things that are right he wasnt cleverhis manner of writing showed it but the cleverest man in england couldnt have had more the instinct that under the circumstances was the supremely happy one the instinct of giving her something that would do beautifully to be shown to mrs gereth this was a kind of divination for naturally he couldnt know the line mrs gereth was taking it was furthermore explainedand that was the most touching part of allby his wish that she herself should notice how awfully well he was behaving his very bareness called her attention to his virtue and these were the exact fruits of her beautiful and terrible admonition he was cleaving to mona he was doing his duty he was making tremendously sure he should be without reproach  if fleda handed this communication to her friend as a triumphant gage of the innocence of the young mans heart her elation lived but a moment after mrs gereth had pounced upon the telltale spot in it why in the world then that lady cried does he still not breathe a breath about the day the day the day she repeated the word with a crescendo of superior acuteness she proclaimed that nothing could be more marked than its absencean absence that simply spoke volumes what did it prove in fine but that she was producing the effect she had toiled forthat she had settled or was rapidly settling mona  such a challenge fleda was obliged in some manner to take up you may be settling mona she returned with a smile but i can hardly regard it as sufficient evidence that youre settling monas lover  why not with such a studied omission on his part to gloss over in any manner the painful tension existing between themthe painful tension that under providence ive been the means of bringing about he gives you by his silence clear notice that his marriage is practically off  he speaks to me of the only thing that concerns me he gives me clear notice that he abates not one jot of his demand  well then let him take the only way to get it satisfied  fleda had no need to ask again what such a way might be nor was her support removed by the fine assurance with which mrs gereth could make her argument wait upon her wish these days which dragged their length into a strange uncomfortable fortnight had already borne more testimony to that element than all the other time the two women had passed together our young lady had been at first far from measuring the whole of a feature that owen himself would probably have described as her companions cheek she lived now in a kind of bath of boldness felt as if a fierce light poured in upon her from windows opened wide and the singular part of the ordeal was that she couldnt protest against it fully without incurring even to her own mind some reproach of ingratitude some charge of smallness if mrs gereths apparent determination to hustle her into owens arms was accompanied with an air of holding her dignity rather cheap this was after all only as a consequence of her being held in respect to some other attributes rather dear it was a new version of the old story of being kicked upstairs the wonderful woman was the same woman who in the summer at poynton had been so puzzled to conceive why a goodnatured girl shouldnt have contributed more to the personal rout of the brigstocksshouldnt have been grateful even for the handsome puff of fleda vetch only her passion was keener now and her scruple more absent the fight made a demand upon her and her pugnacity had become one with her constant habit of using such weapons as she could pick up she had no imagination about anybodys life save on the side she bumped against fleda was quite aware that she would have otherwise been a rare creature but a rare creature was originally just what she had struck her as being mrs gereth had really no perception of anybodys naturehad only one question about persons were they clever or stupid to be clever meant to know the marks fleda knew them by direct inspiration and a warm recognition of this had been her friends tribute to her character the girl had hours now of sombre wishing that she might never see anything good again that kind of experience was evidently not an infallible source of peace she would be more at peace in some vulgar little place that should owe its cachet to tottenham court road there were nice strong horrors in west kensington it was as if they beckoned her and wooed her back to them she had a relaxed recollection of waterbath and of her reasons for staying on at ricks the force was rapidly ebbing one of these was her pledge to owenher vow to press his mother close the other was the fact that of the two discomforts that of being prodded by mrs gereth and that of appearing to run after somebody else the former remained for a while the more endurable  as the days passed however it became plainer to fleda that her only chance of success would be in lending herself to this low appearance then moreover at last her nerves settling the question the choice was simply imposed by the violence done to her tasteto whatever was left of that high principle at least after the free and reckless meeting for months of great drafts and appeals it was all very well to try to evade discussion owen gereth was looking to her for a struggle and it wasnt a bit of a struggle to be disgusted and dumb she was on too strange a footingthat of having presented an ultimatum and having had it torn up in her face in such a case as that the envoy always departed he never sat gaping and dawdling before the city mrs gereth every morning looked publicly into the morning post the only newspaper she received and every morning she treated the blankness of that journal as fresh evidence that everything was off what did the post exist for but to tell you your children were wretchedly marriedso that if such a source of misery was dry what could you do but infer that for once you had miraculously escaped she almost taunted fleda with supineness in not getting something out of somebodyin the same breath indeed in which she drenched her with a kind of appreciation more onerous to the girl than blame mrs gereth herself had of course washed her hands of the matter but fleda knew people who knew mona and would be sure to be in her confidenceinconceivable people who admired her and had the privilege of waterbath what was the use therefore of being the most natural and the easiest of letterwriters if no sort of sidelightin some pretext for correspondencewas by a brilliant creature to be got out of such barbarians fleda was not only a brilliant creature but she heard herself commended in these days for new and strange attractions she figured suddenly in the queer conversations of ricks as a distinguished almost as a dangerous beauty that retouching of her hair and dress in which her friend had impulsively indulged on a first glimpse of her secret was by implication very frequently repeated she had the sense not only of being advertised and offered but of being counseled and enlightened in ways that she scarcely understoodarts obscure even to a poor girl who had had in good society and motherless poverty to look straight at realities and fill out blanks  these arts when mrs gereths spirits were high were handled with a brave and cynical humor with which fledas fancy could keep no step they left our young lady wondering what on earth her companion wanted her to do i want you to cut inthat was mrs gereths familiar and comprehensive phrase for the course she prescribed she challenged again and again fledas picture as she called it though the sketch was too slight to deserve the name of the indifference to which a prior attachment had committed the proprietor of poynton do you mean to say that mona or no mona he could see you that way day after day and not have the ordinary feelings of a man this was the sort of interrogation to which fleda was fitfully and irrelevantly treated she had grown almost used to the refrain do you mean to say that when the other day one had quite made you over to him the great gawk and he was on this very spot utterly alone with you the poor girl at this point never left any doubt of what she meant to say but mrs gereth could be trusted to break out in another place and at another time at last fleda wrote to her father that he must take her in for a while and when to her companions delight she returned to london that lady went with her to the station and wafted her on her way the morning post had been delivered as they left the house and mrs gereth had brought it with her for the traveler who never spent a penny on a newspaper on the platform however when this young person was ticketed labeled and seated she opened it at the window of the carriage exclaiming as usual after looking into it a moment nothingnothingnothing dont tell me every day that there was nothing was a nail in the coffin of the marriage an instant later the train was off but moving quickly beside it while fleda leaned inscrutably forth mrs gereth grasped her friends hand and looked up with wonderful eyes only let yourself go darlingonly let yourself go     xiii   that she desired to ask no questions mrs gereth conscientiously proved by closing her lips tight after fleda had gone to london no letter from ricks arrived at west kensington and fleda with nothing to communicate that could be to the taste of either party forbore to open a correspondence if her heart had been less heavy she might have been amused to perceive how much rope this reticence of ricks seemed to signify to her that she could take she had at all events no good news for her friend save in the sense that her silence was not bad news she was not yet in a position to write that she had cut in but neither on the other hand had she gathered material for announcing that mona was undisseverable from her prey she had made no use of the pen so glorified by mrs gereth to wake up the echoes of waterbath she had sedulously abstained from inquiring what in any quarter far or near was said or suggested or supposed she only spent a matutinal penny on the morning post she only saw on each occasion that that inspired sheet had as little to say about the imminence as about the abandonment of certain nuptials it was at the same time obvious that mrs gereth triumphed on these occasions much more than she trembled and that with a few such triumphs repeated she would cease to tremble at all what was most manifest however was that she had had a rare preconception of the circumstances that would have ministered had fleda been disposed to the girls cutting in it was brought home to fleda that these circumstances would have particularly favored intervention she was quickly forced to do them a secret justice one of the effects of her intimacy with mrs gereth was that she had quite lost all sense of intimacy with any one else the lady of ricks had made a desert around her possessing and absorbing her so utterly that other partakers had fallen away hadnt she been admonished months before that people considered they had lost her and were reconciled on the whole to the privation her present position in the great unconscious town defined itself as obscure she regarded it at any rate with eyes suspicious of that lesson she neither wrote notes nor received them she indulged in no reminders nor knocked at any doors she wandered vaguely in the western wilderness or cultivated shy forms of that household art for which she had had a respect before tasting the bitter tree of knowledge her only plan was to be as quiet as a mouse and when she failed in the attempt to lose herself in the flat suburb she felt like a lonely fly crawling over a dusty chart  how had mrs gereth known in advance that if she had chosen to be vile that was what fleda called it everything would happen to help herespecially the way her poor father after breakfast doddered off to his club showing seventy when he was really fiftyseven and leaving her richly alone for the day he came back about midnight looking at her very hard and not risking long wordsonly making her feel by inimitable touches that the presence of his family compelled him to alter all his hours she had in their common sittingroom the company of the objects he was fond of saying that he had collectedobjects shabby and battered of a sort that appealed little to his daughter old brandyflasks and matchboxes old calendars and handbooks intermixed with an assortment of penwipers and ashtrays a harvest he had gathered in from penny bazaars he was blandly unconscious of that side of fledas nature which had endeared her to mrs gereth and she had often heard him wish to goodness there was something striking she cared for why didnt she try collecting somethingit didnt matter what she would find it gave an interest to life and there was no end of little curiosities one could easily pick up he was conscious of having a taste for fine things which his children had unfortunately not inherited this indicated the limits of their acquaintance with himlimits which as fleda was now sharply aware could only leave him to wonder what the mischief she was there for as she herself echoed this question to the letter she was not in a position to clear up the mystery she couldnt have given a name to her errand in town or explained it save by saying that she had had to get away from ricks it was intensely provisional but what was to come next nothing could come next but a deeper anxiety she had neither a home nor an outlooknothing in all the wide world but a feeling of suspense  of course she had her dutyher duty to owena definite undertaking reaffirmed after his visit to ricks under her hand and seal but there was no sense of possession attached to that there was only a horrible sense of privation she had quite moved from under mrs gereths wide wing and now that she was really among the penwipers and ashtrays she was swept at the thought of all the beauty she had forsworn by short wild gusts of despair if her friend should really keep the spoils she would never return to her if that friend should on the other hand part with them what on earth would there be to return to the chill struck deep as fleda thought of the mistress of ricks reduced in vulgar parlance to what she had on her back there was nothing to which she could compare such an image but her idea of marie antoinette in the conciergerie or perhaps the vision of some tropical bird the creature of hot dense forests dropped on a frozen moor to pick up a living the minds eye could see mrs gereth indeed only in her thick colored air it took all the light of her treasures to make her concrete and distinct she loomed for a moment in any mere house gaunt and unnatural then she vanished as if she had suddenly sunk into a quicksand fleda lost herself in the rich fancy of how if she were mistress of poynton a whole province as an abode should be assigned there to the august queenmother she would have returned from her campaign with her baggagetrain and her loot and the palace would unbar its shutters and the morning flash back from its halls in the event of a surrender the poor woman would never again be able to begin to collect she was now too old and too moneyless and times were altered and good things impossibly dear a surrender furthermore to any daughterinlaw save an oddity like mona neednt at all be an abdication in fact any other fairly nice girl whom owen should have taken it into his head to marry would have been positively glad to have for the museum a custodian who was a walking catalogue and who understood beyond any one in england the hygiene and temperament of rare pieces a fairly nice girl would somehow be away a good deal and would at such times count it a blessing to feel mrs gereth at her post  fleda had fully recognized the first days that quite apart from any question of letting owen know where she was it would be a charity to give him some sign it would be weak it would be ugly to be diverted from that kindness by the fact that mrs gereth had attached a tinkling bell to it a frank relation with him was only superficially discredited she ought for his own sake to send him a word of cheer so she repeatedly reasoned but she as repeatedly delayed performance if her general plan had been to be as still as a mouse an interview like the interview at ricks would be an odd contribution to that ideal therefore with a confused preference of practice to theory she let the days go by she felt that nothing was so imperative as the gain of precious time she shouldnt be able to stay with her father forever but she might now reap the benefit of having married her sister maggies union had been built up round a small spare room concealed in this apartment she might try to paint again and abetted by the grateful maggiefor maggie at least was gratefulshe might try to dispose of her work she had not indeed struggled with a brush since her visit to waterbath where the sight of the family splotches had put her immensely on her guard poynton moreover had been an impossible place for producing no active art could flourish there but a buddhistic contemplation it had stripped its mistress clean of all feeble accomplishments her hands were imbrued neither with ink nor with watercolor close to fledas present abode was the little shop of a man who mounted and framed pictures and desolately dealt in artists materials she sometimes paused before it to look at a couple of shy experiments for which its dull window constituted publicity small studies placed there for sale and full of warning to a young lady without fortune and without talent some such young lady had brought them forth in sorrow some such young lady to see if they had been snapped up had passed and repassed as helplessly as she herself was doing they never had been they never would be snapped up yet they were quite above the actual attainment of some other young ladies it was a matter of discipline with fleda to take an occasional lesson from them besides which when she now quitted the house she had to look for reasons after she was out the only place to find them was in the shopwindows they made her feel like a servantgirl taking her afternoon but that didnt signify perhaps some day she would resemble such a person still more closely this continued a fortnight at the end of which the feeling was suddenly dissipated she had stopped as usual in the presence of the little pictures then as she turned away she had found herself face to face with owen gereth  at the sight of him two fresh waves passed quickly across her heart one at the heels of the other the first was an instant perception that this encounter was not an accident the second a consciousness as prompt that the best place for it was the street she knew before he told her that he had been to see her and the next thing she knew was that he had had information from his mother her mind grasped these things while he said with a smile i saw only your back but i was sure i was over the way ive been at your house  how came you to know my house fleda asked  i like that he laughed how came you not to let me know that you were there  fleda at this thought it best also to laugh since i didnt let you know why did you come  oh i say cried owen dont add insult to injury why in the world didnt you let me know i came because i want awfully to see you he hesitated then he added i got the tip from mother she has written to mefancy  they still stood where they had met fledas instinct was to keep him there the more so that she could already see him take for granted that they would immediately proceed together to her door he rose before her with a different air he looked less ruffled and bruised than he had done at ricks he showed a recovered freshness perhaps however this was only because she had scarcely seen him at all as yet in london form as he would have called itturned out as he was turned out in town in the country heated with the chase and splashed with the mire he had always rather reminded her of a picturesque peasant in national costume this costume as owen wore it varied from day to day it was as copious as the wardrobe of an actor but it never failed of suggestions of the earth and the weather the hedges and the ditches the beasts and the birds there had been days when it struck her as all nature in one pair of boots it didnt make him now another person that he was delicately dressed shining and splendidthat he had a higher hat and light gloves with black seams and a spearlike umbrella but it made him she soon decided really handsomer and that in turn gave himfor she never could think of him or indeed of some other things without the aid of his vocabularya tremendous pull yes this was for the moment as he looked at her the great fact of their situationhis pull was tremendous she tried to keep the acknowledgement of it from trembling in her voice as she said to him with more surprise than she really felt youve then reopened relations with her  its she who has reopened them with me i got her letter this morning she told me you were here and that she wished me to know it she didnt say much she just gave me your address i wrote her back you know thanks no end shall go today so we are in correspondence again arent we she means of course that youve something to tell me from her eh but if you have why havent you let a fellow know he waited for no answer to this he had so much to say at your house just now they told me how long youve been here havent you known all the while that im counting the hours i left a word for youthat i would be back at six but im awfully glad to have caught you so much sooner you dont mean to say youre not going home he exclaimed in dismay the young woman there told me you went out early  ive been out a very short time said fleda who had hung back with the general purpose of making things difficult for him the street would make them difficult she could trust the street she reflected in time however that to betray to him she was afraid to admit him would give him more a feeling of facility than of anything else she moved on with him after a moment letting him direct their course to her door which was only round a corner she considered as they went that it might not prove such a stroke to have been in london so long and yet not to have called him she desired he should feel she was perfectly simple with him and there was no simplicity in that none the less on the steps of the house though she had a key she rang the bell and while they waited together and she averted her face she looked straight into the depths of what mrs gereth had meant by giving him the tip this had been perfidious had been monstrous of mrs gereth and fleda wondered if her letter had contained only what owen repeated     xiv   when owen and fleda were in her fathers little place and among the brandyflasks and penwipers still more disconcerted and divided the girlto do something though it would make him stayhad ordered tea he put the letter before her quite as if he had guessed her thought shes still a bit nastyfancy he handed her the scrap of a note which he had pulled out of his pocket and from its envelope fleda vetch it ran is at 10 raphael road west kensington go to see her and try for gods sake to cultivate a glimmer of intelligence when in handing it back to him she took in his face she saw that its heightened color was the effect of his watching her read such an allusion to his want of wit fleda knew what it was an allusion to and his pathetic air of having received this buffet tall and fine and kind as he stood there made her conscious of not quite concealing her knowledge for a minute she was kept silent by an angered sense of the trick that had been played her it was a trick because fleda considered there had been a covenant and the trick consisted of mrs gereths having broken the spirit of their agreement while conforming in a fashion to the letter under the girls menace of a complete rupture she had been afraid to make of her secret the use she itched to make but in the course of these days of separation she had gathered pluck to hazard an indirect betrayal fleda measured her hesitations and the impulse which she had finally obeyed and which the continued procrastination of waterbath had encouraged had at last made irresistible if in her highhanded manner of playing their game she had not named the thing hidden she had named the hidingplace it was over the sense of this wrong that fledas lips closed tight she was afraid of aggravating her case by some ejaculation that would make owen prick up his ears a great quick effort however helped her to avoid the danger with her constant idea of keeping cool and repressing a visible flutter she found herself able to choose her words meanwhile he had exclaimed with his uncomfortable laugh thats a good one for me miss vetch isnt it  of course you know by this time that your mothers very sharp said fleda  i think i can understand well enough when i know whats to be understood the young man asserted but i hope you wont mind my saying that youve kept me pretty well in the dark about that ive been waiting waiting waiting so much has depended on your news if youve been working for me im afraid it has been a thankless job cant she say what shell do one way or the other i cant tell in the least where i am you know i havent really learnt from you since i saw you there where she is you wrote me to be patient and upon my soul i have been but im afraid you dont quite realize what im to be patient with at waterbath dont you know ive simply to account and answer for the damned things mona looks at me and waits and i hang it i look at you and do the same fleda had gathered fuller confidence as he continued so plain was it that she had succeeded in not dropping into his mind the spark that might produce the glimmer invoked by his mother but even this fine assurance gave a start when after an appealing pause he went on i hope you know that after all youre not keeping anything back from me  in the full face of what she was keeping back such a hope could only make her wince but she was prompt with her explanations in proportion as she felt they failed to meet him the smutty maid came in with teathings and fleda moving several objects eagerly accepted the diversion of arranging a place for them on one of the tables ive been trying to break your mother down because it has seemed there may be some chance of it thats why ive let you go on expecting it shes too proud to veer round all at once but i think i speak correctly in saying that ive made an impression  in spite of ordering tea she had not invited him to sit down she herself made a point of standing he hovered by the window that looked into raphael road she kept at the other side of the room the stunted slavey gazing wideeyed at the beautiful gentleman and either stupidly or cunningly bringing but one thing at a time came and went between the teatray and the open door  you pegged at her so hard owen asked  i explained to her fully your position and put before her much more strongly than she liked what seemed to me her absolute duty  owen waited a little and having done that you departed  fleda felt the full need of giving a reason for her departure but at first she only said with cheerful frankness i departed  her companion again looked at her in silence i thought you had gone to her for several months  well fleda replied i couldnt stay i didnt like it i didnt like it at alli couldnt bear it she went on in the midst of those trophies of poynton living with them touching them using them i felt as if i were backing her up as i was not a bit of an accomplice as i hate what she has done i didnt want to be even to the extent of the mere look of itwhat is it you call such peoplean accessory after the fact there was something she kept back so rigidly that the joy of uttering the rest was double she felt the sharpest need of giving him all the other truth there was a matter as to which she had deceived him and there was a matter as to which she had deceived mrs gereth but her lack of pleasure in deception as such came home to her now she busied herself with the tea and to extend the occupation cleared the table still more spreading out the coarse cups and saucers and the vulgar little plates she was aware that she produced more confusion than symmetry but she was also aware that she was violently nervous owen tried to help her with something this made rather for disorder my reason for not writing to you she pursued was simply that i was hoping to hear more from ricks ive waited from day to day for that  but youve heard nothing  not a word  then what i understand said owen is that practically you and mummy have quarreled and youve done iti mean you personallyfor me  oh no we havent quarreled a bit then with a smile weve only diverged  youve diverged uncommonly farowen laughed back fleda with her hideous crockery and her fathers collections could conceive that these objects to her visitors perception even more strongly than to her own measured the length of the swing from poynton and ricks she was aware too that her high standards figured vividly enough even to owens simplicity to make him reflect that west kensington was a tremendous fall if she had fallen it was because she had acted for him she was all the more content he should thus see she had acted as the cost of it in his eyes was none of her own showing what seems to have happened he exclaimed is that youve had a row with her and yet not moved her  fleda considered a moment she was full of the impression that notwithstanding her scant help he saw his way clearer than he had seen it at ricks he might mean many things and what if the many should mean in their turn only one the difficulty is you understand that she doesnt really see into your situation she hesitated she doesnt comprehend why your marriage hasnt yet taken place  owen stared why for the reason i told you that mona wont take another step till mother has given full satisfaction everything must be there you see everything was there the day of that fatal visit  yes thats what i understood from you at ricks said fleda but i havent repeated it to your mother she had hated at ricks to talk with him about mona but now that scruple was swept away if he could speak of monas visit as fatal she need at least not pretend not to notice it it made all the difference that she had tried to assist him and had failed to give him any faith in her service she must give him all her reasons but one she must give him in other words with a corresponding omission all mrs gereths you can easily see that as she dislikes your marriage anything that may seem to make it less certain works in her favor without my telling her she has suspicions and views that are simply suggested by your delay therefore it didnt seem to me right to make them worse by holding off long enough she thinks she may put an end to your engagement if monas waiting she believes she may at last tire mona out that in all conscience fleda felt was lucid enough  so the young man following her attentively appeared equally to feel so far as that goes he promptly declared she has at last tired mona out he uttered the words with a strange approach to hilarity  fledas surprise at this aberration left her a moment looking at him do you mean your marriage is off  owen answered with a kind of gay despair god knows miss vetch where or when or what my marriage is if it isnt off it certainly at the point things have reached isnt on i havent seen mona for ten days and for a week i havent heard from her she used to write me every week dont you know she wont budge from waterbath and i havent budged from town then he suddenly broke out if she does chuck me will mother come round  fleda at this felt that her heroism had come to its real testfelt that in telling him the truth she should effectively raise a hand to push his impediment out of the way was the knowledge that such a motion would probably dispose forever of mona capable of yielding to the conception of still giving her every chance she was entitled to that conception was heroic but at the same moment it reminded fleda of the place it had held in her plan she was also reminded of the not less urgent claim of the truth ah the truththere was a limit to the impunity with which one could juggle with it wasnt what she had most to remember the fact that owen had a right to his property and that he had also her vow to stand by him in the effort to recover it how did she stand by him if she hid from him the single way to recover it of which she was quite sure for an instant that seemed to her the fullest of her life she debated yes she said at last if your marriage is really abandoned she will give up everything she has taken  thats just what makes mona hesitate owen honestly exclaimed i mean the idea that i shall get back the things only if she gives me up  fleda thought an instant you mean makes her hesitate to keep younot hesitate to renounce you  owen looked a trifle bewildered she doesnt see the use of hanging on as i havent even yet put the matter into legal hands shes awfully keen about that and awfully disgusted that i dont she says its the only real way and she thinks im afraid to take it she has given me time and then has given me again more she says i give mummy too much she says im a muff to go pottering on thats why shes drawing off so hard dont you see  i dont see very clearly of course you must give her what you offered her of course you must keep your word there must be no mistake about that the girl declared  owens bewilderment visibly increased you think then as she does that i must send down the police  the mixture of reluctance and dependence in this made her feel how much she was failing him she had the sense of chucking him too no no not yet she said though she had really no other and no better course to prescribe doesnt it occur to you she asked in a moment that if mona is as you say drawing away she may have in doing so a very high motive she knows the immense value of all the objects detained by your mother and to restore the spoils of poynton she is readyis that itto make a sacrifice the sacrifice is that of an engagement she had entered upon with joy  owen had been blank a moment before but he followed this argument with successa success so immediate that it enabled him to produce with decision ah shes not that sort she wants them herself he added she wants to feel theyre hers she doesnt care whether i have them or not and if she cant get them she doesnt want me if she cant get them she doesnt want anything at all  this was categoric fleda drank it in she takes such an interest in them  so it appears  so much that theyre all and that she can let everything else absolutely depend upon them  owen weighed her question as if he felt the responsibility of his answer but that answer came in a moment and as fleda could see out of a wealth of memory she never wanted them particularly till they seemed to be in danger now she has an idea about them and when she gets hold of an ideaoh dear me he broke off pausing and looking away as with a sense of the futility of expression it was the first time fleda had ever heard him explain a matter so pointedly or embark at all on a generalization it was striking it was touching to her as he faltered that he appeared but half capable of floating his generalization to the end the girl however was so far competent to fill up his blank as that she had divined on the occasion of monas visit to poynton what would happen in the event of the accident at which he glanced she had there with her own eyes seen owens betrothed get hold of an idea i say you know do give me some tea he went on irrelevantly and familiarly  her profuse preparations had all this time had no sequel and with a laugh that she felt to be awkward she hastily complied with his request its sure to be horrid she said we dont have at all good things she offered him also bread and butter of which he partook holding his cup and saucer in his other hand and moving slowly about the room she poured herself a cup but not to take it after which without wanting it she began to eat a small stale biscuit she was struck with the extinction of the unwillingness she had felt at ricks to contribute to the bandying between them of poor monas name and under this influence she presently resumed am i to understand that she engaged herself to marry you without caring for you  owen looked out into raphael road she did care for me awfully but she cant stand the strain  the strain of what  why of the whole wretched thing  the whole thing has indeed been wretched and i can easily conceive its effect upon her fleda said  her visitor turned sharp round you can there was a light in his strong stare you can understand its spoiling her temper and making her come down on me she behaves as if i were of no use to her at all  fleda hesitated shes rankling under the sense of her wrong  well was it i pray who perpetrated the wrong aint i doing what i can to get the thing arranged  the ring of his question made his anger at mona almost resemble for a minute an anger at fleda and this resemblance in turn caused our young lady to observe how handsome he looked when he spoke for the first time in her hearing with that degree of heat and used also for the first time such a term as perpetrated in addition his challenge rendered still more vivid to her the mere flimsiness of her own aid yes youve been perfect she said youve had a most difficult part youve had to show tact and patience as well as firmness with your mother and youve strikingly shown them its i who quite unintentionally have deceived you i havent helped you at all to your remedy  well you wouldnt at all events have ceased to like me would you owen demanded it evidently mattered to him to know if she really justified mona i mean of course if you had liked meliked me as she liked me he explained  fleda looked this inquiry in the face only long enough to recognize that in her embarrassment she must take instant refuge in a superior one i can answer that better if i know how kind to her youve been have you been kind to her she asked as simply as she could  why rather miss vetch owen declared ive done every blessed thing she wished i rushed down to ricks as you saw with fire and sword and the day after that i went to see her at waterbath at this point he checked himself though it was just the point at which her interest deepened a different look had come into his face as he put down his empty teacup but why should i tell you such things for any good it does me i gather that youve no suggestion to make me now except that i shall request my solicitor to act shall i request him to act  fleda scarcely heard his words something new had suddenly come into her mind when you went to waterbath after seeing me she asked did you tell her all about that  owen looked conscious all about it  that you had had a long talk with me without seeing your mother at all  oh yes i told her exactly and that you had been most awfully kind and that i had placed the whole thing in your hands  fleda was silent a moment perhaps that displeased her she at last suggested  it displeased her fearfully said owen looking very queer  fearfully broke from the girl somehow at the word she was startled  she wanted to know what right you had to meddle she said you were not honest  oh fleda cried with a long wail then she controlled herself i see  she abused you and i defended you she denounced you  she checked him with a gesture dont tell me what she did she had colored up to her eyes where as with the effect of a blow in the face she quickly felt the tears gathering it was a sudden drop in her great flight a shock to her attempt to watch over what mona was entitled to while she had been straining her very soul in this attempt the object of her magnanimity had been pronouncing her not honest she took it all in however and after an instant was able to speak with a smile she would not have been surprised to learn indeed that her smile was strange you had said a while ago that your mother and i quarreled about you its much more true that you and mona have quarreled about me  owen hesitated but at last he brought it out what i mean to say is dont you know that mona if you dont mind my saying so has taken it into her head to be jealous  i see said fleda well i dare say our conferences have looked very odd  theyve looked very beautiful and theyve been very beautiful oh ive told her the sort you are the young man pursued  that of course hasnt made her love me better  no nor love me said owen of course you know she says she loves me  and do you say you love her  i say nothing elsei say it all the while i said it the other day a dozen times fleda made no immediate rejoinder to this and before she could choose one he repeated his question of a moment before am i to tell my solicitor to act  she had at that moment turned away from this solution precisely because she saw in it the great chance of her secret if she should determine him to adopt it she might put out her hand and take him it would shut in mrs gereths face the open door of surrender she would flare up and fight flying the flag of a passionate an heroic defense the case would obviously go against her but the proceedings would last longer than monas patience or owens propriety with a formal rupture he would be at large and she had only to tighten her fingers round the string that would raise the curtain on that scene you tell me you say you love her but is there nothing more in it than your saying so you wouldnt say so would you if its not true what in the world has become in so short a time of the affection that led to your engagement  the deuce knows what has become of it miss vetch owen cried it seemed all to go to pot as this horrid struggle came on he was close to her now and with his face lighted again by the relief of it he looked all his helpless history into her eyes as i saw you and noticed you more as i knew you better and better i felt less and lessi couldnt help itabout anything or any one else i wished i had known you sooneri knew i should have liked you better than any one in the world but it wasnt you who made the difference he eagerly continued and i was awfully determined to stick to mona to the death it was she herself who made it upon my soul by the state she got into the way she sulked the way she took things and the way she let me have it she destroyed our prospects and our happiness upon my honor she made just the same smash of them as if she had kicked over that teatable she wanted to know all the while what was passing between us between you and me and she wouldnt take my solemn assurance that nothing was passing but what might have directly passed between me and old mummy she said a pretty girl like you was a nice old mummy for me and if youll believe it she never called you anything else but that ill be hanged if i havent been good havent i i havent breathed a breath of any sort to you have i youd have been down on me hard if i had wouldnt you youre down on me pretty hard as it is i think arent you but i dont care what you say now or what mona says either or a single rap what any one says she has given me at last by her confounded behavior a right to speak out to utter the way i feel about it the way i feel about it dont you know is that it had all better come to an end you ask me if i dont love her and i suppose its natural enough you should but you ask it at the very moment im half mad to say to you that theres only one person on the whole earth i really love and that that person here owen pulled up short and fleda wondered if it was from the effect of his perceiving through the closed door the sound of steps and voices on the landing of the stairs she had caught this sound herself with surprise and a vague uneasiness it was not an hour at which her father ever came in and there was no present reason why she should have a visitor she had a fear which after a few seconds deepened a visitor was at hand the visitor would be simply mrs gereth that lady wished for a near view of the consequence of her note to owen fleda straightened herself with the instant thought that if this was what mrs gereth desired mrs gereth should have it in a form not to be mistaken owens pause was the matter of a moment but during that moment our young couple stood with their eyes holding each others eyes and their ears catching the suggestion still through the door of a murmured conference in the hall fleda had begun to make the movement to cut it short when owen stopped her with a grasp of her arm youre surely able to guess he said with his voice dropped and her arm pressed as she had never known such a drop or such a pressureyoure surely able to guess the one person on earth i love  the handle of the door turned and fleda had only time to jerk at him your mother  the door opened and the smutty maid edging in announced mrs brigstock     xv   mrs brigstock in the doorway stood looking from one of the occupants of the room to the other then they saw her eyes attach themselves to a small object that had lain hitherto unnoticed on the carpet this was the biscuit of which on giving owen his tea fleda had taken a perfunctory nibble she had immediately laid it on the table and that subsequently in some precipitate movement she should have brushed it off was doubtless a sign of the agitation that possessed her for mrs brigstock there was apparently more in it than met the eye owen at any rate picked it up and fleda felt as if he were removing the traces of some scene that the newspapers would have characterized as lively mrs brigstock clearly took in also the sprawling teathings and the mark as of high water in the full faces of her young friends these elements made the little place a vivid picture of intimacy a minute was filled by fledas relief at finding her visitor not to be mrs gereth and a longer space by the ensuing sense of what was really more compromising in the actual apparition it dimly occurred to her that the lady of ricks had also written to waterbath not only had mrs brigstock never paid her a call but fleda would have been unable to figure her so employed a year before the girl had spent a day under her roof but never feeling that mrs brigstock regarded this as constituting a bond she had never stayed in any house but poynton where the imagination of a bond one way or the other prevailed after the first astonishment she dashed gayly at her guest emphasizing her welcome and wondering how her whereabouts had become known at waterbath had not mrs brigstock quitted that residence for the very purpose of laying her hand on the associate of mrs gereths misconduct the spirit in which this hand was to be laid our young lady was yet to ascertain but she was a person who could think ten thoughts at oncea circumstance which even putting her present plight at its worst gave her a great advantage over a person who required easy conditions for dealing even with one the very vibration of the air however told her that whatever mrs brigstocks spirit might originally have been it had been sharply affected by the sight of owen he was essentially a surprise she had reckoned with everything that concerned him but his presence with that in awkward silence she was reckoning now as fleda could see while she effected with friendly aid an embarrassed transit to the sofa owen would be useless would be deplorable that aspect of the case fleda had taken in as well another aspect was that he would admire her adore her exactly in proportion as she herself should rise gracefully superior fleda felt for the first time free to let herself go as mrs gereth had said and she was full of the sense that to go meant now to aim straight at the effect of moving owen to rapture at her simplicity and tact it was her impression that he had no positive dislike of monas mother but she couldnt entertain that notion without a glimpse of the implication that he had a positive dislike of mrs brigstocks daughter monas mother declined tea declined a better seat declined a cushion declined to remove her boa fleda guessed that she had not come on purpose to be dry but that the voice of the invaded room had itself given her the hint  i just came on the mere chance she said mona found yesterday somewhere the card of invitation to your sisters marriage that you sent us or your father sent us some time ago we couldnt be presentit was impossible but as it had this address on it i said to myself that i might find you here  im very glad to be at home fleda responded  yes that doesnt happen very often does it mrs brigstock looked round afresh at fledas home  oh i came back from ricks last week i shall be here now till i dont know when  we thought it very likely you would have come back we knew of course of your having been at ricks if i didnt find you i thought i might perhaps find mr vetch mrs brigstock went on  im sorry hes out hes always outall day long  mrs brigstocks round eyes grew rounder all day long  all day long fleda smiled  leaving you quite to yourself  a good deal to myself but a little today as you see to mr gereth and the girl looked at owen to draw him into their sociability for mrs brigstock he had immediately sat down but the movement had not corrected the sombre stiffness taking possession of him at the sight of her before he found a response to the appeal addressed to him fleda turned again to her other visitor is there any purpose for which you would like my father to call on you  mrs brigstock received this question as if it were not to be unguardedly answered upon which owen intervened with pale irrelevance i wrote to mona this morning of miss vetchs being in town but of course the letter hadnt arrived when you left home  no it hadnt arrived i came up for the nightive several matters to attend to then looking with an intention of fixedness from one of her companions to the other im afraid ive interrupted your conversation mrs brigstock said she spoke without effectual point had the air of merely announcing the fact fleda had not yet been confronted with the question of the sort of person mrs brigstock was she had only been confronted with the question of the sort of person mrs gereth scorned her for being she was really somehow no sort of person at all and it came home to fleda that if mrs gereth could see her at this moment she would scorn her more than ever she had a face of which it was impossible to say anything but that it was pink and a mind that it would be possible to describe only if one had been able to mark it in a similar fashion as nature had made this organ neither green nor blue nor yellow there was nothing to know it by it strayed and bleated like an unbranded sheep fleda felt for it at this moment much of the kindness of compassion since mrs brigstock had brought it with her to do something for her that she regarded as delicate fleda was quite prepared to help it to perform if she should be able to gather what it wanted to do what she gathered however more and more was that it wanted to do something different from what it had wanted to do in leaving waterbath there was still nothing to enlighten her more specifically in the way her visitor continued you must be very much taken up i believe you quite espouse his dreadful quarrel  fleda vaguely demurred his dreadful quarrel  about the contents of the house arent you looking after them for him  she knows how awfully kind youve been to me owen said he showed such discomfiture that he really gave away their situation and fleda found herself divided between the hope that he would take leave and the wish that he should see the whole of what the occasion might enable her to bring to pass for him  she explained to mrs brigstock mrs gereth at ricks the other day asked me particularly to see him for her  and did she ask you also particularly to see him here in town mrs brigstocks hideous bonnet seemed to argue for the unsophisticated truth and it was on fledas lips to reply that such had indeed been mrs gereths request but she checked herself and before she could say anything else owen had addressed their companion  i made a point of letting mona know that i should be here dont you see thats exactly what i wrote her this morning  she would have had no doubt you would be here if you had a chance mrs brigstock returned if your letter had arrived it might have prepared me for finding you here at tea in that case i certainly wouldnt have come  im glad then it didnt arrive shouldnt you like him to go fleda asked  mrs brigstock looked at owen and considered nothing showed in her face but that it turned a deeper pink i should like him to go with me there was no menace in her tone but she evidently knew what she wanted as owen made no response to this fleda glanced at him to invite him to assent then for fear that he wouldnt and would thereby make his case worse she took upon herself to declare that she was sure he would be very glad to meet such a wish she had no sooner spoken than she felt that the words had a bad effect of intimacy she had answered for him as if she had been his wife mrs brigstock continued to regard him as if she had observed nothing and she continued to address fleda ive not seen him for a long timeive particular things to say to him  so have i things to say to you mrs brigstock owen interjected with this he took up his hat as if for an immediate departure  the other visitor meanwhile turned to fleda what is mrs gereth going to do  is that what you came to ask me fleda demanded  that and several other things  then you had much better let mr gereth go and stay by yourself and make me a pleasant visit you can talk with him when you like but it is the first time youve been to see me  this appeal had evidently a certain effect mrs brigstock visibly wavered i cant talk with him whenever i like she returned he hasnt been near us since i dont know when but there are things that have brought me here  they are not things of any importance owen to fledas surprise suddenly asserted he had not at first taken up mrs brigstocks expression of a wish to carry him off fleda could see that the instinct at the bottom of this was that of standing by her of seeming not to abandon her but abruptly all his soreness working within him it had struck him that he should abandon her still more if he should leave her to be dealt with by her other visitor you must allow me to say you know mrs brigstock that i dont think you should come down on miss vetch about anything its very good of her to take the smallest interest in us and our horrid little squabble if you want to talk about it talk about it with me he was flushed with the idea of protecting fleda of exhibiting his consideration for her i dont like your crossquestioning her dont you see shes as straight as a die ill tell you all about her he declared with an excited laugh please come off with me and let her alone  mrs brigstock at this became vivid at once fleda thought she looked most peculiar she stood straight up with a queer distention of her whole person and of everything in her face but her mouth which she gathered into a small tight orifice fleda was painfully divided her joy was deep within but it was more relevant to the situation that she should not appear to associate herself with the tone of familiarity in which owen addressed a lady who had been and was perhaps still about to become his motherinlaw she laid on mrs brigstocks arm a repressive hand mrs brigstock however had already exclaimed on her having so wonderful a defender he speaks upon my word as if i had come here to be rude to you  at this grasping her hard fleda laughed then she achieved the exploit of delicately kissing her im not in the least afraid to be alone with you or of your tearing me to pieces ill answer any question that you can possibly dream of putting to me  im the proper person to answer mrs brigstocks questions owen broke in again and im not a bit less ready to meet them than you are he was firmer than she had ever seen him it was as if she had not known he could be so firm  but shell only have been here a few minutes what sort of a visit is that fleda cried  it has lasted long enough for my purpose there was something i wanted to know but i think i know it now  anything you dont know i dare say i can tell you owen observed as he impatiently smoothed his hat with the cuff of his coat  fleda by this time desired immensely to keep his companion but she saw she could do so only at the cost of provoking on his part a further exhibition of the sheltering attitude which he exaggerated precisely because it was the first thing since he had begun to like her that he had been able frankly to do for her it was not in her interest that mrs brigstock should be more struck than she already was with that benevolence there may be things you know that i dont she presently said to her with a smile but ive a sort of sense that youre laboring under some great mistake  mrs brigstock at this looked into her eyes more deeply and yearningly than she had supposed mrs brigstock could look it was the flicker of a certain willingness to give her a chance owen however quickly spoiled everything nothing is more probable than that mrs brigstock is doing what you say but theres no one in the world to whom you owe an explanation i may owe somebody onei dare say i do but not you no  but what if theres one that its no difficulty at all for me to give fleda inquired im sure thats the only one mrs brigstock came to ask if she came to ask any at all  again the good lady looked hard at her young hostess i came i believe fleda just you know to plead with you  fleda with a bright face hesitated a moment as if i were one of those bad women in a play  the remark was disastrous mrs brigstock on whom her brightness was lost evidently thought it singularly free she turned away as from a presence that had really defined itself as objectionable and fleda had a vain sense that her good humor in which there was an idea was taken for impertinence or at least for levity her allusion was improper even if she herself wasnt mrs brigstocks emotion simplified it came to the same thing im quite ready that lady said to owen rather mildly and woundedly i do want to speak to you very much  im completely at your service owen held out his hand to fleda goodbye miss vetch i hope to see you again tomorrow he opened the door for mrs brigstock who passed before the girl with an oblique averted salutation owen and fleda while he stood at the door then faced each other darkly and without speaking their eyes met once more for a long moment and she was conscious there was something in hers that the darkness didnt quench that he had never seen before and that he was perhaps never to see again he stayed long enough to take itto take it with a sombre stare that just showed the dawn of wonder then he followed mrs brigstock out of the house     xvi   he had uttered the hope that he should see her the next day but fleda could easily reflect that he wouldnt see her if she were not there to be seen if there was a thing in the world she desired at that moment it was that the next day should have no point of resemblance with the day that had just elapsed she accordingly aspired to an absence she would go immediately down to maggie she ran out that evening and telegraphed to her sister and in the morning she quitted london by an early train she required for this step no reason but the sense of necessity it was a strong personal need she wished to interpose something and there was nothing she could interpose but distance but time if mrs brigstock had to deal with owen she would allow mrs brigstock the chance to be there to be in the midst of it was the reverse of what she craved she had already been more in the midst of it than had ever entered into her plan at any rate she had renounced her plan she had no plan now but the plan of separation this was to abandon owen to give up the fine office of helping him back to his own but when she had undertaken that office she had not foreseen that mrs gereth would defeat it by a manoeuvre so simple the scene at her fathers rooms had extinguished all offices and the scene at her fathers rooms was of mrs gereths producing owen at all events must now act for himself he had obligations to meet he had satisfactions to give and fleda fairly ached with the wish that he might be equal to them she never knew the extent of her tenderness for him till she became conscious of the present force of her desire that he should be superior be perhaps even sublime she obscurely made out that superiority that sublimity mightnt after all be fatal she closed her eyes and lived for a day or two in the mere beauty of confidence it was with her on the short journey it was with her at maggies it glorified the mean little house in the stupid little town owen had grown larger to her he would do like a man whatever he should have to do he wouldnt be weaknot as she was she herself was weak exceedingly  arranging her few possessions in maggies fewer receptacles she caught a glimpse of the bright side of the fact that her old things were not such a problem as mrs gereths picking her way with maggie through the local puddles diving with her into smelly cottages and supporting her at smellier shops in firmness over the weight of joints and the taste of cheese it was still her own secret that was universally interwoven in the puddles the cottages the shops she was comfortably alone with it that comfort prevailed even while at the evening meal her brotherinlaw invited her attention to a diagram drawn with a fork on too soiled a tablecloth of the scandalous drains of the convalescent home to be alone with it she had come away from ricks and now she knew that to be alone with it she had come away from london this advantage was of course menaced but not immediately destroyed by the arrival on the second day of the note she had been sure she should receive from owen he had gone to west kensington and found her flown but he had got her address from the little maid and then hurried to a club and written to her why have you left me just when i want you most he demanded the next words it was true were more reassuring on the question of his steadiness i dont know what your reason may be they went on nor why youve not left a line for me but i dont think you can feel that i did anything yesterday that it wasnt right for me to do as regards mrs brigstock certainly i just felt what was right and i did it she had no business whatever to attack you that way and i should have been ashamed if i had left her there to worry you i wont have you worried by any one no one shall be disagreeable to you but me i didnt mean to be so yesterday and i dont today but im perfectly free now to want you and i want you much more than youve allowed me to explain youll see if im not all right if youll let me come to you dont be afraidill not hurt you nor trouble you i give you my honor ill not hurt any one only i must see you on what i had to say to mrs b she was nastier than i thought she could be but im behaving like an angel i assure you im all rightthats exactly what i want you to see you owe me something you know for what you said you would do and havent done what your departure without a word gives me to understanddoesnt itthat you definitely cant do dont simply forsake me see me if you only see me once i shant wait for any leavei shall come down tomorrow ive been looking into trains and find theres something that will bring me down just after lunch and something very good for getting me back i wont stop long for gods sake be there  this communication arrived in the morning but fleda would still have had time to wire a protest she debated on that alternative then she read the note over and found in one phrase an exact statement of her duty owens simplicity had expressed it and her subtlety had nothing to answer she owed him something for her obvious failure and what she owed him was to receive him if indeed she had known he would make this attempt she might have been held to have gained nothing by her flight well she had gained what she had gainedshe had gained the interval she had no compunction for the greater trouble she should give the young man it was now doubtless right that he should have as much trouble as possible maggie who thought she was in her confidence but was immensely not had reproached her for having left mrs gereth and maggie was just in this proportion gratified to hear of the visitor with whom early in the afternoon she would have to ask to be left alone maggie liked to see far and now she could sit upstairs and rake the whole future she had known that as she familiarly said there was something the matter with fleda and the value of that knowledge was augmented by the fact that there was apparently also something the matter with mr gereth  fleda downstairs learned soon enough what this was it was simply that as he announced the moment he stood before her he was now all right when she asked him what he meant by that state he replied that he meant he could practically regard himself henceforth as a free man he had had at west kensington as soon as they got into the street such a horrid scene with mrs brigstock  i knew what she wanted to say to me thats why i was determined to get her off i knew i shouldnt like it but i was perfectly prepared said owen she brought it out as soon as we got round the corner she asked me pointblank if i was in love with you  and what did you say to that  that it was none of her business  ah said fleda im not so sure  well i am and im the person most concerned of course i didnt use just those words i was perfectly civil quite as civil as she but i told her i didnt consider she had a right to put me any such question i said i wasnt sure that even mona had with the extraordinary line you know that mona has taken at any rate the whole thing the way i put it was between mona and me and between mona and me if she didnt mind it would just have to remain  fleda was silent a little all that didnt answer her question  then you think i ought to have told her  again our young lady reflected i think im rather glad you didnt  i knew what i was about said owen it didnt strike me that she had the least right to come down on us that way and ask for explanations  fleda looked very grave weighing the whole matter i dare say that when she started when she arrived she didnt mean to come down  what then did she mean to do  what she said to me just before she went she meant to plead with me  oh i heard her said owen but plead with you for what  for you of courseto entreat me to give you up she thinks me awfully designingthat ive taken some sort of possession of you  owen stared you havent lifted a finger its i who have taken possession  very true youve done it all yourself fleda spoke gravely and gently without a breath of coquetry but those are shades between which shes probably not obliged to distinguish its enough for her that were singularly intimate  i am but youre not owen exclaimed  fleda gave a dim smile you make me at least feel that im learning to know you very well when i hear you say such a thing as that mrs brigstock came to get round me to supplicate me she went on but to find you there looking so much at home paying me a friendly call and shoving the teathings aboutthat was too much for her patience she doesnt know you see that im after all a decent girl she simply made up her mind on the spot that im a very bad case  i couldnt stand the way she treated you and that was what i had to say to her owen returned  shes simple and slow but shes not a fool i think she treated me on the whole very well fleda remembered how mrs gereth had treated mona when the brigstocks came down to poynton  owen evidently thought her painfully perverse it was you who carried it off you behaved like a brick and so did i i consider if you only knew the difficulty i had i told her you were the noblest and straightest of women  that can hardly have removed her impression that there are things i put you up to  it didnt owen replied with candor she said our relation yours and mine isnt innocent  what did she mean by that  as you may suppose i particularly inquired do you know what she had the cheek to tell me owen asked she didnt better it much she said she meant that its excessively unnatural  fleda considered afresh well it is she brought out at last  then upon my honor its only you who make it so her perversity was distinctly too much for him i mean you make it so by the way you keep me off  have i kept you off today fleda sadly shook her head raising her arms a little and dropping them  her gesture of resignation gave him a pretext for catching at her hand but before he could take it she had put it behind her they had been seated together on maggies single sofa and her movement brought her to her feet while owen looking at her reproachfully leaned back in discouragement what good does it do me to be here when i find you only a stone  she met his eyes with all the tenderness she had not yet uttered and she had not known till this moment how great was the accumulation perhaps after all she risked there may be even in a stone still some little help for you  owen sat there a minute staring at her ah youre beautiful more beautiful than any one he broke out but ill be hanged if i can ever understand you on tuesday at your fathers you were beautifulas beautiful just before i left as you are at this instant but the next day when i went back i found it had apparently meant nothing and now again that you let me come here and you shine at me like an angel it doesnt bring you an inch nearer to saying what i want you to say he remained a moment longer in the same position then he jerked himself up what i want you to say is that you like mewhat i want you to say is that you pity me he sprang up and came to her what i want you to say is that youll save me  fleda hesitated why do you need saving when you announced to me just now that youre a free man  he too hesitated but he was not checked its just for the reason that im free dont you know what i mean miss vetch i want you to marry me  fleda at this put out her hand in charity she held his own which quickly grasped it a moment and if he had described her as shining at him it may be assumed that she shone all the more in her deep still smile let me hear a little more about your freedom first she said i gather that mrs brigstock was not wholly satisfied with the way you disposed of her question  i dare say she wasnt but the less shes satisfied the more im free  what bearing have her feelings pray fleda asked  why monas much worse than her mother she wants much more to give me up  then why doesnt she do it  she will as soon as her mother gets home and tells her  tells her what fleda inquired  why that im in love with you  fleda debated are you so very sure she will  certainly im sure with all the evidence i already have that will finish her owen declared  this made his companion thoughtful again can you take such pleasure in her being finisheda poor girl youve once loved  owen waited long enough to take in the question then with a serenity startling even to her knowledge of his nature i dont think i can have really loved her you know he replied  fleda broke into a laugh which gave him a surprise as visible as the emotion it testified to then how am i to know that you really loveanybody else  oh ill show you that said owen  i must take it on trust the girl pursued and what if mona doesnt give you up she added  owen was baffled but a few seconds he had thought of everything why thats just where you come in  to save you i see you mean i must get rid of her for you his blankness showed for a little that he felt the chill of her cold logic but as she waited for his rejoinder she knew to which of them it cost most he gasped a minute and that gave her time to say you see mr owen how impossible it is to talk of such things yet  like lightning he had grasped her arm you mean you will talk of them then as he began to take the flood of assent from her eyes you will listen to me oh you dear you dearwhen when  ah when it isnt mere misery the words had broken from her in a sudden loud cry and what next happened was that the very sound of her pain upset her she heard her own true note she turned short away from him in a moment she had burst into sobs in another his arms were round her the next she had let herself go so far that even mrs gereth might have seen it he clasped her and she gave herselfshe poured out her tears on his breast something prisoned and pent throbbed and gushed something deep and sweet surged upsomething that came from far within and far off that had begun with the sight of him in his indifference and had never had rest since then the surrender was short but the relief was long she felt his lips upon her face and his arms tighten with his full divination what she did what she had done she scarcely knew she only was aware as she broke from him again of what had taken place in his own quick breast what had taken place was that with the click of a spring he saw he had cleared the high wall at a bound they were together without a veil she had not a shred of a secret left it was as if a whirlwind had come and gone laying low the great false front that she had built up stone by stone the strangest thing of all was the momentary sense of desolation  ah all the while you cared owen read the truth with a wonder so great that it was visibly almost a sadness a terror caused by his sudden perception of where the impossibility was not that made it all perhaps elsewhere  i cared i cared i cared fleda moaned it as defiantly as if she were confessing a misdeed how couldnt i care but you mustnt you must never never ask it isnt for us to talk about she insisted dont speak of it dont speak  it was easy indeed not to speak when the difficulty was to find words he clasped his hands before her as he might have clasped them at an altar his pressed palms shook together while he held his breath and while she stilled herself in the effort to come round again to the real and the right he helped this effort soothing her into a seat with a touch as light as if she had really been something sacred she sank into a chair and he dropped before her on his knees she fell back with closed eyes and he buried his face in her lap there was no way to thank her but this act of prostration which lasted in silence till she laid consenting hands on him touched his head and stroked it held it in her tenderness till he acknowledged his long density he made the avowal seem only hismade her when she rose again raise him at last softly as if from the abasement of shame if in each others eyes now however they saw the truth this truth to fleda looked harder even than beforeall the harder that when at the very moment she recognized it he murmured to her ecstatically in fresh possession of her hands which he drew up to his breast holding them tight there with both his own im saved im savedi am im ready for anything i have your word come he cried as if from the sight of a response slower than he needed and in the tone he so often had of a great boy at a great game  she had once more disengaged herself with the private vow that he shouldnt yet touch her again it was all too horribly soonher sense of this was rapidly surging back we mustnt talk we mustnt talk we must wait she intensely insisted i dont know what you mean by your freedom i dont see it i dont feel it where is it yet where your freedom if its real theres plenty of time and if it isnt theres more than enough i hate myself she protested for having anything to say about her its like waiting for dead mens shoes what business is it of mine what she does she has her own trouble and her own plan its too hideous to watch her and count on her  owens face at this showed a reviving dread the fear of some darksome process of her mind if you speak for yourself i can understand but why is it hideous for me  oh i mean for myself fleda said impatiently  i watch her i count on her how can i do anything else if i count on her to let me definitely know how we stand i do nothing in life but what she herself has led straight up to i never thought of asking you to get rid of her for me and i never would have spoken to you if i hadnt held that i am rid of her that she has backed out of the whole thing didnt she do so from the moment she began to put it off i had already applied for the license the very invitations were half addressed who but she all of a sudden demanded an unnatural wait it was none of my doing i had never dreamed of anything but coming up to the scratch owen grew more and more lucid and more confident of the effect of his lucidity she called it taking a stand to see what mother would do i told her mother would do what i would make her do and to that she replied that she would like to see me make her first i said i would arrange that everything should be all right and she said she really preferred to arrange it herself it was a flat refusal to trust me in the smallest degree why then had she pretended so tremendously to care for me and of course at present said owen she trusts me if possible still less  fleda paid this statement the homage of a minutes muteness as to that naturally she has reason  why on earth has she reason then as his companion moving away simply threw up her hands i never looked at younot to call lookingtill she had regularly driven me to it he went on i know what im about i do assure you im all right  youre not all rightyoure all wrong fleda cried in despair you mustnt stay here you mustnt she repeated with clear decision you make me say dreadful things and i feel as if i made you say them but before he could reply she took it up in another tone why in the world if everything had changed didnt you break off  i the inquiry seemed to have moved him to stupefaction can you ask me that question when i only wanted to please you didnt you seem to show me in your wonderful way that that was exactly how i didnt break off just on purpose to leave it to her i didnt break off so that there shouldnt be a thing to be said against me  the instant after her challenge fleda had faced him again in selfreproof there isnt a thing to be said against you and i dont know what nonsense you make me talk you have pleased me and youve been right and good and its the only comfort and you must go everything must come from mona and if it doesnt come weve said entirely too much you must leave me aloneforever  forever owen gasped  i mean unless everything is different  everything is differentwhen i know  fleda winced at what he knew she made a wild gesture which seemed to whirl it out of the room the mere allusion was like another embrace you know nothingand you must go and wait you mustnt break down at this point  he looked about him and took up his hat it was as if in spite of frustration he had got the essence of what he wanted and could afford to agree with her to the extent of keeping up the forms he covered her with his fine simple smile but made no other approach oh im so awfully happy he exclaimed  she hesitated she would only be impeccable even though she should have to be sententious youll be happy if youre perfect she risked  he laughed out at this and she wondered if with a newborn acuteness he saw the absurdity of her speech and that no one was happy just because no one could be what she so lightly prescribed i dont pretend to be perfect but i shall find a letter tonight  so much the better if its the kind of one you desire that was the most she could say and having made it sound as dry as possible she lapsed into a silence so pointed as to deprive him of all pretext for not leaving her still nevertheless he stood there playing with his hat and filling the long pause with a strained and anxious smile he wished to obey her thoroughly to appear not to presume on any advantage he had won from her but there was clearly something he longed for beside while he showed this by hanging on she thought of two other things one of these was that his countenance after all failed to bear out his description of his bliss as for the other it had no sooner come into her head than she found it seated in spite of her resolution on her lips it took the form of an inconsequent question when did you say mrs brigstock was to have gone back  owen stared to waterbath she was to have spent the night in town dont you know but when she left me after our talk i said to myself that she would take an evening train i know i made her want to get home  where did you separate fleda asked  at the west kensington stationshe was going to victoria i had walked with her there and our talk was all on the way  fleda pondered a moment if she did go back that night you would have heard from waterbath by this time  i dont know said owen i thought i might hear this morning  she cant have gone back fleda declared mona would have written on the spot  oh yes she will have written bang off owen cheerfully conceded  fleda thought again then even in the event of her mothers not having got home till the morning you would have had your letter at the latest today you see she has had plenty of time  owen hesitated then oh shes all right he laughed i go by mrs brigstocks certain effect on herthe effect of the temper the old lady showed when we parted do you know what she asked me he sociably continued she asked me in a kind of nasty manner if i supposed you really cared anything about me of course i told her i supposed you didntnot a solitary rap how could i suppose you do with your extraordinary ways it doesnt matter i could see she thought i lied  you should have told her you know that i had seen you in town only that one time fleda observed  by jove i didfor you it was only for you  something in this touched the girl so that for a moment she could not trust herself to speak youre an honest man she said at last she had gone to the door and opened it goodbye  even yet however he hung back and she remembered how at the end of his hour at ricks she had been put to it to get him out of the house he had in general a sort of cheerful slowness which helped him at such times though she could now see his strong fist crumple his big stiff gloves as if they had been paper but even if theres no letter he began he began but there he left it  you mean even if she doesnt let you off ah you ask me too much fleda spoke from the tiny hall where she had taken refuge between the old barometer and the old mackintosh there are things too utterly for yourselves alone how can i tell what do i know goodbye goodbye if she doesnt let you off it will be because she is attached to you  shes not shes not theres nothing in it doesnt a fellow knowexcept with you owen ruefully added with this he came out of the room lowering his voice to secret supplication pleading with her really to meet him on the ground of the negation of mona it was this betrayal of his need of support and sanction that made her retreatharden herself in the effort to save what might remain of all she had given given probably for nothing the very vision of him as he thus morally clung to her was the vision of a weakness somewhere in the core of his bloom a blessed manly weakness of which if she had only the valid right it would be all a sweetness to take care she faintly sickened however with the sense that there was as yet no valid right poor owen could give you can take it from my honor you know he whispered that she loathes me  fleda had stood clutching the knob of maggies little painted stairrail she took on the stairs a step backward why then doesnt she prove it in the only clear way  she has proved it will you believe it if you see the letter  i dont want to see any letter said fleda youll miss your train  facing him waving him away she had taken another upward step but he sprang to the side of the stairs and brought his hand above the banister down hard on her wrist do you mean to tell me that i must marry a woman i hate  from her step she looked down into his raised face ah you see its not true that youre free she seemed almost to exult its not trueits not true  he only at this like a buffeting swimmer gave a shake of his head and repeated his question do you mean to tell me i must marry such a woman  fleda hesitated he held her fast no anything is better than that  then in gods name what must i do  you must settle that with her you mustnt break faith anything is better than that you must at any rate be utterly sure she must love youhow can she help it i wouldnt give you up said fleda she spoke in broken bits panting out her words the great thing is to keep faith where is a man if he doesnt if he doesnt he may be so cruel so cruel so cruel so cruel fleda repeated i couldnt have a hand in that you know thats my positionthats mine you offered her marriage its a tremendous thing for her then looking at him another moment i wouldnt give you up she said again he still had hold of her arm she took in his blank alarm with a quick dip of her face she reached his hand with her lips pressing them to the back of it with a force that doubled the force of her words never never never she cried and before he could succeed in seizing her she had turned and scrambling up the stairs got away from him even faster than she had got away from him at ricks     xvii   ten days after his visit she received a communication from mrs geretha telegram of eight words exclusive of signature and date come up immediately and stay with me hereit was characteristically sharp as maggie said but as maggie added it was also characteristically kind here was an hotel in london and maggie had embraced a condition of life which already began to produce in her some yearning for hotels in london she would have responded in an instant and she was surprised that her sister seemed to hesitate fledas hesitation which lasted but an hour was expressed in that young ladys own mind by the reflection that in obeying her friends summons she shouldnt know what she should be in for her friends summons however was but another name for her friends appeal and mrs gereths bounty had laid her under obligations more sensible than any reluctance in the eventthat is at the end of her hourshe testified to her gratitude by taking the train and to her mistrust by leaving her luggage she went as if she had gone up for the day in the train however she had another thoughtful hour during which it was her mistrust that mainly deepened she felt as if for ten days she had sat in darkness looking to the east for a dawn that had not yet glimmered her mind had lately been less occupied with mrs gereth it had been so exceptionally occupied with mona if the sequel was to justify owens prevision of mrs brigstocks action upon her daughter this action was at the end of a week as much a mystery as ever the stillness all round had been exactly what fleda desired but it gave her for the time a deep sense of failure the sense of a sudden drop from a height at which she had all things beneath her she had nothing beneath her now she herself was at the bottom of the heap no sign had reached her from owenpoor owen who had clearly no news to give about his precious letter from waterbath if mrs brigstock had hurried back to obtain that this letter should be written mrs brigstock might then have spared herself so great an inconvenience owen had been silent for the best of all reasonsthe reason that he had had nothing in life to say if the letter had not been written he would simply have had to introduce some large qualification into his account of his freedom he had left his young friend under her refusal to listen to him until he should be able on the contrary to extend that picture and his present submission was all in keeping with the rigid honesty that his young friend had prescribed  it was this that formed the element through which mona loomed large fleda had enough imagination a fine enough feeling for life to be impressed with such an image of successful immobility the massive maiden at waterbath was successful from the moment she could entertain her resentments as if they had been poor relations who neednt put her to expense she was a magnificent dead weight there was something positive and portentous in her quietude what game are they all playing poor fleda could only ask for she had an intimate conviction that owen was now under the roof of his betrothed that was stupefying if he really hated mona and if he didnt really hate her what had brought him to raphael road and to maggies fleda had no real light but she felt that to account for the absence of any result of their last meeting would take a supposition of the full sacrifice to charity that she had held up before him if he had gone to waterbath it had been simply because he had to go she had as good as told him that he would have to go that this was an inevitable incident of his keeping perfect faithfaith so literal that the smallest subterfuge would always be a reproach to him when she tried to remember that it was for herself he was taking his risk she felt how weak a way that was of expressing monas supremacy there would be no need of keeping him up if there were nothing to keep him up to her eyes grew wan as she discerned in the impenetrable air that monas thick outline never wavered an inch she wondered fitfully what mrs gereth had by this time made of it and reflected with a strange elation that the sand on which the mistress of ricks had built a momentary triumph was quaking beneath the surface as the morning post still held its peace she would be of course more confident but the hour was at hand at which owen would have absolutely to do either one thing or the other to keep perfect faith was to inform against his mother and to hear the police at her door would be mrs gereths awakening how much she was beguiled fleda could see from her having been for a whole month quite as deep and dark as mona she had let her young friend alone because of the certitude cultivated at ricks that owen had done the opposite he had done the opposite indeed but much good had that brought forth to have sent for her now fleda felt was from this point of view wholly natural she had sent for her to show at last how much she had scored if however owen was really at waterbath the refutation of that boast was easy  fleda found mrs gereth in modest apartments and with an air of fatigue in her distinguished facea sign as she privately remarked of the strain of that effort to be discreet of which she herself had been having the benefit it was a constant feature of their relation that this lady could make fleda blench a little and that the effect proceeded from the intense pressure of her confidence if the confidence had been heavy even when the girl in the early flush of devotion had been able to feel herself most responsive it drew her heart into her mouth now that she had reserves and conditions now that she couldnt simplify with the same bold hand as her protectress in the very brightening of the tired look and at the moment of their embrace fleda felt on her shoulders the return of the load so that her spirit frankly quailed as she asked herself what she had brought up from her trusted seclusion to support it mrs gereths free manner always made a joke of weakness and there was in such a welcome a richness a kind of familiar nobleness that suggested shame to a harried conscience something had happened she could see and she could also see in the bravery that seemed to announce it had changed everything a formidable assumption that what had happened was what a healthy young woman must like the absence of luggage had made this young woman feel meagre even before her companion taking in the bareness at a second glance exclaimed upon it and roundly rebuked her of course she had expected her to stay  fleda thought best to show bravery too and to show it from the first what you expected dear mrs gereth is exactly what i came up to ascertain it struck me as right to do that first i mean to ascertain without making preparations  then youll be so good as to make them on the spot mrs gereth was most emphatic youre going abroad with me  fleda wondered but she also smiled tonighttomorrow  in as few days as possible thats all thats left for me now fledas heart at this gave a bound she wondered to what particular difference in mrs gereths situation as last known to her it was an allusion ive made my plan her friend continued i go for at least a year we shall go straight to florence we can manage there i of course dont look to you however she added to stay with me all that time that will require to be settled owen will have to join us as soon as possible he may not be quite ready to get off with us but im convinced its quite the right thing to go it will make a good change it will put in a decent interval  fleda listened she was deeply mystified how kind you are to me she presently said the picture suggested so many questions that she scarcely knew which to ask first she took one at a venture you really have it from mr gereth that hell give us his company  if mr gereths mother smiled in response to this fleda knew that her smile was a tacit criticism of such a form of reference to her son fleda habitually spoke of him as mr owen and it was a part of her present vigilance to appear to have relinquished that right mrs gereths manner confirmed a certain impression of her pretending to more than she felt her very first words had conveyed it and it reminded fleda of the conscious courage with which weeks before the lady had met her visitors first startled stare at the clustered spoils of poynton it was her practice to take immensely for granted whatever she wished oh if youll answer for him it will do quite as well she said then she put her hands on the girls shoulders and held them at arms length as if to shake them a little while in the depths of her shining eyes fleda discovered something obscure and unquiet you bad false thing why didnt you tell me her tone softened her harshness and her visitor had never had such a sense of her indulgence mrs gereth could show patience it was a part of the general bribe but it was also like the handing in of a heavy bill before which fleda could only fumble in a penniless pocket you must perfectly have known at ricks and yet you practically denied it thats why i call you bad and false it was apparently also why she again almost roughly kissed her  i think that before i answer you i had better know what youre talking about fleda said  mrs gereth looked at her with a slight increase of hardness youve done everything you need for modesty my dear if hes sick with love of you you havent had to wait for me to inform you  fleda hesitated has he informed you dear mrs gereth  dear mrs gereth smiled sweetly how could he when our situation is such that he communicates with me only through you and that you are so tortuous you conceal everything  didnt he answer the note in which you let him know that i was in town fleda asked  he answered it sufficiently by rushing off on the spot to see you  mrs gereth met that allusion with a prompt firmness that made almost insolently light of any ground of complaint and fledas own sense of responsibility was now so vivid that all resentments turned comparatively pale she had no heart to produce a grievance she could only left as she was with the little mystery on her hands produce after a moment a question how then do you come to know that your son has ever thought  that he would give his ears to get you mrs gereth broke in i had a visit from mrs brigstock  fleda opened her eyes she went down to ricks  the day after she had found owen at your feet she knows everything  fleda shook her head sadly she was more startled than she cared to show this odd journey of mrs brigstocks which with a simplicity equal for once to owens she had not divined now struck her as having produced the hush of the last ten days there are things she doesnt know she presently exclaimed  she knows he would do anything to marry you  he hasnt told her so fleda said  no but he has told you thats better still laughed mrs gereth my dear child she went on with an air that affected the girl as a sort of blind profanity dont try to make yourself out better than you are i know what you are i havent lived with you so much for nothing youre not quite a saint in heaven yet lord what a creature youd have thought me in my good time but you do like it fortunately you idiot youre pale with your passion you sweet thing thats exactly what i wanted to see i cant for the life of me think where the shame comes in then with a finer significance a look that seemed to fleda strange she added its all right  ive seen him but twice said fleda  but twice mrs gereth still smiled  on the occasion at papas that mrs brigstock told you of and one day since then down at maggies  well those things are between yourselves and you seem to me both poor creatures at best mrs gereth spoke with a rich humor which tipped with light for an instant a real conviction i dont know what youve got in your veins you absurdly exaggerated the difficulties but enough is as good as a feast and when once i get you abroad together she checked herself as if from excess of meaning what might happen when she should get them abroad together was to be gathered only from the way she slowly rubbed her hands  the gesture however made the promise so definite that for a moment her companion was almost beguiled but there was nothing to account as yet for the wealth of mrs gereths certitude the visit of the lady of waterbath appeared but half to explain it is it permitted to be surprised fleda deferentially asked at mrs brigstocks thinking it would help her to see you  its never permitted to be surprised at the aberrations of born fools said mrs gereth if a cow should try to calculate thats the kind of happy thought shed have mrs brigstock came down to plead with me  fleda mused a moment thats what she came to do with me she then honestly returned but what did she expect to get of you with your opposition so marked from the first  she didnt know i want you my dear its a wonder with all my violencethe gross publicity ive given my desires but shes as stupid as an owlshe doesnt feel your charm  fleda felt herself flush slightly but she tried to smile did you tell her all about it did you make her understand you want me  for what do you take me i wasnt such a donkey  so as not to aggravate mona fleda suggested  so as not to aggravate mona naturally weve had a narrow course to steer but thank god were at last in the open  what do you call the open mrs gereth fleda demanded then as the other faltered do you know where mr owen is today  mrs gereth stared do you mean hes at waterbath well thats your own affair i can bear it if you can  wherever he is i can bear it fleda said but i havent the least idea where he is  then you ought to be ashamed of yourself mrs gereth broke out with a change of note that showed how deep a passion underlay everything she had said the poor woman catching her companions hand however the next moment as if to retract something of this harshness spoke more patiently dont you understand fleda how immensely how devotedly ive trusted you her tone was indeed a supplication  fleda was infinitely shaken she was silent a little yes i understand did she go to you to complain of me  she came to see what she could do she had been tremendously upset the day before by what had taken place at your fathers and she had posted down to ricks on the inspiration of the moment she hadnt meant it on leaving home it was the sight of you closeted there with owen that had suddenly determined her the whole story she said was written in your two faces she spoke as if she had never seen such an exhibition owen was on the brink but there might still be time to save him and it was with this idea she had bearded me in my den what wont a mother do you knowthat was one of the things she said what wouldnt a mother do indeed i thought i had sufficiently shown her what she tried to break me down by an appeal to my good nature as she called it and from the moment she opened on you from the moment she denounced owens falsity i was as goodnatured as she could wish i understood that it was a plea for mere mercy that you and he between you were killing her child of course i was delighted that mona should be killed but i was studiously kind to mrs brigstock at the same time i was honest i didnt pretend to anything i couldnt feel i asked her why the marriage hadnt taken place months ago when owen was perfectly ready and i showed her how completely that fatuous mistake on monas part cleared his responsibility it was she who had killed himit was she who had destroyed his affection his illusions did she want him now when he was estranged when he was disgusted when he had a sore grievance she reminded me that mona had a sore grievance too but she admitted that she hadnt come to me to speak of that what she had come to me for was not to get the old things back but simply to get owen what she wanted was that i would in simple pity see fair play owen had been awfully bedeviledshe didnt call it that she called it misledbut it was simply you who had bedeviled him he would be all right still if i would see that you were out of the way she asked me pointblank if it was possible i could want him to marry you  fleda had listened in unbearable pain and growing terror as if her interlocutress stone by stone were piling some fatal mass upon her breast she had the sense of being buried alive smothered in the mere expansion of another will and now there was but one gap left to the air a single word she felt might close it and with the question that came to her lips as mrs gereth paused she seemed to herself to ask in cold dread for her doom what did you say to that she inquired  i was embarrassed for i saw my dangerthe danger of her going home and saying to mona that i was backing you up it had been a bliss to learn that owen had really turned to you but my joy didnt put me off my guard i reflected intensely for a few seconds then i saw my issue  your issue fleda murmured  i remembered how you had tied my hands about saying a word to owen  fleda wondered and did you remember the little letter that with your hands tied you still succeeded in writing to him  perfectly my little letter was a model of reticence what i remembered was all that in those few words i forbade myself to say i had been an angel of delicacyi had effaced myself like a saint it was not for me to have done all that and then figure to such a woman as having done the opposite besides it was none of her business  is that what you said to her fleda asked  i said to her that her question revealed a total misconception of the nature of my present relations with my son i said to her that i had no relations with him at all and that nothing had passed between us for months i said to her that my hands were spotlessly clean of any attempt to make him make up to you i said to her that i had taken from poynton what i had a right to take but had done nothing else in the world i was determined that if i had bit my tongue off to oblige you i would at least have the righteousness that my sacrifice gave me  and was mrs brigstock satisfied with your answer  she was visibly relieved  it was fortunate for you said fleda that shes apparently not aware of the manner in which almost under her nose you advertised me to him at poynton  mrs gereth appeared to recall that scene she smiled with a serenity remarkably effective as showing how cheerfully used she had grown to invidious allusions to it how should she be aware of it  she would if owen had described your outbreak to mona  yes but he didnt describe it all his instinct was to conceal it from mona he wasnt conscious but he was already in love with you mrs gereth declared  fleda shook her head wearily noi was only in love with him  here was a faint illumination with which mrs gereth instantly mingled her fire you dear old wretch she exclaimed and she again with ferocity embraced her young friend  fleda submitted like a sick animal she would submit to everything now then what further passed  only that she left me thinking she had got something  and what had she got  nothing but her luncheon but i got everything  everything fleda quavered  mrs gereth struck apparently by something in her tone looked at her from a tremendous height dont fail me now  it sounded so like a menace that with a full divination at last the poor girl fell weakly into a chair what on earth have you done  mrs gereth stood there in all the glory of a great stroke ive settled you she filled the room to fledas scared vision with the glare of her magnificence ive sent everything back  everything fleda gasped  to the smallest snuffbox the last load went yesterday the same people did it poor little ricks is empty then as if for a crowning splendor to check all deprecation theyre yours you goose mrs gereth concluded holding up her handsome head and rubbing her white hands fleda saw that there were tears in her deep eyes     xviii   she was slow to take in the announcement but when she had done so she felt it to be more than her cup of bitterness would hold her bitterness was her anxiety the taste of which suddenly sickened her what had she become on the spot but a traitress to her friend the treachery increased with the view of the friends motive a motive magnificent as a tribute to her value mrs gereth had wished to make sure of her and had reasoned that there would be no such way as by a large appeal to her honor if it be true as men have declared that the sense of honor is weak in women some of the bearings of this stroke might have thrown a light on the question what was now at all events put before fleda was that she had been made sure of for the greatness of the surrender imposed an obligation as great there was an expression she had heard used by young men with whom she danced the only word to fit mrs gereths intention was that mrs gereth had designed to fetch her it was a calculated it was a crushing bribe it looked her in the eyes and said simply thats what i do for you what fleda was to do in return required no pointing out the sense at present of how little she had done made her almost cry aloud with pain but her first endeavor in the face of the fact was to keep such a cry from reaching her companion how little she had done mrs gereth didnt yet know and possibly there would be still some way of turning round before the discovery on her own side too fleda had almost made one she had known she was wanted but she had not after all conceived how magnificently much she had been treated by her friends act as a conscious prize but what made her a conscious prize was only the power the act itself imputed to her as high bold diplomacy it dazzled and carried her off her feet she admired the noble risk of it a risk mrs gereth had faced for the utterly poor creature that the girl now felt herself the change it instantly wrought in her was moreover extraordinary it transformed at a touch her emotion on the subject of concessions a few weeks earlier she had jumped at the duty of pleading for them practically quarreling with the lady of ricks for her refusal to restore what she had taken she had been sore with the wrong to owen she had bled with the wounds of poynton now however as she heard of the replenishment of the void that had so haunted her she came as near sounding an alarm as if from the deck of a ship she had seen a person she loved jump into the sea mrs gereth had become in a flash the victim poor little ricks had been laid bare in a night if fledas feeling about the old things had taken precipitate form the form would have been a frantic command it was indeed for mere want of breath that she didnt shout oh stop themits no use bring them backits too late and what most kept her breathless was her companions very grandeur fleda distinguished as never before the purity of such a passion it made mrs gereth august and almost sublime it was absolutely unselfishshe cared nothing for mere possession she thought solely and incorruptibly of what was best for the things she had surrendered them to the presumptive care of the one person of her acquaintance who felt about them as she felt herself and whose long lease of the future would be the nearest approach that could be compassed to committing them to a museum now it was indeed that fleda knew what rested on her now it was also that she measured as if for the first time mrs gereths view of the natural influence of a fine acquisition she had adopted the idea of blowing away the last doubt of what her young friend would gain of making good still more than she was obliged to make it the promise of weeks before it was one thing for the girl to have heard that in a certain event restitution would be made it was another for her to see the condition with a noble trust treated in advance as performed and to be able to feel that she should have only to open a door to find every old piece in every old corner to have played such a card was therefore practically for mrs gereth to have won the game fleda had certainly to recognize that so far as the theory of the matter went the game had been won oh she had been made sure of  she couldnt however succeed for so very many minutes in deferring her exposure why didnt you wait dearest ah why didnt you waitif that inconsequent appeal kept rising to her lips to be cut short before it was spoken this was only because at first the humility of gratitude helped her to gain time enabled her to present herself very honestly as too overcome to be clear she kissed her companions hands she did homage at her feet she murmured soft snatches of praise and yet in the midst of it all was conscious that what she really showed most was the wan despair at her heart she saw mrs gereths glimpse of this despair suddenly widen heard the quick chill of her voice pierce through the false courage of endearments do you mean to tell me at such an hour as this that youve really lost him  the tone of the question made the idea a possibility for which fleda had nothing from this moment but terror i dont know mrs gereth how can i say she asked ive not seen him for so long as i told you just now i dont even know where he is thats by no fault of his she hurried on he would have been with me every day if i had consented but i made him understand the last time that ill receive him again only when hes able to show me that his release has been complete and definite oh he cant yet dont you see and thats why he hasnt been back its far better than his coming only that we should both be miserable when he does come hell be in a better position hell be tremendously moved by the splendid thing youve done i know you wish me to feel that youve done it as much for me as for owen but your having done it for me is just what will delight him most when he hears of it said fleda in desperate optimism when he hears of it there indeed regretting her advance she quite broke down she was wholly powerless to say what owen would do when he heard of it i dont know what he wont make of you and how he wont hug you she had to content herself with lamely declaring she had drawn mrs gereth to a sofa with a vague instinct of pacifying her and still after all gaining time but it was a position in which her great duped benefactress portentously patient again during this demonstration looked far from inviting a hug fleda found herself tricking out the situation with artificial flowers trying to talk even herself into the fancy that owen whose name she now made simple and sweet might come in upon them at any moment she felt an immense need to be understood and justified she averted her face in dread from all that she might have to be forgiven she pressed on her companions arm as if to keep her quiet till she should really know and then after a minute she poured out the clear essence of what in happier days had been her secret you mustnt think i dont adore him when ive told him so to his face i love him so that id die for himi love him so that its horrible dont look at me therefore as if i had not been kind as if i had not been as tender as if he were dying and my tenderness were what would save him look at me as if you believe me as if you feel what ive been through darling mrs gereth i could kiss the ground he walks on i havent a rag of pride i used to have but its gone i used to have a secret but every one knows it now and any one who looks at me can say i think whats the matter with me its not so very fine my secret and the less one really says about it the better but i want you to have it from me because i was stiff before i want you to see for yourself that ive been brought as low as a girl can very well be it serves me right fleda laughed if i was ever proud and horrid to you i dont know what you wanted me in those days at ricks to do but i dont think you can have wanted much more than what ive done the other day at maggies i did things that made me afterwards think of you i dont know what girls may do but if he doesnt know that there isnt an inch of me that isnt his fleda sighed as if she couldnt express it she piled it up as she would have said holding mrs gereth with dilated eyes she seemed to sound her for the effect of these words its idiotic she wearily smiled its so strange that im almost angry for it and the strangest part of all is that it isnt even happiness its anguishit was from the first from the first there was a bitterness and a kind of dread but i owe you every word of the truth you dont do him justice either hes a dear i assure you hes a dear id trust him to the last breath i dont think you really know him hes ever so much cleverer than he makes a show of hes remarkable in his own shy way you told me at ricks that you wanted me to let myself go and ive gone quite far enough to discover as much as that as well as all sorts of other delightful things about him youll tell me i make myself out worse than i am said the girl feeling more and more in her companions attitude a quality that treated her speech as a desperate rigmarole and even perhaps as a piece of cold immodesty she wanted to make herself out badit was a part of her justification but it suddenly occurred to her that such a picture of her extravagance imputed a want of gallantry to the young man i dont care for anything you think she declared because owen dont you know sees me as i am hes so kind that it makes up for everything  this attempt at gayety was futile the silence with which for a minute her adversary greeted her troubled plea brought home to her afresh that she was on the bare defensive is it a part of his kindness never to come near you mrs gereth inquired at last is it a part of his kindness to leave you without an inkling of where he is she rose again from where fleda had kept her down she seemed to tower there in the majesty of her gathered wrong is it a part of his kindness that after ive toiled as ive done for six days and with my own weak hands which i havent spared to denude myself in your interest to that point that ive nothing left as i may say but what i have on my backis it a part of his kindness that youre not even able to produce him for me  there was a high contempt in this which was for owen quite as much and in the light of which fleda felt that her effort at plausibility had been mere groveling she rose from the sofa with an humiliated sense of rising from ineffectual knees that discomfort however lived but an instant it was swept away in a rush of loyalty to the absent she herself could bear his mothers scorn but to avert it from his sweet innocence she broke out with a quickness that was like the raising of an arm dont blame himdont blame him hed do anything on earth for me it was i said fleda eagerly who sent him back to her i made him go i pushed him out of the house i declined to have anything to say to him except on another footing  mrs gereth stared as at some gross material ravage another footing what other footing  the one ive already made so clear to you my having it in black and white as you may say from her that she freely gives him up  then you think he lies when he tells you that he has recovered his liberty  fleda hesitated a moment after which she exclaimed with a certain hard pride hes enough in love with me for anything  for anything apparently except to act like a man and impose his reason and his will on your incredible folly for anything except to put an end as any man worthy of the name would have put it to your systematic to your idiotic perversity what are you after all my dear i should like to know that a gentleman who offers you what owen offers should have to meet such wonderful exactions to take such extraordinary precautions about your sweet little scruples her resentment rose to a strange insolence which fleda took full in the face and which for the moment at least had the horrible force to present to her vengefully a showy side of the truth it gave her a blinding glimpse of lost alternatives i dont know what to think of him mrs gereth went on i dont know what to call him im so ashamed of him that i can scarcely speak of him even to you but indeed im so ashamed of you both together that i scarcely know in common decency where to look she paused to give fleda the full benefit of this remarkable statement then she exclaimed any one but a jackass would have tucked you under his arm and marched you off to the registrar  fleda wondered with her free imagination she could wonder even while her cheek stung from a slap to the registrar  that would have been the sane sound immediate course to adopt with a grain of gumption youd both instantly have felt it i should have found a way to take you you know if id been what owens supposed to be i should have got the business over first the rest could come when you liked good god girl your place was to stand before me as a woman honestly married one doesnt know what one has hold of in touching you and you must excuse my saying that youre literally unpleasant to me to meet as you are then at least we could have talked and owen if he had the ghost of a sense of humor could have snapped his fingers at your refinements  this stirring speech affected our young lady as if it had been the shake of a tambourine borne towards her from a gypsy dance her head seemed to go round and she felt a sudden passion in her feet the emotion however was but meagrely expressed in the flatness with which she heard herself presently say ill go to the registrar now  now magnificent was the sound mrs gereth threw into this monosyllable and pray whos to take you fleda gave a colorless smile and her companion continued do you literally mean that you cant put your hand upon him fledas wan grimace appeared to irritate her she made a short imperious gesture find him for me you foolfind him for me  what do you want of him fleda sadly asked feeling as you do to both of us  never mind how i feel and never mind what i say when im furious mrs gereth still more incisively added of course i cling to you you wretches or i shouldnt suffer as i do what i want of him is to see that he takes you what i want of him is to go with you myself to the place she looked round the room as if in feverish haste for a mantle to catch up she bustled to the window as if to spy out a cab she would allow half an hour for the job already in her bonnet she had snatched from the sofa a garment for the street she jerked it on as she came back find him find him she repeated come straight out with me to try at least to get at him  how can i get at him hell come when hes ready fleda replied  mrs gereth turned on her sharply ready for what ready to see me ruined without a reason or a reward  fleda was silent the worst of it all was that there was something unspoken between them neither of them dared to utter it but the influence of it was in the girls tone when she returned at last with great gentleness dont be harsh to meim very unhappy the words produced a visible impression on mrs gereth who held her face averted and sent off through the window a gaze that kept pace with the long caravan of her treasures fleda knew she was watching it wind up the avenue of poyntonfleda participated indeed fully in the vision so that after a little the most consoling thing seemed to her to add i dont see why in the world you take so for granted that hes as you say lost  mrs gereth continued to stare out of the window and her stillness denoted some success in controlling herself if hes not lost why are you unhappy  im unhappy because i torment you and you dont understand me  no fleda i dont understand you said mrs gereth finally facing her again i dont understand you at all and its as if you and owen were of quite another race and another flesh you make me feel very oldfashioned and simple and bad but you must take me as i am since you take so much else with me she spoke now with the drop of her resentment with a dry and weary calm it would have been better for me if i had never known you she pursued and certainly better if i hadnt taken such an extraordinary fancy to you but that too was inevitable everything i suppose is inevitable it was all my own doingyou didnt run after me i pounced on you and caught you up youre a stiff little beggar in spite of your pretty manners yes youre hideously misleading i hope you feel how handsome it is of me to recognize the independence of your character it was your clever sympathy that did ityour extraordinary feeling for those accursed vanities you were sharper about them than any one i had ever known and that was a thing i simply couldnt resist well the poor lady concluded after a pause you see where it has landed us  if youll go for him yourself ill wait here said fleda  mrs gereth holding her mantle together appeared for a while to consider  to his club do you mean  isnt it there when hes in town that he has a room he has at present no other london address fleda said its there one writes to him  how do i know with my wretched relations with him mrs gereth asked  mine have not been quite so bad as that fleda desperately smiled then she added his silence her silence our hearing nothing at allwhat are these but the very things on which at poynton and at ricks you rested your assurance that everything is at an end between them  mrs gereth looked dark and void yes but i hadnt heard from you then that you could invent nothing better than as you call it to send him back to her  ah but on the other hand youve learned from them what you didnt knowyouve learned by mrs brigstocks visit that he cares for me fleda found herself in the position of availing herself of optimistic arguments that she formerly had repudiated her refutation of her companion had completely changed its ground  she was in a fever of ingenuity and painfully conscious on behalf of her success that her fever was visible she could herself see the reflection of it glitter in mrs gereths sombre eyes  you plunge me in stupefaction that lady answered and at the same time you terrify me your account of owen is inconceivable and yet i dont know what to hold on by he cares for you it does appear and yet in the same breath you inform me that nothing is more possible than that hes spending these days at waterbath excuse me if im so dull as not to see my way in such darkness if hes at waterbath he doesnt care for you if he cares for you hes not at waterbath  then where is he poor fleda helplessly wailed she caught herself up however she did her best to be brave and clear before mrs gereth could reply with due obviousness that this was a question for her not to ask but to answer she found an air of assurance to say you simplify far too much you always did and you always will the tangle of life is much more intricate than youve ever i think felt it to be you slash into it cried fleda finely with a great pair of shears you nip at it as if you were one of the fates if owens at waterbath hes there to wind everything up  mrs gereth shook her head with slow austerity you dont believe a word youre saying ive frightened you as youve frightened me youre whistling in the dark to keep up our courage i do simplify doubtless if to simplify is to fail to comprehend the insanity of a passion that bewilders a young blockhead with bugaboo barriers with hideous and monstrous sacrifices i can only repeat that youre beyond me your perversitys a thing to howl over however the poor woman continued with a break in her voice a long hesitation and then the dry triumph of her will ill never mention it to you again owen i can just make out for owen is a blockhead owens a blockhead she repeated with a quiet tragic finality looking straight into fledas eyes i dont know why you dress up so the fact that hes disgustingly weak  fleda hesitated at last before her companions she lowered her look because i love him its because hes weak that he needs me she added  that was why his father whom he exactly resembles needed me and i didnt fail his father said mrs gereth she gave fleda a moment to appreciate the remark after which she pursued mona brigstock isnt weak shes stronger than you  i never thought she was weak fleda answered she looked vaguely round the room with a new purpose she had lost sight of her umbrella  i did tell you to let yourself go but its clear enough that you really havent mrs gereth declared if mona has got him  fleda had accomplished her search her interlocutress paused if mona has got him the girl inquired tightening the umbrella  well said mrs gereth profoundly it will be clear enough that mona has  has let herself go  has let herself go mrs gereth spoke as if she saw it in every detail  fleda felt the tone and finished her preparation then she went and opened the door well look for him together she said to her friend who stood a moment taking in her face they may know something about him at the colonels  well go there mrs gereth had picked up her gloves and her purse but the first thing she went on will be to wire to poynton  why not to waterbath at once fleda asked  her companion hesitated in your name  in my name i noticed a place at the corner  while fleda held the door open mrs gereth drew on her gloves forgive me she presently said kiss me she added  fleda on the threshold kissed her then they went out     xix   in the place at the corner on the chance of its saving time fleda wrote her telegramwrote it in silence under mrs gereths eye and then in silence handed it to her i send this to waterbath on the possibility of your being there to ask you to come to me mrs gereth held it a moment read it more than once then keeping it and with her eyes on her companion seemed to consider there was the dawn of a kindness in her look fleda perceived in it as if as the reward of complete submission a slight relaxation of her rigor  wouldnt it perhaps after all be better she asked before doing this to see if we can make his whereabouts certain  why so it will be always so much done said fleda though im poor she added with a smile i dont mind the shilling  the shillings my shilling said mrs gereth  fleda stayed her hand no noim superstitious  superstitious  to succeed it must be all me  well if that will make it succeed mrs gereth took back her shilling but she still kept the telegram as hes most probably not there  if he shouldnt be there fleda interrupted there will be no harm done  if he shouldnt be there mrs gereth ejaculated heaven help us how you assume it  im only prepared for the worst the brigstocks will simply send any telegram on  where will they send it  presumably to poynton  theyll read it first said mrs gereth  read it  yes mona will shell open it under the pretext of having it repeated and then shell probably do nothing shell keep it as a proof of your immodesty  what of that asked fleda  you dont mind her seeing it  rather musingly and absently fleda shook her head i dont mind anything  well then thats all right said mrs gereth as if she had only wanted to feel that she had been irreproachably considerate after this she was gentler still but she had another point to clear up why have you given for a reply your sisters address  because if he does come to me he must come to me there if that telegram goes said fleda i return to maggies tonight  mrs gereth seemed to wonder at this you wont receive him here with me  no i wont receive him here with you only where i received him lastonly there again she showed her companion that as to that she was firm  but mrs gereth had obviously now had some practice in following queer movements prompted by queer feelings she resigned herself though she fingered the paper a moment longer she appeared to hesitate then she brought out you couldnt then if i release you make your message a little stronger  fleda gave her a faint smile hell come if he can  mrs gereth met fully what this conveyed with decision she pushed in the telegram but she laid her hand quickly upon another form and with still greater decision wrote another message from me this she said to fleda when she had finished to catch him possibly at poynton will you read it  fleda turned away thank you  its stronger than yours  i dont care said fleda moving to the door mrs gereth having paid for the second missive rejoined her and they drove together to owens club where the elder lady alone got out fleda from the hansom watched through the glass doors her brief conversation with the hallporter and then met in silence her return with the news that he had not seen owen for a fortnight and was keeping his letters till called for these had been the last orders there were a dozen letters lying there he had no more information to give but they would see what they could find at colonel gereths to any connection with this inquiry however fleda now roused herself to object and her friend had indeed to recognize that on second thoughts it couldnt be quite to the taste of either of them to advertise in the remoter reaches of the family that they had forfeited the confidence of the master of poynton the letters lying at the club proved effectively that he was not in london and this was the question that immediately concerned them nothing could concern them further till the answers to their telegrams should have had time to arrive mrs gereth had got back into the cab and still at the door of the club they sat staring at their need of patience fledas eyes rested in the great hard street on passing figures that struck her as puppets pulled by strings after a little the driver challenged them through the hole in the top anywhere in particular ladies  fleda decided drive to euston please  you wont wait for what we may hear mrs gereth asked  whatever we hear i must go as the cab went on she added but i neednt drag you to the station  mrs gereth was silent a moment then nonsense she sharply replied  in spite of this sharpness they were now almost equally and almost tremulously mild though their mildness took mainly the form of an inevitable sense of nothing left to say it was the unsaid that occupied themthe thing that for more than an hour they had been going round and round without naming it much too early for fledas train they encountered at the station a long halfhour to wait fleda made no further allusion to mrs gereths leaving her their dumbness with the elapsing minutes grew to be in itself a reconstituted bond they slowly paced the great gray platform and presently mrs gereth took the girls arm and leaned on it with a hard demand for support it seemed to fleda not difficult for each to know of what the other was thinkingto know indeed that they had in common two alternating visions one of which at moments brought them as by a common impulse to a pause this was the one that was fixed the other filled at times the whole space and then was shouldered away owen and mona glared together out of the gloom and disappeared but the replenishment of poynton made a shining steady light the old splendor was there again the old things were in their places our friends looked at them with an equal yearning face to face on the platform they counted them in each others eyes fleda had come back to them by a road as strange as the road they themselves had followed the wonder of their great journeys the prodigy of this second one was the question that made her occasionally stop several times she uttered it asked how this and that difficulty had been met mrs gereth replied with pale luciditywas naturally the person most familiar with the truth that what she undertook was always somehow achieved to do it was to do itshe had more than one kind of magnificence she confessed there audaciously enough to a sort of arrogance of energy and fleda going on again her inquiry more than answered and her arm rendering service flushed in her diminished identity with the sense that such a woman was great  you do mean literally everything to the last little miniature on the last little screen  i mean literally everything go over them with the catalogue  fleda went over them while they walked again she had no need of the catalogue at last she spoke once more even the maltese cross  even the maltese cross why not that as well as everything elseespecially as i remembered how you like it  finally after an interval the girl exclaimed but the mere fatigue of it the exhaustion of such a feat i drag you to and fro here while you must be ready to drop  im very very tired mrs gereths slow headshake was tragic i couldnt do it again  i doubt if theyd bear it again  thats another matter theyd bear it if i could there wont have been this time either a shake or a scratch but im too tiredi very nearly dont care  you must sit down then till i go said fleda we must find a bench  no im tired of them im not tired of you this is the way for you to feel most how much i rest on you fleda had a compunction wondering as they continued to stroll whether it was right after all to leave her she believed however that if the flame might for the moment burn low it was far from dying out an impression presently confirmed by the way mrs gereth went on but ones fatigue is nothing the idea under which one worked kept one up for you i couldi can still nothing will have mattered if shes not there  there was a question that this imposed but fleda at first found no voice to utter it it was the thing that between them since her arrival had been so consciously and vividly unsaid finally she was able to breathe and if she is thereif shes there already  mrs gereths rejoinder too hung back then when it camefrom sad eyes as well as from lips barely movedit was unexpectedly merciful it will be very hard that was all now and it was poignantly simple the train fleda was to take had drawn up the girl kissed her as if in farewell mrs gereth submitted then after a little brought out if we have lost  if we have lost fleda repeated as she paused again  youll all the same come abroad with me  it will seem very strange to me if you want me but whatever you ask whatever you need that i will always do  i shall need your company said mrs gereth fleda wondered an instant if this were not practically a demand for penal submissionfor a surrender that in its complete humility would be a long expiation but there was none of the latent chill of the vindictive in the way mrs gereth pursued we can always as time goes on talk of them together  of the old things fleda had selected a thirdclass compartment she stood a moment looking into it and at a fat woman with a basket who had already taken possession always she said turning again to her companion never she exclaimed she got into the carriage and two men with bags and boxes immediately followed blocking up door and window so long that when she was able to look out again mrs gereth had gone     xx   there came to her at her sisters no telegram in answer to her own the rest of that day and the whole of the next elapsed without a word either from owen or from his mother she was free however to her infinite relief from any direct dealing with suspense and conscious to her surprise of nothing that could show her or could show maggie and her brotherinlaw that she was excited her excitement was composed of pulses as swift and fine as the revolutions of a spinning top she supposed she was going round but she went round so fast that she couldnt even feel herself move her emotion occupied some quarter of her soul that had closed its doors for the day and shut out even her own sense of it she might perhaps have heard something if she had pressed her ear to a partition instead of that she sat with her patience in a cold still chamber from which she could look out in quite another direction this was to have achieved an equilibrium to which she couldnt have given a name indifference resignation despair were the terms of a forgotten tongue the time even seemed not long for the stages of the journey were the items of mrs gereths surrender the detail of that performance which filled the scene was what fleda had now before her eyes the part of her loss that she could think of was the reconstituted splendor of poynton it was the beauty she was most touched by that in tons she had lostthe beauty that charged upon big wagons had safely crept back to its home but the loss was a gain to memory and love it was to her too at last that in condonation of her treachery the old things had crept back she greeted them with open arms she thought of them hour after hour they made a company with which solitude was warm and a picture that at this crisis overlaid poor maggies scant mahogany it was really her obliterated passion that had revived and with it an immense assent to mrs gereths early judgment of her she too she felt was of the religion and like any other of the passionately pious she could worship now even in the desert yes it was all for her far round as she had gone she had been strong enough her love had gathered in the spoils she wanted indeed no catalogue to count them over the array of them miles away was complete each piece in its turn was perfect to her she could have drawn up a catalogue from memory thus again she lived with them and she thought of them without a question of any personal right that they might have been that they might still be hers that they were perhaps already anothers were ideas that had too little to say to her they were nobodys at alltoo proud unlike base animals and humans to be reducible to anything so narrow it was poynton that was theirs they had simply recovered their own the joy of that for them was the source of the strange peace in which the girl found herself floating  it was broken on the third day by a telegram from mrs gereth shall be with you at 1130dont meet me at station fleda turned this over but was sufficiently expert not to disobey the injunction she had only an hour to take in its meaning but that hour was longer than all the previous time if maggie had studied her convenience the day owen came maggie was also at the present juncture a miracle of refinement increasingly and resentfully mystified in spite of all reassurance by the impression that fleda suffered more than she gained from the grandeur of the gereths she had it at heart to exemplify the perhaps truer distinction of nature that characterized the house of vetch she was not like poor fleda at every ones beck and the visitor was to see no more of her than what the arrangement of luncheon might tantalizingly show maggie described herself to her sister as intending for a just provocation even the understanding she had had with her husband that he also should remain invisible fleda accordingly awaited alone the subject of so many manoeuvresa period that was slightly prolonged even after the drawingroom door at 1130 was thrown open mrs gereth stood there with a face that spoke plain but no sound fell from her till the withdrawal of the maid whose attention had immediately attached itself to the rearrangement of a windowblind and who seemed while she bustled at it to contribute to the pregnant silence before the duration of which however she retreated with a sudden stare  he has done it said mrs gereth turning her eyes avoidingly but not unperceivingly about her and in spite of herself dropping an opinion upon the few objects in the room fleda on her side in her silence observed how characteristically she looked at maggies possessions before looking at maggies sister the girl understood and at first had nothing to say she was still dumb while mrs gereth selected with hesitation a seat less distasteful than the one that happened to be nearest on the sofa near the window the poor woman finally showed what the two past days had done for the age of her face her eyes at last met fledas its the end  theyre married  theyre married  fleda came to the sofa in obedience to the impulse to sit down by her then paused before her while mrs gereth turned up a dead gray mask a tired old woman sat there with empty hands in her lap ive heard nothing said fleda no answer came  thats the only answer its the answer to everything so fleda saw for a minute she looked over her companions head and far away he wasnt at waterbath mrs brigstock must have read your telegram and kept it but mine the one to poynton brought something we are herewhat do you want mrs gereth stopped as if with a failure of voice on which fleda sank upon the sofa and made a movement to take her hand it met no response there could be no attenuation fleda waited they sat facing each other like strangers i wanted to go down mrs gereth presently continued well i went  all the girls effort tended for the time to a single aimthat of taking the thing with outward detachment speaking of it as having happened to owen and to his mother and not in any degree to herself something at least of this was in the encouraging way she said yesterday morning  yesterday morning i saw him  fleda hesitated did you see her  thank god no  fleda laid on her arm a hand of vague comfort of which mrs gereth took no notice youve been capable just to tell me of this wretched journey of this consideration that i dont deserve  were together were together said mrs gereth she looked helpless as she sat there her eyes unseeingly enough on a tall dutch clock old but rather poor that maggie had had as a weddinggift and that eked out the bareness of the room  to fleda in the face of the event it appeared that this was exactly what they were not the last inch of common ground the ground of their past intercourse had fallen from under them yet what was still there was the grand style of her companions treatment of her mrs gereth couldnt stand upon small questions couldnt in conduct make small differences youre magnificent her young friend exclaimed theres a rare greatness in your generosity  were together were together mrs gereth lifelessly repeated thats all we are now its all we have the words brought to fleda a sudden vision of the empty little house at ricks such a vision might also have been what her companion found in the face of the stopped dutch clock yet with this it was clear that she would now show no bitterness she had done with that had given the last drop to those horrible hours in london no passion even was left to her and her forbearance only added to the force with which she represented the final vanity of everything  fleda was so far from a wish to triumph that she was absolutely ashamed of having anything to say for herself but there was one thing all the same that not to say was impossible that he has done it that he couldnt not do it shows how right i was it settled forever her attitude and she spoke as if for her own mind then after a little she added very gently for mrs gereths thats to say it shows that he was bound to her by an obligation that however much he may have wanted to he couldnt in any sort of honor break  blanched and bleak mrs gereth looked at her what sort of an obligation do you call that no such obligation exists for an hour between any man and any woman who have hatred on one side he had ended by hating her and now he hates her more than ever  did he tell you so fleda asked  no he told me nothing but the great gawk of a fact i saw him but for three minutes she was silent again and fleda as before some lurid image of this interview sat without speaking do you wish to appear as if you dont care mrs gereth presently demanded  im trying not to think of myself  then if youre thinking of owen how can you bear to think  sadly and submissively fleda shook her head the slow tears had come into her eyes i cant i dont understandi dont understand she broke out  i do then mrs gereth looked hard at the floor there was no obligation at the time you saw him lastwhen you sent him hating her as he did back to her  if he went fleda asked doesnt that exactly prove that he recognized one  he recognized rot you know what i think of him fleda knew she had no wish to challenge a fresh statement mrs gereth made oneit was her sole faint flicker of passionto the extent of declaring that he was too abjectly weak to deserve the name of a man for all fleda caredit was his weakness she loved in him he took strange ways of pleasing you her friend went on there was no obligation till suddenly the other day the situation changed  fleda wondered the other day  it came to monas knowledgei cant tell you how but it camethat the things i was sending back had begun to arrive at poynton i had sent them for you but it was her i touched mrs gereth paused fleda was too absorbed in her explanation to do anything but take blankly the full cold breath of this they were there and that determined her  determined her to what  to act to take means  to take means fleda repeated  i cant tell you what they were but they were powerful she knew how said mrs gereth  fleda received with the same stoicism the quiet immensity of this allusion to the person who had not known how but it made her think a little and the thought found utterance with unconscious irony in the simple interrogation mona  why not shes a brute  but if he knew that so well what chance was there in it for her  how can i tell you how can i talk of such horrors i can only give you of the situation what i see he knew it yes but as she couldnt make him forget it she tried to make him like it she tried and she succeeded thats what she did shes after all so much less of a fool than he and what else had he originally liked mrs gereth shrugged her shoulders she did what you wouldnt fledas face had grown dark with her wonder but her friends empty hands offered no balm to the pain in it it was that if it was anything nothing else meets the misery of it then there was quick work before he could turn round he was married  fleda as if she had been holding her breath gave the sigh of a listening child at that place you spoke of in town  at the registrars like a pair of low atheists  the girl hesitated what do people say of that i mean the world  nothing because nobody knows theyre to be married on the 17th at waterbath church if anything else comes out everybody is a little prepared it will pass for some stroke of diplomacy some move in the game some outwitting of me its known there has been a row with me  fleda was mystified people surely knew at poynton she objected if as you say shes there  she was there day before yesterday only for a few hours she met him in london and went down to see the things  fleda remembered that she had seen them only once did you see them she then ventured to ask  everything  are they right  quite right theres nothing like them said mrs gereth at this her companion took up one of her hands again and kissed it as she had done in london mona went back that night she was not there yesterday owen stayed on she added  fleda stared then shes not to live there  rather but not till after the public marriage mrs gereth seemed to muse then she brought out shell live there alone  alone  shell have it to herself  he wont live with her  never but shes none the less his wife and youre not said mrs gereth getting up our only chance is the chance she may die  fleda appeared to consider she appreciated her visitors magnanimous use of the plural mona wont die she replied  well i shall thank god till thenand with this for the first time mrs gereth put out her handdont desert me  fleda took her hand and her clasp of it was a reiteration of a promise already given she said nothing but her silence was an acceptance as responsible as the vow of a nun the next moment something occurred to her i mustnt put myself in your sons way  mrs gereth gave a dry flat laugh youre prodigious but how shall you possibly be more out of it owen and i she didnt finish her sentence  thats your great feeling about him fleda said but how after what has happened can it be his about you  mrs gereth hesitated how do you know what has happened you dont know what i said to him  yesterday  yesterday  they looked at each other with a long deep gaze then as mrs gereth seemed again about to speak the girl closing her eyes made a gesture of strong prohibition dont tell me  merciful powers how you worship him mrs gereth wonderingly moaned it was for fleda the shake that made the cup overflow she had a pause that of the child who takes time to know that he responds to an accident with pain then dropping again on the sofa she broke into tears they were beyond control they came in long sobs which for a moment mrs gereth almost with an air of indifference stood hearing and watching at last mrs gereth too sank down again mrs gereth soundlessly wearily wept     xxi   it looks just like waterbath but after all we bore that together these words formed part of a letter in which before the 17th mrs gereth writing from disfigured ricks named to fleda the day on which she would be expected to arrive there on a second visit i shant for a long time to come the missive continued be able to receive any one who may like it who would try to smooth it down and me with it but there are always things you and i can comfortably hate together for youre the only person who comfortably understands you dont understand quite everything but of all my acquaintance youre far away the least stupid for action youre no good at all but action is over for me forever and you will have the great merit of knowing when im brutally silent what i shall be thinking about without setting myself up for your equal i dare say i shall also know what are your own thoughts moreover with nothing else but my four walls youll at any rate be a bit of furniture for that you know a little ive always taken youquite one of my best finds so come if possible on the 15th  the position of a bit of furniture was one that fleda could conscientiously accept and she by no means insisted on so high a place in the list this communication made her easier if only by its acknowledgment that her friend had some thing left it still implied recognition of the principle of property something to hate and to hate comfortably was at least not the utter destitution to which after their last interview she had helplessly seemed to see mrs gereth go forth she remembered indeed that in the state in which they first saw it she herself had liked the blessed refuge of ricks and she now wondered if the tact for which she was commended had then operated to make her keep her kindness out of sight she was at present ashamed of such obliquity and made up her mind that if this happy impression quenched in the spoils of poynton should revive on the spot she would utter it to her companion without reserve yes she was capable of as much action as that all the more that the spirit of her hostess seemed for the time at least wholly to have failed mrs gereths three minutes with owen had been a blow to all talk of travel and after her woeful hour at maggies she had like some great moaning wounded bird made her way with wings of anguish back to the nest she knew she should find empty fleda on that dire day could neither keep her nor give her up she had pressingly offered to return with her but mrs gereth in spite of the theory that their common grief was a bond had even declined all escort to the station conscious apparently of something abject in her collapse and almost fiercely eager as with a personal shame to be unwatched all she had said to fleda was that she would go back to ricks that night and the girl had lived for days after with a dreadful image of her position and her misery there she had had a vision of her now lying prone on some unmade bed now pacing a bare floor like a lioness deprived of her cubs there had been moments when her minds ear was strained to listen for some sound of grief wild enough to be wafted from afar but the first sound at the end of a week had been a note announcing without reflections that the plan of going abroad had been abandoned it has come to me indirectly but with much appearance of truth that they are goingfor an indefinite time that quite settles it i shall stay where i am and as soon as ive turned round again i shall look for you the second letter had come a week later and on the 15th fleda was on her way to ricks  her arrival took the form of a surprise very nearly as violent as that of the other time the elements were different but the effect like the other arrested her on the threshold she stood there stupefied and delighted at the magic of a passion of which such a picture represented the lowwater mark wound up but sincere and passing quickly from room to room fleda broke out before she even sat down if you turn me out of the house for it my dear there isnt a woman in england for whom it wouldnt be a privilege to live here mrs gereth was as honestly bewildered as she had of old been falsely calm she looked about at the few sticks that as she afterwards phrased it she had gathered in and then hard at her guest as if to protect herself against a joke sufficiently cruel the girls heart gave a leap for this stare was the sign of an opportunity mrs gereth was all unwitting she didnt in the least know what she had done and as fleda could tell her fleda suddenly became the one who knew most that counted for the moment as a magnificent position it almost made all the difference yet what contradicted it was the vivid presence of the artists idea where on earth did you put your hand on such beautiful things  beautiful things mrs gereth turned again to the little worn bleached stuffs and the sweet spindlelegs theyre the wretched things that were herethat stupid starved old womans  the maiden aunts the nicest the dearest old woman that ever lived i thought you had got rid of the maiden aunt  she was stored in an empty barnstuck away for a sale a matter that fortunately ive had neither time nor freedom of mind to arrange ive simply in my extremity fished her out again  youve simply in your extremity made a delight of her fleda took the highest line and the upper hand and as mrs gereth challenging her cheerfulness turned again a lustreless eye over the contents of the place she broke into a rapture that was unforced but that she was conscious of an advantage in being able to feel she moved as she had done on the previous occasion from one piece to another with looks of recognition and hands that lightly lingered but she was as feverishly jubilant now as she had formerly been anxious and mute ah the little melancholy tender telltale things how can they not speak to you and find a way to your heart its not the great chorus of poynton but youre not im sure either so proud or so broken as to be reached by nothing but that this is a voice so gentle so human so femininea faint faraway voice with the little quaver of a heartbreak youve listened to it unawares for the arrangement and effect of everythingwhen i compare them with what we found the first day we came downshows even if mechanically and disdainfully exercised your admirable infallible hand its your extraordinary genius you make things compose in spite of yourself youve only to be a day or two in a place with four sticks for something to come of it  then if anything has come of it here it has come precisely of just four thats literally by the inventory all there are said mrs gereth  if there were more there would be too many to convey the impression in which half the beauty residesthe impression somehow of something dreamed and missed something reduced relinquished resigned the poetry as it were of something sensibly gone fleda ingeniously and triumphantly worked it out ah theres something here that will never be in the inventory  does it happen to be in your power to give it a name mrs gereths face showed the dim dawn of an amusement at finding herself seated at the feet of her pupil  i can give it a dozen its a kind of fourth dimension its a presence a perfume a touch its a soul a story a life theres ever so much more here than you and i were in fact just three  oh if you count the ghosts  of course i count the ghosts it seems to me ghosts count doublefor what they were and for what they are somehow there were no ghosts at poynton fleda went on that was the only fault  mrs gereth considering appeared to fall in with the girls fine humor poynton was too splendidly happy  poynton was too splendidly happy fleda promptly echoed  but its cured of that now her companion added  yes henceforth therell be a ghost or two  mrs gereth thought again she found her young friend suggestive only she wont see them  no she wont see them then fleda said what i mean is for this dear one of ours that if she had as i know she did its in the very taste of the air a great accepted pain  she had paused an instant and mrs gereth took her up well if she had  fleda still hesitated why it was worse than yours  mrs gereth reflected very likely then she too hesitated the question is if it was worse than yours  mine fleda looked vague  precisely yours  at this our young lady smiled yes because it was a disappointment she had been so sure  i see and you were never sure  never besides im happy said fleda  mrs gereth met her eyes awhile goose she quietly remarked as she turned away there was a curtness in it nevertheless it represented a considerable part of the basis of their new life  on the 18th the morning post had at last its clear message a brief account of the marriage from the residence of the brides mother of mr owen gereth of poynton park to miss mona brigstock of waterbath there were two ecclesiastics and six bridesmaids and as mrs gereth subsequently said a hundred frumps as well as a special train from town the scale of the affair sufficiently showed that the preparations had been complete for weeks the happy pair were described as having taken their departure for mr gereths own seat famous for its unique collection of artistic curiosities the newspapers and letters the fruits of the first london post had been brought to the mistress of ricks in the garden and she lingered there alone a long time after receiving them fleda kept at a distance she knew what must have happened for from one of the windows she saw her rigid in a chair her eyes strange and fixed the newspaper open on the ground and the letters untouched in her lap before the mornings end she had disappeared and the rest of that day she remained in her room it recalled to fleda who had picked up the newspaper the day months before on which owen had come down to poynton to make his engagement known the hush of the house was at least the same and the girls own waiting her soft wandering through the hours there was a difference indeed sufficiently great of which her companions absence might in some degree have represented a considerate recognition that was at any rate the meaning fleda devoutly glad to be alone attached to her opportunity mrs gereths sole allusion the next day to the subject of their thoughts has already been mentioned it was a dazzled glance at the fact that monas quiet pace had really never slackened  fleda fully assented i said of our disembodied friend here that she had suffered in proportion as she had been sure but thats not always a source of suffering its mona who must have been sure  she was sure of you mrs gereth returned but this didnt diminish the satisfaction taken by fleda in showing how serenely and lucidly she could talk     xxii   her relation with her wonderful friend had however in becoming a new one begun to shape itself almost wholly on breaches and omissions something had dropped out altogether and the question between them which time would answer was whether the change had made them strangers or yokefellows it was as if at last for better or worse they were in a clearer cruder air really to know each other fleda wondered how mrs gereth had escaped hating her there were hours when it seemed that such a feat might leave after all a scant margin for future accidents the thing indeed that now came out in its simplicity was that even in her shrunken state the lady of ricks was larger than her wrongs as for the girl herself she had made up her mind that her feelings had no connection with the case it was her pretension that they had never yet emerged from the seclusion into which after her friends visit to her at her sisters we saw them precipitately retire if she should suddenly meet them in straggling procession on the road it would be time enough to deal with them they were all bundled there together likes with dislikes and memories with fears and she had for not thinking of them the excellent reason that she was too occupied with the actual the actual was not that owen gereth had seen his necessity where she had pointed it out it was that his mothers bare spaces demanded all the tapestry that the recipient of her bounty could furnish there were moments during the month that followed when mrs gereth struck her as still older and feebler and as likely to become quite easily amused  at the end of it one day the london paper had another piece of news mr and mrs owen gereth who arrived in town last week proceed this morning to paris they exchanged no word about it till the evening and none indeed would then have been uttered had not mrs gereth irrelevantly broken out i dare say you wonder why i declared the other day with such assurance that he wouldnt live with her he apparently is living with her  surely its the only proper thing for him to do  theyre beyond mei give it up said mrs gereth  i dont give it upi never did fleda returned  then what do you make of his aversion to her  oh she has dispelled it  mrs gereth said nothing for a minute youre prodigious in your choice of terms she then simply ejaculated  but fleda went luminously on she once more enjoyed her great command of her subject i think that when you came to see me at maggies you saw too many things you had too many ideas  you had none said mrs gereth you were completely bewildered  yes i didnt quite understandbut i think i understand now the case is simple and logical enough shes a person whos upset by failure and who blooms and expands with success there was something she had set her heart upon set her teeth aboutthe house exactly as she had seen it  she never saw it at all she never looked at it cried mrs gereth  she doesnt look with her eyes she looks with her ears in her own way she had taken it in she knew she felt when it had been touched that probably made her take an attitude that was extremely disagreeable but the attitude lasted only while the reason for it lasted  go oni can bear it now said mrs gereth her companion had just perceptibly paused  i know you can or i shouldnt dream of speaking when the pressure was removed she came up again from the moment the house was once more what it had to be her natural charm reasserted itself  her natural charm mrs gereth could barely articulate  its very great everybody thinks so there must be something in it it operated as it had operated before theres no need of imagining anything very monstrous her restored good humor her splendid beauty and mr owens impressibility and generosity sufficiently cover the ground his great bright sun came out  and his great bright passion for another person went in your explanation would doubtless be perfection if he didnt love you  fleda was silent a little what do you know about his loving me  i know what mrs brigstock herself told me  you never in your life took her word for any other matter  then wont yours do mrs gereth demanded havent i had it from your own mouth that he cares for you  fleda turned pale but she faced her companion and smiled you confound mrs gereth you mix things up youve only had it from my own mouth that i care for him  it was doubtless in contradictious allusion to this which at the time had made her simply drop her head as in a strange vain reverie that mrs gereth a day or two later said to fleda dont think i shall be a bit affected if im here to see it when he comes again to make up to you  he wont do that the girl replied then she added smiling but if he should be guilty of such bad taste it wouldnt be nice of you not to be disgusted  im not talking of disgust im talking of its opposite said mrs gereth  of its opposite  why of any reviving pleasure that one might feel in such an exhibition i shall feel none at all you may personally take it as you like but what conceivable good will it do  fleda wondered to me do you mean  deuce take you no to what we dont you know by your wish ever talk about  the old things fleda considered again it will do no good of any sort to anything or any one thats another question i would rather we shouldnt discuss please she gently added  mrs gereth shrugged her shoulders  it certainly isnt worth it  something in her manner prompted her companion with a certain inconsequence to speak again that was partly why i came back to you you knowthat there should be the less possibility of anything painful  painful mrs gereth stared what pain can i ever feel again  i meant painful to myself fleda with a slight impatience explained  oh i see her friend was silent a minute you use sometimes such odd expressions well i shall last a little but i shant last forever  youll last quite as long here fleda suddenly hesitated  mrs gereth took her up with a cold smile that seemed the warning of experience against hyperbole as long as what please  the girl thought an instant then met the difficulty by adopting as an amendment the same tone as any danger of the ridiculous  that did for the time and she had moreover as the months went on the protection of suspended allusions this protection was marked when in the following november she received a letter directed in a hand at which a quick glance sufficed to make her hesitate to open it she said nothing then or afterwards but she opened it for reasons that had come to her on the morrow it consisted of a page and a half from owen gereth dated from florence but with no other preliminary she knew that during the summer he had returned to england with his wife and that after a couple of months they had again gone abroad she also knew without communication that mrs gereth round whom ricks had grown submissively and indescribably sweet had her own interpretation of her daughterinlaws share in this second migration it was a piece of calculated insolencea stroke odiously directed at showing whom it might concern that now she had poynton fast she was perfectly indifferent to living there the morning post at ricks had again been a resource it was stated in that journal that mr and mrs owen gereth proposed to spend the winter in india there was a person to whom it was clear that she led her wretched husband by the nose such was the light in which contemporary history was offered to fleda until in her own room late at night she broke the seal of her letter  i want you inexpressibly to have as a remembrance something of minesomething of real value something from poynton is what i mean and what i should prefer you know everything there and far better than i whats best and what isnt there are a lot of differences but arent some of the smaller things the most remarkable i mean for judges and for what theyd bring what i want you to take from me and to choose for yourself is the thing in the whole house thats most beautiful and precious i mean the gem of the collection dont you know if it happens to be of such a sort that you can take immediate possession of itcarry it right away with youso much the better youre to have it on the spot whatever it is i humbly beg of you to go down there and see the people have complete instructions theyll act for you in every possible way and put the whole place at your service theres a thing mamma used to call the maltese cross and that i think ive heard her say is very wonderful is that the gem of the collection perhaps you would take it or anything equally convenient only i do want you awfully to let it be the very pick of the place let me feel that i can trust you for this you wont refuse if you will think a little what it must be that makes me ask  fleda read that last sentence over more times even than the rest she was baffledshe couldnt think at all of what it might be this was indeed because it might be one of so many things she made for the present no answer she merely little by little fashioned for herself the form that her answer should eventually wear there was only one form that was possiblethe form of doing at her time what he wished she would go down to poynton as a pilgrim might go to a shrine and as to this she must look out for her chance she lived with her letter before any chance came a month and even after a month it had mysteries for her that she couldnt meet what did it mean what did it represent to what did it correspond in his imagination or his soul what was behind it what was beyond it what was in the deepest depth within it she said to herself that with these questions she was under no obligation to deal there was an explanation of them that for practical purposes would do as well as another he had found in his marriage a happiness so much greater than in the distress of his dilemma he had been able to take heart to believe that he now felt he owed her a token of gratitude for having kept him in the straight path that explanation i say she could throw off but no explanation in the least mattered what determined her was the simple strength of her impulse to respond the passion for which what had happened had made no difference the passion that had taken this into account before as well as after found here an issue that there was nothing whatever to choke it found even a relief to which her imagination immensely contributed would she act upon his offer she would act with secret rapture to have as her own something splendid that he had given her of which the gift had been his signed desire would be a greater joy than the greatest she had supposed to be left to her and she felt that till the sense of this came home she had even herself not known what burned in her successful stillness it was an hour to dream of and watch for to be patient was to draw out the sweetness she was capable of feeling it as an hour of triumph the triumph of everything in her recent life that had not held up its head she moved there in thoughtin the great rooms she knew she should be able to say to herself that for once at least her possession was as complete as that of either of the others whom it had filled only with bitterness and a thousand times yesher choice should know no scruple the thing she should go down to take would be up to the height of her privilege the whole place was in her eyes and she spent for weeks her private hours in a luxury of comparison and debate it should be one of the smallest things because it should be one she could have close to her and it should be one of the finest because it was in the finest he saw his symbol she said to herself that of what it would symbolize she was content to know nothing more than just what her having it would tell her at bottom she inclined to the maltese crosswith the added reason that he had named it but she would look again and judge afresh she would on the spot so handle and ponder that there shouldnt be the shade of a mistake  before christmas she had a natural opportunity to go to london there was her periodical call upon her father to pay as well as a promise to maggie to redeem she spent her first night in west kensington with the idea of carrying out on the morrow the purpose that had most of a motive her fathers affection was not inquisitive but when she mentioned to him that she had business in the country that would oblige her to catch an early train he deprecated her excursion in view of the menace of the weather it was spoiling for a storm all the signs of a winter gale were in the air she replied that she would see what the morning might bring and it brought in fact what seemed in london an amendment she was to go to maggie the next day and now that she had started her eagerness had become suddenly a pain she pictured her return that evening with her trophy under her cloak so that after looking from the doorstep up and down the dark street she decided with a new nervousness and sallied forth to the nearest place of access to the underground the december dawn was dolorous but there was neither rain nor snow it was not even cold and the atmosphere of west kensington purified by the wind was like a dirty old coat that had been bettered by a dirty brush at the end of almost an hour in the larger station she had taken her place in a thirdclass compartment the prospect before her was the run of eighty minutes to poynton the train was a fast one and she was familiar with the moderate measure of the walk to the park from the spot at which it would drop her  once in the country indeed she saw that her father was right the breath of december was abroad with a force from which the london labyrinth had protected her the green fields were black the sky was all alive with the wind she had in her anxious sense of the elements her wonder at what might happen a reminder of the surmises in the old days of going to the continent that used to worry her on the way at night to the horrid cheap crossings by long sea something in a dire degree at this last hour had begun to press on her heart it was the sudden imagination of a disaster or at least of a check before her errand was achieved when she said to herself that something might happen she wanted to go faster than the train but nothing could happen save a dismayed discovery that by some altogether unlikely chance the master and mistress of the house had already come back in that case she must have had a warning and the fear was but the excess of her hope it was every ones being exactly where every one was that lent the quality to her visit beyond lands and seas and alienated forever they in their different ways gave her the impression to take as she had never taken it at last it was already there though the darkness of the day had deepened they had whizzed past chaterchater which was the station before the right one off in that quarter was an air of wild rain but there shimmered straight across it a brightness that was the color of the great interior she had been haunting that vision settled before herin the house the house was all and as the train drew up she rose in her mean compartment quite proudly erect with the thought that all for fleda vetch then the house was standing there  but with the opening of the door she encountered a shock though for an instant she couldnt have named it the next moment she saw it was given her by the face of the man advancing to let her out an old lame porter of the station who had been there in mrs gereths time and who now recognized her he looked up at her so hard that she took an alarm and before alighting broke out to him theyve come back she had a confused absurd sense that even he would know that in this case she mustnt be there he hesitated and in the few seconds her alarm had completely changed its ground it seemed to leap with her quick jump from the carriage to the ground that was that of his stare at her smoke she was on the platform with her frightened sniff it had taken her a minute to become aware of an extraordinary smell the air was full of it and there were already heads at the window of the train looking out at something she couldnt see some one the only other passenger had got out of another carriage and the old porter hobbled off to close his door the smoke was in her eyes but she saw the stationmaster from the end of the platform recognize her too and come straight to her he brought her a finer shade of surprise than the porter and while he was coming she heard a voice at a window of the train say that something was a good bit offa mile from the town that was just what poynton was then her heart stood still at the white wonder in the stationmasters face  youve come down to it miss already  at this she knew poyntons on fire  gone misswith this awful gale you werent wired look out he cried in the next breath seizing her the train was going on and she had given a lurch that almost made it catch her as it passed when it had drawn away she became more conscious of the pervading smoke which the wind seemed to hurl in her face  gone she was in the mans hands she clung to him  burning still miss aint it quite too dreadful took early this morningthe whole place is up there  in her bewildered horror she tried to think have they come back  back theyll be there all day  not mr gereth i meannor his wife  nor his mother missnot a soul of them back a pack o servants in chargenot the old ladys lot eh a nice job for caretakers some rotten chimley or one of them portable lamps set down in the wrong place what has done it is this cruel cruel night then as a great wave of smoke half choked them he drew her with force to the little waiting room awkward for you missi see  she felt sick she sank upon a seat staring up at him do you mean that great house is lost  it was near it i was told an hour agothe fury of the flames had got such a start i was there myself at six the very first i heard of it they were fighting it then but you couldnt quite say they had got it down  fleda jerked herself up were they saving the things  thats just where it was missto get at the blessed things and the want of right helpit maddened me to stand and see em muff it this aint a place like for anything organized they dont come up to a reel emergency  she passed out of the door that opened toward the village and met a great acrid gust she heard a faroff windy roar which in her dismay she took for that of flames a mile away and which the first instant acted upon her as a wild solicitation i must go there she had scarcely spoken before the same omen had changed into an appalling check  her vivid friend moreover had got before her he clearly suffered from the nature of the control he had to exercise dont do that missyou wont care for it at all then as she waveringly stood her ground its not a place for a young lady nor if youll believe me a sight for them as are in any way affected  fleda by this time knew in what way she was affected she became limp and weak again she felt herself give everything up mixed with the horror with the kindness of the stationmaster with the smell of cinders and the riot of sound was the raw bitterness of a hope that she might never again in life have to give up so much at such short notice she heard herself repeat mechanically yet as if asking it for the first time poyntons gone  the man hesitated what can you call it miss if it aint really saved  a minute later she had returned with him to the waitingroom where in the thick swim of things she saw something like the disk of a clock is there an uptrain she asked  in
