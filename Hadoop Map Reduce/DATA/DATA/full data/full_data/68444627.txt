a young fakir   im going to try it deacon jones says i can have the right to run both things for ten dollars and uncle nathan is going to lend me money enough to get the stock  what scheme have you got in your head now teddy hargreaves and mrs fernald looked over her spectacles at the son of her widowed sister who was literally breathless in his excitement  im going to run a cane an knife board at the peach bottom fair and try to make money enough to pay the debt mother owes on the place  youre crazymad as a march hare the idea of a child like you setting yourself up to earn three or four hundred dollars when your father worked all his life and couldnt get so much together  mrs fernald really appeared to be angry and she really believed there was good cause why she should lose her temper the thought that little teddya whiflet she called himshould set up his opinion in such matters against his elders and attempt to earn in one season an amount which seth hargreaves had never been able to repay during his thirtysix years of life was so preposterous that the good lady looked upon the boys assertion as positive proof that he was not only ready but willing to fly in the face of providence  i shall try it all the same teddy replied in a most provokingly matteroffact tone an im going down to see uncle nathan this very minute  very well and i consider it my bounden duty to advise your mother to keep you in the house until the fair is ended aunt sarah said as she took from its peg the wellworn gingham sunbonnet  teddy had no desire to prolong the conversation which had been begun simply because his aunt insisted on knowing where he had been but hurried away from the gate on which he had been swinging while mrs fernald questioned him as if fearful lest she might try to detain him until the matter could be settled according to her own ideas of propriety  i can have the right to run what i want to every day the fair lasts for ten dollars an now if you lend me fifteen ill be all right the boy cried as he burst into nathan hargreaves store just as the old gentleman was adding a trifle more sand to the sugar in order to compensate for what might possibly have been spilled by the careless clerk  oh its fixed eh and youre really goin to turn fakir uncle nathan asked wrinkling his face into the semblance of a laugh but remaining silent as if fearing to waste even such a cheap thing as mirth  whats a fakir  a man or a boy for that matter who goes out to sell things as you count on doin if im fool enough to let you throw away fifteen good dollars of mine  but you promised to lend me the money  an im going to do it but that dont make me any less a fool jest because im holdin to my word tell me what you count on doin an then well come down to the business end of the scheme  ill pay the ten dollars ive got to deacon jones for the right to run the games an with what you lend me im goin to waterville an buy a whole lot of knives an canes theres a storekeeper over there who promises to sell that kind of goods for less than they cost him  an hes lyin when he says it people dont do business for the fun of it but thats neither here nor there so far as our trade is concerned im goin to give you the fifteen dollars nowits a power of money for a boy of your size teddy an if you make anything as i allow you will im to have eighteen dollars back dont forget that part of the trade  ill stand to what i agreed uncle nathan and you shall be paid the very day the fair closes  here it is and with a sigh which was almost a groan uncle nathan took from a fat calfskin wallet three fivedollar bills adding as he handed them to teddy be careful of it my boy for im puttin almost too much confidence in a child of your size an nobody knows how distressed id be if anything happened to prevent your paying it back  teddy placed the money carefully in the inside pocket of his vest and after promising for at least the hundredth time that it should be repaid by the close of the following week hurried home confident in the belief that he was on an extremely short road to wealth  mrs hargreaves was by no means as sanguine as her son concerning the success of the scheme and actually appeared frightened when teddy showed her the money he had received from his uncle nathan who was reputed to be the closestfisted merchant to be found within a days ride of peach bottom run  if you should lose it teddy and be unable to pay him back at the exact time you promised it would be the undoing of us for we could never expect to get another dollar i know he is not generous but have always believed that if we should be in yet more straitened circumstances he would give us some assistance he has neither charity nor mercy for any one who does not pay a little more than his just debts  but i shall give back every cent of this mother so dont look as if you were in such distress i want to go to waterville to buy my stock in the morning an am counting on walking its only seven miles an ill save fifty cents by traveling on shanks mare  i will have breakfast ready by four oclock but you must come back on the stage teddy  yes if i feel very tired but i dont know of any easier way to earn a dollar than by walking both ways  the young fakir believed he knew exactly what kind and amount of stock he wished to purchase on the following day therefore he had no preparations to make for the journey save to get his limbs in the best possible condition for the tramp by retiring very early in order to scoop in plenty of sleep  the thought of the success which should attend him in his new venture kept his eyes open a long while after getting into bed and when he finally succeeded in crossing over to the land of nod dreams of the fortune to be made during the coming week visited his brain and remained there until his mothers voice summoned him to breakfast  the sun had not yet come up from behind the hills when he was trudging sturdily along over the dusty road carrying a generous luncheon tied in a snowywhite napkin and with his money secured by many pins in the lining of his cap  be careful not to lose it for your uncle nathan would never forgive you his mother had said and he cried cheerily as he walked swiftly down the lane to the highway  theres no fear of anything like that happening the bills cant get away without my knowing it so long as they stay here and teddy pulled his cap yet more closely down on his head  in a trifle more than two hours he was at waterville wondering why the stores were not open no matter how early it was when such an important customer as himself came to town  since the merchants were evidently ignorant of his arrival as was evidenced by the fact that their places of business yet remained closed there was no more profitable occupation for him than to eat a second breakfast which he proceeded to do using a handtruck on the depotplatform as a seat  the train which left new york on the evening before had arrived some time previous and the station was temporarily deserted by all save a boy of about teddys age who was walking to and fro in an aimless manner  by the time the young fakir had finished his second biscuit he noticed that the stranger was watching him narrowly and holding forth the napkin with its generous store he asked  have one  i dont care if i do said the boy carelessly and he continued  i reckon you live round here  no i jest come up from peach bottom run an am waiting for the stores to be opened  why youre from the same place where the fair is goin to be held  no i live at the run an the fair is over to peach bottom most five miles from my house are you goin there  i should reckon i was why im goin to help run it  you are and teddys mouth opened wide in astonishment  yes sirree an you fellers will be jest about crazy when i tell you what ive come to do  dont flash it upon us too quick for we wanter kind of keep our wits about us till the fun is over  the tone of sarcasm in teddys voice appeared to nettle the stranger  ive come down here to give away a steamboat whats worth five hundred dollars  then there aint any need for you to go any farther cause im willin to take it now  if you wont be so smart ill tell you about it was the dignified reply theres a firm out in detroit whats goin to do that very thing to the feller that can guess how much she weighs an ive been hired to help the man who is comin down to peach bottom to show off a lot of boats  what are you goin to do and now teddy was interested  row around in the creek while he looks out for the stuff in the fair it wont be any moren fun an if youll come over ill take you out  i dont spose you could help me guess how much the steamer weighs could you  there aint anybody as can do that cause you see she aint built yet but you can find out all about it by lookin on the fair grounds for the circulars what the davis boat and oar company of detroit will throw around an if theres somethin else you wanter know jest ask for sam balderston all the folks will know me before ive been there very long  im going to work at the fair myself teddy replied and then in response to his new friends questions he gave him all the particulars of his proposed venture  i reckon youll get along all right an come out way ahead if some of these smart fakirs dont try to get the best of you say why cant i go to your house an stay till its time to go over to the fair ill pay my way  if mothers willin id like to have you an i dont believe shell care now ive got to buy my stuff wherell i meet you afterward  im goin with you sam said in a matteroffact tone i know a good deal about such things an wont see you cheated  teddy hardly thought he was in need of any assistance but since he did not want to offend this fellow who was concerned in giving away a steamboat he could not well refuse therefore the two started up the street together     chapter ii  an old fakir   sam had very much advice to give during the short walk and while the greater portion of it was worthless there were bits which might be of value to the young fakir  dont buy anything till you have seen all there is in town an then youll know which is the cheapest sam repeated several times with an air of wisdom and teddy believed this to be a good idea  with this object in view the two boys walked from store to store examining that particular quality of canes and knives which teddy thought would be best suited to his purpose and sam had no hesitation in criticising the goods boldly until more than one of the clerks lost his temper entirely and refused to show the full stock  if you go on this way sam we wont get the business done to day an i want to send the stuff down in the stage which leaves here at three oclock  therell be plenty of time for that i know what im about now if you had sent your money to me id got you a dandy lot in new york for almost nothing  seeins how i didnt even know your name till a couple of hours ago there wasnt much chance for me to do that an i guess ill make out well enough here if you dont keep on raisin a fuss with the clerks  i wont so much as yip agin if thats the way you look at it the question is which store youre goin to buy from  theres a place near the depot that wasnt open when we came past lets go there an then ill make up my mind  sam feeling a trifle injured because his advice had not been fully appreciated said nothing more until they were near the station and then seeing a train approaching he proposed that they stop for a few minutes  jest as likely as not therell be people on it whom i know goin to the fair an you want to get acquainted with all the fakirs sos theyll help you along now an then  the stage goes at three  an it aint moren ten now come on sam cried triumphantly as he motioned for teddy to come nearer  sam had already quickened his pace and teddy was forced to follow or injure the feelings of one whom he believed held a responsible position in the peach bottom exhibition among the passengers alighting from the train as the boys arrived was a man who carried a large package enveloped in green cloth and sam whispered excitedly  ill bet thats an old fakir and if he is we want to let him know who we are  teddy failed to understand exactly why this was necessary but his companion seemed so positive on the point that he remained silent  this particular passenger appeared to have plenty of time at his disposal he placed his package at one end of the platform lighted a pipe and then walked to and fro as the remainder of the travelers dispersed  you foller me an well find out who he is sam whispered when he thought a fitting opportunity had come and then advanced boldly toward the stranger goin to the fair he asked  yes what of it  nothin only i spose you know youve got to take another train here  if i didnt why would i be loafin around this dead place  i jest spoke of it cause this feller an i are goin there too and sam waved his hand in the direction where teddy was standing  i spose therell be other boys besides you at the fair eh  but we belong to it im to give a steamboat away an hes goin to run a cane an knife board were waiting here to buy the stock  illustration the three notes were handed to the generous stranger  oh you are eh and now the man appeared to be interested i reckon youre goin to spend as much as a dollar  one why hes got fifteen an the whole of it will be spent before the stage leaves we know something about the business an dont count on gettin an outfit for nothing  i thought you was a fakir the man said in a more friendly tone as unobserved by the worldlywise sam he made a peculiar gesture to a stranger immediately in the rear  thats what i am was the proud reply an ill make things hum over at peach bottom before i leave the town you see i thought id speak to you cause all of us fellers should know each other  youre right an its mighty lucky you did strike up an acquaintance for i can give you a big lift ive helped many a boy into the business when they had money enough to help themselves  the last dozen words were spoken in a loud tone as if for the benefit of the stranger in the rear but instead of waiting to hear more the latter turned abruptly and walked toward the package with a green covering at the end of the platform  i knew we oughter talk with you  did you count on buying your stuff in this onehorse town the man asked as teddy approached and the latter replied  there wasnt any other place i could go to cause it costs too much for a ticket to new york  how big a stock do you want  all i can get for fifteen dollars dont you think that will be enough  it depends the stranger replied reflectively if you buy the goods here youll have to pay such a big price that it wont be much of a pile now ifive got the very thing in mind youll remember the day you saw me if my plan works i know a fakir here who has a fine layout that he wants to sell you can get fifty dollars worth of stuff forwell he asks twenty but ill say you are friends of mine an the chances are you can make a trade  that would be a regular snap sam cried and teddys eyes glistened at the thought of thus procuring a full outfit so cheaply  ill do what i can for you the man said in a patronizing tone at any rate ill make him come down in his price and if theres any balance it can be paid after the fair has been opened long enough for you to take in some money  if business is good im willing to do what is right teddy replied but i must pay uncle nathan first  how much do you owe him  fifteen dollars  why bless my soul itll be a pretty poor fair if you cant make five times that amount in the first two days  where can we see the man sam asked eager that his wonderfully good trade should be consummated at the earliest possible opportunity  i dont know but hes somewhere in the town give me your cash an ill hunt him up inside of half an hour the stuff is right here in the baggageroom and you can ship it on the stage without any trouble  just for an instant teddy hesitated to part with what seemed to him like an enormous amount of money but then came the thought that an old fakir would not wrong a young oneand he considered himself such after some little difficulty he succeeded in extracting all the pins and the three notes were handed to the generous stranger almost at the same moment that the greencovered package disappeared from the edge of the platform simultaneously with the departure of the second stranger  wait right here for me the man said as he put the money in his pocket ive got too much work to do to spend any very great amount of time hunting you fellows up in case you dont stay in one place  after thus cautioning them the old fakir walked slowly away and sam said  it was lucky you fell in with me teddy for i know how these things are worked an can give you a good many pointers before the fair is over why youll have a firstclass outfit for about half what its worth  yes its a good chance but i cant see why he didnt take us with him if he was in a hurry an then he wouldnt have had to come back  hes got to do that anyway for his stuff is here sam replied pointing toward where he had last seen the mans package but it was no longer there i guess the baggagemaster has taken it in he added but you neednt be afraid of losin your money while im with you  then sam occupied his companions attention by telling of his many alleged wonderful exploits and an hour passed before his story was concluded  in the meantime one train had arrived and departed another was on the point of leaving the depot bound for peach bottom when teddy cried as he leaped to his feet  see im certain thats the man who has got my money  where  on the platform of the front car  before he could say anything more the train steamed out leaving the wouldbe young fakir staring at it in distress and consternation  of course it wasnt him sam said confidently when the last car had disappeared from view the stuff he was gointo buy for you is here in the baggageroom cause he said so an well see him before long  illustration see im certain thats the man who has got my money  teddys suspicions had been aroused and he was not easily quieted the thought that it was possible he might have lost the money loaned him by uncle nathan was sufficient to cause the liveliest fear and he said decidedly  im going to know where that mans baggage went to  howll you find out  ask the baggagemaster  dont make a fool of yourself it would be nice for an old fakir like that man to know you thought hed steal your money  i dont care what he knows so long as i get my fifteen dollars back  teddy trembling with apprehension and excitement went into the baggageroom and asked there if a greencovered package had been taken in by any of the attendants  no one had seen such an article and all were positive there was nothing of the kind remaining in their charge  then he asked if a bundle of canes had been left there and to this question there was a most decided negative  the hangerson at the fairs havent begun to come yet the baggagemaster said and when they do come we shant have any of their stuff to handle for it will all be transferred across the platform without being brought in here what is the matter anything gone wrong  the lump which had been rising in teddys throat was now so large that it was with difficulty he could say  a man has run off with fifteen dollars of mine an uncle nathan will jest about kill me     chapter iii  a friend   the baggagemaster immediately displayed the utmost sympathy for the victim of the old fakirs seductive scheme and sam was loud in his denunciations of a brother in the craft who would serve them in such a shabby manner  you leave him to me an ill show you what can be done that young gentleman said and teddy replied reproachfully  ive left too much to you already if you hadnt thought it was necessary to make the acquaintance of every fellow who was going to the fair id have my fifteen dollars in my cap now  ill get them back for you  how  i cant say jest now but you wait an see what i can do  inasmuch as teddy must account first to his mother and afterward to uncle nathan for that amount the confident assertion of his friend failed to give him any mental relief and he said quite sharply  you thought it was all right to give the money to him an if you didnt know any more than a country boy whod never even heard of such fellows i cant see how you can do much toward helping  at this point the baggagemaster who had been listening to the conversation broke in with the sage remark  its no use for you fellows to fight over what has been done the money is gone theres no doubt about that but it may be you can get it back  how teddy asked eagerly  by notifying the police and it is possible that they may find your man long before the fair is ended  but even if they should how can i pay uncle nathan the eighteen dollars he wants after givin deacon jones the ten which i promised  that of course is a question i cannot answer the officer of the company replied not unkindly but it will certainly be better to get some of the money back than to lose the whole  of course it will sam said promptly after waiting a few seconds without hearing any reply from teddy tell us what to do an ill see to the whole thing  hello what kind of a meeting are you holding here a cheery voice cried and looking up the disconsolate teddy saw a merchant whose stock he had been examining a short time previous  in a few words the baggagemaster explained the condition of affairs  can nothing be done the merchant asked  it is barely possible the fact of the matter is that the two swindlers left on the last train and this boys money has gone with them beyond a doubt  then the merchant turned to the wouldbe fakir and asked for further particulars which were readily given the latter saying as he finished the sad story  uncle nathan is bound to raise a big row an i wont be able to help mother as i counted on doing but i spose it serves me right  im not so sure of that lad for all of us are liable to be taken in at some time or another it is possible you may make money at the fair and i will give you credit to the amount you lost go to the store show this slip and get what you think may be needed  while speaking the merchant had been writing on a piece of paper torn from his memorandum book and when he handed it to teddy the almost heartbroken boy read the following words       the bearer edward hargreaves is entitled to credit thirty      days time on all he may need to the extent of thirty      dollars                                                        john reaves  but i only lost fifteen dollars teddy said as he read the order  i so understood but you may need more therefore i have made the amount sufficiently large dont hesitate to buy what is wanted and whether you ever find the swindler or not i feel very positive my bill will be paid  teddy tried to thank the merchant but that lump in his throat was still too near his mouth to admit of many words and sam whispered  dont say anything more about it youve struck the biggest kind of luck and the safest way is to hold your tongue  even had it been possible to speak teddy could not have said all that was in his heart and before sam had time to give any further advice the merchant boarded a train which was just starting for new york leaving the young fakir and his newlymade friend to settle matters among themselves  youre in big luck the latter said consolingly whats the difference if you have lost fifteen dollars so long as you know how to get thirty dollars worth of goods to start in business  but this bill will have to be paid and uncle nathan must have his money that leaves me fortyfive dollars in debt  sposen it does youre bound to make a good deal moren that an im here to help you through  teddy came very near saying that if sam had not been there the fifteen dollars would still be reposing beneath the lining of his cap but he succeeded in checking himself and the reproachful words remained unspoken  at this point in the conversation the baggagemaster insisted that information of the swindler should be given to the police and whether they desired to do so or not the boys were forced to accompany him to headquarters  here it is possible their story might have been told without exciting more than ordinary interest if the name of the kindlydisposed merchant had not been used but that was sufficient to awaken a decided interest and every detail was written down carefully  we will try to get the money for you the chief said several of my men will be at the fair and if you see this fellow again information must be given to them immediately  teddy had but little hope that any good would result by this means but he promised faithfully to do as requested and then the boys were at liberty to finish the business which had been interrupted so disastrously  so much time had been wasted that it was necessary to move around very lively in order to have the goods ready before the stage should leave and teddy did a great deal toward expediting matters by explaining to the clerk at the store on which he had the order for credit exactly what he proposed to do  the young man understood at once the kind of goods which would be needed and without listening to the many suggestions made by sam selected a good assortment of both knives and canes  aint you getting more than thirty dollars worth teddy asked as the clerk continued to add to the pile  i think not these are all cheap goods you know and make a big show without amounting to any very great value i will put in cotton cloth enough for the cane board and as many rings as you will need unless business should be very brisk  the clerk was bent on making the bill exactly the size of the order and when the prices had been figured out teddy had invested just thirty dollars in a stock which must bring in a profit of at least fifty per cent in order to admit of his paying the debts already contracted  the goods were to be put on the stage by the salesman and there was nothing further for the boys to do but decide on their manner of traveling to the run  after losin fifteen dollars i reckon theres only one thing for me to do teddy said as they left the store im gointo walk but you can do as you please  sposen we both ride youre bound to make a pile of money before the fair is over an can afford by jinks theres that fakir now  in an instant sam was off at full speed crying stop thief with the full strength of his lungs as he pursued a man carrying a bundle covered with green cloth  such an appeal was well calculated to arouse every idler in the immediate vicinity and before teddy fully understood what had happened not less than twenty men and boys were in chase of the stranger who strange to say had not quickened his pace  the thought that it might yet be possible to regain his money lent unusual speed to the wouldbe fakirs heels and he was among the foremost when the man suddenly halted turned squarely around and asked  what is the matter with you people do you want me  i guess we do a policeman replied as he seized the stranger by the collar somebody yelled for us to stop the thief and you must be the man  who says i am was the angry question  by this time both teddy and sam had discovered the latters mistake the only point of resemblance between this stranger and the one who stole the money was that both carried packages covered with green cloth but while the first bundle was bulky and apparently heavy this was small and readily held under the mans arm  sam did not wait to explain matters fearing lest he might get into serious trouble because of the mistake he slipped quietly away leaving teddy to bear the brunt of the accuseds wrath  the latter realized that something must be done at once for the greater portion of the crowd was looking inquiringly at him and he said in a voice which was far from steady  i didnt do the hollerin but a feller who was with me when a man stole my money thought you must be the one  where is he the stranger asked advancing threateningly  i dont know he ran away when he saw it was a mistake  the crowd immediately began to disperse the policeman called down quite the reverse of blessings on sams head and then walked away leaving teddy and the stranger comparatively alone  i dont know as it does any harm to have a lot of fools chasing a man the latter said but it might give him a bad name in his work  im very sorry sir but you see  im not blaming you my boy since it was the other fellow who did the mischief tell me how you lost your stuff  my what  your stuffmoney  oh and teddy at once gave the stranger a detailed account of all that had happened the latter saying as the story was concluded  i wouldnt be afraid to bet my head that long jim was the duck who played the trick i know he came here headed for the fair grounds and its jest about his style of working  do you think theres any chance ill get it back  he shall give up if i see him ill be at the fair myself working a neat little game and will see you there  with this remark the stranger walked away and teddy went toward the depot once more feeling quite certain he had made a friend who would aid him in his new venture     chapter iv  uncle nathan   when teddy reached the depot he was not obliged to hunt very long for sam for that young gentleman crept out from behind a pile of baggage on seeing his friend was alone and asked in a hoarse whisper  what did that feller do to you  nothing but that dont prove we should get out of another scrape so easily and you must be careful or well be in no end of trouble before the fair is ended  i was only tryin to catch your money  it surely wouldnt have done any harm if you had found out whether that was the man or not before you started the whole crowd after him  thats right rub it into a feller when he tries to do you a good turn sam said sarcastically and then remembering an instant later that he proposed to be this boys guest he added i was only lookin out for you an so long as theres been no harm done we neednt talk about it do you still mean to walk home  theres nothing else to be done if we want to get to the run tonight for the stage left while we were chasing that man  this was exactly what he did not want to do but under the circumstances there was no help for it and the young gentleman who expected to form such a prominent portion of the fair set out by the side of the friend whom he had injured while thinking to do him a favor  at the end of a trifle less than three hours when both were footsore hungry and weary the boys arrived at teddys home and mrs hargreaves made the stranger welcome despite the inconvenience caused by his coming  not until after sam had retired did teddy tell his mother of the theft and for several moments the widow was in great mental distress but finally she viewed the matter in a more cheerful light and it was resolved that uncle nathan should not be told of the mishap  it would only make him angry mrs hargreaves said and you must pay him before the merchant who was so kind to you gets his money but i am terribly afraid teddy that the whole scheme will be a failure  the amateur fakir assured her as best he could and when they retired that night both teddy and his mother were in a comparatively contented frame of mind  the following day was sunday on which not even the all engrossing topic of caneboards and knives was to be discussed but before the family had finished breakfast the arrival of a stranger forced them into worldly topics  the newcomer was none other than the man whom sam had accused of being the thief and he explained the cause of his visit by saying  i have reason to believe that long jim the fakir who got away with your sons money will be over here tonight because the hotels at peach bottom are crowded and it is possible he may be forced to give up the stuff although not exactly understanding what he meant the widow insisted on his coming into the house and he laid the details of his plan before teddy and sam  ill hang around here for him the stranger said and you shall say if he is the man who did you up after that ill take a hand in the business and itll be queer if between us all we cant make him do the square thing more especially since the rest of his gang havent come yet  as might be expected teddy was excited by the prospect of recovering the money which he had believed was lost beyond reclaim and plans were at once laid to trap the dishonest fakir  while this conversation was being carried on uncle nathan came in to learn how his nephew had succeeded in town and the stranger introduced himself as frank hazelton a dealer in jewelry which was to be on exhibition during the coming week at the fair  the old man was delighted to make the strangers acquaintance for he fancied there would be an opportunity for him to take the agency of a valuable line of goods without the outlay of any money and in a very few moments the two were fast friends  uncle nathan not only monopolized nearly all the conversation but insisted on showing mr hazelton around the village and actually forced the latter to accompany him despite the fact that it was sunday when an honest merchant is not supposed to so much as think of business  on the following day it would be necessary for those who had purchased the privilege of doing business on the fair grounds to be present ready to select their different sites for working and very shortly after the sun sank behind the hills sam and teddy retired in order to be ready for an early start next morning since the first stage left the run at halfpast five  it lacked fully an hour of that time when the boys were called to breakfast by mrs hargreaves and in less than fifteen minutes they were at the table eating a hearty breakfast which was interrupted by the appearance of uncle nathan who looked as if he had not been in bed since the evening previous  ive been robbed he cried passionately and this is what comes of trying to help my nephew enter a disreputable line of business i believe you induced that man to come here explaining all about my store simply that he might act the burglar and it wouldnt take much to make me think you had agreed to divide with him the illgotten gains he added shaking his fist in the direction of teddy who was so astounded by the news as to be literally incapable of movement  what do you mean nathan mrs hargreaves cried  just what i said my store was robbed last night and your precious son knows the thief better than i do  you mean the man who came here yesterday the widow asked while teddy and sam gazed at the old man in openmouthed astonishment  of course i do who else could it be didnt i take him over there yesterday and didnt i explain just how difficult it was to deposit money in a bank because a man would have to pay a dollar to go to waterville an back or trust the stage driver to do the business  by this time teddy had recovered something like composure and he said gravely  we have no means of knowing what you said to mr hazelton but if you told him all your business that is no concern of ours you insisted on his going away with you and we havent seen him since  but you lied to me about my money  in what way  you never said a word about its being stolen  if i never said a word i couldnt have told a lie he has evidently given the whole story but what happened in waterville has nothing to do with the robbery of your store  oh it hasnt eh well im beginning to think it was a job cooked up by all hands to get the best of me  if it had been and now teddy was on his feet looking the angry old man squarely in the face why wouldnt i have said something about it in order to make the story seem straighter a merchant in waterville trusted me for the goods i wanted after he heard the money was gone and i count on paying you before i do him  oh you do eh well its mighty doubtful whether you or this precious friend of yours will ever see the fair for im going to get out a warrant for the whole lot before im done with this thing  would you arrest teddy when he has been in this house ever since you left here yesterday morning mrs hargreaves cried  ill have my money back and the sooner your smart son tells me where it is the sooner he can go about his business but he must first pay me back my eighteen dollars  i only borrowed fifteen uncle nathan and that you will get before next wednesday if you want to arrest me go ahead but i promise that youll be sorry for it  so you threaten do you thats what comes of trying to help an ungrateful boy i knew he was going to the bad from the first minute he talked about having a caneboard the old man added as he turned to the widow and i predict that hell come to no good even if he manages to get out of this scrape  you thought it was a good idea for me to do as i proposed teddy replied standing his ground bravely and was willing to loan me the money provided i would pay you three dollars for the use of fifteen for one week  thats right throw in my teeth what i wanted to do in order to help you along and call me an old skinflint i am old enough to expect such things from such as you  i havent called you any names nor do i intend to do so i only wanted mother to know the truth of the business between us do you really believe i had any hand in breaking into your store  if you didnt your friends did and that amounts to the same thing as youll soon find out ill have a warrant issued for the arrest of the whole crowd if you dont tell me the truth this very minute  but i dont know anything uncle nathan  ill have the truth out of you before the day is ended the old man cried angrily and without saying or doing anything save to shake his fist in the direction of his nephew and sam he left the house  as yet none of the little party knew the full extent of what had happened but before uncle nathan was fairly out of the yard a neighbor came around to tell mrs hargreaves that the old mans store had been entered by burglars on the night previous and a large amount of money together with the most valuable goods had been carried away  it is not difficult to imagine the consternation which seized upon the little party after uncle nathans departure teddy was so overwhelmed that it was literally impossible for him to say a word and sam shook like one in an ague fit at the thought that he might be carried off to jail before it was possible for him to astonish the people by his skill as an oarsman  you must not think of leaving here until we know what your uncle proposes to do mrs hargreaves said as she returned to the diningroom after talking with the neighbor of course i know that neither of you two boys had anything to do with the robbery but you must not run away  ive got to leave no matter what the old fool says sam replied i dont know how the folks would get along if i didnt show up an it wont do to disappoint them  are you going teddy asked and sam replied in a voice which trembled despite all his efforts to make it sound firm  of course i am you dont allow im such an idiot as to stay till he can have me arrested an if youre sensible both of us will go  i must stay here an lose all my chances of making money teddy said gloomily  all right then im off an after i once get on the fair grounds ill bet that old duffer wont get hold of me  sam did not propose to lose any time he had no baggage and in a very few moments after so deciding he was walking up the road over which the stage would pass while teddy with a heavier heart than he had ever known before waited for his uncle to send the officers of the law to carry him to prison     chapter v  the fair   it seemed to teddy as if everything pleasant in life had departed from him as he waited for the return of uncle nathan accompanied by the officers of the law and neither he nor his mother had any idea that the visit would be long delayed  the widow had every proof even if her heart had not told the truth that her son was innocent of the charge which the angry old man made she knew both he and sam remained in the house during the entire day previous to the robbery and it would have been almost impossible for them to have left during the night without her knowledge but at the same time it was only reasonable she should be distressed in mind as to the final outcome of the matter  one two three hours passed and yet no arrest had been made  teddy no longer hoped to play the part of fakir at the fair but yet he fancied it might be possible to sell his stock which had already been forwarded by the stage to some more fortunate fellow and in order to do this it was necessary he should be on the grounds at the earliest possible hour but the charge made by his uncle held him a voluntary prisoner  at eight oclock a neighbor whose love of gossip was greater than her desire for housework came to the garden gate to say that she had just heard the justice of the peace refuse to issue a warrant for either of the boys and she added to this information her belief that it the burglary was a judgment upon uncle nathan for presuming to talk business on the sabbath  when this busybody had departed mrs hargreaves said as she reentered the house  there is no longer any reason teddy why you shouldnt carry out your plans every one in this village knows where to find you in case a warrant is granted which doesnt now seem possible and it is better to go ahead as you proposed knowing that your mother is certain you are innocent of any wrongdoing  teddys one desire had been to be on the fair grounds and when this advice was given from a fellows best friend he started at once saying as he left the house  ill come back if theres nothing to do but theres no reason to worry if you dont see me until saturday for i shall stay jest as long as things run smooth  ten minutes later while he was trudging along the dusty road with no other idea than that he would be forced to walk the entire distance a friend in a wagon overtook him proposed that he ride and before the fair grounds were reached he had heard all the particulars of the robbery  it appeared that the burglars must have effected an entrance to uncle nathans store after midnight saturday and when the proprietor arrived on the following morning there was absolutely no clue to the thieves  they must have had a wagon to take away all the old man says he has lost teddys informant added as the story was concluded and because of that the justice refused to issue a warrant for the man who slept at the hotel last night of course the idea that you knew anything about it was all in that old fools eye  then nobody has been arrested teddy exclaimed in surprise  of course not an more than one in town hopes hell never see hide nor hair of his goods or money but between you an me i dont believe hes lost half as much as he tries to make out  to this last assertion teddy gave but little heed the all absorbing thought in his mind was as to whether he would actually be arrested for the crime and this was sufficient to prevent any speculations as to the amount of loss or his former dreams of the future  arriving at the fair grounds he found everything in a state of confusion goods were arriving and being put in place men were quarreling for this or that vantage ground and carpenters were busy in every direction  as a matter of course he knew that all this would be changed on the following day when the visitors began to arrive but nevertheless it gave him a homesick feeling which he could not suppress and for a time prevented him from attending to his own interests  hello what are you sittin there for a voice cried after he had remained inactive near the entrance nearly an hour debating in his own mind whether or not it would be worth the while to unpack the goods which he knew were awaiting his call somewhere on the grounds  looking up quickly he saw sam selfpossessed and jaunty as at the first moment he met him in waterville but wearing an air of considerably more importance  have you gone to work yet he asked listlessly  of course not theres nothin for me to do till the folks begin to come in to see how well i can row a boat what did the old duffer do  do you mean uncle nathan  of course  he hasnt had anybody arrested yet but theres no knowin how soon hell begin  hed better not try it on me sam said with an assumption of boldness ive found a feller here thats goin to show off rifles an i can borrow as many as i want if he does any funny business  would you shoot anybody  you jest stay till an old lunatic comes along sayin ive helped to rob him when your mother knows where i was an see what ill do sam replied in a really bloodthirsty tone as he turned to walk away and then as if reconsidering the matter he stopped long enough to say wait here a minute an ill show you a feller what knows a thing or two  inasmuch as teddy had no idea of moving from the position he had taken up near the gate it was not irksome to do as the exhibitor of boats requested and without troubling his head as to who this very important person might be he remained at the precise spot until sam returned with a boy who appeared to be a year or two older than himself  this is dan summers an hes here to help show off a dandy rifle made in chicopee falls down in massachusetts or some such place hell help us out of the scrape if anybody can  dan looked as if this introduction was disagreeable to him rather than otherwise and after nodding to teddy he said in an explanatory tone  im here to help the man what exhibits goods from the stevens arms company thats all but i dont see how i could be of any help if you fellers have got in a fuss  neither do i teddy replied and then to show that no one could aid him he told the whole story including all that uncle nathan had said  i wouldnt let that worry me dan said philosophically when the tale was ended if you want to make any money out of this fair it is time you was lookin out for a stand an i know of the best place on the grounds come with me now an you can get it before the crowd of fakirs have a chance to take it up  teddy rather liking the appearance of this boy resolved to follow his advice and signified the same by slipping down from the stack of exhibits as he said  show it to me an ill get right to work for theres fortyfive dollars ive got to pay back no matter what uncle nathan makes up his mind to do  thats the way to talk sam cried approvingly and forthwith he proceeded to take charge of his two acquaintances resolved that lack of energy should not prevent him from sharing in their triumphs if indeed they had any  dan professed to have had considerable experience with fairs and the manner in which he proceeded to work showed that there had been no boasting on his part he selected a spot where nearly all of the visitors would be forced to pass in order to see the cattle or the racing and set about putting up a stand for teddy in the most approved manner  he ordered sam here and there to such places as he had seen an accumulation of lumber and so well did he work after borrowing an ax and a hatchet from a candy butcher that it was not yet noon when teddy had an inclosure sufficiently large for his purpose the cloth was in place and the holes cut for the canes so that it would be but the work of a few moments to make everything ready when business should begin  you cant do the whole thing yourself if there is anything like the crowd that ought to come dan said and i advise you to hire a clerk  wherell i find one teddy asked helplessly  take some of the fellers from your own village but be sure theyre honest for after business begins there wont be any chance to watch em  teddy thought he could find the proper party before the following day and then came the question of where they were to sleep  ive got that all fixed sam said confidently  the man what runs the museum in that big tent is a friend of mine an he wont say a word if we stay under the canvas tonight  how long have you known him teddy asked warned by previous experience that sams statements were not always to be depended upon  i never saw him till this morning but that dont make no difference so long as hes willin for us to stay there  well go over an look around dan said leading the way and to the surprise of at least one of the party it was found that master sams statement was absolutely correct  the proprietor of the museum was more than willing to allow the boys to sleep under his canvas for the very good reason that they would act as sentinels in lieu of those he had neglected to hire and all three went away in search of a place where they could obtain meals during the expected five days of excitement and moneymaking  this was even a more simple matter than the first at a boardinghouse nearly opposite the main entrance to the grounds they could be accommodated at a reasonable rate and the preliminaries had been settled it only remained now to welcome the visitors and get from them as much money as possible  teddy almost forgot the terrible fact that his uncle nathan might yet have him arrested and sam acted as if such a thing had never been possible  it is true all three of the boys discussed the possibility of finding the money which had been stolen from teddy but neither thought of connecting the two crimes as the work of one person  during the afternoon teddy looked around in the hope of seeing the man unjustly accused of the theft who had promised to aid him but as yet he had not put in an appearance and it seemed as if all the choice places would be taken before he arrived  it was anything rather than sport to wander around the almost deserted grounds and at an early hour after partaking of a remarkably poor supper the three boys sought the seclusion granted by the mildewed canvas of the alleged museum of the worlds wonders  a goat a wax baby two or three snakes an alligator and a contortionist who was none other than the proprietor of this magnificent array of marvels made up the entire list of curiosities but the tent would shelter the young fakirs from the wind and dew and it was possible they might sleep as soundly as at home     chapter vi  a clue   sam and dan who had worked at many fairs and been forced to sleep in far less desirable places thought it was a rare piece of good fortune to get such comfortable quarters free but the prospect of lying on the ground all night was far from pleasing to teddy  he looked around for some spot softer than another but there was no choice and he said to himself  theres one satisfaction about it im better off on the ground than i would have been if uncle nathan had succeeded in having me arrested and put in jail  this thought caused the interior of the tent to seem less disagreeable and he almost persuaded himself that it would be sport to stay all night in a museum with a real contortionist as host  dan had thrown himself at full length on the ground where he could watch the proprietor of this enormous exhibition cook his supper on an oilstove and sam anxious about other peoples affairs as usual devoted his entire time to asking questions regarding the business  how do you count on gettin along when the crowds get here you cant sell tickets an act too  ive got a barker an a clown coming tomorrow it was no use to pay em wages for layin around when there was nothing to be done but put up the tent  whats a barker sam asked in surprise  why the man who stands outside an does the talking of course  then his supper having been cooked and eaten the host amused himself and his guests by telling of his experience in the show business relating stories and talking of the different fakirs he had met  when i started out he said i made up my mind that a fortune could be made in one season i bought a fine tent had lots of performers about twenty animals and a dozen cases of stuffed birds and other curiosities we struck hard luck from the sendoff an first the woman with an iron jaw gave me the shake because she got tired of waiting for the salary that never came two of the bears grew so disgusted with the bad business that they died and one after another of the people skipped till i was pretty nigh alone a sheriff in harmer seized the cases another levied on my live stock and it has only taken two seasons to bring the show down to where you see it  this was not pleasing information for teddy who was obliged to make such a large amount of money in order to free himself from debt and he asked  isnt it possible to make money at every fair i thought the fakirs got rich in a little while  so did i before i went into the business a fellow may make a big stake this week and lose it all at the next stand if you strike bad weather or a crowd that hasnt got any money its uphill work to pull in the entrance fee now i have to pay a hundred dollars for this privilege because ive got a big tent and it wouldnt be any more if i had a show to compare with it in size itll take a good many tencent pieces to make that up  this plain statement of facts caused teddy to figure how many nickels he must receive before the capital invested and stolen would be returned and the result was far from gratifying  the eighteen dollars which must be given to uncle nathan the thirty i owe in waterville and ten i paid for the privilege of running the boards makes eleven hundred and sixty fivecent pieces ill never see so many customers as that and aunt sarah was right when she called me a fool for thinking of going into the business he said to himself as his companions began to make their preparations for the night  it is useless to cry over spilled milk however and this he realized in time to prevent himself from being plunged into the lowest depths of despondency it was barely possible business would be exceptionally good he argued mentally and if hard work could accomplish the desired result he must be successful  dan was already lying down with his head toward the side of the tent and his feet near the oilstove which had been left burning because of the dampness and teddy crawled over by the side of him sam had decided to sleep by the side of his host probably with the idea that he might appear to be on terms of greater intimacy and all hands gave themselves up to slumber  the excitement of the morning and subsequent labor had so tried teddy that despite the hardness of his bed he fell asleep in a very few moments and it was not yet nine oclock when all the inmates of the tent save the goat and possibly the alligator and snakes were wrapped in blissful unconsciousness  half an hour later a terrific yell from sam caused the remainder of the party to spring to their feet in alarm  whats the matter dan cried  somebody has got into the tent and been poundin me with a club im pretty near killed  the faint glow cast by the oilstove was not sufficient to illumine any portion of the tent and the host made all haste to light a lantern after which dan proceeded to search for the supposed intruder but before he had taken a dozen steps the proprietor of the museum burst into a hearty laugh  funny aint it sam cried angrily i spose youd laugh if id been killed in your old tent  this savage remark appeared to excite the mans mirth rather than check it and while he was thus enjoying himself teddy and dan stood gazing at him in surprise  it was several minutes before the man could speak and then he said as he pointed to the goat who stood a short distance away calmly munching some potato parings  thats the fellow who has been beating your friend with a club i always let him loose at night and he has walked over our dying boy  sam insisted that he had been beaten with a club but on examining his clothing two spots of fresh earth were found showing where the animal had stepped a hoofprint on the sleeve and another directly on the breast of his coat comprised the full amount of damage done  the boy who had believed himself so dangerously wounded now grew angry and leaping to his feet declared he would not remain in the tent another minute unless the goat was tied  theres nothing to prevent your bunking somewhere else the owner of the animal replied quite sharply  billy always has had the liberty of the tent at night and i reckon he wont lose it now  sam started toward the entrance but before reaching it he realized that he would be punishing no one but himself and slowly turned back saying as he approached the stove  its too late to hunt for lodgings now an i spose ill have to make the best of it  i guess you will the host replied quietly and the angry sam lay down on the seat of the baggage wagon to insure himself against another visit from billy  this incident had driven the desire for sleep from the eyelids of teddy and dan and they remained awake some time after the loud breathing of their companions told that the visit from the goat had been temporarily effaced from their minds  now teddy discovered what a hard uncomfortable bed the bare earth was and after tossing about for half an hour he whispered to dan  do you suppose it would be any better in the wagon  no youll get used to it in a little while and the ground is softer than a board  teddy was about to reply when the sound of voices from the outside attracted his attention and then came the crackle as of a match being lighted  two or more men had halted near the canvas within a few feet of where the boys were lying evidently that they might be sheltered from the wind while getting their pipes or cigars in working order  a moment later both the listeners heard one of the newcomers say  i dont think it will be safe for you to show up very much while we stay here  why not if them boys recognize me it will be an easy matter to frighten em into holdin their tongues and theres goin to be good pickins this week  but whats the use of runnin any risk weve made a fairly good haul already an its better to get safe off with that than stick our noses where itll be hard work to pull them back  teddy was in the highest possible excitement in the tone of the second speakers voice he recognized the man who had stolen his money and he punched dan with his elbow to assure himself that the latter was listening  keep quiet dan whispered and then the conversation on the outside was continued  ill take good care to keep shady an you see what can be done tomorrow  illustration the boys crept through the flap of the tent and followed the two men  will you promise not to leave the house till after dark  i thought you had more nerve but so long as you havent i reckon ill promise for this is bound to be a fat thing and i dont want to lose the whole of it  when these country jays begin to send their stuff home ill have ours shipped an theres little danger itll be overhauled more especially since the old man couldnt get a warrant for the only one he suspects its a safe bet that hazelton has a pretty good idea who did the job an if they make trouble for him hell most likely tell what he thinks  theres no call to be afraid of him after he has worked a couple of days for those he ropes in would do all they could to have him arrested  the last portion of this remark was almost indistinguishable owing to the fact that the men were walking away and when the sound of their footsteps could no longer be heard teddy said  those are the men who robbed uncle nathans store an im certain one of them got my money  would you know their voices if you heard them again  sure but why dont we find out where they are going it wouldnt be a hard job  are you willin to sneak after them  of course i am come on  the boys arose softly and crept through the flap of the tent without awakening the sleepers  the night was dark and cloudy and it was impossible to see any very great distance in either direction but dan had taken especial heed to the course taken by the men and he started off without hesitation  we ought to have a club or something to protect ourselves in case they should see us teddy whispered  we wont get near enough to let them do much mischief do you see two sparks over there they are the lighted ends of cigars an our men are behind them  dan quickened his pace but he had failed to calculate the distance correctly and was much nearer the game than he had suspected  be careful they dont see us he said in a low tone and in another instant the boys were directly in front of the men  teddy started back in alarm but he was too late in an instant the sparks flashed before his eyes and he fell to the ground unconscious just as dan succeeded in warding off the blow of a fist which was aimed at him     chapter vii  the clerk   when teddy recovered from the vicious blow which had rendered him unconscious he saw dan lying on the ground beside him but no one else was near  it was as if they had been fighting with phantoms of the brain save for the fact that both bore the most indisputable signs of having been assaulted by beings of true flesh and blood  one of dans eyes was closed as if by a violent blow and teddy bled freely from the ear the crimson fluid telling eloquently of the exact location of that superior force which had caused so many stars to dance before his mental vision  we got through with that part of it mighty quick dan said ruefully as he rose to his feet there wasnt anything slow about the way they struck out after we made fools of ourselves by running into them eh  i dont understand how it all happened it wasnt more than three seconds from the time i first saw them before there was a regular set of fireworks dancing in front of my eyes  it so happens that they saw us first dan replied as he rubbed his head those men were the thieves and what i said showed them that we were on the scent  where are they now  youll have to ask that question of someone else dan said with a grimace of pain the last thing i know was when the tall fellow landed one square on my nose and before i recovered both were out of sight we have done harm rather than good for now they know we overheard the conversation an well be mighty lucky if this is all we get before the fair comes to an end  suppose we tell the police now  what can you say to them we heard those men talking about something which may have had nothing to do with the robbery and want to have them arrested on what grounds will we ask for a warrant besides if nathan hargreaves was my uncle i would let him fight his own battles  but i owe him eighteen dollars  what of that he wouldnt take a penny off if you got your head broke while trying to find his money and after all that has happened i think we have good reason to let him severely alone  im willing to go back to the tent teddy said as he began to feel faint and dan aided him during the short walk both staggering as they came through the flap meeting their host near the entrance who asked sharply  what has been going on i counted on helping a party of boys rather than giving my tent up to a lot of roughs as you appear to be  in the fewest possible words dan explained what had happened and in addition told all the story of teddys losing his money together with the accusation made by uncle nathan  im sorry i said a word and the proprietor of the museum did really appear to be grieved it makes no difference whether you got a whipping or not the guilty parties are here and you can count on my help in turning them up  thats what im afraid we shant be able to do teddy replied we tried our best tonight and got the worst of it  there is plenty of time between now and saturday ill do all any man can an itll be strange if we dont get some proof before the fair closes  how did you know we were out dan asked  i saw you go and there was no reason why i should kick but i began to be afraid you were up to something crooked now i know the whole story ill do my best to help you out of the scrape go to sleep and well talk the whole matter over in the morning  this was good advice but not easily followed both the boys began to feel the effects of the blows received from the thieves and the pain resulting therefrom was not conducive to repose  they did manage to close their eyes in slumber now and then however and when the day broke mr sweet the proprietor of the museum was standing ready to minister to their necessities  you havent got exactly the right kind of faces to bring very big business he said cheerily but i reckon we can make a change in the general appearance use this plentifully as a bath and before business opens youll be respectable members of society  it was certainly necessary for them to do something toward improving their appearance teddys ear was swollen to nearly twice its natural size and dan had an eye which was rapidly blackening  thanks to the application provided by the owner of the museum these evidences of a fight were rapidly reduced and when sam awoke they looked little the worse for wear although he readily discovered that something serious had happened while he was wrapped in slumber  what has been goin on he asked suspiciously  nothing much dan replied with a forced laugh the goat walked over us and were kinder used up thats all are you ready to go to breakfast  it was evident that sam did not believe this explanation but since he said nothing more about it the two actors in the previous nights adventures held their peace therefore it would not be in his power to betray any secrets  breakfast was eaten at an early hour and the young fakirs returned to the grounds in time for teddy to meet the first visitors  under dans instructions he continued to cry out  heres where you can get a cane or a knife for nothing three rings for five cents and every time you throw it over the mark you get what you ring three for five and every cane or knife you ring is yours  it was yet too early for the exhibits to be opened therefore teddy had the assistance of his friends in reclaiming the rings thrown and after nearly four dollars had been taken in with a loss only of a ten cent cane the amateur fakir began to understand that it would be necessary for him to have a clerk  youre bound to do a good business this week dan said at about eight oclock sam and i must go now to attend to our own work an if you see some fellow who can be trusted i advise you to hire him or therell be considerable trade lost for when these people want to spend their money they wont wait for you to hunt up assistants  yes i reckon theres moren a thousand who are jest aching to see how i can row in one of them dandy boats master sam added but if you get into any kind of a scrape an dont know how to get out come to me ill see you through no matter how good business is  these two friends and advisers had hardly left him when a particular chum from the run came up and knowing he could be trusted teddy immediately made a trade for his services  tim jones accepted the offer of ten cents on each dollar which might be taken in and straightway engaged himself as teddys clerk promising faithfully to account for every penny he should receive  i know you are honest the proprietor of the board said to his friend and i want you to help me on the square so im willing to give a fair price for i may have to be away a good deal of the time  you mean that nathan hargreaves is goin to have you arrested  why do you say that  because hes tellin around town at the run that you know who robbed his store an says hell have a warrant out if he has to go to waterville for it  that is where hes making a great big mistake tim but if he should do anything of the kind i expect you to do your best here and teddy spoke very solemnly for he really believed his uncle would succeed in having him arrested i dont know positively who broke into his store but dan an i heard enough last night to make us believe we can find the thieves if we have time to work it out  id let him hustle to get the stuff if it was my pudding tim replied with emphasis and then as a party of young fellows bent on spending money approached the board he began to cry as lustily as might have been expected from any old fakir  heres where you get em three rings for a nickel and every cane or knife you ring is yours all for the small sum of five cents  convinced that he had a capable clerk who was willing to work hard in order to earn an additional percentage teddy contented himself with making change for the rush of customers which continued unabated until nearly ten oclock and then came a lull when he was able to watch the other fakirs around him  up to this point business had continued in the most promising manner and if it held out as well there would be no difficulty in his paying all the money he owed even although there might be no very large profit  i only want to get out square he said to himself while nursing his injured ear but this experience led him to believe it was possible to do very much toward helping his mother and already had he begun to dream of large returns despite the fifteen dollars out of which he had been swindled  it was just when his customers had gone to other parts of the ground and after teddy had figured up the amount of money taken in showing that there was nearly eight dollars in the treasury with an offset only of one twentycent knife and two tencent canes lost that the young fakir saw hazelton standing some distance away beckoning to him  look out sharp for things tim he cried as he vaulted over the railing and ran to the side of the man whom he believed to be a friend  did anything happen last night the latter asked  teddy told him the whole story keeping back not one incident  i heard quite so much in the hotel where i board it is long jim and his partner who have done the job of which both you and i are accused as for your uncle he isnt worth a minutes thought but im going to get to work an what he says may go against me so you and i must turn those fellows up if we can  aint your business honest teddy asked in surprise  well when we come right down to dots i dont suppose it is watch me when i leave here and youll have a chance to judge for yourself i may want to leave my satchel with you for a while and i reckon youre willing to take care of it  of course i am ill do anything you ask  better wait and see the game first but dont forget that weve got to turn up the two men who whipped you and your friend last night or stand the chance of being hauled up for the robbery ourselves  did you say anything to uncle nathan to make him think you would break into his store  no i only played him for a jay as you shall see me do with two or three hundred of these smart fellows here and he jumped down on me because there was no one else on whom to fasten the crime ive got to go now dont forget to hurry back to your caneboard when you see im getting through with my first stand for i want to leave my stuff with somebody whom i can trust     chapter viii  the jewelry fakir   teddys curiosity regarding the kind of business which hazelton proposed to do was so great that for the time being he forgot his own venture in watching this supposed friend  the jewelry fakir disappeared amid the crowd for a few moments reappearing in a carriage drawn by a fancifully decorated horse and the gaudy trappings caused the sightseers to stop believing something interesting or curious was to be seen  hazelton introduced himself as an agent for a large manufacturing company and proposed to dispose of samples of their goods in a manner which would be satisfactory to all he began by throwing away great numbers of cheap rings made to imitate gold and as the boys scrambled for them he complained that the older members of the throngthose people whom he particularly wished should test the merits of his wareswere getting nothing  i can change that he said after hesitating a moment as if to devise some plan then holding up half a dozen pairs of cuffbuttons he continued i am allowed to give away only six of these what gentleman will advance twentyfive cents for one of these sets knowing the money will be returned to him by that means i shall place the goods where they will do the most good  in a short time the necessary number of purchasers was found each having paid a quarter of a dollar and then with great ostentation the fakir returned to every one the money he had given  a similar performance was gone through with in the case of ten seal rings and by that time the crowd were in a state of high excitement for they were getting supposedly valuable goods by simply loaning this agent their money for a short time  the fakir then held up a lot of watchchains asking who would give him a dollar for one but in this instance he made no mention of returning the money  believing these also were to be given away every man scrambled to pass up his dollar before the supply should be exhausted and fully two hundred dollars was taken in by the generous agent then as the demand ceased hazelton produced from his valise what appeared to be a heavy gold watch  wrapping it in paper and attaching it to a chain he cried  who wants to take another and receive as a present what i have fastened to the end of it but on the condition that this paper shall not be removed until i give permission  a young fellow standing near teddy made all possible haste to pass the fakir a dollar and receive the prize  then the remainder of the crowd clamored for more to be put up in the same manner and hazelton disposed of at least a hundred before the clamorous throng could be appeased  while this was being done teddy saw the young fellow slyly remove the paper and examine his goods a look of anger and disappointment overspread his face as a cheap empty locket fashioned on the outside something like the case of a watch was revealed to view twenty cents would have been an extravagantly high price for what he had paid a dollar but it was possible the agent would return the money as he had done in the previous cases and the victimized fellow held his peace  hazelton was now ready to take a hurried departure no more dollars were passed up and quickly seizing the reins he said  i have not represented these goods to be gold but they are a fine imitation and mr nathan hargreaves of peach bottom run will probably act as my agent for the sale of them you can get what may be wanted from him if you need any more  the last words were hardly spoken before he drove quickly through the throng leaving his dupes in a daze from which they did not recover until he was lost to view  now teddy understood what the giveaway game was and he also knew that it was far from being honest although hazelton had really made no promises which he did not fulfill  some of the victims were angry and vowed to flog that feller within an inch of his life before sunset others bore their loss philosophically and turned away with the remark that the fakir was a cute one while the majority hastened off lest they should be suspected of being victims  teddy returned to his caneboard feeling sad because he had been so mistaken in this particular man and had hardly reached there when hazelton on foot came from the side of the fair grounds opposite where he had disappeared saying hurriedly as he handed the boy a black satchel somewhat resembling a sample case  look out for this all my money is in it  without waiting for an answer the man was gone and the young fakir was in no slight distress at being the custodian of so much wealth  after considerable discussion with tim he decided to leave it behind the caneboard where it would be screened from view and then a crowd of customers suddenly appearing he was so busy during the next half hour that he hardly had time to think of that which had been intrusted to his keeping  not until trade grew dull once more did hazelton appear looking decidedly well pleased with himself and standing where the passersby could not hear he asked  well what do you think of the giveaway game now  it looks to me like a swindle teddy replied bluntly the things you sold were not worth half what you got for them  six cents apiece for the chains and five for the lockets is what i pay by the quantity the fakir said with a laugh  but you made the people think they were getting real watches  i was mighty careful to say nothing of the kind they thought they saw a watch and i told them i would make each purchaser a present of what was on the chain their idea was to get the best of me and in that i didnt lose very much its a case of setting a thief to catch a thief and the smartest man comes out ahead  but why did you leave all the money with me  because it sometimes happens that my customers make a kick and try to get back their stuff by force so i dont carry much cash in my pockets while i am on the fair grounds  of course you are all through now you cant expect to do the same thing over again  thats exactly what i shall do in about an hour only in a different portion of the inclosure and youll see that i can catch just as many suckers as before  then in order to be rid of the satchel for it seemed as if he was really concerned in the swindle so long as it remained in his keeping teddy said he wanted to see what dan and sam were doing  go ahead ill stay near by where i can keep an eye on the stuff so you neednt let that worry you  as a matter of fact the boy was not eager to leave his place of business but having said so it was necessary to go or let hazelton understand exactly why the remark had been made  cautioning tim to keep his eyes open for trade he walked across the grounds to the building where dan was employed and found that young gentleman displaying the good qualities of a peculiarlooking weapon  this is the model pocket rifle dan was saying to a party of gentlemen the shoulderrest is detachable and you can buy an effective weapon for a trifle over fifteen dollars as hello teddy hows business he added suddenly on observing his friend and the two had an opportunity for conversation while the curious ones were examining the rifle  teddy gave a brief account of what had already been done and then asked  cant you get off a few minutes and go with me to see what sam is doing  it was not difficult for dan to get a short leave of absence and the two went directly to the creek where their acquaintance who proposed to make himself the central figure of the fair was rowing around in a jaunty looking craft  sam wore a sailors shirt turned away at the throat and tied with a black silk handkerchief while on the breast of the garment was worked the name davis boat and oar co detroit mich the same legend being printed in gold on the band of his straw hat  sam had evidently been expecting his friends for he espied them before they reached the shore and rowing to the bank insisted they should take a sail  come on its all right he said it dont make any difference whether i carry passengers or not so long as the boat is kept goin an i want to show you somethin fine in the way of rowin  neither of the boys cared very much about accepting the invitation but he was so persistent that they finally stepped on board as the easiest manner of settling the matter  i tell you what it is fellers he said as he pulled out into the stream im jest makin things hum around here these folks have never seen any kind of style put into rowin an im knockin their eyes out  dont give it to them too strong or they may want to keep you here as an ornament after the fair closes and then the rest of the world would suffer dan said with a laugh and sam replied  you fellers can make fun but what i say is straight and then he made preparations for giving an exhibition watch me now an youll learn a thing or two about boats  during the next ten minutes he pulled as if in a race first up and then down the stream until sheer lack of breath forced him to stop  i hope you havent set the keel on fire dan said solicitously theres no question but that you made good time though im inclined to think the build of the boat had considerable to do with the speed this one looks as if she would row herself  thats all you know about it if i hadnt been a firstclass hand at  see there teddy cried excitedly as he pointed toward the shore thats the man who got my fifteen dollars pull in sam an pull for all you are worth  the oarsman delayed only long enough to gaze in the direction indicated where he saw the old fakir whom they had met with such great loss at waterville and then he bent himself to the task  do you believe it will be safe to tackle him after last night dan asked  im going to and if he dont get away from me ill ask some of the crowd to help me have him arrested teddy replied grimly  the little craft was a considerable distance from the shore sam was so excited that he only thought of landing in the shortest possible space of time and instead of keeping a lookout for other boats rowed vigorously as if he were the only oarsman on the stream  teddy and dan sat motionless with their eyes fixed on the man and thus it happened that no one on board saw a double ender in which were three ladies and two gentlemen come around a bend in the creek directly in sams course  there was a shout from the bank three shrill screams of terror and then a crash as the two craft came together with terrific force  the occupants of both boats were thrown into the water as the frail timbers were splintered and the spectators on the bank acted as if panicstricken     chapter ix  a brave rescue   sam was a fairly good swimmer and as soon as he found himself in the water he struck out for the shore paying no attention to any one else until he had assured his own safety  one of the gentlemen in the other craft did the same selfish thing while the other unable to help even himself was trying to keep his head above water by resting his chin on an oar and piece of planking  the women were in imminent danger of being drowned for there was no other boat near at hand which could be sent to the rescue and the throng of spectators was in that unreasoning state of fear and excitement which prevents people from being of any service at such a time  when teddy and dan came to the surface after having been thrown from their seats they were within a few feet of each other and the latter asked  can you swim  yes dont pay any attention to me but do what you can toward saving those women  will you help me  of course but i cant take care of more than one  both boats had disappeared and nothing save a few fragments showed where they had gone down  teddy thought only of aiding the struggling women for there was no question that the man with the oar could take care of himself at least until those on the bank should be sufficiently composed to do something effective and he swam to the nearest struggling being clasping her firmly under one arm as he said  dont make a row but keep perfectly quiet an ill take you ashore  halfunconscious as she was the woman attempted to grasp him by the neck and for several seconds he had all he could do to prevent her from choking him to death but after two or three kicks judiciously administered he succeeded in making her understand that her life as well as his own depended upon her remaining passive and from that moment all went well  the employees of the company which had the boats on exhibition flung into the water several lifesaving arrangements of cork and canvas and by dint of much persuading he induced her to trust to one of these while he went to the assistance of dan who had been carried beneath the surface more than once by the struggles of the woman whom he was trying to save  by this time a boat was brought up from around the point and as these two helpless ones were taken on board both the boys swam to the rescue of the last of the party who had sunk beneath the surface for the third time  teddy now nearly exhausted by his efforts was the first to grasp her but if it had not been for dan the struggle would have been useless since his strength was so far spent that he could not have brought her above the water unaided  by their united efforts however she was taken on board the boat in a state of unconsciousness and they made their way to the shore cheered by the shouts of the assembled multitude  weak almost exhausted beyond the power to stand upright they landed a few seconds in advance of the craft and the reception received was enough to have nerved stronger men to a semblance of strength  it was not until they were in the private apartments allotted to the davis company that either fully understood how weak he was and then willing hands aided them to recuperate  hot flannels warm drinks and dry clothes were contributed by the different exhibitors until as teddy said they looked like circus clowns but they were in fairly good bodily condition and it appeared as if the involuntary bath had done them no real injury  outside the building the people were shouting themselves hoarse in praise of the two boys who had saved three lives and sam stood bowing acknowledgments as if he had been the chief actor in the thrilling scene  the difference between the real and the pretended lifesavers was readily understood however when dan and teddy made their appearance looking decidedly the worse for their struggles and the cheers which went up would have been ample reward for the most praiseloving person in the world  they looked like anything rather than reputable employees as they appeared in the borrowed garments but as teddy said they couldnt stay in the building until their clothes were dried and it was absolutely necessary he should attend to his business  dans duties necessitated his remaining near the creek but teddy was forced to go back to his caneboard and the crowd which followed him was good evidence of the money he would make  during two hours after he returned from this thrilling adventure the caneboard had more customers than could conveniently be attended to and it is safe to say that he then handled a larger amount than he had ever before seen  at this rate it wont take long to square up things and you shall have a fair portion of the profits tim he said when there was an opportunity for him to speak with his clerk without being overheard by the customers  its a lucky thing for us that them boats were smashed tim said devoutly as he handed his employer half a dollar to change we might have stood here with our tongues hangin out all day an never seen a quarter of this money if you hadnt known how to swim  you are right to a certain extent but i cant take all the credit of this spurt because more than half the people are trying to get a cane for nothing  in the same way they thought to swindle mr hazelton out of a watch tim replied with a smile but we wont fight about what brings trade so long as it comes with the cash  up to this time teddy had no very definite idea of how much money had been taken in and he was thinking it would be a good idea to ascertain when a gruff familiar voice from the rear asked  are the wages of sin as much as they should be  turning quickly he saw uncle nathan and replied  i dont know exactly what they should be but perhaps you do  whatever i may know now i remember that it was not allowed i should insult my elders either by plainly spoken words or insinuations the old man said sternly  neither would i have done such a thing if you had not given me the provocation but when i promised to pay three dollars for the use of fifteen one week you did not seem to think that amount would be the wages of sin  at the time i had no idea you would conspire with others to rob me of my hardearned savings  you know very well uncle nathan that i havent done any such thing on the night your store was robbed i staid in the house and hadnt left it when you came to tell us the news  every person of your class has some such excuse ready in case of an emergency but that kind of talk will not do with me if you meant to do the square thing why was i not told you lost the money i lent you  because i knew you would raise an awful row thinking possibly it would not be paid back  have i yet any assurance that it will be the old man asked in a fury  do you need it now  i always need my own  and in this case if i pay you at once do you think it right to charge me three dollars for the use of fifteen lent two days ago  that was what you promised and the world gauges a man by the way he keeps his word  i owe the storekeeper in waterville thirty dollars but i told him you must be paid first and so you shall  then give me the money now uncle nathan snarled  that is exactly what i am willing to do teddy replied calmly but if you cant trust me i have reason to be suspicious of you so give me a receipt for the amount and the matter can be settled  the old man literally glared at his nephew for an instant and then eager to have the cash in his possession he wrote a receipt handing it to the young fakir as he said angrily  now let me see if you can settle the bill  since the mishap on the creek where teddy had covered himself with glory business had been so good that he had more than twice that amount and emptying the contents of his money bag on a board he proceeded to select the required sum  uncle nathan watched him jealously his eyes twinkling enviously and when the money was placed in his hand he counted it twice over before delivering up the written acknowledgment  are you certain all this has been honestly earned teddy he asked gravely  how else could i have got it  there are many ways while i would not be willing to take my oath to it several of these tencent pieces look very much like those i lost night before last  do you mean to say i had anything to do with robbing your store and now that this particular debt had been canceled teddy felt very brave  i know that such an amount of money has not been earned honestly and what is more my eyes have been opened to the character of your friends  if you mean mr hazelton he is as much your friend as mine for you were with him all day sunday  that is exactly who i do mean uncle nathan replied with provoking deliberation i have seen his method of doing business since i came into this fair and know he is nothing more than a deliberate swindler  but one with whom you were perfectly willing to go into partnership a voice in the rear of teddy cried sharply and the jewelry fakir stepped directly in front of uncle nathan i told you exactly how i worked and you offered to put up even money with me growing angry when i said you would be of no use in the business if it is swindling you were mighty eager to have a hand in the same business  i dont want to talk with you uncle nathan said as he put teddys eighteen dollars carefully in his pocket  then why do you come around here trying to bully this boy he had no idea of what i was going to do until he saw me work while you understood the whole plan make any trouble for him and i will get up here and tell every person who comes along that you wanted to be my partner  do it the old man said angrily after having cheated so many people out of their money who will believe a word you say  at the same time however uncle nathan took good care to leave this particular spot and hazelton stepped to the rear of the board where he could talk privately with teddy     chapter x  an encounter   first of all the jewelry fakir wanted to hear the particulars of the accident on the lake and teddy began by telling him the primary cause of the trouble  i reckon all three of us lost our heads when we saw that man i know i did and we were so eager to get on shore that we paid no attention to anything else have you seen him  who long jim no but the boys say he is here somewhere running the swinging ball game  what is that  a wooden ball is swung on two short uprights about eight inches apart and between them in the center stands a small peg you pay ten cents for the privilege of swinging the ball and if it hits the peg when it comes back after leaving your hand you get a dollar  i should think that would be easy enough to do  well dont try it with such an idea or youll go broke mighty quick it looks simple but it isnt accomplished very often  have you done anything since i left here  yes and scooped in as much as i had any right to expect i dont want to spoil tomorrows business so shant make another pitch but will spend my time trying to find jim  what good can that do  i still count on making him give back your fifteen dollars if nothing more i reckon your uncle nathan wont try again to get a warrant out for us and so i shant bother my head about learning anything regarding the robbery  hell make things just as disagreeable as he can theres no question about that  well let him and well see who comes out ahead trade is beginning to pick up and youd better attend to your customers  hazelton walked away and from that moment until nearly nightfall teddy had all the business both he and his clerk could attend to  nearly every one had something to say about the accident on the creek and the young fakir was forced to tell the story over and over again until he really got tired of repeating the details  when nearly all of the visitors had left the grounds teddy made up his cash account and the sum total surprised both himself and tim  including the amount paid uncle nathan he had taken in fiftyfive dollars and twenty cents ten per cent of this was paid to the clerk and he found himself possessed of the magnificent sum of thirtyone dollars and seventy cents  at this rate we shall be rich before the end of the week he said in a tone of satisfaction  thats a fact but it dont seem right for me to take so much tim replied as he wrapped the five dollars and a half which had been given him in his handkerchief  that was the agreement an well stick to it  but when you promised ten cents on every dollar neither of us believed trade would be half so good  youre right i thought if we got onethird as much business would be booming but that has nothing to do with our bargain youve hung right on here without even stopping for anything to eat an are entitled to what youve been paid everybody says therell be a bigger crowd tomorrow an so we stand a chance to make considerable more are you going home tonight or do you count on staying here  ive got to let the folks know where i am for when i left it was allowed id be back by sunset tomorrow ill come prepared to stay the rest of the week  therell be plenty of stages running an you can afford to ride both ways after this days work i want to send some of this money home to mother for it aint safe to carry so much around with me  am i to take it  yes an you can tell her all that has happened ask her to come over thursday an see for herself that were getting rich  twentyfive dollars was tied in a bundle with many wrappings of paper and tim started off looking almost afraid at being the custodian of so much wealth  it was necessary teddy should pack up his entire stock until next morning and this he proceeded to do as soon as he was alone mr sweet had given him permission to bring his goods into the museum tent and his only trouble was how everything could be carried without assistance before he was ready for departure however sam came up and the question of transportation was settled  well how do you feel now teddy asked cheerily for the knowledge that he had already taken in nearly enough to pay his debts caused him to feel very jolly  i allers get the worst of everything sam replied disconsolately you an dan made a big strike when you tumbled into the water an ive had a blowin up come mighty near losin my job into the bargain  why  cause the boss says that i was careless an reckless an that i couldnt earn enough in a month to pay for the two boats ive smashed  are they lost entirely  no of course not we pulled em out a little while ago an it cost so very much to fix both the folks in the other boat were as much to blame as me  they certainly were not keeping any better lookout and as a matter of fact i suppose im more at fault than any one else for if i hadnt sung out about the fakir it wouldnt have happened  thats what i told the boss but hes chuck full of foolish talk about the bravery he says you an dan showed an is tryin to get up what he calls a testimonial for you  a what teddy cried in surprise  i heard him say testimonial but if you know what that means you can go to the head  i dont and i hope it wont amount to anything ive been paid enough for what was done by the boom it gave my business  of course you an dan are bound to have the best end of it  why didnt you stop an do the same thing  cause i had sense enough to look out for myself first  but you know how to swim  what of that its mighty risky catchin hold of people in the water an i dont mean to take any chances how much have you made today  when teddy told him the expert in rowing looked decidedly envious  youve got all that money in one day  yes but i sent the most of it home to mother  its funny what luck some folks have when them as knows the business twice as well dont much moren earn their salt sam said as if to himself and before he could continue dan arrived  he wore his own clothes and carried those teddy had left in the boathouse  these were dry so i brought em up you neednt carry back the ones you borrowed till tomorrow so sams boss says  then dan asked concerning business and by the time all three had finished discussing this very important matter the knives and canes were packed ready for removal  each boy took a load carried it to the tent where mr sweet was figuring up his receipts for the day and then went to supper returning half an hour later so tired that there was no desire on the part of either to do anything other than sleep  the proprietor of the museum was in very good spirits he had taken in one hundred and six dollars and eighty cents and said in a tone of satisfaction  i reckon this fair will pan out all right trade is bound to be better tomorrow and thursday is always the biggest of the week i hear you boys have been distinguishing yourselves tell me about it  dan related the incident of the day very modestly interrupted now and then by sam who was eager to pose as a hero also and mr sweet expressed himself as being well satisfied with their behavior  chasing a thief and getting a whipping in the night and then saving the lives of three people the next day is record enough for one week so youd better not try for any more adventures he said with a laugh  now that the incident of the previous night had been spoken of so openly it was necessary sams curiosity should be satisfied and dan was forced to tell the story  while he was doing so and listening to the oarsmans comments teddy had an opportunity to see the barker and clown who arrived that morning neither was a very prepossessinglooking man they were lying on the ground some distance from the boys as if bent on minding their own business and there was no real reason for an unfavorable opinion concerning them  but little time was spent in conversation on this evening every one was thoroughly tired and each sought for a soft spot on which to pass the night  as before sam crawled up on the wagon to be out of harms way when the goat should be unfastened while dan and teddy lay down in very nearly the same place as before  i dont fancy we shall hear many secrets between now and morning no matter how many men come around here to talk the former said laughingly it wont take me two minutes to fall asleep and the noise that can awaken me then will have to be very great  teddys only reply was a yawn and in even less time than dan had mentioned he was wrapped in slumber  shortly after the proprietor of the exhibition began to make his preparations for retiring and the clown asked  how did that row start this afternoon  half a dozen of the village toughs tried to get in without paying and i had to polish one of em off the barker replied  you must have done it pretty quick for when i got out there the thing was over mr sweet said  the fellow was more than halfdrunk an it wasnt a very big job they threaten to come back and clean the whole show out  yes ive heard such threats made before but never lost much sleep worrying about it  ten minutes later all the human occupants of the tent were enjoying a wellearned rest and the goat had about concluded it would be a profitless job to prospect for anything more to eat when the sound of footsteps could have been heard from the outside  had mr sweet been awake he would have decided that these late visitors were trying to find the flap of the tent for they walked cautiously around the canvas twice and then a sharp knife was thrust through the fabric  an instant later sam awoke his companion with a yell that would have done credit to any indian  some one had given him such a blow as sent him from the seat to the ground and the remainder of the party leaped to their feet only to be confronted by a large party of halfdrunken toughs who had come to avenge the insult received during the afternoon     chapter xi  long jim   teddys first thought when he was awakened by sams yells was that the officers of the law were coming to arrest him for the robbery committed at uncle nathans store but in a very few seconds he understood that this was not the case  he and dan had been sleeping some distance from the remainder of the company therefore when the handtohand struggle began they were out of it entirely and owing to the darkness could not be seen by the assailants but sams cries served to show the mob where he was and one after another pounded him when they failed to find any of the other occupants  while one might have counted twenty teddy and dan stood motionless undecided as to what should be done while the din caused by the combatants and the screaming boy were almost deafening and then the latter said  weve got to take a hand in this row teddy mr sweet has given us the chance to sleep here and the least we can do is to help as much as possible for it appears to me that his men are getting the worst of it  a broken tentpeg was lying on the ground near at hand and dan added as he seized it  try to light one of the lanterns so we can see which is an enemy and then sail in  it seemed to teddy as if he would never be able to follow these instructions he had plenty of matches but in his excitement one after another was extinguished until he fancied half an hour must have elapsed before the wick was ignited  the faint glow of light served to show one of the intruders teddys form and the latter had but just succeeded in hanging the lantern on the centerpole when it became necessary to defend himself  the drunken bully made a lunge at him which he managed to avoid by jumping aside and in another instant he had seized the man by the waist doing his best to throw him  from this moment teddy knew nothing more of the row than that portion in which he was immediately concerned he was able to prevent the man from striking by hugging close to his body and the two swayed here and there in the effort to gain the mastery now and then they came in contact with the other combatants one or both receiving a chance blow but no especial injury was done to either  had the man been sober teddy must have been overcome in a very short time but as he was far from being steady on his feet the odds were about even and the boy succeeded in holding his own until the others had retreated or been so disabled that it was no longer possible for them to continue the assault  fully thirty minutes had elapsed from the time sam first sounded the alarm before the occupants of the tent could count themselves as victors and then mr sweet and the clown pulled teddys adversary away throwing him bodily out of the tent after administering summary punishment  during all this time the other exhibitors who intended to sleep on the grounds had been gathering around the canvas but no one cared to risk his precious body by entering until it was certain the battle had been ended  then the tent was filled with sympathizing friends who endeavored to ascertain the amount of injury done but were interrupted in the work by the proprietor who cried angrily  clear out of here every mothers son you didnt dare to come in when it would have been possible to help us and theres no need of you now we were attacked by a crowd of men from the town who proposed to clean the show out because we wouldnt let them in free and thats all there is to it  not until the last visitor had unwillingly departed did the little party pay any attention to their wounds and then the result of the engagement was ascertained  the barker had a broken nose but it would not prevent him from doing a full share of talking on the following day the clowns eye looked rather bad and mr sweets cheek had been cut but these were only trifling mishaps teddy had come out of the affray comparatively uninjured dan showed nothing worse than a bruise under the left ear and while sam appeared to be unscathed he declared that he had been pounded until every inch of his body felt like jelly  you squealed fairly well for a fellow who was so badly done up mr sweet said with a laugh as he proceeded to dress the barkers wounded nose and i reckon youll be all right by morning light some of the other lanterns so i can see what im about and during the remainder of the night well stand guard for no one can say how soon those scoundrels may attempt to pay us a second visit although i think they had a full dose this time  how the assailants had fared no one was able to form a very good opinion the general belief among the occupants of the tent however was that they had received such severe punishment that there would be no further attack on this night at least  when the wounds had been dressed mr sweet said as he took up a position near the flap  you fellows had better try to go to sleep now ill keep awake for a while and then call some one to relieve me dan cant you borrow one of those queerlooking rifles you are exhibiting and bring it with you tomorrow night  i might get the one i use for shooting at a target but you wouldnt think of trying to kill a man would you mr sweet  i could do a good deal toward scaring them and if a crowd insisted on forcing an entrance id take mighty good care that one would carry away a bullet to remember me by  ill bring the rifle dan replied and teddy whispered  when i came here to run a caneboard i didnt count on being obliged to do any fighting  i dont reckon therell be much more here the managers of the fair will see to it that those fellows are put where they cant do any additional mischief for the exhibitors must be protected and we shall be safe enough except something else comes up to make a row  then the sore tired party lay down in search of slumber once more and strange as it may seem after the exciting events all save the sentinel were soon wrapped again in slumber  each in turn was aroused to do his share of guard duty before morning came but no enemy appeared and at sunrise the three boys went across the grounds to the boardinghouse where as dan said the price was twice as big as the breakfast  teddy had his place of business ready for the reception of customers before the first stageload of visitors arrived and when tim came he had already taken in nearly a dollar  whats the news he asked as the clerk appeared looking radiant and happy at the thought of earning as much money as on the previous day  your mother was pretty nigh wild when i told her what we took in yesterday an says shell be here sure on thursday theres no more news of your uncle nathans goods an hes still tryin to have you arrested but your mother says not to be afraid cause she has talked with a lawyer an dont think therell be any trouble i told the folks at home that the old skinflint made you pay three dollars interest on the money what was stole an everybody in town will know it before night  tim was forced to stop his story to wait upon a party of young gentlemen who were eager to get dollar canes for five cents and the booths adjoining teddys place of business had not yet been opened when he announced that there were four dollars in the money box  were bound to have a big day tim said confidently the band from the run is comin over this mornin an if the city people hear about it you bet theyll jest crowd in to hear the music therell be  of the boys to see you but take my advice an dont let em have any rings on credit for i wouldnt trust the best of the whole lot at fair time im goin to stay till friday do you spose that man will let me sleep in his tent with you fellers  teddy promised to inquire and then advised tim to have a look at the grounds before business began to be rushing and the clerk was glad to take advantage of the proposition  he started off with the air of one who owned the entire inclosure and was hardly lost to view amid the fastgathering throng when teddy was literally dazed by seeing long jim the very man who had robbed him in waterville lounging along toward his stand  not until the fakir stood directly in front of the boy did he appear to recognize him and then he would have turned quickly away but for the latters cry  somebody hold that man till i get a constable he stole my money  realizing that a flight across the grounds with hundreds of men and boys crying stop thief in full pursuit would be disastrous long jim turned to face his young accuser  what do you mean by saying such a thing he asked angrily if you wasnt so small id make you eat the words  i was big enough for you to steal from and i want my money  it was only natural that a crowd should gather after such an accusation and long jim looked around for some means of escape but realizing that he could not well get away while so many were near he stepped close to teddy as he whispered  if you say another word ill smash your face you young whelp hold your tongue if you want to leave here alive  ill say exactly whats true give me my money or ill find some one to have you arrested  the boy is a liar and what is more has just robbed his uncles store if what they say over at the run be true the fakir said excitedly as he turned to face the crowd i dont want to hurt him but i wont be insulted by a thief so the best thing for me to do is to leave  saying this he walked deliberately away and the curious ones who a moment previous had been friendly to teddy began to sympathize with the man  dont let him off the boy cried starting to follow and then remembering that he would be forced to leave his wares at the mercy of the crowd turned back while long jim continued straight across the grounds unmolested  it looks like it was a case of the pot calling the kettle black an old farmer said and his immediate circle of friends laughed heartily while the younger portion of the crowd gazed earnestly at teddy believing they saw before them a fullfledged burglar     chapter xii  a discovery   with feelings of mingled anger vexation and disappointment teddy stood silent and motionless for several moments after long jim disappeared striving to keep the tears from his eyes  it seemed hard enough to be swindled out of fifteen dollars but to be held up as a thief by the very man who had done him the wrong and to be stared at as a criminal by the curious was an aggravation of misfortune  just for one instant he made up his mind to tell the whole story to the bystanders but before there was time for him to speak he realized that many of them would think he was trying to shield himself by an untruth against just accusations therefore he remained quiet not making the slightest effort to influence trade  fortunately he was soon aroused from this very disagreeable frame of mind by a very pleasing incident  the band from the run arrived and to the young fakirs surprise marched directly to his booth the leader saying in a tone sufficiently loud to be heard by every one in the immediate vicinity as the musicians halted about ten feet away  we have been hired to play on the grounds today teddy and left home half an hour earlier than the specified time for the sole purpose of giving you a serenade to show that whatever your uncle may say the folks at the run are positive there isnt a shadow of truth in his ridiculous story we know what you are working for and intend to help you along as much as possible  then the musicians began to play while as a matter of course every one who came up wanted to know why the band was there instead of on the stand built for its especial accommodation and there were people enough who had heard the leaders remarks to explain matters to the newcomers  the immediate result was that instead of believing him to be a burglar the same ones who fancied a few moments previous that he looked guilty were now quite positive he was a victim  tim arrived while the serenade was in progress and when teddy explained the situation he exclaimed gleefully  well by jinks this jest knocks the spots outer everything trade will hum after this or im a duffer  and the clerks prediction was verified in a very short time  when the musicians had concluded the concert they laid aside their instruments and during the next ten minutes every man of them threw rings at the canes or knives so rapidly that both teddy and his assistant had all they could do to wait upon the throng  then giving the signal for the march to be resumed the leader said to the young fakir  dont get discouraged my boy no matter what happens if you have any trouble it cant last long for youve plenty of friends at the run and after what happened here yesterday there should be a good many on the grounds  the kindhearted musicians marched away without giving teddy an opportunity to thank them and as if to atone for their previously spoken harsh words the bystanders devoted themselves with unusual zest to the task of winning a cane worth a dollar by an outlay of five cents  it was nearly an hour before trade began to grow dull again and both the boys were quite willing to rest a few moments  at this rate we stand a chance of getting rich before the fair closes teddy exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction i wonder what uncle nathan would have said if hed been here to hear the leader  ill tell you a disagreeable but familiar sounding voice replied from the rear of the stand where its owner had been concealed by an adjoining booth and nathan hargreaves stalked into view with a comically tragic air things have come to a pretty pass when a mans own relations an them as he has set up in business with his own hardearned money try to bring scorn and reproach upon him you are a snake in the grass teddy hargreaves an not content with helpin rob me concoct such a disgraceful scene as i have jest witnessed  what could i have had to do with it teddy cried in surprise i didnt know they were going to give me a lift  of course you did i aint blind if i am such a fool as to put you in the way of makin so much money there wasnt a man in that band whod have countenanced the speech the leader made if you hadnt been workin on their sympathies but your race wont be much longer dont think that ive stopped all proceedings for it may be that youre shoved into jail this very day unless you make a clean breast of the whole thing  ive got nothing to tell simply because i dont know anything but i believe the same man who took my fifteen dollars robbed your store dan and i heard him and another fellow talking and in trying to find out something for your benefit got knocked down  what did they say who are they the old man asked eagerly his bearing toward teddy changing very suddenly tell me tell your poor old uncle wholl be mighty near the poorhouse if he dont get his own again  this appeal touched teddys heart immediately but tim said half to himself taking good care uncle nathan should hear him however  moren a hundred robberies like that wouldnt make him poor why down at the run folks say youd hardly miss whats been taken  those who make that kind of talk are only shiftless people with never a dollar of their own consequently they dont know the value of one the old man cried angrily its all very well for a set of loafers who are mad with me because i wouldnt give them credit to say such things do you suppose id spend my time runnin around the country huntin for the thieves if i hadnt lost a power of money  youd be willin to run pretty far if there was a nickel at the end of the road tim retorted but before he could say anything more teddy motioned for him to be silent  are you goin to tell me who the robbers are uncle nathan asked in a wheedling tone as he turned once more toward his nephew  i dont know the men whom i suspect except by sight but its more than possible we may find out enough to warrant their arrest before the fair closes  the old man insisted on knowing at once and alternately coaxed and threatened but all to no purpose  teddy positively refused to make a statement until he had more proof and recognizing the fact that he might hurt his own cause by insisting uncle nathan said in a most affectionate tone  i must go now teddy but ill see you again before night if youll do all you can to help find them scoundrels ill never say that you had anything to do with the crime  youd no business to make any such talk for you knew it was impossible for me to take any hand in it even if id wanted to be a thief  theres a good deal of circumstantial evidence the old man said solemnly as he turned to leave an it stands you in hand to do all a boy can to clear your own skirts im goin to give you a chance an promise there wont be any arrest made today at all events  theres a good reason why you promise that tim cried angrily as uncle nathan walked away you tried mighty hard but couldnt get a warrant an there aint a justice of the peace between here an waterville as would grant one without any other evidence than what you can say  dont make him angry tim hes feeling bad about his money an you cant blame him for trying to find out who has got it  i dont blame him for that but what im kickin about is that he keeps naggin at you when theres no reason for it  most likely he thinks there is  he cant its only the wretched old skinflints way of gettin even with the world an so he picks on a feller what he believes cant strike back  i wish i could find out who the robbers are and where the goods have been hidden  well i dont it serves him right to lose em an hello here comes that feller what helps exhibit the rifles i wonder what he wants at this time of day jest when business is beginnin to be rushin  dan was evidently in a high state of excitement for he forced his way through the crowds regardless of possible injury to himself or others and did not slacken speed until he stood in front of the caneboard breathless and panting  whats up teddy asked in surprise  the fakir who got your money an another man who i think is the same one we heard talkin outside the tent have jest bought a boat from the davis company sam saw em an ran over to tell me while the bargain was bein made hes watchin down there till we can get back  i dont believe it would do any good for me to say another word to long jim he went past here this mornin an i only made a bad matter worse by trying to make him give back what he stole  we aint countin on doin that but i believe theyre gettin ready to cart away the goods what were stole from your uncle nathan perhaps we can foller without bein seen an get on to the whole snap could you get off for the balance of the day  and now teddy was quite as excited as dan  yes an so can sam  are you goin to help find his goods after all that old duffer has threatened tim asked impatiently  ill do what i can was the decided reply do you think you will be able to get along alone today  i could do it easy enough by hirin a boy to pick up the rings but i hate to see you make a fool of yourself teddy  youll think different later come on dan ill be back as soon as i can tim and then the young fakir urged his friend in the direction of the creek  it wont do to go anywhere near the boathouse dan said sam is up the bank a long piece where the willows hide him hes keepin his eye on the craft they bought so it cant be taken away without his seein it  by mingling with the crowd it was possible to make their way to the desired spot without being seen save by those with whom they came into immediate contact and in a few moments the watcher was joined by his friends  now i want you fellers to let me manage this case sam said pompously i know more bout detective business than both of you put together an if youd only told me what was up the other night wed had the whole thing settled  have you seen the men dan asked impatiently  lots of times the old fakir is loafin around close by the landin an the other one must a gone off for somethin the davis company told me i could take any of the boats an the minute the thieves start well jump right on their trail     chapter xiii  amateur detectives   it was fated that the thrilling work of running down and capturing the thieves should not be begun until after considerable delay  now i wonder what he is up to dan said when it was no longer possible to see the supposed burglar  why is it that you cant let me do this thing sam asked angrily if you keep meddlin well never fix matters  i dont see that im interfering dan replied in surprise  the three boys watched this one particular boat in silence for ten minutes or more seeing long jim now and then and just as they believed he was about to step on board the man walked toward the exhibition buildings and was soon lost to view amid the throng of people  you was gettin ready too i could tell that by your eye  ill have to give in that youre the smartest feller in this section of the country sam an thats a fact  of course it is the amateur detective replied complacently thinking dans sarcasm was really praise if i have my own way i can turn up the biggest thief that ever walked on two legs but you mustnt bother me or things may go wrong  if the matter had not been so serious to him teddy would have laughed long and often at the dignity and superior knowledge assumed by this fellow who since he made his acquaintance had done nothing more difficult than to get himself into trouble but under the circumstances he was so deeply interested in the outcome of the business that there was no room in his mind for mirth  dan he said let you and i walk around two or three minutes well stay close by so that sam can give us the signal in case the men show up and we may find hazelton  dont tell him what were doin the amateur detective cried sharply  why not  cause its likely hell want to meddle with our business an then my work will be spoiled  i wont say a word to him until after seeing you again teddy replied as he led dan away and added when they were where it would be impossible for sam to hear them see here its foolish for us to think of trying to follow those men if hes to be allowed to make a fool of himself with him believing hes the greatest detective in the country something wrong is sure to happen an we may never get another chance of finding out about the burglary  dont fret about that dan replied confidently it wont do any harm to let him swell a little now while hes keeping watch but when the real work begins it wont take long to sit on him  then there will be a row  ill attend to his case but i dont think therell be anything for us to do yet awhile the men are evidently in no hurry to leave and most likely intend to wait till the crowd begins to go  then why should all three of us stay on watch  we wont go back to your caneboard and ill tell sam to come for you when the burglars put in an appearance hell have time to do that an while hes gettin a boat ready you can come for me  will it be safe to trust him  yes indeed dan replied with a laugh hes havin an awful good time thinkin hes the greatest detective in the world and couldnt be hired to leave that clump of willows so long as the men keep out of sight  teddy was not so confident and insisted on going back with dan while the arrangement was made  when the matter was explained sam appeared to be perfectly satisfied  thats all right he said readily i can see to this thing alone but ill let you fellers know the minute anything happens dont tell any of the constables what im up to or theyll want to have a finger in the pie  convinced that he would be informed of any change in the situation teddy returned to the caneboard just in time to aid tim in attending to a rush of customers who were spending their money liberally  what made you come back the clerk asked in surprise ive hired a feller for a quarter to pick up rings an am gettin along first rate  teddy briefly explained the condition of affairs and then there was little opportunity for conversation until considerably past noon when trade dropped off very decidedly for a while  in order that he might have a glimpse of the other fakirs and rest himself at the same time tim was sent to see if sam was yet at his selfselected post of duty and teddy took advantage of the opportunity to ascertain the amount of his receipts  to his great surprise he found nearly forty dollars in the moneybox and from this he took thirty with which to pay the merchant in waterville who had given him credit for his stock  it has turned out to be a mighty good venture even if aunt sarah was so sure id make a fool of myself by tryin it all the money i make now will be clear profit and it looks as if id be able to help mother quite a bit  illustration theyre getting ready to start he said breathlessly  well how is business a voice asked in a cheery tone and looking up teddy saw his sole remaining creditor  im glad youve come he cried bundling the thirty dollars up in a piece of paper id jest counted this out for you an when you take it ill be free from debt  but i dont want the money the merchant replied i only came around to see if you were successful  ive already made more than i reckoned on an itll be a favor if you take this cause i dont like to have so much around  then teddy explained the condition of his business affairs not forgetting to tell of the accusation made against him by his uncle nathan and the merchant said as he concluded  i heard the whole story my boy and have already talked with mr hargreaves whom i met a few moments ago i do not think he can do anything to you because you have made many friends here the money i will take as it is not well to keep it where it might be stolen but can give you no receipt until i get home  thatll be all right teddy replied contentedly you trusted me with the goods an it would be funny if i couldnt wait for a receipted bill its through you that ive had the chance to make so much an i want you to know i feel grateful  i believe that and am more than pleased to have put you in the way of getting a start in the world come to see me when the fair closes and it is possible i may show you an opportunity of learning to be a merchant on a large scale rather than a fakir whose method of getting a living is very precarious regardless of the fact that he sometimes makes very great profits  it can be readily understood that teddy accepted the invitation and then trade commencing once more the gentleman walked away leaving the proprietor of the caneboard with the pleasing consciousness that he was free from debt and with quite a large amount of money in his mothers keeping  tim returned very shortly after the merchants departure and reported that sam was still on duty  the boat hasnt been moved nor have the men showed up again he said that feller acts as if he thought he was bigger than the president he told me he could be the greatest detective that ever lived if it wasnt that folks made him show off at rowin cause he had so much style about him i dont think hes so very wonderful but of course i never saw many out an out detectives  and you dont see one when you met him im sure hell get dan an me in trouble before this thing is ended  then why dont you let him go off alone thats what id do with such a chump  i cant because  the sentence was not concluded for at that moment dan came up at full speed  theyre gettin ready to start he said breathlessly i saw em go by the buildin an run over to tell sam that id fetch you our boat is a long distance up the creek an well have to hurry or run the chance of missing their craft  there was no delay on teddys part despite the misgivings he had regarding sam  one parting injunction to tim on the subject of business and then he followed dan at full speed toward the creek on such a course as would bring them fully a quarter of a mile above the boathouse outside the fair grounds  sam had made everything ready for the journey by the time they arrived and was so excited that he could no longer speak of his own wonderful powers as a thiefcatcher  one of you fellers had better row while i steer he said seating himself in the stern sheets and taking the tillerropes if they see the way i handle the oars theyll know exactly whos after them an then the gamell be up  dont worry yourself about that dan replied calmly neither teddy nor i knows anything about a boat except it may be to steer so youll have to hump yourself  sam grumbled considerably about taking so many risks but he finally moved over to the bow and his companions took their seats aft  i wont put any style to it an perhaps thatll keep em from knowin im on their trail he said and immediately began rowing in such a bungling fashion that dan said sharply  look here if youre goin to pull this boat do it or well go back at this rate youll have everybody at the fair watching to see what kind of chumps have been allowed to risk their lives weve got no time to spare either for we must get on the other side of the creek where it will be possible to watch the men without getting too near  ill take care of that part of the business sam replied loftily and dan immediately put into operation his plan of sitting on the amateur detective  you do your share and that will be enough teddy and i propose to take a hand in this ourselves  then i might as well go back  you can if you want to  it so chanced that he had no such desire and with the air of one whose feelings have been deeply wounded he rowed steadily on dan steering until they were where it was possible to have a full view of a long stretch of the creek  illustration there they are teddy said  there they are teddy said pointing down stream to where a boat was being pulled close to the left bank they have stopped and it looks as if something was being taken on board  it is a portion of the goods they stole dan cried stop rowing sam and if nothing happens well soon know where the whole lot is to be hidden     chapter xiv  the rendezvous   that dans surmise was correct could be seen a few moments after while the boys partially concealed by the overhanging bank watched the proceedings with but little danger of being discovered  on the shore were a number of packages in a cart and these the supposed burglars loaded into the boat with the utmost haste  if this lot comprised all that had been taken from uncle nathan his loss must have been greater than he stated and teddy said after watching several moments in silence  i reckon this is only part of what they took but im puzzled to know how it could have been brought so far the idea of carting goods over here to find a place in which to hide them is a queer one when all the thieves had to do was slip down the river in a skiff an before morning theyd be beyond reach of the officers  it surely was strange that the men should have done so much useless labor and the only solution to the apparent mystery was offered by sam who said with an air of superior wisdom  theyve done it to throw me off the scent that fakir we saw in waterville must have known who i was  how does it happen he had the nerve to come here when he knew you counted on showing the people who visited this fair your skill in rowing dan asked with a laugh  i reckon he didnt think i was tellin the truth  it was useless to attempt to make sam acquainted with himself he had such a remarkable idea of his own abilities despite the scrapes he was constantly getting into that the most eloquent orator would have been unable to convince him he was anything more than a very egotistical boy with little save his vanity to recommend him to the notice of the general public  in five minutes the boat at the opposite bank had received as much of a cargo as her owners wished to carry and then the men began to row leisurely down the river  now go slow sam and dont turn around to look or they may suspect we are following them dan said warningly ill keep you posted about what they are doing and you can tell us afterward what ought to have been done pull moderately for we dont want to get very near while it is light enough for them to see us  the chase was not a long one by keeping the boats head to the bank and moving leisurely as boys who were bent only on pleasure might have done the pursuers evidently caused no suspicions as to their purpose and after about a mile had been traversed the burglars turned up a narrow waterway which led to a barn or shed built on the meadows for the storing of marsh hay  there were plenty of ditches near at hand into which the amateur detectives could run their craft unobserved and as the pursued left the creek dan steered into one of these  here their heads hardly came above the bank and all three could see the men carrying their cargo to the building  weve got em now said sam triumphantly as the first of the packages was taken on shore an the sooner we nab both the better  how do you intend to set about such a job teddy asked  go right up an tell em weve been on their track  and in less than two minutes you would get a worse pounding than the toughs gave you last night  sam appeared to realize the truth of this statement for he had no further suggestions to offer and dan said after some reflection  i think the best thing we can do will be to go back to the fair if those fellows find us here the jig will be up but it isnt likely theyve got the whole of their plunder with them and intend to come here again well talk with some one and find out a good plan or keep our eyes peeled to learn what they mean to do with the goods if they propose simply to hide them until there is a chance to get the lot away safely we shall have the key to the situation an can take plenty of time deciding what should be done  sam did not again propose to make any attempt at intimidating the men and teddy thought dans scheme a wise one  theyll come here more than once before the week is ended you know they spoke of moving the stuff when the exhibitors got ready to leave an wed better go back to the grounds before those fellows have finished their work  sam pulled out of the watercourse into the creek without a murmur but when they were on the way back and he felt at liberty to display his true style courage returned  i knew you fellers wasnt any good on detective work he said scornfully if id had charge of the case we should have them men tied hand an foot in the bottom of this boat  how would you have got em there dan asked  thats my business jest because ive let you into this thing theres no reason why i should give all my secrets away is there  not a bit of it an you keep them locked up in your heart for if teddy an i knew the plans we might get into a bad scrape  well what are you goin to do now  nothing until after we have talked with those who know more than we do about such things  sam immediately relapsed into silence his superior knowledge had been scorned and he proposed to let his companions understand that he was not pleased with them  by the time the boys reached the bend in the creek they could see the boat in which were long jim and his companion half a mile behind and dan said  those fellows dont know me when we land you and sam had better keep out of sight while i try to find out where they go after striking the fair ground  all right its time i helped tim an youll come to the caneboard if there is anything to tell  so i dont amount to anything eh sam asked sulkily  of course you do but it would be foolish to make a show of yourself to long jim who would remember you keep rowing around in the boat as if you were at work and therell be no chance for suspicion  by this time the little craft was at the landing stage of the boathouse and two of the party leaped out leaving the third feeling that he had been unjustly deprived of a very large portion of his rights  if them fellers think theyre goin to get the best of me theyre makin a big mistake an ill show em so before night they dont know any more about bein detectives than a cat but both will be mightily surprised before mornin or im mistaken  then instead of rowing around the creek as dan had suggested sam pulled out into the middle of the stream looking wondrous wise and determined as he awaited the coming of those whose secret he had partially discovered  meanwhile teddy and dan without the slightest suspicion of what their friend proposed to do separated at the landing stage the former making all haste to reach his caneboard where he found tim doing a thriving business and standing near by was hazelton  where have you been the jewelry fakir asked solicitously ive come here two or three times without finding you and had almost begun to believe old nathan succeeded in getting a warrant  teddy was undecided as to whether he should tell this acquaintance of all he had seen or not but after some deliberation and in view of the fact that he also had been accused of the burglary concluded to do so  weve found out where long jim is hiding the stuff he stole from my uncle he said and then explained what had been done during the last hour  hazelton was surprised that so much information had been gained but he was able to cause teddy an equal amount of astonishment  i dont believe the packages you saw came from the old mans store i heard about two hours ago that a store here in town was robbed last night and it isnt dead sure after your uncles accusations and what i have done on the fair grounds that i shant be arrested on suspicion most likely the goods taken down the creek were stolen here but i dont understand why those fellows should work so boldly  probably they think as one of them said the other night while so many articles are being carried to and fro  very likely that may be true and now comes the question of what shall be done regarding the information you have gained i stand in a mighty delicate position and quite naturally want to save myself if possible for even an arrest when there is little or no proof aint to be contemplated calmly  you ought to know better than i how we should go to work dan an i thought there would be plenty of time for if those fellows were going to skip very soon they wouldnt have taken the trouble to carry the stuff down there where it could not be gotten away quickly  ill think the matter over teddy and come back here in a couple of hours hazelton said after a moments thought  dont tell anyone what you found out until after seeing me again  this conversation had been carried on at the rear of the caneboard where the customers could not overhear it and when the jewelry fakir walked toward the exhibition building it was necessary to satisfy tims curiosity regarding what had been accomplished  i dont spose its any of my business the latter said when teddy concluded the story but i wouldnt be afraid to bet all i shall earn this week that youll have trouble with that feller before the scrape is over he knows so awful much that somethin tough is bound to happen  teddy did not think there was any good cause for alarm more especially since he felt confident dan would keep an eye on the oarsman and during the next two hours he thought of nothing save earning money for customers were plenty and even with the assistance of the boy tim had engaged it was all he and his clerk could do to wait upon those who were anxious to win a cane or knife  now and then some of the other fakirs would visit him but as a rule all were so busy that there was little time for the exchange of compliments and even the cry of three rings for five cents with the chance to get a dollar cane or knife for nothing was not needed to stimulate trade  it was two hours from the time of his return when dan came up looking decidedly uneasy and teddy did not stop to make change for the man who had just patronized him before he asked hurriedly  now whats up  sam is missing  what do you mean how can that be  he was to row around the creek near the landing but for the last hour no one has seen him and what is more the boat cant be found long jim an his friend havent come ashore as near as i can make out an it looks to me as if that foolish sam has got into trouble through trying to play detective     chapter xv  sams adventures   in order to explain sams absence and one or two other incidents in their regular sequence it is necessary to go back to the moment when his friends having landed the amateur detective was left to his own devices  his first impulse was to report his arrival to the manager of the boat exhibit and then go about his routine duties but before this very proper plan could be carried into effect he chanced to see hazelton on the shore  now whats he layin around there for sam asked of himself ill bet dan or teddy has given the whole snap away an hes come to pull in the burglars its a mighty mean trick for them to play after ive worked the case so far that theres nothing to do but nab em hell get all the praise an folks wont know the job was managed by me  the longer sam thought of this apparent ingratitude and treachery on the part of teddy and dan the more angry he grew and it did not require many moments thought for him to succeed in convincing himself that he had been very shabbily treated  continuing to talk to himself or rather at the tiller on which his eyes were fixed he added  folks have said so much about their savin them women from drownin when i mighter done the same thing if id been willin to make a fool of myself that they want to scoop in everything but i could stop this little game by jest goin ahead on my own hook if i sneaked down the creek an brought back the stuff them men have been hidin people would begin to know how much i understand about detective work  this appeared in his mind as the most brilliant scheme he had ever conceived and in a very few seconds sam decided that it should be carried into effect  first and with no very welldefined idea of why such a course was necessary he rowed cautiously to and fro past the landing stage scrutinizing closely every face he saw and mentally hugging himself because of the excitement which would be caused by his return with the stolen property  then he turned the boat and began to row down the creek stopping every few seconds to gaze around in such a mysterious manner that the suspicions of any one who observed him would have been instantly aroused  in this manner which he believed the only true way for a firstclass detective to approach his prey sam had rowed less than half a mile when he saw long jim and his companion returning  now the time had come when true cunning was necessary and the amateur detective began to display it by pulling the boat sharply around heading her for an indentation on the opposite shore  here he ran her bow aground and lying at full length in the bottom peered out at the men in the most stealthy manner  they had already taken notice of his erratic movements and now regarded him intently but without checking the headway of their own craft in a few minutes were beyond sight around the bend  there sam said with a longdrawn breath of relief as he arose to a sitting posture if teddy an dan had been here them fellers would have tumbled to the whole racket but ive put em off the scent an will have plenty of time to do my work  he pulled out from the shore once more gazed long and earnestly up and down the creek and then in the same ridiculous manner as before continued the journey  the trip which should have consumed no more than an hour even with the most indolent oarsman was not completed until twice that time had elapsed and then fully fifteen minutes were spent by this very cautious boy in landing  he pulled his boat up high out of the water and in order to conceal her heaped such a pile of dry grass on top of her that it must have attracted the attention of any one passing more especially those who were familiar with the creek  this done he went toward the barn after the fashion of an oldtime stage villain halting at the slightest sound and peering in every direction fancying himself surrounded by foes  not until he had circled completely around the barn twice did he venture to enter and then much to his disappointment there was nothing to be seen the building appeared to be absolutely empty and even his eagle eye failed to discover any traces of recent occupancy  well this is mighty funny he said with a sigh of disappointment them fellers surely brought a lot of stuff in here but they must have carried it out again  having expended so much labor and time in reaching this place he did not intend to return until after making a thorough search however and to this end he investigated one possible hidingplace after another pulling up the boards of the rude flooring and peering into places where nothing larger than a mouse could have been hidden  during this time the burglars were returning with all possible speed sams actions both as he came down the creek and also while screening himself from view were so suspicious that guilty as the men were they immediately concluded what was very near the truth  long jim recognized the boy as having been with teddy when the bargain for the imaginary caneboard was made and instead of returning to the fair grounds the two watched from a point of vantage on the bank until master sam had landed  his purpose was now evident and it was necessary the burglars should resort to desperate measures to prevent the loss of their illgotten gains as well as to save themselves from imprisonment  when they arrived where it was possible to look into the barn sam was on his knees scraping away the dirt which appeared to have been recently disturbed and they heard him say in a tone of exultation  ive got to it at last an now well see what teddy an dan have to say when i flash the whole lot of stuff up with nobody to help me i reckon  he did not finish the sentence for at that moment long jim stepped directly in front of him as he asked  did you leave anything here my son  noiithat isyou see  sam was so frightened that he could not say another word it seemed as if his tongue was swollen to twice its natural size while his throat was parched and dry and to make bad matters worse he had entirely neglected to invent a plausible excuse for his presence there in case of an interruption  i asked if youd left anything here long jim repeated very mildly  wellwell you see i jest come down toto i thought perhaps i might find something but its time i was gettin back to the fair cause the folks will be needin me  as he spoke he attempted to back toward the door but before taking half a dozen steps a cry of fear burst from his lips for a heavy hand was laid with no gentle force on his shirt collar and he staggered forward helplessly  thats an invitation for you to hold on a bit an have a little conversation with two gentlemen who are mighty curious to know why you came here long jim said grimly youre goin to tell us the whole particlars or there wont be enough left of you to be seen under a microscope  sam made no reply he was literally dazed with fear and just at that moment he thought the life of a detective very disagreeable  come speak up an be quick about it the man cried fiercely weve got no time to waste on sich cubs as you an in about two minutes youll get worsen we served out the other night  that wasnt me follerin you from the museum tent sam said quickly thinking possibly this fact might work in his favor  who was it  teddy an dan  who is dan  a feller who works for the stevens arms company up at the fair  why did they follow us  teddy wanted to get back the money he gave you to buy a caneboard with  if he knows whats wise for him hell stop any such rackets or he may get moren he bargains for  then the second man who still held firmly to sams collar asked as he shook his prisoner vigorously  how did you know we had been here  us fellers saw you come down in a boat  so all three are in the secret eh  sams only thought was that he might possibly save his own skin and he replied in the affirmative although he must have known that by such answer he was destroying his friends chances of recovering the goods  where are the fools now long jim asked angrily  up at the fair  what do they intend to do  get somebody to arrest you  then weve got to skip mighty lively phil and long jim looked up at his companion  yes but if my advice had been follered we wouldnt be in this scrape you was the only one the cubs knew an by keepin out of sight we mighter finished the work thats been laid out youre so pigheaded that a yoke of oxen couldnt keep you in hidin  theres no use fightin about it now for weve got to get a move on us in short order it wont do to let this boy have a chance to give the alarm  of course not lash him up somewhere so he cant make a noise an his chums will come before he starves to death  dont do that sam cried in an agony of terror i wont say a word about your catchin me here an ill do anything you say  oh youre a nice plum to make promises aint you it didnt take much persuadin to make you go back on your friends an thats enough to show whether you can be trusted get the rope out of the boat phil an then well make ready for a long jump  phil obeyed grumbling as he went because his partner had refused to take his advice thus plunging both of them into danger and long jim turned his attention to the prisoner once more  before we leave this part of the country for good im goin to give you somethin to remember us by sos you wont go round stickin your nose into other peoples business agin  what are you goin to do sam asked his face growing even paler than before  give you the worst floggin a boy ever had id do it now if there wasnt so much work to be got through  sam had sufficient sense to know that all his pleadings for mercy would be in vain and he held his peace until phil returned with a long coil of rope which had been used as a boats painter  one of the beams at the end of the barn served as a post to which to lash the prisoner and here the amateur detective was made fast in such a skillful manner that he could not so much as move his arms  shall we gag him now phil asked and long jim replied  no theres time enough  he cant make any one hear if he yells his best an ive got a little business to settle before hes trussed up for good     chapter xvi  missing   when dan informed teddy that sam was missing and suggested the possibility of the burglars having gotten him in their power both the boys were decidedly alarmed but the matter ceased to appear as serious after it had been discussed in all its bearings  long jim wouldnt have dared to spirit him away when there are so many people around teddy said after a long silence during which he was trying to imagine what sam might have done besides what would be the good of taking him if we were left behind  perhaps they count on hauling us in too  that isnt to be thought of for a moment they dont want to burden themselves with a lot of boys when every effort must be made to get the stolen property out of this section of the country before they are discovered  ill allow all that sounds reasonable but where is sam  of course i dont know do you think he would dare to go down the river again after we landed  no indeed hes too much of a coward for that if theres been any funny business it was done when the men got back  then we have no need to worry for there are hundreds of people on the bank of the creek all the time an sam would know enough to yell if anybody tried to steal him  the idea that the amateur detective might be stolen seemed so comical to dan that he gave way to mirth and what had promised to be a most sorrowful visit speedily became a merry one  he had permission to remain away from the exhibition building during the rest of the day teddy finally said an most likely hes goin to take advantage of it by roaming around the grounds exercising his detective faculties hell turn up at the museum tonight all right with a big yarn to tell about his supposed adventures  i reckon youre right but i did get a little rattled when his boss asked me where he was ill come back this way when its time to go to supper  wait a minute im mighty hungry now an business has been so good that i can afford to treat to sandwiches an lemonade if youll go with me over to the grand stand ill bring you back something tim he added as he leaped over the railing  dan said he could remain away half an hour from the rifle exhibit and teddy was now so easy in mind concerning money matters that he resolved to have thirty minutes of sport  the boys first made a tour of that portion of the grounds where the fakirs were congregated stopping a moment to see the whip dealer lashing a pine stake to show the quality of his goods and then watching the great african dodger who thrust his woolly head through an aperture in a canvas screen for all those to throw balls at who were inclined to pay the price  then they stopped at the envelope game where were spread on a stand a large collection of cheap gaudy goods each bearing a printed number every one supposed to correspond with those contained in a box of envelopes and this fakir was doing a big business as was shown by the fact that he could afford to hire a barker who cried continually at the full strength of his lungs  come up now and try your luck heres where we have all prizes and no blanks ten cents buys an envelope with the privilege of drawing for yourself so there can be no job put up against you and every number calls for some one of the many valuable articles in the layout heres a gentleman who spends only ten cents and gets a pair of those beautiful tripleplated doubleexpansion fine pure metal cuff buttons worth two dollars at some stores  come on dan said impatiently that fellow is almost as big a snide as hazelton  how do you make that out i can see a lot of things that cost more than a dollar look at the silver watch and the revolver  that may be all very well but no one except a fellow who is interested in the business gets any of those articles  you can select any envelope you choose  thats right but the ones with the numbers calling for the big prizes are lying flat in the box where nobody can get them if you should accuse the man of cheating he would turn the whole thing upside down and then of course they could be found here comes a fellow who i know is cappin for that fakir watch how he does it  the apparent stranger approached the stand and after some talk as to how the game was run invested ten cents  the man did not open the envelope he drew but handed it to the fakir who pretending to look at the card it contained shouted  number fiftyfour the gentleman has drawn that beautiful solid silver watch worth fifty dollars and i will give him thirty for his bargain  the stranger showed his prize to the crowd that clustered around him and business was increased wonderfully for it had apparently been proven that the game was conducted fairly  now watch him dan said as the stranger walked away with his prize ostentatiously displayed and the two boys followed a short distance off until they saw him halt behind a booth where he turned the article won over to a barker who had approached  thats the way it is done dan said and when we come back youll see the same watch on the layout  teddy was rapidly being initiated in the tricks of the fakirs and the more he saw the more firmly was he resolved not to follow the business longer than the present week although he believed his own game to be an honest one  the cheap jewelry dealer the man who had been selling the remnants of a stock of knives made by a manufacturer who had bankrupted himself by putting into them too expensive material the fakir with the dolls which were to be knocked down by balls thrown from a certain distance with a prize of one cigar if the customer could tumble two over and the peanutcandy dealer were visited in turn and then the boys were attracted by the sound of hazeltons voice  he was plying his peculiar trade again and by the appearance of the crowd was meeting with great success  lets see how he gets out of it this time teddy suggested and dan agreed  the fakir had arrived at that point where he was giving away the supposed watches and the boys listened until they saw his preparations for departure  what beats me is how he gets clear every time dan whispered i should think after he had swindled four or five hundred some of them would lay for a chance to get even with him  he says they do an thats why he left his satchel with me  hazelton recognized the boys just as he was telling that nathan hargreaves might possibly act as his agent after the close of the fair and nodded pleasantly as he gathered up the reins but this was one of the occasions when he was not to be allowed to go scot free  two stalwartlooking fellows were standing near the head of the horse and when the fakir would have driven off they seized the bridle one of them shouting  come down with that money this is the second time ive seen you do us countrymen up today and now youve got to square things  hazelton swung his whip around striking the speaker full in the face and causing the horse to plunge and rear but yet the fellows kept their hold  the whip was pulled from the fakirs hand and in an instant it appeared as if a riot had begun those who had been content to keep secret the fact of having been swindled now grew bold as they saw there was a leader in the movement and more than a hundred leaped forward to seize the representative of the alleged jewelry manufacturers  hell be killed teddy shouted and would have attempted to go to the assistance of the man who had been kind to him despite the fact that he could not have aided him in any way against so many but for the fact that dan pulled him back as he shouted  cant you see that it would be fifty to one if you should go in that crowd we couldnt help him and whats the use of gettin a big lickin for nothing besides what would become of your business if the people here thought you were his partner  before dan ceased speaking teddy realized how useless would be any effort of his and he remained passive trying to get a glimpse of the illfated fakir  the numbers who beset him completely hid hazelton from view the carriage had been overturned by the first desperate rush of the victims and the horse was clearing a space around himself by the free use of his heels  theyll commit murder teddy cried  i dont believe itll be quite as bad as that but he wont be likely to give away any more lockets while this fair lasts  as a matter of fact hazelton was not left to fight the battle alone like every other fakir engaged in that peculiar business he had several partners whose duty it was to mingle with the crowd for the purpose of intimidating any who might be disposed to make trouble and these had closed in upon him while some of the more timid spectators shouted for the constables  illustration run as you never did before teddy for if they get hold of us itll be a bad job all around  once teddy caught a glimpse of the unfortunate man his glossy hat was gone his clothing torn and his face covered with blood  i can see him now he cried and it looks as if they had about used him up for  before he could finish the sentence a stranger rushed toward him and showing the familiar black satchel in his hand said hurriedly  get out of here with that hazelton will see you some time this evening dont stop a minute  before the boy could reply the stranger was forcing his way through the struggling yelling crowd in order to aid his partner and teddy said in dismay  now we are in a muss here is all his money an if anybody sees us with it well have a tough time  you cant throw it away an we must sneak off dan said and the expression on his face told how distressed he was that such a responsibility had been thrust upon them  shall we go back to the stand  no that would never do for then they would be sure to vent their anger on you go up to the museum mr sweet knows hazelton an may be willin to help him by keeping the satchel till the row is over  these words had been spoken as the boys were trying to make their way through the fringe of spectators which had hemmed them in since the fight began and after some difficulty they succeeded but at the same moment one of the combatants who had received more than his share of punishment emerged close by their side  he saw hazeltons satchel and recognized it  come here fellows two little villains are making off with the money thats what we want  he at once started in pursuit as did several others and dan cried as he helped carry the burden  run as you never did before teddy for if they get hold of us itll be a bad job all around     chapter xvii  a terrible night   at just about the same moment when teddy and dan were running with hazeltons money at full speed toward the museum tent with the chance of escape very much against them sam was in a decidedly painful frame of mind  after he had been securely tied the two men conversed in low tones for several minutes and then as if having arrived at some definite conclusion began to make preparations for leaving the place  at the same spot where sam had been interrupted while scraping away the dirt they proceeded to dig with a shovel which phil procured from somewhere outside the building and during this labor the prisoner could hear fragments of the conversation  once long jim ceased his work long enough to say  when you come to look at the matter quietly it doesnt seem as if wed got into sich a very bad scrape you can manage to bring the rest of the stuff down the creek between now an friday mornin and ive got a plan for givin anybody who may come after us a good clue to the boys disappearance  phil made some remark which sam could not hear and his companion replied in a louder tone  it can all be done sos to make folks think weve gone up the creek an weve got to lay low for a while which wont be a hard job while the weather is warm  but i dont like the idea of totin that cub with us so long  ill take care of him an will make him earn his board or somethins bound to break  from this time until several packages were unearthed sam could hear nothing but what had already been said was sufficient to convince him that he was to have a very unpleasant experience and for at least the hundredth time he fervently wished he had never so much as heard of detective work  after the goods had been brought to light the earth was replaced in the excavation and pounded down carefully then fully half an hour was spent digging in different places probably for the purpose of misleading any one who might come there in search of plunder for phil said in a tone of satisfaction as he ceased the apparently aimless labor  itll take at least a day before all of these suspicious looking spots have been investigated an in the meanwhile unless were chumps we shall know whats goin on ill take one load to the boat make sure the coast is clear an then the three of us can carry the balance have the boy ready for a quick move an see to it that he cant give an alarm  ill knock his head off if he so much as thinks of such a thing and as phil disappeared with a portion of the plunder long jim began to unfasten sams bonds saying as he did so  weve made up our minds to hold you with us a few days cause youre sich jolly company if you obey orders an keep your mouth shut theres a chance of gettin outer this scrape mighty easy but id slit your throat in a jiffy if you tried to give us the slip or made any noise  sam made no reply but his captor could see very plainly that the boy was nearly paralyzed with fright and it was safe to infer he would follow the instructions given to the letter  phil returned in a very short time and reported  the coast is clear theres not a craft to be seen on the creek an we can leave without danger  the rope had been removed from sams limbs and long jim proceeded to load him down with bundles until he staggered under the weight  now see that you walk a chalk line the burglar said fiercely foller phil an ill keep behind to make sure there are no tricks played remember what i promised  the men could carry the remainder of the goods in one load and the three went out of the barn hurriedly sam not daring to so much as lift his eyes from the ground lest long jims threat should be carried into execution  arriving at the waters edge the boat was loaded the prisoner ordered to take his place at the oars and then the final preparations were made  phil uncovered the boat in which sam had come launched and overturned her then taking the hat from the unresisting boys head threw it far out in the channel afterward giving the little craft a shove which sent her a long distance from the shore next the two oars were sent after the hat and phil said with a laugh  the current aint very strong but with the aid of the wind i reckon that stuff will drift up to the fair grounds before dark  sams despair was already so great that it did not seem as if it could be increased but the last vestige of hope fled when he realized that these things had been done in order to make it appear as if he were dead  teddy and dan wont think of huntin for me after the boat is found he thought an these men are sure to kill me before this scrape is over  the two burglars seated themselves comfortably in the sternsheets the packages being placed at the bow to trim the craft properly and long jim said sternly  youve been showin off your skill as an oarsman for two or three days an we want you to do it now put in your best licks for itll be tough if we dont get through the water mighty fast  even sams worst enemy would have pitied him at this moment no galley slave chained to his seat could have been more utterly helpless and he exerted himself to the utmost in order to please those who professed to be so willing to punish or kill  every stroke of the oars took them farther away from the fair grounds and each puff of wind carried the evidences of the prisoners death nearer the only ones who might take the trouble to search for him  not until fully an hour had passed did the burglars give any sign of a desire to end the journey and then long jim said  we must be six miles from the fair grounds by this time an that is as far as youll want to pull tonight phil there should be plenty of good hidinplaces in this bit of woods an i think wed better haul up  all right steer her into that ditch over there an well look around  thus far in his experience as a detective this was the only thing sam had had for which to be thankful his arms were so tired that it seemed as if he could not have pulled another stroke and his clothes were literally wet from the perspiration that came from his body  phil went ashore leaving his companion to watch the almost exhausted prisoner and in a few moments the former shouted  load that cub up an bring him over here this is a capital place to locate in for a couple of days  staggering under the heavy burden long jim placed on his shoulders the amateur detective was forced on through the underbrush in advance of his captor until the two arrived at a perfect tangle of cedars  phil returned to the boat for the remainder of the goods and all the plunder was placed inside the thicket where the foliage was so dense that one might have passed within a few feet of the spot and not had any suspicion men were hidden there  a tiny brook ran past one side of the hidingplace and sam took advantage of the opportunity to check his raging thirst while the men were laying plans for the future  ill go back soon after sunset phil said as he lighted his pipe and proceeded to make himself comfortable we can leave the boy here to look out for the stuff an youd better come with me up to the barn sos to learn if any one visits the place i shall be back before morning an you can let me know if the coast is clear  shall you try to finish the job we were talkin about  no things are so hot jest now that it wont pay to take any more risks than are absolutely necessary what we want is to get out of this portion of the country as soon as possible  all right ill leave you to manage the rest of the business an promise to follow orders  i think its about time you said that jim if my plans had been carried out in the first place we wouldnt be in sich a muss but could be havin the cream of the pickins at the fair  well whats the use of harpin on that all the time the thing has been done an weve got to make the best of it do you think itll be safe to leave this cub here alone while were away  it will be when i get through with him was the grim reply and sam terrified by the vagueness of this remark more even than he had been by the plain language previously used cried piteously  please dont leave me here alone tonight ill pull the boat an do everything you say without so much as yippin  them as starts out in the detective business have to take what comes specially when their own foolishness brings it about you joined our party of your own accord my son an must put up with what we choose to give  sam said nothing more he was reaping what he had sowed and decided that matters could not be much worse even if he was caught trying to escape therefore he resolved to take desperate chances in an effort to give his captors the slip  there was no opportunity to make the attempt on this night at least for when phil had finished smoking he proceeded in a very methodical manner to secure the prisoner  sam was ordered to seat himself on the ground with his back to the trunk of a cedartree and he was fastened skillfully with his elbows tied back in such a manner that he could not bring his hands together both feet were bound and then with a sudden movement phil forced the boys mouth open shoving into it a short piece of pine wood about an inch and a half in diameter  this was secured in such a manner that the prisoner could not free himself from the uncomfortable bridle neither would it be possible for him to make the slightest outcry  now dont shout for help while we are gone an unless the bears eat you up we shall meet again about daybreak phil said with a coarse laugh as he and jim went out of the thicket toward the creek  poor sam had never thought of the possibility that there might be bears in this section of the country until the burglar suggested it and he was so terrified as not to realize it was impossible there could be any dangerous animals in such a thicklysettled portion of the state  therefore in addition to the danger to be apprehended from his captors he had constantly before his mind this new cause for fear the rustling of the leaves the flight of a bird as it sought a perch for the night or the soughing of the wind among the branches were to him so many proofs that a violent death would be his before morning  if the beginning of the hours of darkness was so terrible it can well be fancied how he suffered before another day dawned     chapter xviii  a narrow escape   neither teddy nor dan had any hope of reaching the museum tent before their pursuers could overtake them and although both knew what might be the result if they were taken with the jewelry fakirs money and goods in their possession they did not for a moment think of abandoning the property  the cries of those in the rear attracted the attention of the spectators elsewhere on the grounds and without waiting to learn the cause of the trouble hundreds of men and boys joined in the chase all shouting at the full strength of their lungs  stop thief stop thief  the distance to be traversed was nearly a quarter of a mile but the many turns the boys were forced to make in order to avoid those who were ready to capture them doubled this and they were yet very far from the goal when a burly redfaced man jumped in front of them  it seemed as if capture was inevitable but teddy resorted to the last means of defense and was successful  letting go his hold of the satchel he lowered his head leaped forward with full force striking the officious stranger full in the stomach  the man not anticipating such an attack at a moment when he almost had his hands upon the supposed thieves was bowled over like a ninepin and jumping quickly aside teddy caught hold of the satchel once more  by this time both the boys were so nearly winded that speech was well nigh impossible but dan managed to gasp admiringly  youre a dandy old fellow and then with one supreme effort increased his pace a trifle  it was fortunate that there were no spectators in front of mr sweets tent when the boys came in sight of it the barker was lounging in a chair outside and on catching a glimpse of the boys recognized them immediately  the crowd in pursuit would have told a duller man than he professed to be that there had been some serious trouble and running to meet the boys as if to intercept them he cried  circle around the canvas an crawl underneath sos that gang wont see where youve gone  the fugitives understood the scheme at once and making a short detour as if to avoid him dashed under the guyropes at one end gaining the interior of the tent before the pursuers arrived  mr sweet had just started toward the flap to ascertain the cause of the commotion when the boys entered and thinking himself about to be attacked leaped quickly back as he seized an ironbound stake  oh its you eh he said on recognizing the intruders whats up are you the thieves theyre yellin for  teddy was hardly able to speak but he held up the satchel as he panted  hazeltonstheyre killin himhewantsthissaved  yes i understand it now jump into the wagon an get under the stuff there ill take the valise them kind of fakirs are bound to come to grief sooner or later an honest people get into a muss tryin to help em id like to see the fair where them kinds of games wasnt allowed but dont spose i ever shall although its always promised  while mr sweet had been grumbling and at the same time concealing the satchel under the box containing the snakes the boys were doing their best to hide themselves beneath the litter of ropes and canvas which had been carelessly thrown into the wagon  in the meantime the pursuers came up discovered the unpleasant fact that the fugitives were no longer in sight and began to parley with the barker  i tried to catch em the boys heard the latter say but they got around the tent before i had time to find out what the matter was  theyve gone inside one of the crowd shouted dont lets allow swindlers to get the best of us so easy  thats the way to talk another cried well have em out if the show has to come down  at this moment mr sweet looking calm and undisturbed emerged from the flap  bring out them boys or down comes your tent a man yelled  i reckon the wisest plan for you to pursue is to wait till i find out what all this means the proprietor of the museum said loudly at the same time beckoning the barker and the clown to his side it looks to me as if this was the same gang who came here last night tryin to clean us out an warrants for their arrest are in the hands of the constables now i paid one hundred dollars for the privilege of exhibitin here an that means im to have all the protection the managers of this fair and the authorities of the town can give me ive warned you off but if you still want to finish up the work of last night an the constables dont come in time there are three of us here who are good for twice that number of your gang an when a man gets a tap over the head with one of these hes not in it any longer  mr sweet flourished the heavy stake as he spoke and his employes showed that they were armed in the same manner  we didnt come to disturb you one of the crowd said in a milder tone as the greater number fell back before the threats made of invoking the aid of the law all we want is a valise two boys brought here for in it is quite a pile of our money  how did they get it from you the proprietor of the museum asked for the purpose of gaining time in the hope the constables would put in an appearance  we were swindled by a jewelry agent an are goin to get back our own  oh you are eh well i havent got the stuff but if you allow yourselves to be swindled will you help matters by turning thieves you can sue the man who has done you up but theres a penalty for stealing as you will find out if you keep on in this way  the less impetuous among the pursuers understood that the showman was speaking only the truth and now that they had an opportunity for reflection began to be ashamed of the part they were playing one by one walked away without making any further remonstrance and in a short time only a dozen or so remained in front of the tent  all these were young men and several had been drinking therefore the danger was not yet past  you stand here and brain the first man who attempts to enter mr sweet said as he disappeared inside the tent then hurrying to where teddy and dan were hidden he whispered  it may be possible that in order to avoid a row i shall be obliged to let this gang in there is no one behind the canvas and you can slip out readily go directly back where you belong an if anybody accuses you of being the boys who brought away the valise deny it im goin to make a big bluff about lookin for constables an the minute you hear me talking move lively  what about hazeltons money teddy asked  hell find it here when he dares to come for it  an instant later the fugitives heard him say from the outside  i propose to call for help in case you very respectable young gentleman should take a notion to break in and steal  all we ask is that youll turn out them boys one of the party replied angrily for whether its stealing or not were bound to have that fakirs money  that part of it is nothing to me there are no boys inside an if you want to go in one at a time so therell be no chance of gettin the best of me an destroyin my property i dont think therell be any objection made  nows our time before they come dan whispered as he slipped softly down from the wagon and teddy followed  it was but the work of a moment to raise the canvas and step out there was absolutely no one in sight the tent had been erected near the edge of the grounds and there was nothing in the vicinity to attract the sightseers  well get over the fence an come in through the main gate its better to pay for admission than to let people suspect we were the ones who have been chased  go on ill stay close at your heels  five minutes later they were walking along the dusty road looking as innocent as possible and feeling comparatively safe  do you suppose any one will know us teddy asked after they had trudged some distance in silence  there cant be much danger of that all the crowd saw were our backs and besides after those fellows cool off theyll be ashamed of themselves i dont reckon youll have any trouble but i may get it hot from the boss because ive been away so long  i guess there wont be much danger of that but if anything should happen come to my stand after what has happened i reckon i can afford to whack up with you on some of the profits especially since every one says tomorrow is to be such a big day where do you suppose hazelton is  he must have had a chance to get off when the men started for us but ill bet he dont look as nice as he did this morning  by this time the boys were at the ticketoffice and paying the price of admission they walked into the inclosure without attracting the slightest attention  on the way to his place of business teddy chanced to think of the errand on which they had started out and he bought a generous supply of sandwiches for dan tim and himself  when the two arrived at the caneboard business was at its height and the clerk and his assistant were having quite as much as they could do to attend to the customers  this saved teddy the necessity of entering into any explanation while strangers were near and he immediately went to work not having an idle moment until nearly nightfall when the greater portion of the visitors had departed  where did you and dan go that you staid away so long tim asked as he and teddy began to pack up the stock of canes and knives  oh its a long story ill tell you all about it while we are eating supper teddy replied with a significant look in the direction of the assistant  tim understood that there was some secret regarding the matter and he at once proceeded to get rid of a possible eavesdropper by saying to the assistant  heres the money i promised theres no need of your stayin any longer  shall i come to work in the morning  tim looked toward his employer and the latter said  yes of course if it is pleasant weather everybody says therell be a bigger crowd than ever an i reckon we shall have work enough for all hands  the boy had but just taken his departure when dan approached looking very mournful  have you been bounced teddy cried excitedly  not a bit of it but look here and dan held up a straw hat thats poor sams his boat has been found bottom up an this with one of the oars was fished out of the creek a few moments ago while we were talking rough about him the poor boy was drowning     chapter xix  the arrest   teddy was dazed by the tidings and apparent proof of sams death without being able to explain why it seemed as if the amateur detective was not the sort of a boy who might be expected to depart this life suddenly and the news saddened him wonderfully  just think he said the poor fellow wouldnt try to save the women because of the danger of approaching a drowning person and in such a short time he himself is at the bottom of the creek  if he has got any folks some word ought to be sent to them  i never heard him say whether he had or not will any one search for the body  the man who represents the davis company says he will have men out in the morning if it is possible to hire any if not there will be plenty wanting a job by saturday and he can then get all he wants its bound to be a long search for theres no telling where the boat capsized  nothing save sams untimely fate was spoken of during the time they were packing up the goods and carrying them to the tent and then mr sweet after having been told the sad news said without commenting upon it  you boys had better go to supper now an get back before dark for theres no knowin but that some of those fellows who called on me may be waiting to take their revenge out on you  how did you get rid of them dan asked  that part of it was as easy as rollin off a log after you boys were out of sight i let em in one at a time an the chumps never tumbled to the fact that you had gone under the canvas they came to the conclusion you must have climbed over the fence an we didnt take the trouble to show them the mistake it was a close shave though at one time when i was talkin so loud about stealing i thought wed have the toughest kind of a row  is the money all right  its jest where i left it an wont be touched till he comes to claim it unless you boys want to take charge of the property  indeed we dont teddy replied quickly ive had all i want of such caretaking  then go to supper an hurry back  the boys waited only long enough to stow their goods in the wagon and then mr sweets advice was acted upon  as a matter of course tim wanted to know what the proprietor of the museum had been talking about and as they were walking across the grounds teddy told the whole story concluding by saying  it was a little the worst scrape i ever got into but after the money had been placed in our hands and the man who left it went off we couldnt do different from what we did  that hazelton had no business to get you into such a row tim replied indignantly why didnt he hang on to the stuff an take his lickin like a man  i dont think he knew it was to be given to us the fellow who did it had seen him leave the satchel with us once most likely an when there was danger of being robbed believed we could look out for it again its the last time such a thing will happen for im going to tell hazelton that i dont want to be mixed up in his business  at this point dan changed the subject of conversation by speculating upon the way in which sam met his death and this topic was such a mournful one that nothing else was thought of until the party returned to the tent once more  then came the question of how much money had been taken in during the day and after figuring up the amount he had spent teddy reckoned the cash on hand announcing the result as follows  countin what i paid out weve taken sixtyone dollars an seventy cents since morning it dont seem reasonable but a feller has to believe it after seein the money  youll have a much better trade tomorrow if it is fair and youre not recognized as one of the boys who helped to get hazeltons money away mr sweet said cheerily i predict that the receipts will figure up hard on to a hundred dollars  teddy gasped like a person who is suddenly submerged in cold water at the thought of earning so much and he realized that if such should be the case he would be able to assist his mother very materially  ill pay you tim before i get so dazzled as to forget it he said with a laugh and the clerk felt almost as rich as his employer when he received six dollars and seventeen cents for a days labor which came very near being sport  i only wish the fair held on for six months he said gleefully it seems too bad that there are only two days more for saturday never counts  you can go to the holtown fair and try it for yourself ill give you what stock we have left on hand  then ill do it tim replied emphatically and straightway he began to speculate as to the enormous amount of money he would earn  teddy tied his money in as compact a package as possible intending to give it to his mother when she should arrive on the morrow and mr sweet had advised that all hands turn in early when the flap was raised admitting a man who appeared to be covered with adhesive plaster and bandages  not until the newcomer had approached within the circle of light cast by the lantern did the occupants of the tent recognize him as the jewelry fakir and teddy cried in surprise  why mr hazelton we didnt expect to see you tonight  did you think i was dead  it looked as if you would be killed for a certainty and you did get pretty well done up  yes as the reports of the prize fights put it im badly disfigured but still in the ring was the money taken away all right  mr sweet has hidden it  and how did you come out of the scrape  if it hadnt been for the folks here we should have fared about the same as you did  im sorry my boy that you were dragged into the matter and it wouldnt have happened if id understood what kelly was going to do he knew you could be trusted and so turned it over but it was a mean situation to put you in  it wasnt pleasant for any of us mr sweet said but you can thank the boys for hanging on to the bag as if it had been their own most fellows of their age would have dropped it long before reaching here how did you get off  when the cry was raised that the money had gone the greater portion of the crowd started in pursuit an my partners and i managed to hold our own until a couple of constables came up they took charge of the team and gave us a chance to slip through the gates  what are you going to do now try it tomorrow  with this face well i should say not there is a fellow here who has bought my right to the privilege and i shall leave peach bottom early in the morning  thats about the best thing you can do and id advise that you dont spend much time out of doors until then  im not intending to it was necessary to come here and unless you object ill stay a while sos they will have time to sober up a bit  youre welcome to what weve got even if i dont like your way of doing business  i want to straighten matters with the boys and if they  hazelton did not finish the sentence for at that moment the canvas flap was pushed aside and a man entered with an unmistakable air of authority  hold on there friend mr sweet shouted we dont allow visitors at this time of night  i understand that but reckon you wont make any very big kick when i tell you that im one of the deputy sheriffs of this county and have come to serve a warrant  on whom  frank hazelton who claims to be an agent for a firm of jewelry manufacturers i believe youre the man he added approaching the disfigured fakir  youve got that part of it straight enough but what am i to be arrested for  you are suspected of being concerned in the burglary which was committed in this town last night  hazelton did not express nearly as much surprise as the boys who were really dazed by the announcement  so hargreaves has finally succeeded the fakir said half to himself and the officer replied quickly  this has nothing to do with old nathans affair although it does look as if the two burglaries were committed by the same person  hazelton remained silent several seconds during which time the sheriff waited patiently for him to say he was ready to go and then he asked  can i speak to one of these boys in private it has nothing to do with the charge but i want him to aid me in getting a good lawyer  i am sorry to say i must hear all that is talked about however trifling it may be  well i dont suppose it can make much difference and without rising from his seat hazelton continued teddy you believe i had nothing to do with this thing  i can tell what i heard those  dont tell anything yet a while at least not now i want you to do this for me after the fair closes go to that merchant who was so kind to you and explain to him the whole affair including your suspicions ask him to direct you to the best attorney in the county get all the money from mr sweet that may be needed and pay the lawyers fee send him to me as soon afterward as possible it is nothing more serious than lying in jail a few days and that wont be such a great hardship now ive got this face on me  shall i  there is no need of saying anything more hazelton interrupted fearing the boy was about to speak of the money the proprietor of the museum had hidden the merchant will understand and advise if you tell him everythingthat is i think he will but in case he refuses talk with some one else whom you can trust  as he finished speaking the fakir arose to his feet motioned to the officer and walked directly out of the tent without so much as bidding the others goodby  no one spoke until after he had been absent several minutes and then teddy asked with a longdrawn sigh  do you think he will come out all right mr sweet  thats hard to say for i dont know how much proof they may have against him its his business that has done a great deal toward inducing a magistrate to issue the warrant for once a man shows himself to be a swindler anything else can readily be believed of him  but what about his money dan asked  that is to be handed over to teddy  what have i got to do with it the boy asked in amazement  he told us that as plainly as he dared to talk before the officer and well count it out after which his stock in trade shall be buried for i want nothing to do with it     chapter xx  a proposition   teddy had the most decided objections to taking charge of hazeltons money and for several reasons in the first place he did not want to have the responsibility and again the fact of its being in his possession seemed to make him a partner in the business  mr sweet was determined however he insisted that hazelton had stated this as plainly as was possible under the circumstances and despite the boys protests immediately began the transfer  it shall be done in such a way that he cant accuse you of having taken any the proprietor said as he pulled the satchel from its hidingplace and broke the lock open with a hatchet well count it in the presence of all hands and each one shall give teddy a written statement of how much was found  an exclamation of surprise burst from tims lips as the receptacle was spread out on the ground for it appeared to be literally crammed with money  mr sweet separated the silver from the bank notes spreading both on the ground where they could be seen by every person present and then he counted them slowly taking care that the spectators were following his every movement  i make it three hundred an fortyeight dollars he announced if theres anybody here who aint sure thats right say so now  each member of the party had seen the amount counted and agreed with the result as declared by mr sweet who forthwith wrote the following       we the undersigned have seen a valise belonging to frank      hazelton broken open and certify that three hundred and      fortyeight dollars the only money found therein was handed      by jacob sweet to edward hargreaves in conformance with the      orders as we understood them from the said frank hazelton  now i want every one to sign that mr sweet said as he handed his leadpencil first to the barker and then teddy and i will have some proof of the amount  it required quite a while for all to conform with the wishes of the proprietor of the museum owing to the fact that several of the party were far from being skillful penmen but the task was finally accomplished and as the money was handed to teddy the latter asked ruefully  what shall i do with it im afraid of losing so much  thats a risk hazelton is bound to take fasten it in your clothes somehow an be sure you dont get into any row where it can be stolen  by the aid of many pins and with the assistance of both dan and tim teddy finally succeeded in disposing of the money about his person in such a way that it was not an unusual burden and then mr sweet insisted that all hands should try to get some rest in order to be fresh for the supposedly enormous amount of work to be done on the following day  teddy lay down on the ground with the others but it was many hours before his eyes were closed in slumber sams untimely death the guardianship of so much money and his own business affairs all served to keep his eyes open until nearly midnight when he fell into a sleep so troubled by frightful dreams that it was far from being restful  it seemed as if he had but just lost consciousness when mr sweet aroused him with the information that the big day of the fair was breaking  turn out an get your breakfast before sunrise for on this morning the early bird will pick up many a penny while the lazy ones are yet in bed an fakirs must make hay when the sun shines  teddy was on his feet in an instant and half an hour later having broken his fast he was at the booth with his clerk and dan the latter volunteering his assistance until the exhibition buildings should be opened  the proprietor of the museum had advised him well the receipts of the cane and knife boards were nearly five dollars before more than half of the booths were in condition for trade because the trains were running unusually early in order to accommodate the crowds and when dan felt obliged to leave business was so good that the proprietor clerk and assistant were all working industriously  if i can get off ill see you about noon dan said as he walked away and teddy replied  be sure to come for mother will be here and i want you to meet her  from that time until nine oclock the crowd increased in numbers and as teddy said during a lull in business it seemed as if the grounds were so full that no more could get in  when mrs hargreaves arrived her son could pay little attention to her but he proposed that she should amuse herself by looking at the different exhibits until nearly noon when he stated that he would take an hour off no matter how great a rush of customers might be around his booth  i earned sixty dollars yesterday an before night ill have a hundred more so theres little doubt that this weeks work as a fakir will enable me to pay all you owe on the house he whispered triumphantly and his mother walked away hardly daring to believe what teddy had told her  during the next hour it seemed as if a steady stream of money was flowing into the box and teddy was feeling confident that mr sweets prediction would prove to be correct when the one especial man he wanted to see came up with a folded paper in his hand  it was the merchant from waterville and he said as he handed the document to the boy  here is the receipted bill and i am more than glad to see you doing so well  can i talk with you for five minutes teddy asked hardly noticing the paper as he put it in his pocket  as long as you want to what is the matter running out of stock  oh no your clerk made such a good selection for me that ive got all i shall need this is something more important  then teddy hurriedly told the merchant how and where he had first met hazelton explained fully what the latters business was of the accusations made by uncle nathan what he and dan had heard and seen and concluded by repeating the request made by the fakir as he was led away to jail  are you willing to do anything for him the boy asked as his story was finished  i cant say it is a matter which appeals very strongly to my sympathies because of the swindles he perpetrated but if it is an unjust accusation something should be done to help him the one lawyer above all others who can be of assistance came over with me this morning i will see him and later in the day you shall have a call from us  before you go i wish you would take this money teddy said earnestly it is too large an amount for me to carry around and it will be safe with you  the merchant consented to take charge of hazeltons illgotten gains and teddy felt decidedly relieved when the cash was in anothers keeping and he had nothing of more value than an acknowledgment of the same to look after  in this matter i shall recognize no other order than yours the merchant said when the transaction was concluded and if the fakir should succeed in regaining his liberty he must come to you for the necessary document  i dont care how it is fixed so long as the money is not in my hands teddy replied in a tone of satisfaction and then he was called upon to attend to another rush of customers every one of whom was eager to be waited upon first  another hour passed and it was more evident than before that mr sweet had been correct when he stated the sum which should be taken in at the caneboard  teddy having breakfasted early was so hungry that he was on the point of going out to buy a supply of sandwiches when another visitor arrived  this was no less a personage than uncle nathan and he greeted his nephew with the utmost cordiality as he said  it looks to me as if you were makin a power of money here teddy i had no idea these triflin games would so attract the people  glad to be on pleasant terms with the old man once more teddy stated that they had been at work very hard since the first train arrived and concluded by saying  i took over sixty dollars yesterday and mr sweet says itll come near to a hundred today  sixty dollars the old man cried are you telling me the truth teddy hargreaves  of course i am an ive got the money in my pocket to prove it  why at this rate youll soon be a rich man for you dont seem to lose much of the stock  we buy a good many canes or knives back when a man puts a ring over one that he dont want we take it in and give him five more chances in that way there is very little goes out compared to the amount of money received  uncle nathan looked around at the players for a moment and then in a very confidential tone he whispered  see here teddy dont you want a partner ill pay for the stock you bought an  ive already done that out of yesterdays receipts teddy cried all the bills are settled an what comes in now is clear profit  but suppose i stood here an called up the people i know dont you think it would make business better  and if it should do you think we could attend to more customers every minute i talk with you is so much money lost for the other fellers cant pick up rings an make change fast enough  does that mean you dont want to go into business with me the old man asked angrily  no but it means that there would be no reason for doing such a thing ive got no debts an there are more customers than can be attended to on so small a board if youd made the proposition last monday it would have been different but now you cant expect me after taking all the risk to divide after the work has been done  who lent you the money to start teddy hargreaves uncle nathan cried his face growing purple with rage  you did  and how have you repaid such generosity how  i gave you three dollars for the use of fifteen two days was the prompt reply  but how have you repaid me for remaining inactive after my money was stolen  that was something which did not concern me therefore i had nothing to repay  it has a great deal to do with you as shall be shown before this day is ended unless you consent to take me as an equal partner in this enterprise your friend in crime has been arrested and i can swear that he turned over to you his illgotten gains one word from me at this time and you will be in the same prison  the fact of his having been threatened before made teddy bold and he said quietly  i wont pay you for holding your tongue uncle nathan so do whatever you choose  i will inform the authorities of all i have learned this morning and we shall see what the result will be the old man cried in a fury as he walked away and despite the bold bearing he had assumed teddy firmly believed that if the magistrate who issued the warrant for hazeltons arrest should know he was in possession of the fakirs money he would be brought before a bar of justice to explain matters     chapter xxi  with the burglars   it is well to look in upon sam during his enforced vigil of wednesday night  for at least two hours after the burglars had departed he thought of nothing save that he would soon be killed and perhaps devoured by wild animals then the pain in his jaw and limbs became so great owing to the tightly bound cords and his inability to move that his sufferings overcame the fear to a certain extent and he had not even the poor consolation of being able to give vent to an audible groan  notwithstanding the mental and bodily torture he did sleep occasionally during the night which appeared to be of twentyfour hours duration and never had he heard a sweeter sound than when his captors approached the hum of their voices reaching him before the noise of their footsteps  the burglars were laden with packages of what appeared to be merchandise and by the faint light of the coming day sam could see that they looked heated and tired  well hows our detective long jim asked with a laugh as he threw himself on the ground by the boys side has he decided to arrest his victims or will he give them a little show of leaving the country  as a matter of course sam could not make any reply but the expression in his eyes must have told of the suffering which he was forced to endure for phil said as he began to untie the rope holding the gag in place  theres no need of keepin him trussed up any longer an i reckon itll be a relief to have a chance to use his tongue once more  even when he was free the prisoner was unable to do more than roll upon his side his limbs were so stiff and cramped that he had no power over them and he could not have risen to his feet just at that moment if his life had depended upon it  jim seemed to think all this was very comical for he laughed loudly at the prisoners helplessness and suggested that if he intended to follow the business of a detective to practice remaining in one position in order to avoid such a complete collapse when fortune should again be so unkind to him as she had been in this particular case  when the burglars mirth finally ceased the two men lighted their pipes and proceeded to enjoy a season of repose after so much fatiguing work while sam was left to recover as best he might  fully half an hour elapsed before he succeeded in crawling to the brook where he quenched his thirst and then his one desire was for sleep  stretched out on the ground within a few feet of his captors the blissful unconsciousness of slumber came upon him and the sun was high in the heavens before he awoke  long jim was seated on the turf his back against a tree and a quantity of food spread out in front of him but phil was not in sight  well it strikes me youve been takin things mighty comfortable the man said with a grunt dont give yourself so far over to a life of pleasure as to forget that i promised to give you the greatest floggin of your life before we part for then you wont be so much surprised when it comes  the sight of the food caused sam to realize how very hungry he was and regardless of the subject introduced by jim he asked timidly  cant i have somethin to eat  i dont think you can my son in the first place you havent earned it an then again my partner an i may need all the grub weve got on hand  then as if reconsidering his determination the man selected two small crackers tossing them to sam as he cut a slice of boiled ham for himself  thats moren you deserve he said as the prisoner began to devour them eagerly so dont count on gettin another bite today  sam literally devoured the food and then went once more to the brook to wash down the dry repast  it seemed as if the crackers increased rather than satisfied his hunger and he watched jim eagerly as the latter finished a generous meal of meat cheese and hardboiled eggs  the burglar lighted his pipe and paid no attention to the hungry boy who now had ample time for reflection  he remembered that this was the important day of the fair and pictured to himself teddy and dan at their work enjoying themselves at the same time they were making money then he thought of what he might be doing if the detective fever had not taken so firm a hold upon him and despite all efforts to prevent it the tears coursed down his cheeks plowing wide furrows in the dirt with which his face was encrusted  this painful revery was not prolonged shortly before noon phil came into the hidingplace his face wearing an expression of entire satisfaction  i reckon we neednt be afraid any one will be here lookin for us now our detective has been drowned he exclaimed  whats up jim asked  hazelton the fakir has been arrested for the burglary at peach bottom an men are draggin the creek to find the body of the boy who worked for the davis boat company  sam actually shuddered at the thought that people were looking for his corpse and it gave him an uncanny feeling this idea that he was numbered with the dead  when was the arrest made jim asked  last night old nathan from the run says the fakir turned over a lot of money to the boy who was goin to buy your caneboard an it looks very much as if he would be locked up with the man whom people believe is his partner  nothin said about what the cubs saw at the barn  not a word  then we can count on havin the balance of this week in which to leave the country  as much as that if not more another load will get the stuff together but ive been thinkin wed better bury it here an not try to move a thing for a month or two  in that case wed be obliged to take that specimen along and jim pointed with a contemptuous gesture toward sam it wouldnt do to let go of him while there was a chance of his givin the game away  ill tend to that part of it an guarantee he wont be in condition to make us much trouble phil said so confidently that sam began to shake as with an ague fit for it seemed positive to him this burglar had decided upon his murder  if things were so comfortable like why dont you try to make a dollar for i reckon theres a big crowd at the fair  the grounds are packed but it aint exactly safe to do much business and phil told of the assault upon hazelton the whole boilin of em now think everybodys tryin to work some swindle he added an the consequence is that it would go hard with any feller who should slip up weve done enough for one week an id rather not take chances till this stuff is off our hands  do you count on goin back agin today  whats the use  i only asked for youre managin this whole thing now  my idea was to sneak up alone tonight take on the balance of the stuff an then lay low till saturday evenin when well make the big break  its goin to be mighty dull business sittin here with nothin to do jim replied in a tone of complaint  i dont see how we can fix it much quicker unless we go tomorrow while there are so many around  it was evident jim did not relish the idea of leaving everything to his companion and the latter so understood the expression on his friends face for he said angrily  youre cookin up some foolish scheme now an in spite of all i can do to prevent it well probably succeed in gettin nabbed before matters are arranged as they should be  oh youre too smart thats what ails you take all the soft snaps an leave me here to suck my thumbs without even the chance of movin around  if you think its sich a snap to row up there an back why dont you try your hand  thats jest what im willin to do anythings bettern stayin here an id like you to have a taste of it  sam who was expecting each moment to see the thieves come to blows understood at once that this arrangement did not please phil but he made no further objection than to say  if you wasnt so blamed careless id like to have you do a share of the hard work but its ten to one youll contrive to let everybody know you are there  i may not be so allfired smart as you think you are but i aint quite a fool why ive managed bigger things than this when you was around beggin for something to eat cause you was too chickenhearted to do this kind of work  youd better not say too much ive stuck by you when worse men would have a given you the cold shake an dont intend to take any guff especially since ive had sich hard work to get us out of the scrape you jumped into  i shall talk an if you dont want to listen there are plenty of places to lay off in outside of this  then the two thieves glared at each other several moments in silence and finally phil said with a mirthless laugh  we wont fight till this job is finished go an get the balance of the stuff an well make a break whenever you are ready but after one pull up an back therell be somebody besides me wholl think it hard work  then in order to heal the breach which had opened between them phil produced a suspicious looking black bottle from his pocket and handed it without comment to his partner  why didnt you bring this out before an then perhaps the business would a looked different jim growled as he drank long and deep but it wont make any difference about my goin up the creek  thats all right im satisfied  as the two men began to drink a great hope sprang up in sams heart that they would become so stupefied by the liquor that he might make his escape they had not thought it necessary to replace the bonds which had cost him so much suffering and at the first signs of unconsciousness he resolved to make one dash for liberty either by taking to the boat or attempting to make his way toward the fair grounds on that side of the creek  there was no such good fortune in store for the prisoner however the men drank themselves into the most friendly humor and then the supply of liquor was exhausted  after advising jim not to start until sunset phil lay down to sleep and sam thought it wise to feign slumber also lest the wakeful burglar should take it into his head to administer the promised flogging in order to pass the time more agreeably     chapter xxii  a disaster   teddy was decidedly uncomfortable in mind after uncle nathan departed by a combination of circumstances which could not well have been avoided he had been made to appear as a confederate of hazelton and if all the facts concerning his relations with the fakir should become known public opinion would he against him  he did not allow these forebodings to interfere with business however customers were plenty the nickels were coming in as rapidly as he could make change and tim had no hesitancy in saying that mr sweet had set their receipts of one day considerably too low  weve done twice as much as we did yesterday at this time an im countin on gettin twelve or fifteen dollars as my share of this days work  it looks as though you wouldnt be disappointed and thats a fact i wish i knew where we could get a few more canes for weve lost quite a good many this morning  theres no time to go to waterville but we can shorten the board by putting the uprights closer together an thatll make the layout look all right here comes your mother an if you want to go off with her ill promise to keep things goin here  that was exactly what teddy did want to do he felt that it was necessary she should know the true condition of affairs and he could not talk with her confidentially near the caneboard therefore when she came up he proposed that they walk toward the grand stand where the waterville band was doing its best to put in the shade the performances of the musicians from the run  you are looking worried teddy mrs hargreaves said as they moved away in the proposed direction what is the matter isnt business as good as you expected  it is a great deal better but uncle nathan has been here again and this time im afraid it is in his power to do me some harm  then teddy told his mother all that had happened explaining in detail the suspicions which might be aroused against him and she was quite as disturbed as he when the recital was finished  i will talk with him myself she said after some thought  dont do anything of the kind for then he will be worse than ever thinking he can frighten me into giving half of all i have made and that i wont do no matter how many warrants he gets out  but teddy dont you think  mrs hargreaves was interrupted by a cry from a halfintoxicated man who halted directly in front of the young fakir and shouted to some of his companions in the rear  here he is this is the sneak who helped take that jewelry swindlers money away i saw him then an can swear to his face  as a matter of course the tone as well as the words was sufficient to attract a crowd in this place where the throng was so dense that one could only make his way from one portion of the grounds to the other with the greatest difficulty and for a moment while teddy stood unable to decide what should be said or done every person looked at him threateningly  his partner has been arrested an well serve him in the same way the man continued as he advanced toward the boy  why do you want to talk to me like that teddy cried looking around in vain for a friend there are plenty of people here who know me for i live down at the run an never swindled anybody  thats a lie the man replied fiercely seizing the boy by the collar  its the truth mrs hargreaves cried im his mother and we have lived at the run ever since he was born deacon jones is our neighbor and he can answer for the truth of it  illustration i tell you to let go of him he is an acquaintance  ill see whether he can or not and the bully was about to drag teddy away aided by his halfintoxicated friend when a familiar voice from the outskirts of the crowd cried  hold on there what are you about  ive caught the feller what sneaked away the jewelry swindlers money an am goin to put him with his partner  you are going to take your hand off his collar this instant or get yourself into trouble and the merchant from waterville forced his way through the throng until he stood by teddys side  is that you mr reaves the bully asked in surprise well you dont want to interfere in this business for the boy is a bad one all the way through he was deep enough to get the best of us yesterday but he wont be so lucky now  i tell you to let go of him he is an acquaintance of mine whom i would trust a good deal sooner than some whom i see now  but you are makin a big mistake mr reaves for i saw him makin off with the valise where our money had been put  it was evident the bully had considerable respect for the merchant for he released his hold on teddy but was determined that the boys alleged character should be made known to all in the vicinity  i happen to know all about that affair mr reaves replied as he led teddy and his mother out of the throng and if you want the full particulars of the affair come to my store when you are more sober than now  a very large number of those present were acquainted with the merchant and for the majority his statement was sufficient to absolve teddy of wrongdoing but a few among whom were the intoxicated party and his friends vowed to sift the matter more thoroughly before the fair came to an end  mrs hargreaves was terribly excited and at once insisted that teddy should go home with her immediately regardless of how much money he was making but mr reaves said in a matteroffact tone as if such incidents were of everyday occurrence  it would be foolish for him to do that more especially since it would be a tacit acknowledgment of guilt and besides his business here is too valuable to be abandoned simply because a drunken rowdy chooses to make trouble i was on my way to see him i have found a lawyer who will undertake hazeltons case and he can at the same time give teddy some good advice  then the merchant introduced mr harvey as the most prominent attorney in the county and offering mrs hargreaves his arm added  we will go toward the caneboard and give them an opportunity to talk  there is a great deal to be said which cannot interest us and when they are done we shall be readily found  the widow could do no less than comply and as soon as they were comparatively alone the lawyer said to teddy  now i want you to begin and tell me the whole story from the time your money was stolen until this minute dont omit any particulars because you may chance to think they are not important but give every detail and thus i shall be made acquainted with your own case as well as that of hazelton  teddy obeyed this command to the letter he dwelt upon the most minute transaction or trifling movement at sufficient length to give the listener a clear idea of all that had happened and laid bare his own business affairs even to the extent of making the lawyer acquainted with the amount of receipts each day  i dont suppose it makes any difference what i think he said in conclusion but i am almost certain mr hazelton did not have anything to do with the robbery and even if i had suspected him that which dan and i heard while we were in the museum tent would have convinced me that the men whom we saw on the creek are the thieves  i believe as you do my boy and will send a man to the barn you speak of this very night although so much time has now elapsed that i have no hope of finding anything criminating however regardless of what may happen i believe we can show that the fakir was not the guilty party and to guard against a possible attack by your uncle it will be necessary to know exactly where we can get bail in case you should be arrested  then he can take me to jail teddy asked with quivering lips  if he proves what he claims to know there is no question that he will be able to cause your arrest but whether he can send you to prison is an entirely different matter i would now like to have a talk with mr reaves and shall see you before i leave the grounds do not be frightened but continue your business as usual and in a few moments i will give you full particulars as to what must be done in the event anything happens  teddy understood this to be an intimation that the interview was at an end and he started toward the caneboard the lawyer asking as he followed him  how shall i find your friend dan  go down to the exhibit of the j stevens arms and tool company in that yellowroofed building and you will see him showing model pocket rifles i will go with you if you think there is any chance of missing him  i can find him without difficulty do not leave your place of business until after i have seen you again  by this time they had arrived at the caneboard where mrs hargreaves looking decidedly relieved in mind was talking with mr reaves  the lawyer invited the merchant to accompany him and as the two walked away mrs hargreaves said  after talking with mr reaves i will take back what i proposed regarding taking you home it is not possible that anything but the right shall conquer in a case like this and i believe you will come out all right as a boy should who has always been as obedient and loving as you it is time for me to be going now but i will come back again in the morning  then take this money with you for i dont want any more in my pockets than is absolutely necessary and teddy counted out the contents of the box which served him as a safe  there was but little time for any lengthy leavetaking the customers were plenty tim and his assistant had been working several hours without cessation and teddy felt that it was his duty to relieve them  you can trust mr reaves whatever happens his mother said as she kissed him goodby and i shall be back tomorrow to learn if you are all right  dont worry about me teddy replied cheerily uncle nathan cant have everything his own way and he will soon discover that fact  it seemed to teddy that his mother had but just left him when a party of young men who had been talking in an apparently friendly manner directly in front of his place of business suddenly began to quarrel and before he was aware of what had happened his booth was overturned and a fierce battle being waged upon the ground which he fancied belonged temporarily to him because of the money paid to the managers of the fair as rent  canes knives rings and timbers were thrown violently about and while trying to save the property teddy and his clerk received several severe blows intended for some of the combatants     chapter xxiii  a second arrest   when the fight began teddys first thought was that it had been prearranged by some one who wanted to do him an injury without taking the chances of being arrested on a charge of malicious mischief  tim believed it to be a scheme for robbing the money box and while the combatants were struggling close around him he emptied the contents into his trousers pockets regardless of the chance blows received meanwhile  that both were wrong in their conjectures could be told later as the fight assumed the proportions of a small riot and the battle ground was soon shifted to an open space in front of the exhibition buildings  it was nothing more than a causeless row such as is often witnessed at fairs where intoxicating beverages are sold and which start from comparatively nothing illustrating the proverb see what a great fire a little spark can kindle  this is goin to knock our hundred dollars in the head tim said ruefully as he began to gather up the scattered stock when the combatants had surged to and fro until they were some distance from the wrecked caneboard itll take an hour to straighten things out an all that time will be the same as lost  it might be worse teddy replied philosophically and besides we shouldnt be able to do any business while that row is going on if you hadnt thought of the money it might have been lost for there were so many close around me that i couldnt get at the box  oh if you want to pick somethin good out of the trouble ill help this will give us a chance to shorten the board so the stock wont look quite so small  the young fakirs were ready for business in considerably less time than they had fancied would be the case nearly every one on the grounds was attracted by the riot and among those who came to the scene of the conflict was dan  instead of watching the struggling yelling throng he helped teddy and tim restore the booth to order and with such aid as the assistant could give the work was done very quickly  before the spectators had quieted down sufficiently to turn their attention to sport once more everything was ready for business and when the constables had taken the ringleaders in the fight away money began once more to roll into teddys coffers  before dan returned to his own work he heard of all that had occurred since morning and his comments on uncle nathans behavior were more forcible than polite  hes an old fool what oughter be rode on a rail till he cant see an im goin over to the run before i start for home jest to give the duffer a piece of my mind  i dont believe that would do either you or him any good teddy replied laughingly  i dont know what effect itll have on him but ill feel a mighty sight better he shows himself to be the worst swindler on the grounds when he tries to scare you into givin him half youve made for thats what his talk means  if he dont do any worse than threaten i wont say a word but hes so mad theres no knowin whatll happen  the lawyer will see that you pull through all right but if trouble should come be sure to send for me ill manage to get off somehow  with this assurance dan hurried back to the exhibition buildings and teddy was free to assist tim in waiting upon the customers  during the remainder of the afternoon the young fakirs had quite as much as they could attend to and then just as trade had so fallen off that tim could wait upon the customers alone with the aid of the assistant teddy received a call from mr harvey the lawyer  come here behind the booth where we can talk without being overheard he said peremptorily and the boy obeyed at once asking before the attorney had time to speak  do you know if uncle nathan is goin to do anything  he is certainly trying very hard and in case he should succeed in getting a warrant you will demand of the officer who serves it to be taken directly to deacon jones mr reaves and i have just had a talk with him and in our absence he will render such assistance as you may require  that sounds as if you believed uncle nathan would be able to do as he threatened  it is well to be prepared for any emergency since no man can say exactly what may happen during the night two constables will go to the barn on the marshes where you saw the burglars carry some of the goods although i do not think any good is liable to result from the visit for the men have probably been frightened away by this time enough may be found however to prove the truth of your story and that will be sufficient to give the thickheaded authorities an inkling that their judgment as to who the burglars are is not infallible  have you seen mr hazelton yet  no but i shall call on him before going home the best thing which could happen now for all concerned would be the arrest of the man you call long jim and to that end both you and dan must keep a sharp lookout for it is barely possible he may be bold enough to come on the grounds again  but what could we do in case we did see him  follow him quietly until you meet a constable and then insist that he be arrested for swindling you out of fifteen dollars there is not sufficient proof to connect him with the robbery here or at the run but i will take care that he is held long enough as a common swindler to enable us to sift the other matter let me see you said dan was with you at the time of the transaction in waterville  no it was poor sam and now that he is dead im the only one who saw long jim there do you know if they have found sams body  i think not men have been dragging the creek all day and the probabilities now are that some time will elapse before it can be recovered i want you to be very careful during the remainder of today and tonight go to the tent where you sleep before dark and do not venture outside under any provocation no matter what message may be brought  what do you mean teddy asked in surprise  nothing particular i am only taking precautions that is all i shall be here tomorrow and will see you then  the lawyer turned to go and had just passed out from behind the end of the booth when teddy seized his arm pulling him back very suddenly theres long jim now he whispered excitedly see that man over there by the striking machine  it was indeed the burglar whose partner had warned him against visiting the fair or even showing himself in the vicinity during the daytime it could be plainly seen that he was decidedly under the influence of liquor and he swaggered to and fro as if in his drunken brain was the idea that no one would dare cause him trouble  are you certain there is no mistake the lawyer asked as he watched the man  id be able to recognize him anywhere no matter how he was dressed an so would dan for sam an me pointed him out two or three times  then the hardest portion of our work is finished i shall have him arrested on the charge of swindling you and can arrange it without the formality of first getting a warrant it is now more necessary than ever that you should remain where i can find you readily at any hour of the day or night  except when i go for supper ill be here or in the tent teddy replied and then there was no further opportunity for conversation  long jim had started leisurely and on anything rather than a straight course toward the grand stand and mr harvey followed so near that he could have placed his hand on the burglars shoulder  teddy watched until the two were lost to view amid the throng and then said to himself with a sigh  ill bet the lawyer cant find a constable an that long jim gets clear somehow but what i dont understand is how he dares to come here  he would have run down to tell dan of the startling news had it not been for mr harveys injunction to remain in the places designated and he was so nervous that only with the greatest difficulty could he wait upon an impatient customer  an hour passed and nothing had been heard from either the lawyer or the burglar  the visitors remained later on this day than usual but the tardy ones were departing and it was with a decided sense of relief that teddy began to pack up his stock for the night dan arrived before the work was finished and his excitement was great when he learned of what had happened  cant we go somewhere to find out if the man was arrested he asked eagerly  i promised to be on hand in case the lawyer should want me  then well get the stuff to the tent go to supper an afterward ill snoop round to hear the news  all hands worked rapidly and in ten minutes the three boys were at the boardinghouse eating as if each moment were of the utmost importance when they overheard a conversation between two men at the next table which caused them no slight degree of relief and pleasure  who was that drunken fellow constable ford lugged off this evening one of the men asked and the other replied  a man who swindled a boy over at waterville out of fifteen dollars  i didnt see any boy in the crowd  he wasnt there lawyer harvey recognized the fellow and insisted on his arrest sayin that the squire already knew about the case  i thought at first it might be some one who had been robbing the stores around here  oh the burglar has been caught already an laid in jail since yesterday  but he was only arrested on suspicion  therell be proof enough to convict him i reckon an if there isnt he ought to be sent to jail for six months because of what he has done on the grounds  then the conversation was changed to a subject in which the boys had no interest and dan whispered to teddy  that settles long jim an now if your lawyer is as smart as he appears to be it wont take long to show that hazelton didnt have anything to do with the burglar tryin to get me in jail teddy replied with a sigh  of course it will things are turning out all right after all an if poor sam hadnt been drowned wed have a reglar celebration tonight     chapter xxiv  a third arrest   when the boys returned to the museum tent from supper they had a long and interesting story to tell mr sweet but to their surprise after the recital was concluded he said calmly  i knew all of that except about the burglars arrest  why how did you hear it dan asked  the lawyer an the merchant have been over here twice since noon pumpin me about hazelton an tryin to find out how you boys have behaved yourselves  why did they want to know anything about us teddy asked in surprise  sos to make sure your stories were straight when men like them take hold of a thing they dont want to run any chances of bein fooled what has been done about sam  dan could best answer this question and he replied  the body hasnt been found but i heard the manager of the davis boat companys exhibit say that he should keep men at the work of draggin the creek till the work was finished i cant get through my head how he happened to capsize the craft for she didnt seem to be cranky  that is something none of us will ever know mr sweet replied solemnly and then as if to change the mournful subject he asked how did business pan out today teddy  ill count up we must have come pretty near to what you predicted but we would have done a great deal better if it hadnt been for the big row that made us lose at least an hour to say nothin of havin six canes broken just when we needed every one in order to make a good show  then teddy and tim emptied the contents of their pockets on a piece of canvas and the other occupants of the tent waited patiently for the result to be announced  its ninetyfour dollars and fortyfive cents the former said after counting the money twice as if doubtful of the first result thats a big sum of money but theres no chance of a mistake  you can figure that the row cost you six dollars mr sweet replied puffing vigorously at his pipe i havent been tendin out on fairs these eight years without bein able to name the amount of such a business as yours  wed have had twentyfive more but for that row tim said decidedly  youre wrong there my boy and the proprietor of the museum wore an air of one who knows it all that is about as much as two boys can take in an you dont want to kick for ive seen lots of fakirs come on to a fair ground with a better caneboard than yours an not get expenses be thankful for what youve earned an hope that you can pay expenses tomorrow for there wont be any too much money floatin around after such a business as weve had today  im more than satisfied teddy replied as he set aside the amount due tim and the latter appeared to be more than contented with having earned nine dollars and fortyfour cents so easily  you can suck your thumbs from now out the barker said philosophically for the backbone of trade has been broken an the peach bottom fair is already numbered with the things of the past  dont you think well do anything more teddy asked  oh yes therell be a little to pick up until tomorrow night but it wont amount to anything near like what has already been done although itll be clear profit  since i am more than satisfied theres no chance of being disappointed teddy replied and at that moment the head of a stranger appeared between the flaps of canvas  is there a boy named teddy here the newcomer asked  well what do you want of him and mr sweet sprang to his feet as if anticipating trouble  nothing more than what hazelton wanted me to say was the reply as the stranger entered evidently thinking his search was at an end  and what is that the proprietor of the museum asked motioning teddy to remain silent  theres no need of all this secrecy with me for im hazeltons partner in everything except the giveaway game the stranger said with a laugh it appears a man has been arrested by a party whom this boy teddy knows and im to say that he is to come to jail very early tomorrow morning  even now mr sweets suspicions were not allayed and he asked cautiously  could you tell me what hes wanted for  lawyer harvey will be there and is going to talk with him where hazelton can hear what is said  is that all  everything and if you see the boy can i depend on your repeating the message  under the circumstances there can be no harm in taking every precaution the proprietor of the museum replied and if your errand is finished i may as well say that this is the boy teddy whom hazelton sent you to see  thats all right there was no need of pointing him out but since you have done so i simply want to ask if he can spare the time to do as hazelton and the lawyer wish  of course i can and now teddy spoke for himself say that if nothing happens ill be there  have you heard whether your uncle has succeeded in getting a warrant the stranger asked  no but mr harvey seemed to think he might be able to do so and i dont want to make any promises that cant be carried out  then ill count on your being there but since leaving the jail ive heard enough to warrant my advising you to remain under cover tonight  why  those fellows who started the fight when you got away with the money are swearing vengeance i dont think its likely theyll attack the tent for owing to the representations made by the lawyer therell be a big force of constables on duty tonight but if you should venture outside the grounds it might be impossible to keep any engagement in the future  i wasnt thinkin of leaving here teddy replied but the mere fact that he ought not do so made him feel very uncomfortable  i couldnt be in any worse fix if i had committed some big crime he said bitterly and it is tough to feel like a criminal when a fellow is only trying to earn honest money  it isnt the rule that honest people fare the best the stranger replied with a laugh but i hope youll come out on the top of the heap at all events my business here is finished and ill go  the folds of canvas dropped behind him and mr sweet said musingly  it beats all how you boys have succeeded in getting yourselves mixed up in this affair if i didnt know all the circumstances id say there must be some fire where there is so much smoke  the smoke isnt of our makin an teddys uncle can be blamed for the most of it dan said angrily i only wish he was here to know my opinion of him  are you talkin about me uncle nathan asked as he pushed aside the canvas and entered without so much as asking permission  thats exactly what i was doing dan replied without any show of fear an if youve been sneakin round to listen theres no need of my tellin over agin jest what i think of a man who tries to frighten an honest boy into givin up half of what he has made  an honest boy the old man repeated with a sneer and teddy whispered to his friend  dont say anything to make him angry for ill only get the worst of it  of course you will uncle nathan replied having overheard the words when an ungrateful wretch like you conspires to rob the hand that has fed him he must expect to get the worst of it  i never took from you the value of a cent teddy said stoutly and dan cried as he sprang to his feet  if there has been any attempt at robbery youre the guilty one for youve tried to steal half the money he made by threatening to have him arrested if he didnt divide his profits  that was only a business proposition the old man replied not in the least abashed and he has aided others in stealing from me  what do you want here mr sweet cried angrily this is my tent i have paid for the privilege of putting it upon these grounds and have the right to prevent such old hypocrites as you from entering without paying an admission  look out that you do not come within reach of the law uncle nathan replied threateningly stepping back quickly as if expecting an attack i am here armed with the right to take this boy and shall exercise it despite all that may be said come in mr officer  in response to this call a constable entered and teddys heart sank within him for he understood that the longdeferred arrest was about to be made  there is your prisoner the old man said vindictively as he pointed to the boy and the sooner you take him to jail where he belongs the sooner we shall be rid of a viper  illustration as the constable approached him teddy said i demand to be first taken to deacon jones  teddys grief and fear were so great that he could not speak and even dan appeared to have been made dumb by this show of authority but mr sweet was somewhat accustomed to such scenes and he demanded  show me the warrant i do not propose to let any one be taken out of my tent by such an old reprobate as that until i am satisfied it is done under the sanction of the law  convince yourself uncle nathan replied as the constable held out a folded document that will show under what authority we act  sweet read it carefully and handed it to the officer as he said to the old man  this shows that the constable has the right to take teddy to prison but as certain as there will be a sun in the sky tomorrow so certain will i aid him in making you suffer for doing this thing you know he had nothing to do with the burglary committed at your store and have only had this issued in the hope of defrauding him of what he has earned honestly  talk is cheap uncle nathan said impatiently officer take your prisoner away unless you count on stayin here all night  the short parley between the proprietor of the museum and the accuser gave teddy time to think of what the lawyer had said and he added as the constable approached him  i demand to be first carried to deacon jones  now what kind of a bee have you got in your bonnet the old man cried displaying both surprise and fear i say you are to go to jail an that settles it  if he wants to see the deacon im bound to take him there the constable said  whos been makin sich foolish talk to you uncle nathan screamed  lawyer harvey told me what the law was an i dont intend to get into any fuss by deprivin a prisoner of his rights was the stolid reply     chapter xxv  on bail   when uncle nathan learned that the celebrated lawyer had made preparations for this move on his part he was literally beside himself with rage and vowed that the warrant should be served and the prisoner taken to jail immediately or he would see to it that the constable was deprived of his commission without delay  ive served the warrant the man said quietly an now the prisoner is in my custody you have no more to say what shall be done with him than that goat so shut your mouth  ill shut yours so close it wont be opened again for a month the old man screamed do as i tell you or take the consequences  and im goin to give you the same advice mr sweet cried as he advanced toward uncle nathan threateningly now the boy has been arrested you are an intruder here an ill give you thirty seconds in which to get out after that well make an example of such a reprobate  ill go when i get ready an not a minute before lay a hand on me an ill have a warrant for you  if you can get it well and good i now order you out for the last time in thirty seconds ill guarantee you wont be in condition to walk  while their employer had been speaking the barker and the clown silently ranged themselves by his side ready for any commands which might be given and the infuriated old man had sufficient sense left to let him understand it would be unsafe to linger  ill serve you out before this thing is ended he cried shaking his fist in impotent rage as he went toward the flap and dan who could control himself no longer replied  youd better begin on me for im goin to tell this thing to everybody who comes to the fair tomorrow an from what ive heard it wouldnt take much coaxin to get the band from the run up here sos i could sing it youre havin a good time now but therell be a different side to the matter tomorrow  mr sweet had followed uncle nathan so closely literally turning him out that he could not reply while inside the canvas but once in the open air he made threats that would have frightened any one who did not know the motive by which they had been inspired  meanwhile the constable appeared disposed to take matters in the most comfortable manner he asked teddy why he wished to see deacon jones and the boy said  i dont know but mr harvey told me that if anything happened tonight i was to see the deacon  then well go there are you ready  teddy thought of his money and fearing lest it might be taken from him asked if he could hand something to mr sweet  i think not was the undecided reply the deacon will know an whatever he says ill stand by  dont bother about anything just now the proprietor of the museum said well all go with you an therell be plenty of time to make necessary arrangements before youre taken to jail  although the lawyer had assured him he could be involved in no serious trouble the mere fact that he was under arrest sufficed to make teddy wretched and like one under sentence of death he prepared to accompany the constable  dan and tim intended to join the party as was shown by their remaining very close to the prisoner and only the barker and the clown were left to care for the tent  uncle nathan was met on the outside and he immediately began to insist that the boy be taken to jail at once but the officer paid no attention to his ravings  if you dont hold your tongue ill knock the whole top of your head off mr sweet whispered brandishing his fists in the most threatening manner and the old man cried excitedly  mr officer i call upon you to bear witness that this man is threatening my life and insist that you protect me from insult  ive nothing to do with you the constable replied with a laugh the warrant has been served an all youve got to do is hold your horses till the case is called up in court  wait till i get home once more an then well see that hes got a good deal to do with the case tim cried ill spend every minute from then for a week tellin the folks that he only did this to make teddy give up half of what he made an itll be a pretty poor kind of a chump wholl do any more tradin at his store  uncle nathan stepped toward the boy who had spoken so boldly as if he would inflict the direst punishment then and there but he probably realized that this would prejudice his case and contented himself by saying  well see whether the people at the run will believe a couple of boys who have been in league with burglars for you mustnt forget tim jones that i have proof you helped teddy to carry away the burglars money  if itll do you any good ill own up to the fact now the boy replied it cant be so bad to do that as it is to arrest your own nephew because he wont give you half his money  dont say anything more teddy whispered to his friend its only makin matters worse an hes got the upper hand of us all jest now  i dont know whether he has or not the valiant tim replied but at the same time itll do him a world of good to let him hear the truth  at this point uncle nathan appeared to understand that he was not coming out victor in this battle of tongues and he wisely held his peace saying not another word until the little party arrived at the home of deacon jones  the manager of the fair was resting after a particularly hard days work more than one of the citizens of peach bottom had openly said he was responsible for the riot by allowing liquor to be sold on the grounds and his greeting of the visitors was not calculated to assure the frightened teddy  well what do you want he cried roughly as they entered his library if its anything concerning the fair i wont open my mouth a man cant be driven to death with work and then disturbed at all hours of the night simply to give the fools in this town a chance to make trouble  all i know about it is that i arrested this boy and he insisted on being brought to you saying it was lawyer harveys advice the constable began and the angry deacon immediately began to appear interested  is this your nephew nathan he asked of the old man who now had a smirk of confidence on his face  im sorry he is deacon an after i set him up in business he goes agin me by givin information to burglars who rob me  and you have had him arrested  i felt obliged to in the interest of society  thats a lie mr sweet interrupted angrily he tried to make the boy pay him half he earned on the fair grounds and has done this thing only because teddy refused  we wont go into the details of the case because i am not a magistrate the deacon replied with a majestic wave of the hand mr officer tell the squire that i am prepared to go bail to any amount and ask if the business cant be conducted here for im too tired to go out of doors unless it is absolutely necessary  what the old man screamed will you answer for that little villains appearance at court  thats what i said nathan this affair is none of my business other than i have stated but i must say you are goin a leetle too far not only in my opinion but in that of others an it may prove a costly job for somebody before its finished  the old man was literally speechless  he could not understand why the deacon should have turned against him so suddenly and the last words made him decidedly uneasy  he was not to be silenced without a struggle however after the first surprise had died away he said with a comical assumption of dignity  i will see whether im to be browbeaten in this manner the squire does not dare to release the boy on bail and i shall tell him so  with these words he left the house hurriedly and the constable said to the deacon  if you will write a line to the squire saying that youre ready to go bail i do not think there will be any necessity of troubling you again tonight  this suggestion was immediately acted upon and the weary manager of the fair penned the following words       i am ready to enter security to any amount for the appearance      at court of edward hargreaves and if you should not consider      my bond sufficient i am empowered to say that john reaves of      waterville will add his name therefore there can be no good      reason for committing him to jail since we are both      responsible for the prisoner until the bond can be executed                                                            a jones  having received this the constable departed with the prisoner and his friends and once on the outside he said confidently  the matter is settled no matter how much old nathan may rave both mr reaves an the deacon have got the squire by the nose and he must dance to their fiddlin  that this assertion was correct teddy realized a few moments later when he was ushered into the squires diningroom and the latter without paying the slightest attention to the prisoner said to the officer  i have just heard that you served the warrant i issued and then took the boy to deacon jones house is that correct  straight as a string squire lawyer harvey told him if anything happened to go there an i thought he had a right to look up bail before being lugged off to jail heres what the deacons got to say about it  the squire took the paper which the officer held out and after reading it said benignly  you were quite correct in doing what you did mr constable this is quite sufficient guarantee that he will be produced when wanted and you may let him go give me the papers and i will indorse them  after this formality had been gone through with the constable said to mr sweet  that settles the matter so far as teddy is concerned and with such men as the deacon mr reaves and lawyer harvey to back him i dont believe old nathan will make any too much out of this job  you are free to go where you please the squire added and the young fakir with his friends left the house wondering very much at the amount of influence which unsolicited had been exerted in teddys behalf  as for the boy himself he was far from feeling comfortable in mind unless the burglary could be brought home to long jim it did not seem possible that hazelton could be set free and this last was absolutely necessary in order to establish his own innocence  it was a great consolation for him to be with such good friends however and each in turn tried to cheer him but without success until mr sweet said  theres no question of your getting out of the scrape with flying colors and to celebrate im goin to give a regular dinner party to every decent fakir on the grounds come over boys an help me get ready business has been so good today that i can afford to indulge in a little extravagance     chapter xxvi  the fakirs party   the idea of a party in the museum tent where there would be no guests save fakirs struck teddy as being very comical and he laughed heartily despite the fact that he was still virtually a prisoner in the meshes of the law but at the same time he did not think mr sweet was really in earnest when he made the proposition  it was not many moments however before he understood that the party was to be given in the most elaborate manner possible  on arriving at the tent mr sweet sent the bouncer out with invitations to such of the fakirs as remained on the grounds all night or lived in the immediate vicinity and at the same time the clown started for the town in order to purchase refreshments  now you boys are to take right hold an help the best you know how the proprietor of the museum said as he pulled off his coat and vest preparatory to making ready for the feast if them as comes want to sit down it must be on the ground owing to the lack of chairs therefore it dont make much difference if the table is a trifle high  illustration we have only one knife said mr sweet to the amusement of the boys and it must serve for all hands  to the surprise of the boys he proceeded to convert the wagon into a festal board by first pulling it into the center of the tent and then removing the sides over the floor of this newspapers were spread and two plates three forks one knife and four tin dippers were placed on the impromptu cloth  the provisions will be cut ready for eating mr sweet explained so one knife must serve for all hands and it wont hurt any of the crowd if theyre obliged to take turns using the dippers  the clown returned before the guests began to assemble he brought cold sausage sliced ham cold fried potatoes sweet crackers cake pie and a quantity of lemons and sugar  contrary to his expectations mr sweet did not think this assortment sufficient for the kind of a dinner he proposed to give and the messenger was forced to return in search of cheese pickled pigs feet sardines and milk for the coffee  matters were in a decided state of confusion when the first of the guests arrived mr sweet not troubled by the absence of dishes had placed the various articles on the wagontable in the brown paper coverings as they had been received and it was upon his skill as a maker of coffee that he based his reputation as a host  therefore everything was neglected for this one important thing and the proprietor was standing over the oil stove with a look of grave responsibility on his face when the owner of the envelope game and his assistant arrived  the boys will take care of you he said hurriedly bending over the huge pot to inhale the odor in order to know exactly how the berries were adapting themselves to the infusion and much to his surprise teddy found himself the one especial feature of the party  all on the ground had evidently heard of his arrest for each new arrival asked concerning the events of the evening and what was more to the purpose so far as he was concerned all seemed to think his troubles were only temporary  youll come out of it all right the manager of the largest sandwich booth said confidently as he entered with his hat on one side of his head and a cigar held in his mouth at an angle of fortyfive degrees i heard of your uncle last year when he tried to make trouble for a friend of mine in the spittoon game an you can bet your bottom dollar that the people here are not going to take much stock in what he says  it seems they did so far as to issue a warrant for my arrest teddy replied with a mirthless smile  but that wont amount to anything i hear you have got john reaves as a friend an he comes pretty near runnin things to suit himself in peach bottom he helped my friend out of the scrape your uncle put him into an folks say theres no love lost between him an nathan hargreaves  i want to get out of my trouble simply on the ground that i am not guilty teddy replied if i am charged with aiding burglars theres precious little consolation in being set free simply because people do not like the man who made the charge  nobody believes you guilty and for the matter of that im certain hazelton had nothing to do with the job his game aint exactly square but he dont go around breaking into stores  teddy was on the point of telling that long jim had been arrested because of the burglaries committed but he remembered in time that this fact was as yet a secret and remained silent  the man who leased the only great african dodger was the next to arrive and he also seemed to think it necessary to condole with the young fakir in his troubles as did the remainder of the guests and by the time all were assembled teddy began to think his experience was only such as every other person in the tent had undergone at some time in his career  you see this is the way the matter stands the whip man said confidentially while mr sweet was bending all his energies to mixing the lemonade people think fakirs are the worst class of men in the world whereas if the matter was sifted right down theyd find the class as a whole was honest because they couldnt afford to be otherwise im not talking now about those who run strong games like hazelton but ourselves who do a legitimate business youve got canes an knives to sell while i deal in whips now all we want is a fair show to dispose of our goods an we know everything must be done on the square or theres bound to be trouble sooner or later consequently we keep straight an take all the abuse which those who have come to swindle the folks deserve why what i ask you would the managers of these fairs do if they couldnt get us to come up with our money for privileges they couldnt pay expenses an thats the whole amount of the story they run after us an yet when we come theres the same old howl about swindlers  the man talked until he was literally forced to stop for lack of breath and teddy had not so much as spoken but proved a good listener which was all his condoler appeared to expect of him  when the clown returned with the last installment of eatables there was nothing to prevent the assembled crowd from partaking of mr sweets hospitality the coffee was done to a turn the lemonade was neither too sour nor too sweet and the proprietor of the museum summoned his guests to the feast by saying  now turn to an fill yourselves up it aint often i do this sort of thing but somehow or other ive got a reglar admiration for our caneboard fakir an after comin out as he has tonight it seems only right we should kinder spread ourselves theres no liquor in the tent which is as it should be for im a temperance man an them as wants it can make hogs of themselves somewhere else take hold hearty an remember that this layout is in honor of them as did a good turn to the whole gang by savin the lives of the women what would likely have drowned if there hadnt been any fakirs in the country  this was an unusually long speech for the proprietor of the museum and when it was ended he set an example to his guests by attacking the eatables as if he had not indulged in a square meal since the fair was opened  each person present imitated him and tim whispered to teddy when his mouth was so full of cake that it was only with the greatest difficulty his words could be understood  this is what i call a great snap an when ive been fakin at the fairs long enough to get some money ahead ill give fellers like us a good chance to fill up the same as mr sweet has done  dan was equally enthusiastic in all his experience which extended over two years at the very least he declared that he had never seen so much done for a boy and concluded by saying  theres no question teddy but that youre a big gun here an ill advise you to keep right on in this business  ive had enough of it was the reply such times as these are very nice but think of what may happen when im brought up for trial who knows but uncle nathan can succeed in makin folks think im guilty of helpin the burglars an then whatll be the consequences  i know he cant do anything of the kind an thats enough was the confident reply but yet it failed to satisfy the boy who had been bound over to appear at court  the entire party appeared to be having the jolliest kind of a jolly time but ever before teddys mental vision came the picture of himself in prison and even the fact that long jim had been arrested failed to render him confident as to the final result  again and again was he called upon to reply as one after another wished him good luck in the case and the amount of lemonade which was consumed on each occasion caused the clown to make a third visit to the town in order to purchase the wherewithal to satisfy the demands of the guests  it was nearly midnight when the last of the revelers departed and the boys were called upon to help set the interior of the tent to rights  it hasnt been sich a bad time after all mr sweet said musingly as teddy and dan aided him in wheeling the wagon into place a man can remember an evening like this with pleasure when liquor has been kept out of the bill of fare an who shall say that were not better off than if our legs were so tangled as to make walking an impossibility  the barkers red nose was slightly elevated much as if its owner could explain why spirits were superior to lemonjuice and water but mr sweets question remained unanswered and the party set about making the final preparations for the night  poor sam aint here to be troubled by the goat so we can set him loose the proprietor of the museum said as he unfastened the rope from the neck of his pet  hell have a great time pickin up odds an ends between now an daylight an then feel so lazy that itll be hard work to make him do his tricks  do you suppose uncle nathan will be around in the morning teddy asked as he lay down by the side of dan and tim  not a bit of it he got sich a dose tonight that i dont count on seem him agin till this fair is ended an then im going to take a trip over to the run for the express purpose of givin him a piece of my mind  but suppose he should come what shall i say  pay no attention to the old fool an above all dont let him trap you into talking mr harvey will be here tomorrow an he can post you better than ever i could  dont fuss about the thing at all dan replied philosophically theres plenty here who know you hadnt anything to do with the burglaries an he wont have as much as a friend by the time the trial is ended  dan comes pretty nigh being right mr sweet added an now i want all hands to go to sleep for theres one more day of this fair an we need to be somewhere near fresh because tomorrow the dollars wont tumble without a good deal of coaxing goodnight     chapter xxvii  in hiding   that the incidents may be related as nearly as possible in the order of their occurrence it is time to return to the spot where the burglars are in hiding  it will be remembered that we last saw sam after phil had fallen asleep and he was feigning unconsciousness lest long jim having nothing else to do should take it into his ugly head to administer the promised flogging  although sams eyes were apparently closed he took good care to keep strict watch on the burglar but for what seemed a very long time he saw nothing to cause any apprehensions and was just on the point of going to sleep in reality when jim asked as he gave the boy a vicious kick on the side  wheres the grub  i dont know you put it away after finishing your dinner  oh i remember now and the burglar still considerably more than half stupefied by the amount of liquor he had drunk arose to his feet so unsteadily that it seemed as if only the lightest touch would be necessary to send him headlong  after a short search the man found that which he wanted and proceeded to make a hearty meal regardless of the hungry glances which the boy bestowed upon him  dont think im goin to give you any he said with a leer as he concluded the repast youre lucky to be alive an thats enough for sich a duffer ill put this stuff back an youll have every bone in your body broken if you so much as smell of it  sam made no reply he had already learned that there are very many times when silence is indeed golden  ive made up my mind to see what can be done at the fair jim said as he lighted his pipe with great deliberation phil thinks hes the only smart man in the world an its time to show him what a mistake hes been makin all his life why dont you say something he cried angrily as sam continued silent  i dont know what you want me to say if youre goin that settles it i shant be any better off  you can stake your life on that for while im a gentleman an behave myself as such phil is a reglar brute an will make things mighty uncomfortable for a sneak like you  sam thought but was very careful not to say that it was hardly possible for a boy to have a worse master than the alleged gentleman in front of him and the burglar continued as he arose to his feet  i want to leave without wakin phil but you must do it as soon as i push off from the shore for we dont intend to give you a chance of slipping away i shall watch mighty close an if he isnt on his feet before im a dozen yards out into the creek youll get a reminder from this and the man ostentatiously displayed a revolver  i dont count on runnin off sam replied thoroughly frightened by the threat i can stay here till you get ready to let me go because ive got to an im not sich a fool as to git into any worse scrape  now youre talkin somethin like sense an if you keep on in this way ill see to it that you dont have any harder time than a detective oughter expect phil will be on his ear when he knows ive gone an you must tell me all he says remember that if he isnt on his feet before ive got beyond range ill use your head for a target  with this threat the burglar staggered out of the thicket and sam began to speculate as to whether he should make one supreme effort to escape before his other captor awakened  a second glance at the weapon decided him in the negative however and he meekly stepped to the edge of the woods in order to obey the instructions given  despite jims apparent intoxication he watched the boy closely still holding the revolver ready for use and after pushing the boat into the stream he cried  now go ahead an let me see him in about two minutes or ill fill you full of bullets  if sam had been a brave boy he would have made a dash for liberty at this moment but he was in nearly every sense of the word a coward and obeyed the order literally  whos there phil asked angrily as the boy shook him vigorously  jim told me to make you get up or hed shoot sam replied meekly  make me get up what time is it  i dont know but it doesnt seem to be more than three oclock  wheres jim  jest startin for the fair grounds an if you dont show yourself pretty soon hes sure to shoot me  there wouldnt be any particular harm in that for you deserve it but it cant be possible the fool is goin to show himself in daylight when more than one is lookin for him  thats what he said and sam fearing lest the halfdrunken burglar would begin his pistol practice seated himself behind the largest tree that might protect him from the bullets  now that phil was awake he did not lose any further time in talking but ran out to where he could command a view of the creek and once more sam had an opportunity for escape which he did not dare to embrace  come back here an dont make a fool of yourself jims partner cried angrily as he saw the man pulling leisurely from the bank  whats crawlin on you dont i know my business  not if you count on goin up there before dark  thats jest what i intend to do so dont screech so much  come back i tell you or itll be all up for both of us  ive been in this business long enough to know it was the reply as jim continued to row increasing each instant the distance between himself and the shore  now dont spoil a good thing phil said pleadingly and understanding that this conversation might be continued for a short time sam plucked up sufficient courage to make an attack upon the provisions  he took from the general store a large piece of cheese some crackers and as much meat as he believed would suffice to make a hearty meal after which he hid the lot near the tree behind which he was hiding  then he crept back to his former position and listened to the conversation between his captors  phil alternately coaxed and threatened his partner but all to no purpose as could be told by the tones of the latters voice while he pulled up stream and the baffled burglar returned to the camping place absolutely furious with rage  this comes of my bein so foolish as to bring that fool liquor he said half to himself its mighty lucky he didnt know i had more than one bottle  then he took from one of his pockets a second flask refreshing himself with a portion of the contents before asking  what did he say to you  nothin except that he was goin up to the fair sam replied timidly  but what made him tell you to waken me  i spose that was so i couldnt have a chance to run away  what else did he say  that i was to tell him jest how you took his leavin  well if hes lucky enough to get back tell him i said he was the biggest fool that ever walked on two legs them chums of yourn are sure to spot him an its ten to one hes pinched before sunset  sam did not understand what the man meant by the term pinched but under the circumstances he hardly thought it safe to inquire and the angry burglar continued  well make ready to get out of this if he isnt back by daylight an while theres nothin else to do youd better put that stuff under ground for theres no knowin now when well be able to take it away  the spade was near at hand ready for use and while phil alternately smoked and drank from the bottle sam set about burying the plunder  this man was quite as hard a taskmaster as the one who had just departed and the boy was forced to work as he had probably never done before until sufficient of an excavation had been made to conceal the goods  under the direction of the burglar sam covered the different packages with earth did his best to hide all traces of his work and when it was so dark that he could no longer see to move about was allowed to rest  during this time phil had been drinking and smoking with the result that he could hardly speak plainly when the task was accomplished and so intoxicated did he appear to be that sam thought it safe to eat the food he had concealed  keep on talkin sos ill know where you are or on goes the ropes an gag again phil cried and the boy obeyed repeating over and over the same words in order to satisfy his suspicious captor  after eating a hearty meal sam succeeded in mustering sufficient courage to admit of his thinking about attempting to escape  from the manner in which the burglar spoke he knew it could not be very much longer before the man would be so completely under the influence of liquor as to render him helpless and he said to himself  if i could get the rope around his hands an legs id soon be out of this place  whats that you are saying phil cried angrily  nothin i was only doin as you told me talkin sos youd know where i was  ill save all that trouble and the man lurched to his feet as he picked up the rope  please dont tie me agin sam pleaded i wont try to git away  ill go bail that you dont after im through with you put out your hands  phil was yet capable of mischief even though his brain was clouded and sam did not dare to disobey  he suffered himself to be tied without making any remonstrance and as the burglar staggered to his former resting place the boy tested the bonds  previously he had been lashed in such a manner that it was impossible to move hand or foot but now he soon realized that he could do both and the happy thought came that he might free himself with but little difficulty if a favorable opportunity for escape should present itself  now youre fixed phil said half to himself an i may as well take things comfortable till were certain that that fool of a jim is settled  are you goin to leave here tonight sam asked more for the purpose of learning how far the man was on the road to intoxication than for information  if he aint here by twelve oclock well know the jig is up an skip sos to be out of the way before any one can come sneakin around for the stuff  then if jim isnt back by that time an he keeps on drinkin ill take all the chances sam said to himself and from that instant he strained every nerve to learn how nearly the burglar had succeeded in making a worse brute of himself than nature intended     chapter xxviii  a failure   tired though teddy was a long time elapsed after the conclusion of the fakirs feast before he could close his eyes in slumber  now that the excitement of the party had died away the fact that he was a prisoner suffered to remain outside the prison only because men of wealth were willing to guarantee he would respond to the call of the court came into his mind even more vividly than at the time of the arrest and despite all the words of cheer which had been spoken he really began to believe uncle nathan could show plausible proof of his guilt  under almost any other circumstances he would have speculated upon what should be done with the large amount of money he had already earned and rejoiced at the thought that he could supply his mother with what she might need for the present at all events  the profits of the cane and knife boards were hardly thought of on this night while the one painful fact stood before him so prominently and menacingly  his companions had been asleep many hours before slumber visited his eyelids and so heavy was his heart even while in dreamland that he awoke with the first dawn of day and aroused the others to the last days work they would be called upon to do at the peach bottom fair during the present season  why is it that you have turned out so early mr sweet asked in a sleepy tone rising to his feet as the only effectual method of driving the drowsiness from his eyelids  i shant feel much like sleeping till i know how the case is coming out teddy replied sadly  there is no need to worry with such friends as you have got put it right out of your mind until business closes tonight for theres a big pile of work to be done if you expect to make much money  i wish i could teddy said with a longdrawn sigh as he aroused tim and dan  half an hour later the three boys were eating what it was believed would be their last meal in the very unsatisfactory boardinghouse and teddys place of business was the first opened on that morning  there were no more early visitors but the fakirs who had been present at the feast on the evening previous gathered around all appearing very eager to spend money and trade was as lively as it had been on any other morning  the crowd bought rings and threw them recklessly until each man had spent considerably more than a dollar when teddy suddenly realized that this sudden passion for canes only arose from a desire to aid him then he said decidedly  theres no need of you fellows doin this i know you want to see me out of the scrape but ive made a lot of money already an dont want to take yours  you cant have too much my boy one of them said with a laugh and we want to see you go away with a pile trade has been boomin for all hands an it would be kinder rough if we couldnt have a little fun now the fair is the same as over  this did not satisfy teddy and he continued to expostulate against the generosity but all to no purpose the fakirs played until a sufficient number of visitors had arrived to warrant their opening the other booths and then tim and teddy were left alone dan having started for the exhibition building some time previous  until ten oclock there was no more than work enough to keep one boy moderately busy and teddy experienced a deep sense of relief as mr harvey came up to the stand with a cheery good morning  i hear that your uncle nathan succeeded in carrying out his threat the visitor said as if speaking about what was a very trifling matter  yes sir an do you think he can send me to prison  not a bit of it you are under bail and i venture to predict that he will not carry it to court for he has sufficient sense to know it may prove a very expensive job we sent our men to the barn on the marshes last night  what did you find teddy asked eagerly  more than i expected there were no goods in the building but some have evidently been buried there and this fact together with the evidence that boats have been drawn up on the shore recently proves your story as to what was seen when you boys followed the two men to be correct  the other fellow has run away i suppose  i think he is yet in the immediate vicinity otherwise jim would be willing to talk  have you seen him since he was arrested  i have just come from the jail i told him of the evidence we already had to connect him with the burglary and that we should push him hard in the interest of you and hazelton he understands that there is an opportunity to turn states witness but he absolutely refuses to speak on any subject therefore i fancy his partner has not yet got away  then there has been no good done in arresting him teddy said mournfully  that is where you are making a mistake i have prepared an affidavit for you and dan to swear to and shall endeavor to have a warrant issued at once charging him with burglary so he cant give us the slip in case he gets clear in the matter of swindling  do you want dan an i now  yes go after him i will only keep you ten or fifteen minutes  teddy turned to go toward the exhibition buildings but halted an instant to ask  have you seen my uncle this morning  no but i shall do so later in the day and after we have a little conversation i do not think he will be so eager to see you in prison  the lawyers confident manner had very much to do with taking the load of sorrow from teddys mind and he looked almost cheerful as he asked of the manager of the stevens exhibit that dan be allowed to accompany him explaining the reason for making the request  of course he can go the gentleman replied readily trade wont be so good today but that he can be spared as well as not and even if it was rushing he should have permission to leave  when the boys were at the caneboard once more mr harvey hurried them away to the magistrates office and there a long document was read which described in detail all they had seen on the day when sam first gave an exhibition of his skill as a detective  they marveled not a little that the lawyer should have remembered so well every trifling incident nothing however apparently unimportant had escaped him and as dan said  it is written down better than if he had really been with us  this document was sworn to and signed by both after which mr harvey told them that they might return to work adding as he turned to teddy  the man who has been arrested on your complaint will have a hearing tomorrow and it is absolutely necessary you should be at this office as early as nine oclock i dont know whether dan will be allowed to tell what he has heard sam say regarding the matter but he had better come with you  ill be on hand the young fakir replied do you know when im to be tried  that case wont come up for some time in view of the evidence your lawyer is collecting the squire said  dont worry about it for i think the real burglars will soon be caught  an does mr hazelton have to stay in jail all the time  there is no other way out of it since he hasnt got friends who can go bail for him  teddy wanted very much to ask permission to see the prisoner but inasmuch as he was accused of being equally guilty with the fakir it hardly seemed just the proper thing to make the request and he left the office followed by dan who said as they gained the open air  you aint goin to have half so much trouble as you think teddy anybody can see that even the squire is on your side although he did issue the warrant an the proof must be mighty strong to make any of em believe you did anything against the old miser but this keeps us here on the grounds another day doesnt it  yes an if mr sweet packs up his tent tonight well have to hunt for a place to sleep in the village  that dont worry me very much ive made a good weeks work out of the fair an can afford to spend a little money  i shall pay all the bills of course teddy replied quickly it wouldnt be any moren right because you are goin to stay to help me  dan was quite positive he would pay his own bills and his companion equally certain he should not but there was little chance for discussion since they had arrived opposite the grand stand by this time and were hailed by deacon jones who looked as if he considered himself the one important personage on the grounds as he said  i want both of you boys to be here at exactly two oclock dont fail to come no matter how much business you may have on hand  whats the matter teddy asked immediately thinking some new trouble threatened him  there will be plenty of time for explanation after you get here was the mysterious reply and then the deacon signified that the interview was at an end by turning to speak with some gentlemen who had been watching the boys closely  what do you suppose is up now teddy asked with a sigh and dan replied mournfully  im sure i dont know but in his own mind he was convinced that the deacon intended to surrender the boy whose surety he had appeared willing to become on the evening previous  teddy was so disturbed by dismal forebodings that dan was very careful to hide his suspicions since it could do only harm to discuss them and the two parted feeling as if uncle nathan had outwitted mr harvey  on retuning to his place of business teddy did not have the heart to wait upon the customers and after telling tim what had been said to him he added  i cant work its no use to try there must have been something new come up an i wont be able to show that im innocent of robbing the store  dan could give him no consolation for he also felt that matters were approaching a dangerous crisis and he simply said  loaf around old fellow an ill look out for the work here try to put it out of your mind for things wont be made better by worryin over em  just at this moment teddys mother arrived she had heard all the particulars concerning the arrest and subsequent release therefore began at once to sympathize with her son  then you know what the deacon is goin to do teddy asked  this was something of which mrs hargreaves was ignorant but upon being told appeared even more distressed than her son thus increasing instead of lightening his troubles     chapter xxix  the testimonial   it was impossible for teddy to follow tims advice to loaf around  his heart was so full of sorrow that his greatest desire was to go where those who might believe he had been a partner of the burglars could not see him but since that was impossible if he intended to obey the deacons injunctions and present himself at the grand stand at the specified time the next best thing was to remain behind the booth where his mother tried her best to cheer him  it cant be possible that anything to your disadvantage has occurred teddy she said as she held his hand for mutual sympathy mr reaves would have sent me word at once if that had happened  perhaps he doesnt know about it uncle nathan may have been talking with the deacon again an turned him against me  i dont believe it would be possible for him to do such a thing his reputation is not so good that people could put faith in all he says more especially in regard to this case  then if he didnt do it some one else has an that makes it all the worse teddy replied as he tried to force back the tears  at this moment the sorrowing ones were startled by hearing the voice of the man whom they had every reason to call their enemy and an instant later uncle nathan stood before them  well he said in what sounded more like a snarl than anything else you see the old skinflint did jest what he promised an hell see to it that the deacon dont stay on your bail very long unless i get my rights  what do you mean by your rights mrs hargreaves asked  i lent this ungrateful boy the money to start him in a business where hes made more in a week than i ever could in a year then he helped people to rob me an after all that i made what any man must call a fair offer see how much ive lost by him an then think of my offerin to straighten everything out by goin in as his partner  why didnt you do this before the fair opened  i couldnt tell how it would turn out the old man began and then realizing that he was admitting something to his discredit he added quickly i mean i hadnt lost my money then an never suspected how he would wrong me  it seemed as if these last words drove teddy to desperation and he no longerremembered the respect due to age  look here he cried angrily rising and standing directly in front of uncle nathan if you believe im a burglar you cant want to be my partner it was only after the fact of my having made considerable money was known that you offered any trade if the venture had been a losing one you are the last person who would have taken hold of it now im under arrest on a charge made by you who know i am innocent an well put an end to all this talk dont come where my mother and i am do the very worst you can an some day ill have my innings  you threaten eh  thats exactly what im doing i have leased this piece of ground until tomorrow and warn you that itll be mighty uncomfortable if you show your nose here again go now an go quick  thats right teddy tim shouted in a tone of delight from the opposite side of the booth give it to him hot an ill do my share if you dont want to tackle the job till after the trial say the word an ill sail in for it gives me a pain to see him around  teddy made no reply to this generous offer but uncle nathan stepped back very quickly as if fearing an immediate attack  you wont be so bold tomorrow he snarled shaking his fist in impotent rage and then he disappeared from view amid the crowd that had begun to gather  both teddy and his clerk thought it very singular that business should be so good on this day when the majority of the other fakirs were comparatively idle and also in view of what had been said against the proprietor of the caneboard  yet the people gathered around by scores all intent on patronizing the boys and at the same time embracing every opportunity to display their good will  teddy and his mother remained partially screened from the gaze of the curious until nearly two oclock when dan looking decidedly troubled arrived  i suppose weve got to go to the grand stand an find out what the deacon wants he said mournfully my boss told me that we must be there on time an we might as well start  i want to have it over as soon as possible teddy replied nothin that comes can be any worse than waitin here thinkin of what may happen  the two boys walked either side of mrs hargreaves as they went to meet the deacon and it seemed very much as if the majority of the people present knew what was about to occur for the sadvisaged party was followed by crowds of the visitors as they walked steadily onward  it was exactly two oclock when they arrived at the stairway leading to the grand stand and there they were met by the leader of the band from the run who said with a mysterious manner as he opened a gate leading to the track in front of the judges stand  you are to come this way  wheres the deacon teddy asked  waiting for you  without further explanation the musician led the three to a spot where all could see them and to the intense surprise of the sorrowfullooking party the throng assembled on the benches greeted them with the most hearty applause  you are to come with me mrs hargreaves the conductor said as he escorted her to one of the front seats and teddy and dan stood as if stupefied gazing in dismay at the sea of faces in front of them  before the boys had sufficiently recovered from their bewilderment to be able to speculate upon what was to happen deacon jones came down the steps until he reached a place where all could see him and there began a speech which caused at least two of that assemblage to gaze at him in openmouthed astonishment  the manager of the fair did not intend to neglect any opportunity of making himself conspicuous and he delivered an eloquent address looking first at the boys and then at the audience which cannot be given here because of lack of space  he first explained to the spectators that teddy had taken upon himself the business of fakir simply that he might aid his widowed mother then he detailed the loss of the fifteen dollars and finally broached the one important matter that of the scene on the creek when the three women were rescued from drowning  by this time the cheeks of teddy and dan were flaming red and if he had been charging them with the most atrocious crimes they could not have looked more guilty or uncomfortable  as you all know he said in conclusion we have met here to see bravery and a spirit of selfsacrifice rewarded on behalf of the ladies whose lives were saved by these little heroes i am about to present edward hargreaves and daniel summers with one hundred dollars each in addition to that amount the managers of the fair and several gentlemen who do not care to have their names made public have made up a purse of one hundred and eighty dollars to be divided equally between them it is most gratifying to me that i have been selected as the instrument through whom this testimonial is presented and in behalf of my brother officers as well as myself i will state that these brave boys have the freedom of the grounds whenever the peach bottom fair is open  as he concluded the deacon walked with a majestic bearing down to the bewildered boys presented each with a wellfilled pocketbook and then waved his hand as a signal for the band every member of which did his best to make the music heard above the rounds of applause intended for the blushing fakirs  in the meantime the people came down from the benches to congratulate the lifesavers and for fully an hour the two were forced to remain there listening to words of praise which they felt were not warranted by their exploit on the creek  among the most welcome of these enthusiastic visitors was jacob sweet and he said heartily  i heard of this little performance jest in time to get here before that longwinded speech was begun but what pleases me the most is that i was ahead of the whole gang an started our little blowout when it wasnt known you had so many friends ill see you tonight of course an i must go now for the bouncer has been around tellin that youve been sleepin in my tent an i count on a good payin crowd this afternoon  it was considerably past three oclock when the boys and mrs hargreaves returned to the caneboard looking very much different than when they left it and tim cried as they came up  ive heard all about it an what i want to know is where was old nathan while that speechifyin was goin on  i saw him when we first arrived mrs hargreaves replied but he left a few moments later although i have no doubt that he remained where he could hear all that was said without being seen  thats where he was wise it wouldnt be very pleasant for him to show himself now cause everybody is down on him after what the deacon said  dan was obliged to return to his duties and he whispered to teddy before leaving  i tell you what it is old feller this has been a reglar puddin for us an id give a good deal to see another jest like it  youre all right but i expect after this uncle nathan will be so mad hell make me a pile of trouble  dont worry about that his claws are cut now ill be back in time to go to supper  when he departed teddy had an opportunity to say a few words to his mother before she returned home on the stage which was advertised to leave at four oclock and while he did this all thought of being under arrest was put far from his mind because of the joy at what he was now able to perform  never mind what happens to me he whispered ive now got nearly money enough to pay off all we owe an it has been earned honestly too although i believe they paid a big price for what dan an i did on the creek  im thinking more of the praise you earned than the money teddy it was very sweet to hear the deacon say so much to you before all those people  then both of us will be awfully jolly tonight an tomorrow ill be home an bring dan with me  invite him to stay just as long as he wishes and i will have a nice supper ready when the last stage arrives  teddy gave his mother nearly all the money he had including the testimonial and as she walked away he said to tim  im willin to be arrested an put into jail a good many days for the sake of being able to help her as i can do now     chapter xxx  the trial   it was only natural that both teddy and dan should feel highly elated after this public expression of admiration which culminated in the presentation of the purse but they immediately returned to attend to their several duties when the ceremonies were finished  dan went back to the exhibition as if he had done nothing worth remembering and in less than half an hour from the time the deacon concluded his flowery speech it would have required a very ardent student of humanity to discover that anything out of the natural course of events had taken place  at the caneboard teddy waited upon his customers as before and without the slightest sign of having been honored by the magnates of the fair while dan fired at the target as if he had been a boy with no other claim upon the publics attention than his ability to hit a mark  yet it must be confessed that both experienced a very pleasing sense of having satisfied the public and each in his own peculiar way knew he had risen a little above the average boy  there can be no question that any one placed in the same position must have felt gratified by the many expressions of friendship and goodwill with which these two were literally overwhelmed and it would have been more than could be expected of human nature had they remained unmoved under the extravagant flattery which was showered upon them immediately after the close of deacon jones speech  although there was not quite as much money flowing into the box as on the day previous teddy was more than pleased with the receipts because every penny seemed to express just such an amount of goodwill  until nearly nightfall he remained at the booth answering questions upon the same subject till it seemed to have been worn threadbare and then however great his desire to earn money he felt a positive sense of relief that his connection with the peach bottom fair had finally come to an end  this is the last time you an i will pack up the stuff he said to tim as they put into condition for removal the cane and knife boards i promised to give you all that was left and youre more than welcome to it  but you surely dont mean to give me the whole lot tim cried in surprise  thats exactly what im going to do and i sincerely hope when you make a stand youll meet with the same good friends i have here  i cant take these things unless youll allow me to pay something toward what they cost  look here tim teddy said earnestly you have shown yourself to be a friend of mine an every cent that has come in here youve accounted for now whatever may happen im through bein a fakir but if you want to follow the business i can only hope youll come out all right well carry this to mr sweets tent an ill only be so much the better pleased and in case you dont im bound to help you in every way besides i promised to pay a certain percentage on the profits that is yet to be settled  it never will be tim replied in the most decided tone if i take these goods ive got more than a fair share an wont listen to anything else  very well well leave it that way you now own everything an i owe you lots of goodwill  on this basis the remnants of the two boards were packed up for removal and when they were about to take the goods to mr sweets tent dan arrived  how much business did you do today he asked  teddy delayed sufficiently long to count the receipts and then replied  fortyone dollars and fifteen cents that gives tim foureleven an i get more than would have been the case but for the testimonial this afternoon the folks crowded around to see me rather than to get the canes an so business has picked up better than any one expected  it dont make any difference how the money came in so long as you have got it dan replied philosophically an now the question is what are we to do for supper since we paid our bill at the boardinghouse this afternoon  have you got any idea  of course or else i wouldnt have asked the question lets invite mr sweet the bouncer and the clown to some restaurant down town an try to give them as good a time as we had last night  this proposition met with teddys approval and the party was made up as he suggested the cost being divided between the two boys who had been the recipients of the public testimonial  not until a late hour in the evening did these festivities come to an end and then the party retired to the museum tent where they remained undisturbed until the present season of the peach bottom fair had come to an end  it was an unusually late hour for fakirs to arise when mr sweet awakened the boys as he said  turn out now lads an get your stuff ready for removal im sorry to part company but we cant stay here forever an the museum must be forty miles the other side of waterville by monday morning  dan had completed and been paid for his work with the stevens company therefore he had nothing to do teddy no longer claimed any interest in the canes and knives left over from the weeks work consequently he was free to go where he pleased and tim had his goods in such a condition that they could be removed at any moment which prevented him from feeling any anxiety regarding the future  thus it was that all three of the boys were at liberty to assist the proprietor of the museum and this they did with a will until the arrival of lawyer harvey caused them to think of what had almost been forgotten in the bustle and confusion of breaking camp  we are due at the squires office at nine oclock and it is time you boys were getting over that way he said briskly our case wont come up today but it has been decided to give hazelton a hearing and i am very much afraid hes going to get the worst of it  what do you mean teddy asked anxiously  well you see i have not been able to get any information in addition to what you boys furnished and there seems little doubt that the squire must perforce bind him over for trial the fact that he has deliberately swindled so many people will work against him and we can do very little to save him  what will be the result of his being bound over teddy asked  he must remain in jail unless he can get bail until next fall  but that in itself will be a terrible punishment  true yet it cannot be avoided if he had worked honestly the case would be different but now he will be fortunate even to get out in the fall  yet uncle nathan says i am equally guilty  we can easily show you had nothing to do with the robbery and that is our only care this morning  what about long jim  he remains silent refusing to answer the simplest questions and unless he speaks hazelton must be bound over the squire can pursue no other course  believing as they did that hazelton was innocent of the charge upon which he had been arrested both teddy and dan felt it was a great hardship for the fakir to remain so long in prison but since it was beyond their power to give him any relief neither expressed an opinion other than has been recorded  mr harvey had come for them to accompany him to the squires office and since there was nothing to detain them they set out after first bidding mr sweet a cordial goodby for he had announced his intention of leaving peach bottom on the noon train  i shall see one or both of you at some time in the future he said with considerable feeling an therell be no complaint to make if i never fall in with worse boys  the bouncer and the clown also had something to say in the form of an adieu and when the boys left the proprietor of the alleged wonderful museum it was like parting with an old friend for he had shown himself to be a very present help in time of trouble  tim did not propose to start for the run until his companions had concluded their business his goods were packed ready for removal and there was nothing better for him to do than accompany them to the courtroom where it seemed as if all they might say would result only in a long term of imprisonment for hazelton before he could be tried on the baseless charge brought against him simply because of the disreputable business in which he was engaged  mr harvey had little or nothing to say during the walk to the squires office and arriving there the jewelry fakir was seen looking thoroughly despondent  can i speak with him teddy asked the lawyer what do you want to say  nothing in particular except to tell him how bad i feel because we could do nothing to clear him  very well but do not talk long for it may prejudice your own case the people whom he has swindled are here to see that some form of punishment is meted out to him and it can do you no good to be seen acting as a consoler  this possibility troubled teddy very little since he was confident of his own innocence and he approached the prisoner as he said  i wish i could do something mr hazelton to prove you as innocent as i believe you to be  theres no need of that my boy ive put you in a hole already and youve done more for me than some others who call themselves friends  i know it was long jim who committed the burglary but how can it be proven now  there was only one way and that was to catch the real thieves with their plunder mr harvey tells me his attempt was a failure an it wouldnt surprise me if i was not only remanded for trial but received a sentence for something of which i am absolutely innocent i dont profess to be very good my boy as you may understand after seeing me work on the fair grounds but i never yet descended to do such things as i am charged with now  i am certain of that and teddy pressed the prisoners hand in token of friendship and only wish it was possible to aid you  you have already done more than my partners did was the grateful reply and then further conversation was prevented as the squire called the assembly to order  it was not a regular court of law but one would have thought it the most dignified judicial body in the country had he seen the air with which the squire took his seat at the head of the long table as he called the case  that settles hazelton dan whispered as teddy left the prisoner and rejoined his friends somebody has got to suffer in order to make the law come out square an hes the feller whatll have to stand the brunt of everything     chapter xxxi  an arrival   lawyer harvey did not neglect anything which might work to the advantage of his client but in the face of the evidence his efforts appeared to be in vain  uncle nathan who arrived just as the case was called swore to the fact that hazelton had been in his store on the sunday afternoon prior to the robbery and that he had told the prisoner of his keeping large amounts of money in the building because of the difficulty and expense of sending the cash to the waterville bank  he also testified that hazelton seemed unusually interested in everything pertaining to the store and asked many questions relative to his the witness habits such as the time when business usually began how late he remained in the building at night as well as several other things which now seemed as if the information had been sought simply for the purpose of knowing when would be the safest time to commit the crime  how much did you lose mr harvey asked  i dont know for certain but i stand willin to give fifty dollars if the goods can be recovered an if my nephew would tell all he knows  that will do mr hargreaves the lawyer said sharply teddy is not under examination and until he is we do not care to hear your opinion concerning him  i reckon i can tell what i want to cant i squire  you must confine yourself to this particular case as to whether there is sufficient evidence to bind the prisoner over does not concern the charge against your nephew at least not to the extent of your telling what you think  i thought perhaps if he heard me say id give fifty dollars to know where the goods were an knew id swear to it he might confess for he has shown himself to be powerful fond of a dollar  that appears to be a peculiarity of some of his relatives mr harvey said dryly and at this remark the spectators laughed heartily while the old man growled  i didnt come here to be told that i was a miser but it seems even men who call themselves gentlemen think sich things are all right  if you have no other evidence to give we will not detain you the lawyer said sharply and as uncle nathan returned to his chair near the door the proprietor of the hotel at the run was called upon to testify  what he said was in favor of the prisoner rather than otherwise  he swore to the fact that the prisoner spent the night on which the burglary was committed at his house that he pretended to retire at an early hour and started for peach bottom on the first stage  under mr harveys skillful crossexamination the landlord admitted that unless a man got out of the window he could not have left the house without the knowledge of the watchman who kept the keys and remained in the office all night it was also shown that hazelton brought and carried away with him so far as was known at the hotel nothing but a small traveling satchel  then several people from the run were called to prove that the fakir was really in the town on this particular sunday and the driver of the stage testified that the prisoner rode with him the entire distance to peach bottom the landlord of the hotel where hazelton boarded during the fair week or so much of it as he was at liberty swore to the fact that the prisoner had never brought any quantity of baggage to his house and appeared to be very regular in his habits so far as he the landlord knew the fakir remained in his room nearly all the time except while on the exhibition grounds  this ended the testimony and mr harvey argued that there was really no evidence to connect the prisoner with the crime  that he conducted a game which could hardly be called honest is admitted he said but it has nothing to do with the case prejudice should not be allowed to take the place of facts and i insist that my client be released  i reckon theres sufficient ground for suspicion the squire replied an i dont see any other way out of it a jury must decide an i shall hold him in the sum of three thousand  at this moment the dignity of the court received a severe shock as a most unseemly disturbance suddenly occurred at the door and the squire paused to learn who was so bold as to disturb the representative of the law at the very instant when he was delivering an opinion  its nobody but a boy uncle nathan replied as he held the door firmly closed while the wouldbe visitor kicked so vigorously as to threaten the destruction of the panels  bring him in here an well see whether such a row can be kicked up in a court of law with impunity  better let me throw him into the street uncle nathan snarled  mr constable bring that boy before me the squire said sternly and an instant later to the consternation of all those who had seen him the boy who was supposed to have been drowned two days before entered looking decidedly the worse for having existed so long without water and soap  why its sam an he aint dead teddy cried as he rose to his feet  of course i aint but it wouldnt been many days before i turned into a corpse if i hadnt got away from them thieves the amateur detective replied  who are you an what do you want here the squire asked sternly as he rapped on the table for the spectators to remain silent  why im sam balderston the feller who come to the fair to work for the davis boat an oar company of detroit an if what long jim told me was true folks have been tryin to find me in the creek  this is the boy who was reported to have been drowned on the day when those lads here the lawyer pointed to teddy and dan claim to have seen two men carrying goods into an old barn on the marshes i fancy he can give us information relative to the true burglars  you bet i can and now that he was the central figure in the scene all sams old assurance returned if you mean the fellers what broke into teddys uncles store i can flash one of them up the other come to the fair an didnt get back so phil thought he was arrested  who do you mean by the other fellow mr harvey asked  why long jim the same man what swindled teddy out of his fifteen dollars at waterville  have you been with him since your disappearance  most of the time he hung around an then agin phil was there  who is phil  long jims partner theyve got a slat of stuff what has been stole round here an i know where all of it is  tell the squire the whole story  this was sams opportunity and in order to cover himself with glory he slaughtered the truth in the most shocking manner  well he said in a consequential way when dan an me an teddy saw the thieves carryin stuff down to that old barn i wanted to rush in an arrest both but the other fellows was scared an come ashore to talk with hazelton sos hed tell em what to do then i jes made up my mind to carry on the job myself an went back  where the squire asked  to the barn to get the stuff while i was diggin it up the men come back an the minute they saw who was on their trail they got frightened  and who was on their trail the squire interrupted  why me of course they rushed in an i had the awfullest row but it was two to one an so i got the worst of it they had to work mighty hard before gettin me tired an then all the stuff was dug up an put in the boat my craft was upset an sent adrift sos to make it look as if i was dead an we went down the creek six or seven miles where we hid in the woods phil came back here after more goods what had been stolen an they was goin to skip the country when there was a big row an long jim allowed hed come to the fair once more phil was mad an got pretty drunk an after that i had my innings i turned to an lashed him up sames id been but we had an awful fight it takes moren one man to git away with me  where is this fellow now the squire interrupted again  down the creek tied up sos he cant hardly breathe an he must be pretty near sober by this time  if he was very drunk i do not understand how he could have fought so hard  well he did but i got the best of him an whats more i know where all the stuff thats been stolen is hid  mr constable bring into court the prisoner who is charged with swindling and let us see if this extraordinary boy can identify him the squire said with an unusual amount of dignity  if its long jim you bet i can sam said as he turned toward the spectators that they might have a good opportunity of seeing such a wonderful detective as he claimed to be  teddy and dan could hardly control their impatience to speak privately with sam as a matter of course they understood that he was embellishing the story and both were eager to make him tell the exact truth  just at that moment however sam had no time to spend on ordinary boys he had come out of a bad scrape with apparently flying colors and intended to enjoy his triumph to the utmost before sinking back to his rightful plane  the jail was near at hand and sam had not exhibited himself as much as he desired when long jim was brought in  on seeing the boy the burglar gave a start of surprise and allowed the incriminating question to escape his lips  has phil been pinched too  i took care of that business an well bring him in some time today say what about that awful lickin you was goin to give me  ill cut your throat before this job is finished was the angry reply and there was no longer any necessity of asking sam if he recognized the prisoner  you say you can show us the stolen goods and the other burglar is where the officers can get him mr harvey asked  thats just what i can do sam replied proudly  then you will have earned fifty dollars for mr hargreaves has promised even sworn that he will pay that amount for the return of his property mr harvey continued  he might as well give me the money now for im ready to turn the stuff up an when theres more big detective work to be done come to me  i dont know about payin any reward till im certain the little villain isnt one of the thieves himself an is doin this to swindle me uncle nathan cried quickly  he shall have the reward if the story is true the squire replied you cant go back on what youve sworn to an must pay up mr constable get two or three men an go with this boy dont lose sight of him for a minute until he has given all the information in his power     chapter xxxii  in conclusion   sam was led away before either teddy or dan could speak privately with him but they went at once to congratulate hazelton on his apparently happy escape and in response to mr harveys request the squire said  the prisoner can remain here or in your custody until the party returns if the boy has told the truth there is nothing for me to do but discharge him and i am really glad that he has come out so fortunately  dont think ill ever forget what youve done for me hazelton whispered to teddy  but it isnt me at all sam seems to have fixed everything  ive got an idea that i know pretty near the truth of the whole story never mind how he tells it at all events weve no reason to complain for if the goods and the other burglar are found we are out of our trouble your uncles charges cant hold after that  it was as teddy now realized for the first time a happy conclusion to the troubles of both and his heart was lighter than it had been at any time since the accusation was made  there was no question that those who had gone with sam would be absent several hours and the little party in the courtroom had more time at their disposal than could well be occupied by the discussion of their affairs  after the different phases of the case had been gone over in detail hazelton asked teddy  how did you come out at the fair  i havent figured up but i know ive made a good deal an it must be almost enough countin the money deacon jones gave us to pay the debt on the place  until this moment teddy had had so much on his mind that the principal cause of his turning fakir was absent from his mind but now with nothing better to do he began to count up the weeks work announcing the result a few moments later by saying  i took in two hundred an fiftytwo dollars an fifty cents during the week out of that must come the money i lost at waterville what i paid uncle nathan the privilege the money i paid mr reaves for the stock tims wages an my board that leaves one hundred an fortyfive dollars an ninetyeight cents with what came in from the testimonial ill have enough to pay off the debt on the house an pretty near eight dollars for myself which is what i call a big weeks work  im glad you have made it hazelton replied heartily there is a little matter between you an i which yet remains to be settled and when that has been done you should be considerably better off  i dont want you to do a thing teddy said quickly so many people have helped me since the fair opened that it seems as if i was nothing more or less than a beggar  you come very far from deserving that title the fakir replied and then the entrance of mr reaves interrupted the conversation after talking with the lawyer the merchant said to teddy  i am more than pleased to learn that you will be freed from all your troubles in a short time next week i shall be in need of a clerk and if you wish to take the situation it shall be left open until you are ready to go to work the wages are six dollars a week for the first year with an increase as soon as you can earn it and i will really be pleased to have you in my employ  id like to come teddy replied but it dont seem just right to leave mother  there is no necessity of doing so you can ride back and forth on the stage unless your mother should decide as i think she will eventually to make her home in waterville  if she approves of the plan ill come to work next week  make it two weeks so that therell be plenty of time to arrange matters and i will expect you the merchant replied in a tone which showed that he was more than satisfied with the arrangement i only came over to see if you needed any assistance but mr harvey says youll soon be free from the charge your uncle made therefore i will go back at once  about an hour after the merchant departed sam and the constables returned with phil and the stolen goods  the amateur detective was in the best possible spirits and now that the burglar had been apprehended through his assistance the boy felt absolutely certain he was the greatest detective in the country  as a matter of course there was nothing the squire could do save discharge hazelton from custody and after mr harvey had given his word that he would take care sam should appear when wanted as a witness the boy rejoined his friends saying as he did so  if you fellers had done as i wanted youd be way up now the same as i am of course i dont blame you for being afraid but when you go out on such work the only way is to hold on  i wonder how long youd have held on if the men hadnt made you stay with them dan asked  who told you that sam said if i staid it was because i knowed it wouldnt be long until i got the upper hand of the gang an ive done it  before the party separated and while uncle nathan was identifying the goods which had been stolen from him mr harvey insisted that the reward should be paid and although it was very much like drawing a tooth the old man was finally induced to make his word good  its a pile of money but i earned it sam said as he tucked uncle nathans grudgingly bestowed cash in his trousers pocket there aint many round this part of the country who could have done what i did an its only right detectives should be well paid  then with many protestations of friendship the lawyer started for home after returning to hazelton the money which teddy had given mr reaves for safekeeping and the fakir said as he walked out of the courtroom with the four boys  now i want you to come with me until my business is settled and then ill shake the dust of peach bottom from my feet in the shortest possible time  not understanding what he meant the boys accompanied him to the nearest jewelry store and there he bought two silver watches which he presented to teddy and dan as he said  these are only to remind you that i am grateful for what has been done it isnt much of a present but it will suffice to show im not ungrateful some time in the future i may meet you again and then the full debt shall be paid if im solid enough to do it  he was gone almost before the astonished boys could thank him and with his departure this story should properly be concluded since teddy has made his last appearance as a fakir  a few more words and the end shall be written  sam still believing himself especially designed for a detective is yet displaying his style as an oarsman in the employ of the davis boat and oar company and he believes he has guessed the weight of the yacht which is so soon to be given away  dan accepted an offer from mr reaves last week and he and teddy are learning the same business both looking forward to the time when they shall own a store equally as large  uncle nathan is still at the run but his trade has decreased very materially and hazelton has not been seen since the day he left peach bottom but it is quite possible that when the fair opens this season all the fakirs may again meet the country boy who made such a successful venture at the country fair                                   the end    illustration 53 state st                19 kilby st
