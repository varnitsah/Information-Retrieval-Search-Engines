57212154	eric brighteyes  by h rider haggard     dedication  madam  you have graciously conveyed to me the intelligence that during the weary weeks spent far from his homein alternate hope and fear in suffering and mortal triala prince whose memory all men must reverence the emperor frederick found pleasure in the reading of my stories that they interested and fascinated him  while the world was watching daily at the bedside of your majestys imperial husband while many were endeavouring to learn courage in our supremest need from the spectacle of that heroic patience a distant writer little knew that it had been his fortune to bring to such a sufferer an hours forgetfulness of sorrow and pain  this knowledge to an author is far dearer than any praise and it is in gratitude that with your majestys permission i venture to dedicate to you the tale of eric brighteyes  the late emperor at heart a lover of peace though by duty a soldier of soldiers might perhaps have cared to interest himself in a warrior of long ago a hero of our northern stock whose days were spent in strife and whose latest desire was rest but it may not be like the golden eric of this saga and after a nobler fashion he has passed through the hundred gates into the valhalla of renown  to you then madam i dedicate this book a token however slight and unworthy of profound respect and sympathy  i am madam  your majestys most obedient servant  h rider haggard  november 17 1889  to him victoria empress frederick of germany     introduction  eric brighteyes is a romance founded on the icelandic sagas what is a saga is it a fable or a true story the answer is not altogether simple for such sagas as those of burnt njal and grettir the strong partake both of truth and fiction historians dispute as to the proportions this was the manner of the sagas growth in the early days of the iceland communitythat republic of aristocratssay between the dates 900 and 1100 of our era a quarrel would arise between two great families as in the case of the njal saga its cause probably was the ill doings of some noble woman this quarrel would lead to manslaughter then blood called for blood and a vendetta was set on foot that ended only with the death by violence of a majority of the actors in the drama and of large numbers of their adherents in the course of the feud men of heroic strength and mould would come to the front and perform deeds worthy of the iron age which bore them women also would help to fashion the tale for good or ill according to their natural gifts and characters at last the tragedy was covered up by death and time leaving only a few dinted shields and haunted cairns to tell of those who had played its leading parts  but its fame lived on in the minds of men from generation to generation skalds wandered through the winter snows much as homer may have wandered in his day across the grecian vales and mountains to find a welcome at every stead because of the oldtime story they had to tell here night after night they would sit in the ingle and while away the weariness of the dayless dark with histories of the times when men carried their lives in their hands and thought them well lost if there might be a song in the ears of folk to come to alter the tale was one of the greatest of crimes the skald must repeat it as it came to him but by degrees undoubtedly the sagas did suffer alteration the facts remained the same indeed but around them gathered a mist of miraculous occurrences and legends to take a single instance the account of the burning of bergthorsknoll in the njal saga is not only a piece of descriptive writing that for vivid simple force and insight is scarcely to be matched out of homer and the bible it is also obviously true we feel as we read that no man could have invented that story though some great skald threw it into shape that the tale is true the writer of eric can testify for saga in hand he has followed every act of the drama on its very site there he who digs beneath the surface of the lonely mound that looks across plain and sea to westman isles may still find traces of the burning and see what appears to be the black sand with which the hands of bergthora and her women strewed the earthen floor some nine hundred years ago and even the greasy and clotted remains of the whey that they threw upon the flame to quench it he may discover the places where fosi drew up his men where skarphedinn died singing while his legs were burnt from off him where kari leapt from the flaming ruin and the dell in which he laid down to restat every step in short the truth of the narrative becomes more obvious and yet the tale has been added to for unless we may believe that some human beings are gifted with second sight we cannot accept as true the prophetic vision that came to runolf thorsteins son or that of njal who on the evening of the onslaught like theoclymenus in the odyssey saw the whole board and the meats upon it one gore of blood  thus in the norse romance now offered to the reader the tale of eric and his deeds would be true but the dream of asmund the witchcraft of swanhild the incident of the speaking head and the visions of eric and skallagrim would owe their origin to the imagination of successive generations of skalds and finally in the fifteenth or sixteenth century the story would have been written down with all its supernatural additions  the tendency of the human mindand more especially of the norse mindis to supply uncommon and extraordinary reasons for actions and facts that are to be amply accounted for by the working of natural forces swanhild would have needed no familiar to instruct her in her evil schemes eric would have wanted no lovedraught to bring about his overthrow our common experience of mankind as it is in opposition to mankind as we fable it to be is sufficient to teach us that the passion of one and the human weakness of the other would suffice to these ends the natural magic the beauty and inherent power of such a woman as swanhild are things more forceful than any spell magicians have invented or any demon they are supposed to have summoned to their aid but no saga would be complete without the intervention of such extraneous forces the need of them was always felt in order to throw up the acts of heroes and heroines and to invest their persons with an added importance even homer felt this need and did not scruple to introduce not only second sight but gods and goddesses and to bring their supernatural agency to bear directly on the personages of his chant and that far more freely than any norse sagaman a word may be added in explanation of the appearances of familiars in the shapes of animals an instance of which will be found in this story it was believed in iceland as now by the finns and eskimo that the passions and desires of sorcerers took visible form in such creatures as wolves or rats these were called sendings and there are many allusions to them in the sagas  another peculiarity that may be briefly alluded to as eminently characteristic of the sagas is their fatefulness as we read we seem to hear the voice of doom speaking continually things will happen as they are fated that is the keynote of them all the norse mind had little belief in free will less even than we have today men and women were born with certain characters and tendencies given to them in order that their lives should run in appointed channels and their acts bring about an appointed end they do not these things of their own desire though their desires prompt them to the deeds they do them because they must the norns as they name fate have mapped out their path long and long ago their feet are set therein and they must tread it to the end such was the conclusion of our scandinavian ancestorsa belief forced upon them by their intense realisation of the futility of human hopes and schemings of the terror and the tragedy of life the vanity of its desires and the untravelled gloom or sleep dreamless or dreamfull which lies beyond its end  though the sagas are entrancing both as examples of literature of which there is but little in the world and because of their living interest they are scarcely known to the englishspeaking public this is easy to account for it is hard to persuade the nineteenth century world to interest itself in people who lived and events that happened a thousand years ago moreover the sagas are undoubtedly difficult reading the archaic nature of the work even in a translation the multitude of its actors the norse sagamans habit of interweaving endless sideplots and the persistence with which he introduces the genealogy and adventures of the ancestors of every unimportant character are none of them to the taste of the modern reader  eric brighteyes therefore is clipped of these peculiarities and to some extent is cast in the form of the romance of our own day archaisms being avoided as much as possible the author will be gratified should he succeed in exciting interest in the troubled lives of our norse forefathers and still more so if his difficult experiment brings readers to the sagasto the prose epics of our own race too ample too prolix too crowded with detail they cannot indeed vie in art with the epics of greece but in their pictures of life simple and heroic they fall beneath no literature in the world save the iliad and the odyssey alone      eric brighteyes     i  how asmund the priest found groa the witch  there lived a man in the south before thangbrand wilibalds son preached the white christ in iceland he was named eric brighteyes thorgrimurs son and in those days there was no man like him for strength beauty and daring for in all these things he was the first but he was not the first in goodluck  two women lived in the south not far from where the westman islands stand above the sea gudruda the fair was the name of the one and swanhild called the fatherless groas daughter was the other they were halfsisters and there were none like them in those days for they were the fairest of all women though they had nothing in common except their blood and hate  now of eric brighteyes of gudruda the fair and of swanhild the fatherless there is a tale to tell  these two fair women saw the light in the selfsame hour but eric brighteyes was their elder by five years the father of eric was thorgrimur irontoe he had been a mighty man but in fighting with a baresark who fell upon him as he came up from sowing his wheat his foot was hewn from him so that afterwards he went upon a wooden leg shod with iron still he slew the baresark standing on one leg and leaning against a rock and for that deed people honoured him much thorgrimur was a wealthy yeoman slow to wrath just and rich in friends somewhat late in life he took to wife saevuna thorods daughter she was the best of women strong in mind and secondsighted and she could cover herself in her hair but these two never loved each other overmuch and they had but one child eric who was born when saevuna was well on in years        the baresarks were men on whom a passing fury of battle      came they were usually outlawed  the father of gudruda was asmund asmundson the priest of middalhof he was the wisest and the wealthiest of all men who lived in the south of iceland in those days owning many farms and also two ships of merchandise and one long ship of war and having much money out at interest he had won his wealth by vikings work robbing the english coasts and black tales were told of his doings in his youth on the sea for he was a redhand viking asmund was a handsome man with blue eyes and a large beard and moreover was very skilled in matters of law he loved money much and was feared of all still he had many friends for as he aged he grew more kindly he had in marriage gudruda the daughter of björn who was very sweet and kindly of nature so that they called her gudruda the gentle of this marriage there were two children björn and gudruda the fair but björn grew up like his father in youth strong and hard and greedy of gain while except for her wonderful beauty gudruda was her mothers child alone  the mother of swanhild the fatherless was groa the witch she was a finn and it is told of her that the ship on which she sailed trying to run under the lee of the westman isles in a great gale from the northeast was dashed to pieces on a rock and all those on board of her were caught in the net of ran and drowned except groa herself who was saved by her magic art this at the least is true that as asmund the priest rode down by the seashore on the morning after the gale seeking for some strayed horses he found a beautiful woman who wore a purple cloak and a great girdle of gold seated on a rock combing her black hair and singing the while and at her feet washing to and fro in a pool was a dead man he asked whence she came and she answered  out of the swans bath   the norse goddess of the sea  next he asked her where were her kin but pointing to the dead man she said that this alone was left of them  who was the man then said asmund the priest  she laughed again and sang this song       groa sails up from the swans bath      death gods grip the dead mans hand      look where lies her luckless husband      bolder seaking neer swung sword      asmund keep the kirtlewearer      for last night the norns were crying      and groa thought they told of thee      yea told of thee and babes unborn  how knowest thou my name asked asmund  the seamews cried it as the ship sank thine and othersand they shall be heard in story  then that is the best of luck quoth asmund but i think that thou art fey        ie subject to supernatural presentiments generally      connected with approaching doom  ay she answered fey and fair  true enough thou art fair what shall we do with this dead man  leave him in the arms of ran so may all husbands lie  they spoke no more with her at that time seeing that she was a witchwoman but asmund took her up to middalhof and gave her a farm and she lived there alone and he profited much by her wisdom   now it chanced that gudruda the gentle was with child and when her time came she gave a daughter birtha very fair girl with dark eyes on the same day groa the witchwoman brought forth a girlchild and men wondered who was its father for groa was no mans wife it was womens talk that asmund the priest was the father of this child also but when he heard it he was angry and said that no witchwoman should bear a bairn of his howsoever fair she was nevertheless it was still said that the child was his and it is certain that he loved it as a man loves his own but of all things this is the hardest to know when groa was questioned she laughed darkly as was her fashion and said that she knew nothing of it never having seen the face of the childs father who rose out of the sea at night and for this cause some thought him to have been a wizard or the wraith of her dead husband but others said that groa lied as many women have done on such matters but of all this talk the child alone remained and she was named swanhild  now but an hour before the child of gudruda the gentle was born asmund went up from his house to the temple to tend the holy fire that burned night and day upon the altar when he had tended the fire he sat down upon the crossbenches before the shrine and gazing on the image of the goddess freya he fell asleep and dreamed a very evil dream  he dreamed that gudruda the gentle bore a dove most beautiful to see for all its feathers were of silver but that groa the witch bore a golden snake and the snake and the dove dwelt together and ever the snake sought to slay the dove at length there came a great white swan flying over coldback fell and its tongue was a sharp sword now the swan saw the dove and loved it and the dove loved the swan but the snake reared itself and hissed and sought to kill the dove but the swan covered her with his wings and beat the snake away then he asmund came out and drove away the swan as the swan had driven the snake and it wheeled high into the air and flew south and the snake swam away also through the sea but the dove drooped and now it was blind then an eagle came from the north and would have taken the dove but it fled round and round crying and always the eagle drew nearer to it at length from the south the swan came back flying heavily and about its neck was twined the golden snake and with it came a raven and it saw the eagle and loud it trumpeted and shook the snake from it so that it fell like a gleam of gold into the sea then the eagle and the swan met in battle and the swan drove the eagle down and broke it with his wings and flying to the dove comforted it but those in the house ran out and shot at the swan with bows and drove it away but now he asmund was not with them and once more the dove drooped again the swan came back and with it the raven and a great host were gathered against them and among them all of asmunds kith and kin and the men of his quarter and some of his priesthood and many whom he did not know by face and the swan flew at björn his son and shot out the sword of its tongue and slew him and many a man it slew thus and the raven with a beak and claws of steel slew also many a man so that asmunds kindred fled and the swan slept by the dove but as it slept the golden snake crawled out of the sea and hissed in the ears of men and they rose up to follow it it came to the swan and twined itself about its neck it struck at the dove and slew it then the swan awoke and the raven awoke and they did battle till all who remained of asmunds kindred and people were dead but still the snake clung about the swans neck and presently snake and swan fell into the sea and far out on the sea there burned a flame of fire and asmund awoke trembling and left the temple  now as he went a woman came running and weeping as she ran  haste haste she cried a daughter is born to thee and gudruda thy wife is dying  is it so said asmund after ill dreams ill tidings  now in the bedcloset off the great hall of middalhof lay gudruda the gentle and she was dying  art thou there husband she said  even so wife  thou comest in an evil hour for it is my last now hearken take thou the newborn babe within thine arms and kiss it and pour water over it and name it with my name  this asmund did  hearken my husband i have been a good wife to thee though thou hast not been all good to me but thus shalt thou atone thou shalt swear that though she is a girl thou wilt not cast this bairn forth to perish but wilt cherish and nurture her  i swear it he said  and thou shalt swear that thou wilt not take the witchwoman groa to wife nor have anything to do with her and this for thine own sake for if thou dost she will be thy death dost thou swear  i swear it he said  it is well but husband if thou dost break thine oath either in the words or in the spirit of the words evil shall overtake thee and all thy house now bid me farewell for i die  he bent over her and kissed her and it is said that asmund wept in that hour for after his fashion he loved his wife  give me the babe she said that it may lie once upon my breast  they gave her the babe and she looked upon its dark eyes and said  fairest of women shalt thou be gudrudafair as no woman in iceland ever was before thee and thou shalt love with a mighty loveand thou shalt loseand losing thou shalt find again  now it is said that as she spoke these words her face grew bright as a spirits and having spoken them she fell back dead and they laid her in earth but asmund mourned her much  but when all was over and done the dream that he had dreamed lay heavy on him now of all diviners of dreams groa was the most skilled and when gudruda had been in earth seven full days asmund went to groa though doubtfully because of his oath  he came to the house and entered on a couch in the chamber lay groa and her babe was on her breast and she was very fair to see  greeting lord she said what wouldest thou here  i have dreamed a dream and thou alone canst read it  that is as it may be she answered it is true that i have some skill in dreams at the least i will hear it  then he unfolded it to her every word  what wilt thou give me if i read thy dream she said  what dost thou ask methinks i have given thee much  yea lord and she looked at the babe upon her breast i ask but a little thing that thou shalt take this bairn in thy arms pour water over it and name it  men will talk if i do this for it is the fathers part  it is a little thing what men say talk goes by as the wind moreover thou shalt give them the lie in the childs name for it shall be swanhild the fatherless nevertheless that is my price pay it if thou wilt  read me the dream and i will name the child  nay first name thou the babe for then no harm shall come to her at thy hands  so asmund took the child poured water over her and named her  then groa spoke this lord is the reading of thy dream else my wisdom is at fault the silver dove is thy daughter gudruda the golden snake is my daughter swanhild and these two shall hate one the other and strive against each other but the swan is a mighty man whom both shall love and if he love not both yet shall belong to both and thou shalt send him away but he shall return and bring bad luck to thee and thy house and thy daughter shall be blind with love of him and in the end he shall slay the eagle a great lord from the north who shall seek to wed thy daughter and many another shall he slay by the help of that raven with the bill of steel who shall be with him but swanhild shall triumph over thy daughter gudruda and this man and the two of them shall die at her hands and for the rest who can say but this is truethat the mighty man shall bring all thy race to an end see now i have read thy rede  then asmund was very wroth thou wast wise to beguile me to name thy bastard brat he said else had i been its death within this hour  this thou canst not do lord seeing that thou hast held it in thy arms groa answered laughing go rather and lay out gudruda the fair on coldback hill so shalt thou make an end of the evil for gudruda shall be its very root learn this moreover that thy dream does not tell all seeing that thou thyself must play a part in the fate go send forth the babe gudruda and be at rest  that cannot be for i have sworn to cherish it and with an oath that may not be broken  it is well laughed groa things will befall as they are fated let them befall in their season there is space for cairns on coldback and the sea can shroud its dead  and asmund went thence angered at heart     ii  how eric told his love to gudruda in the snow on coldback  now it must be told that five years before the day of the death of gudruda the gentle saevuna the wife of thorgrimur irontoe gave birth to a son at coldback in the marsh on ran river and when his father came to look upon the child he called out aloud  here we have a wondrous bairn for his hair is yellow like gold and his eyes shine bright as stars and thorgrimur named him eric brighteyes  now coldback is but an hours ride from middalhof and it chanced in after years that thorgrimur went up to middalhof to keep the yule feast and worship in the temple for he was in the priesthood of asmund asmundson bringing the boy eric with him there also was groa with swanhild for now she dwelt at middalhof and the three fair children were set together in the hall to play and men thought it great sport to see them now gudruda had a horse of wood and would ride it while eric pushed the horse along but swanhild smote her from the horse and called to eric to make it move but he comforted gudruda and would not and at that swanhild was angry and lisped out  push thou must if i will it eric  then he pushed sideways and with such good will that swanhild fell almost into the fire of the hearth and leaping up she snatched a brand and threw it at gudruda firing her clothes men laughed at this but groa standing apart frowned and muttered witchwords  why lookest thou so darkly housekeeper said asmund the boy is bonny and high of heart  ah he is bonny as no child is and he shall be bonny all his lifedays nevertheless she shall not stand against his ill luck this i prophesy of him that women shall bring him to his end and he shall die a heros death but not at the hand of his foes   and now the years went by peacefully groa dwelt with her daughter swanhild up at middalhof and was the love of asmund asmundson but though he forgot his oath thus far yet he would never take her to wife the witchwife was angered at this and she schemed and plotted much to bring it about that asmund should wed her but still he would not though in all things else she led him as it were by a halter   twenty full years had gone by since gudruda the gentle was laid in earth and now gudruda the fair and swanhild the fatherless were women too eric too was a man of fiveandtwenty years and no such man had lived in iceland for he was strong and great of stature his hair was yellow as gold and his grey eyes shone with the light of swords he was gentle and loving as a woman and even as a lad his strength was the strength of two men and there were none in all the quarter who could leap or swim or wrestle against eric brighteyes men held him in honour and spoke well of him though as yet he had done no deeds but lived at home on coldback managing the farm for now thorgrimur irontoe his father was dead but women loved him much and that was his banefor of all women he loved but one gudruda the fair asmunds daughter he loved her from a child and her alone till his day of death and she too loved him and him only for now gudruda was a maid of maids most beautiful to see and sweet to hear her hair like the hair of eric was golden and she was white as the snow on hecla but her eyes were large and dark and black lashes drooped above them for the rest she was tall and strong and comely merry of face yet tender and the most witty of women  swanhild also was very fair she was slender small of limb and dark of hue having eyes blue as the deep sea and brown curling hair enough to veil her to the knees and a mind of which none knew the end for though she was open in her talk her thoughts were dark and secret this was her joy to draw the hearts of men to her and then to mock them she beguiled many in this fashion for she was the cunningest girl in matters of love and she knew well the arts of women with which they bring men to nothing nevertheless she was cold at heart and desired power and wealth greatly and she studied magic much of which her mother groa also had a store but swanhild too loved a man and that was the joint in her harness by which the shaft of fate entered her heart for that man was eric brighteyes who loved her not but she desired him so sorely that without him all the world was dark to her and her soul but as a ship driven rudderless upon a winter night therefore she put out all her strength to win him and bent her witcheries upon him and they were not few nor small nevertheless they went by him like the wind for he dreamed ever of gudruda alone and he saw no eyes but hers though as yet they spoke no word of love one to the other  but swanhild in her wrath took counsel with her mother groa though there was little liking between them and when she had heard the maidens tale groa laughed aloud  dost think me blind girl she said all of this i have seen yea and foreseen and i tell thee thou art mad let this yeoman eric go and i will find thee finer fowl to fly at  nay that i will not quoth swanhild for i love this man alone and i would win him and gudruda i hate and i would overthrow her give me of thy counsel  groa laughed again things must be as they are fated this now is my rede asmund would turn gudrudas beauty to account and that man must be rich in friends and money who gets her to wife and in this matter the mind of björn is as the mind of his father now we will watch and when a good time chances we will bear tales of gudruda to asmund and to her brother björn and swear that she oversteps her modesty with eric then shall asmund be wroth and drive eric from gudrudas side meanwhile i will do this in the north there dwells a man mighty in all things and blown up with pride he is named ospakar blacktooth his wife is but lately dead and he has given out that he will wed the fairest maid in iceland now it is in my mind to send koll the halfwitted my thrall whom asmund gave to me to ospakar as though by chance he is a great talker and very clever for in his halfwits is more cunning than in the brains of most and he shall so bepraise gudrudas beauty that ospakar will come hither to ask her in marriage and in this fashion if things go well thou shalt be rid of thy rival and i of one who looks scornfully upon me but if this fail then there are two roads left on which strong feet may travel to their end and of these one is that thou shouldest win eric away with thine own beauty and that is not little all men are frail and i have a draught that will make the heart as wax but yet the other path is surer  and what is that path my mother  it runs through blood to blackness by thy side is a knife and in gudrudas bosom beats a heart dead women are unmeet for love  swanhild tossed her head and looked upon the dark face of groa her mother  methinks with such an end to win i should not fear to tread that path if there be need my mother  now i see thou art indeed my daughter happiness is to the bold to each it comes in uncertain shape some love power some wealth and somea man take that which thou lovesti say cut thy path to it and take it else shall thy life be but a weariness for what does it serve to win the wealth and power when thou lovest a man alone or the man when thou dost desire gold and the pride of place this is wisdom to satisfy the longing of thy youth for age creeps on apace and beyond is darkness therefore if thou seekest this man and gudruda blocks thy path slay her girlby witchcraft or by steeland take him and in his arms forget that thine own are red but first let us try the easier plan daughter i too hate this proud girl who scorns me as her fathers lightoflove i too long to see that bright head of hers dull with the dust of death or at the least those proud eyes weeping tears of shame as the man she hates leads her hence as a bride were it not for her i should be asmunds wife and when she is gone with thy helpfor he loves thee much and has cause to love theethis i may be yet so in this matter if in no other let us go hand in hand and match our wits against her innocence   now koll the halfwitted went upon his errand and the time passed till it lacked but a month to yule and men sat indoors for the season was dark and much snow fell at length came frost and with it a clear sky and gudruda ceasing from her spinning in the hall went to the womans porch and looking out saw that the snow was hard and a great longing came upon her to breathe the fresh air for there was still an hour of daylight so she threw a cloak about her and walked forth taking the road towards coldback in the marsh that is by ran river but swanhild watched her till she was over the hill then she also took a cloak and followed on that path for she always watched gudruda  gudruda walked on for the half of an hour or so when she became aware that the clouds gathered in the sky and that the air was heavy with snow to come seeing this she turned homewards and swanhild hid herself to let her pass now flakes floated down as big and soft as fifa flowers quicker and more quick they came till all the plain was one white maze of mist but through it gudruda walked on and after her crept swanhild like a shadow and now the darkness gathered and the snow fell thick and fast covering up the track of her footsteps and she wandered from the path and after her wandered swanhild being loath to show herself for an hour or more gudruda wandered and then she called aloud and her voice fell heavily against the cloak of snow at the last she grew weary and frightened and sat down upon a shelving rock whence the snow had slipped away now a little way behind was another rock and there swanhild sat for she wished to be unseen of gudruda so some time passed and swanhild grew heavy as though with sleep when of a sudden a moving thing loomed upon the snowy darkness then gudruda leapt to her feet and called a mans voice answered  who passes there  i gudruda asmunds daughter  the form came nearer now swanhild could hear the snorting of a horse and now a man leapt from it and that man was eric brighteyes  is it thou indeed gudruda he said with a laugh and his great shape showed darkly on the snow mist  oh is it thou eric she answered i was never more joyed to see thee for of a truth thou dost come in a good hour a little while and i had seen thee no more for my eyes grow heavy with the deathsleep  nay say not so art lost then why so am i i came out to seek three horses that are strayed and was overtaken by the snow may they dwell in odins stables for they have led me to thee art thou cold gudruda  but a little eric yea there is place for thee here on the rock  so he sat down by her on the stone and swanhild crept nearer for now all weariness had left her but still the snow fell thick  it comes into my mind that we two shall die here said gudruda presently  thinkest thou so he answered well i will say this that i ask no better end  it is a bad end for thee eric to be choked in snow and with all thy deeds to do  it is a good end gudruda to die at thy side for so i shall die happy but i grieve for thee  grieve not for me brighteyes worse things might befall  he drew nearer to her and now he put his arms about her and clasped her to his bosom nor did she say him nay swanhild saw and lifted herself up behind them but for a while she heard nothing but the beating of her heart  listen gudruda eric said at last death draws near to us and before it comes i would speak to thee if speak i may  speak on she whispers from his breast  this i would say then that i love thee and that i ask no better fate than to die in thy arms  first shalt thou see me die in thine eric  be sure if that is so i shall not tarry for long oh gudruda since i was a child i have loved thee with a mighty love and now thou art all to me better to die thus than to live without thee speak then while there is time  i will not hide from thee eric that thy words are sweet in my ears  and now gudruda sobs and the tears fall fast from her dark eyes  nay weep not dost thou then love me  ay sure enough eric  then kiss me before we pass a man should not die thus and yet men have died worse  and so these two kissed for the first time out in the snow on coldback and that first kiss was long and sweet  swanhild heard and her blood seethed within her as water seethes in a boiling spring when the fires wake beneath she put her hand to her kirtle and gripped the knife at her side she half drew it then drove it back  cold kills as sure as steel she said in her heart if i slay her i cannot save myself or him let us die in peace and let the snow cover up our troubling and once more she listened  ah sweet said eric even in the midst of death there is hope of life swear to me then that if by chance we live thou wilt love me always as thou lovest me now  ay eric i swear that and readily  and swear come what may that thou wilt wed no man but me  i swear if thou dost remain true to me that i will wed none but thee eric  then i am sure of thee  boast not overmuch eric if thou dost live thy days are all before thee and with times come trials  now the snow whirled down faster and more thick till these two clasped heart to heart were but a heap of white and all white was the horse and swanhild was nearly buried  where go we when we die eric said gudruda in odins house there is no place for maids and how shall my feet fare without thee  nay sweet my may valhalla shuts its gates to me a deedless man up bifrosts rainbow bridge i may not travel for i do not die with byrnie on breast and sword aloft to hela shall we go and hand in hand  art thou sure eric that men find these abodes to say sooth at times i misdoubt me of them  i am not so sure but that i also doubt still i know this that where thou goest there i shall be gudruda  then things are well and well work the norns still eric of a sudden i grow fey for it comes upon me that i shall not die tonight but that nevertheless i shall die with thy arms about me and at thy side there i see it on the snow i lie by thee sleeping and one comes with hands outstretched and sleep falls from them like a mistby freya it is swanhilds self oh it is gone   the northern fates  it was nothing gudruda but a vision of the snowan untimely dream that comes before the sleep i grow cold and my eyes are heavy kiss me once again  it was no dream eric and ever i doubt me of swanhild for i think she loves thee also and she is fair and my enemy says gudruda laying her snowcold lips on his lips oh eric awake awake see the snow is done  he stumbled to his feet and looked forth lo out across the sky flared the wild northern fires throwing light upon the darkness  now it seems that i know the land said eric look yonder are golden falls though we did not hear them because of the snow and there out at sea loom the westmans and that dark thing is the temple hof and behind it stands the stead we are saved gudruda and thus far indeed thou wast fey now rise ere thy limbs stiffen and i will set thee on the horse if he still can run and lead thee down to middalhof before the witchlights fail us  so it shall be eric  now he led gudruda to the horsethat seeing its master snorted and shook the snow from its coat for it was not frozenand set her on the saddle and put his arm about her waist and they passed slowly through the deep snow and swanhild too crept from her place for her burning rage had kept the life in her and followed after them many times she fell and once she was nearly swallowed in a drift of snow and cried out in her fear  who called aloud said eric turning i thought i heard a voice  nay answers gudruda it was but a nighthawk screaming  now swanhild lay quiet in the drift but she said in her heart  ay a nighthawk that shall tear out those dark eyes of thine mine enemy  the two go on and at length they come to the banked roadway that runs past the temple to asmunds hall here swanhild leaves them and climbing over the turfwall into the home meadow passes round the hall by the outbuildings and so comes to the west end of the house and enters by the mens door unnoticed of any for all the people seeing a horse coming and a woman seated on it were gathered in front of the hall but swanhild ran to that shut bed where she slept and closing the curtain threw off her garments shook the snow from her hair and put on a linen kirtle then she rested a while for she was weary and going to the kitchen warmed herself at the fire  meanwhile eric and gudruda came to the house and there asmund greeted them well for he was troubled in his heart about his daughter and very glad to know her living seeing that men had but now begun to search for her because of the snow and the darkness  now gudruda told her tale but not all of it and asmund bade eric to the house then one asked about swanhild and eric said that he had seen nothing of her and asmund was sad at this for he loved swanhild but as he told all men to go and search an old wife came and said that swanhild was in the kitchen and while the carline spoke she came into the hall dressed in white very pale and with shining eyes and fair to see  where hast thou been swanhild said asmund i thought certainly thou wast perishing with gudruda in the snow and now all men go to seek thee while the witchlights burn  nay fosterfather i have been to the temple she answered lying so gudruda has but narrowly escaped the snow thanks be to brighteyes yonder surely i am glad of it for we could ill spare our sweet sister and going up to her she kissed her but gudruda saw that her eyes burned like fire and felt that her lips were cold as ice and shrank back wondering     iii  how asmund bade eric to his yulefeast  now it was suppertime and men sat at meat while the women waited upon them but as she went to and fro gudruda always looked at eric and swanhild watched them both supper being over people gathered round the hearth and having finished her service gudruda came and sat by eric so that her sleeve might touch his they spoke no word but there they sat and were happy swanhild saw and bit her lip now she was seated by asmund and björn his son  look fosterfather she said yonder sit a pretty pair  that cannot be denied answered asmund one may ride many days to see such another man as eric brighteyes and no such maid as gudruda flowers between middalhof and london town unless it be thou swanhild well so her mother said that it should be and without doubt she was foresighted at her death  nay name me not with gudruda fosterfather i am but a grey goose by thy white swan but these shall be well wed and that will be a good match for eric  let not thy tongue run on so fast said asmund sharply who told thee that eric should have gudruda  none told me but in truth having eyes and ears i grew certain of it said swanhild look at them now surely lovers wear such faces  now it chanced that gudruda had rested her chin on her hand and was gazing into erics eyes beneath the shadow of her hair  methinks my sister will look higher than to wed a simple yeoman though he is large as two other men said björn with a sneer now björn was jealous of erics strength and beauty and did not love him  trust nothing that thou seest and little that thou hearest girl said asmund raising himself from thought so shall thy guesses be good eric come here and tell us how thou didst chance on gudruda in the snow  i was not so ill seated but that i could bear to stay grumbled eric beneath his breath but gudruda said go  so he went and told his tale but not all of it for he intended to ask gudruda in marriage on the morrow though his heart prophesied no luck in the matter and therefore he was not overswift with it  in this thing thou hast done me and mine good service said asmund coldly searching erics face with his blue eyes it had been said if my fair daughter had perished in the snow for know this i would set her high in marriage for her honour and the honour of my house and so some rich and noble man had lost great joy but take thou this gift in memory of the deed and gudrudas husband shall give thee another such upon the day that he makes her wife and he drew a gold ring off his arm  now erics knees trembled as he heard and his heart grew faint as though with fear but he answered clear and straight  thy gift had been better without thy words ringgiver but i pray thee to take it back for i have done nothing to win it though perhaps the time will come when i shall ask thee for a richer  my gifts have never been put away before said asmund growing angry  this wealthy farmer holds the good gold of little worth it is foolish to take fish to the sea my father sneered björn  nay björn not so eric answered but as thou sayest i am but a farmer and since my father thorgrimur irontoe died things have not gone too well on ran river but at the least i am a free man and i will take no gifts that i cannot repay worth for worth therefore i will not have the ring  as thou wilt said asmund pride is a good horse if thou ridest wisely and he thrust the ring back upon his arm  then people go to rest but swanhild seeks her mother and tells her all that has befallen her nor does groa fail to listen  now i will make a plan she says for these things have chanced well and asmund is in a ripe humour eric shall come no more to middalhof till gudruda is gone hence led by ospakar blacktooth  and if eric does not come here how shall i see his face for mother i long for the sight of it  that is thy matter thou lovesick fool know this that if eric comes hither and gets speech with gudruda there is an end of thy hopes for fair as thou art she is too fair for thee and strong as thou art in a way she is too strong thou hast heard how these two love and such loves mock at the will of fathers eric will win his desire or die beneath the swords of asmund and björn if such men can prevail against his might nay the wolf eric must be fenced from the lamb till he grows hungry then let him search the fold and make spoil of thee for when the best is gone he will desire the good  so be it mother as i sat crouched behind gudruda in the snow at coldback i had half a mind to end her lovewords with this knife for so i should have been free of her  yes and fast in the doomring thou wildcat the gods help this eric if thou winnest him nay choose thy time and if thou must strike strike secretly and home remember also that cunning is mightier than strength that lies pierce further than swords and that witchcraft wins where honesty must fail now i will go to asmund and he shall be an angry man before tomorrow comes  then groa went to the shut bed where asmund the priest slept he was sitting on the bed and asked her why she came  for love of thee asmund and thy house though thou dost treat me ill who hast profited so much by me and my foresight say now wilt thou that this daughter of thine gudruda the fair should be the light may of yonder longlegged yeoman  that is not in my mind said asmund stroking his beard  knowest thou then that this very day your white gudruda sat on erics lap in the snow while he fondled her to his hearts content  most likely it was for warmth men do not dream on love in the hour of death who saw this  swanhild who was behind and hid herself for shame and therefore she held that these two must soon be wed ah thou art foolish now asmund young blood makes light of cold or death art thou blind or dost thou not see that these two turn on each other like birds at nestingtime  they might do worse said asmund for they are a proper pair and it seems to me that each was born for each  then all goes well still it is a pity to see so fair a maid cast like rotten bait upon the waters to hook this troutlet of a yeoman thou hast enemies asmund thou art too prosperous and there are many who hate thee for thy state and wealth were it not wise to use this girl of thine to build a wall about thee against the evil day  i have been more wont housekeeper to trust to my own arm than to bought friends but tell me for at the least thou art farseeing how may this be done as things are though i spoke roughly to him last night i am inclined to let eric brighteyes take gudruda i have always loved the lad and he will go far  listen asmund surely thou hast heard of ospakar blacktooththe priest who dwells in the north  ay i have heard of him and i know him there is no man like him for ugliness or strength or wealth and power we sailed together on a viking cruise many years ago and he did things at which my blood turned and in those days i had no chicken heart  with time men change their temper unless i am mistaken this ospakar wishes above all to have gudruda in marriage for now that everything is his this alone is left for him to askthe fairest woman in iceland as a housewife think then with ospakar for a soninlaw who is there that can stand against thee  i am not so sure of this matter nor do i altogether trust thee groa of a truth it seems to me that thou hast some stake upon the race this ospakar is evil and hideous it were a shame to give gudruda over to him when she looks elsewhere knowest thou that i swore to love and cherish her and how runs this with my oath if eric is not too rich yet he is of good birth and kin and moreover a man of men if he take her good will come of it  it is like thee asmund always to mistrust those who spend their days in plotting for thy weal do as thou wilt let eric take this treasure of thinefor whom earls would give their stateand live to rue it but i say this if he have thy leave to roam here with his dove the matter will soon grow for these two sicken each to each and young blood is hot and ill at waiting and it is not always snowtime so betroth her or let him go and now i have said  thy tongue runs too fast the man is quite unproved and i will try him tomorrow i will warn him from my door then things shall go as they are fated and now peace for i weary of thy talk and moreover it is false for thou lackest one thinga little honesty to season all thy craft what fee has ospakar paid thee i wonder thou at least hadst never refused the gold ring tonight for thou wouldst do much for gold  and more for love and most of all for hate groa said and laughed aloud nor did they speak more on this matter that night  now early in the morning asmund rose and going to the hall awoke eric who slept by the centre hearth saying that he would talk with him without then eric followed him to the back of the hall  say now eric he said when they stood in the grey light outside the house who was it taught thee that kisses keep out the cold on snowy days  now eric reddened to his yellow hair but he answered who was it told thee lord that i tried this medicine  the snow hides much but there are eyes that can pierce the snow nay more thou wast seen and theres an end now know thisi like thee well but gudruda is not for thee she is far above thee who art but a deedless yeoman  then i love to no end said eric i long for one thing only and that is gudruda it was in my mind to ask her in marriage of thee today  then lad thou hast thy answer before thou askest be sure of one thing if but once again i find thee alone with gudruda it is my axe shall kiss thee and not her lips  that may yet be put to the proof lord said eric and turned to seek his horse when suddenly gudruda came and stood between them and his heart leapt at the sight of her  listen gudruda eric said this is thy fathers word that we two speak together no more  then it is an ill saying for us said gudruda laying her hand upon her breast  saying good or ill so it surely is girl answered asmund no more shalt thou go akissing in the snow or in the flowers  now i seem to hear swanhilds voice she said well such things have happened to better folk and a fathers wish is to a maid what the wind is to the grass still the sun is behind the cloud and it will shine again some day till then eric fare thee well  it is not thy will lord said eric that i should come to thy yulefeast as thou hast asked me these ten years past  now asmund grew wroth and pointed with his hand towards the great golden falls that thunder down the mountain named stonefell that is behind middalhof and there are no greater waterfalls in iceland  a man may take two roads eric from coldback to middalhof one by the bridlepath over coldback and the other down golden falls but i never knew traveller to choose this way now i bid thee to my feast by the path over golden falls and if thou comest that way i promise thee this if thou livest i will greet thee well and if i find thee dead in the great pool i will bind on thy hellshoes and lay thee to earth neighbourly fashion but if thou comest by any other path then my thralls shall cut thee down at my door and he stroked his beard and laughed  now asmund spoke thus mockingly because he did not think it possible that any man should try the path of the golden falls  eric smiled and said i hold thee to thy word lord perhaps i shall be thy guest at yule  but gudruda heard the thunder of the mighty falls as the wind turned and cried nay nayit were thy death  then eric finds his horse and rides away across the snow  now it must be told of koll the halfwitted that at length he came to swinefell in the north having journeyed hard across the snow here ospakar blacktooth had his great hall in which day by day a hundred men sat down to meat now koll entered the hall when ospakar was at supper and looked at him with big eyes for he had never seen so wonderful a man he was huge in staturehis hair was black and black his beard and on his lower lip there lay a great black fang his eyes were small and narrow but his cheekbones were set wide apart and high like those of a horse koll thought him an ill man to deal with and half a troll and grew afraid of his errand since in kolls halfwittedness there was much cunningfor it was a cloak in which he wrapped himself but as ospakar sat in the high seat clothed in a purple robe with his sword whitefire on his knee he saw koll and called out in a great voice   an ablebodied goblin  who is this red fox that creeps into my earth  for to look at koll was very like a fox  my name is koll the halfwitted groas thrall lord am i welcome here he answered  that is as it may be why do they call thee halfwitted  because i love not work overmuch lord  then all my thralls are fellow to thee say what brings thee here  this lord it was told among men down in the south that thou wouldst give a good gift to him who should discover to thee the fairest maid in iceland so i asked leave of my mistress to come on a journey and tell thee of her  then a lie was told thee still i love to hear of fair maids and seek one for a wife if she be but fair enough so speak on koll the fox and lie not to me i warn thee else i will knock what wits are left there from that red head of thine  so koll took up the tale and greatly bepraised gudrudas beauty nor in truth for all his talk could he praise it too much he told of her dark eyes and the whiteness of her skin of the nobleness of her shape and the gold of her hair of her wit and gentleness till at length ospakar grew afire to see this flower of maids  by thor thou koll he said if the girl be but half of what thou sayest her luck is good for she shall be wife to ospakar but if thou hast lied to me about her beware for soon there shall be a knave the less in iceland  now a man rose in the hall and said that koll spoke truth for he had seen gudruda the fair asmunds daughter and there was no maid like her in iceland  i will do this now said blacktooth tomorrow i will send a messenger to middalhof saying to asmund the priest that i purpose to visit him at the time of the yulefeast then i shall see if the girl pleases me meanwhile koll take thou a seat among the thralls and here is something for thy pains and he took off the purple cloak and threw it to him  thanks to thee goldscatterer said koll it is wise to go soon to middalhof for such a bloom as this maid does not lack a bee there is a youngling in the south named eric brighteyes who loves gudruda and she i think loves him though he is but a yeoman of small wealth and is only twentyfive years old  ho ho laughed great ospakar and i am fortyfive but let not this suckling cross my desire lest men call him eric holloweyes   now the messenger of ospakar came to middalhof and his words pleased asmund and he made ready a great feast and swanhild smiled but gudruda was afraid     iv  how eric came down golden falls  now ospakar rode up to middalhof on the day before the yulefeast he was splendidly apparelled and with him came his two sons gizur the lawman and mord young men of promise and many armed thralls and servants gudruda watching at the womens door saw his face in the moonlight and loathed him  what thinkest thou of him who comes to seek thee in marriage fostersister asked swanhild watching at her side  i think he is like a troll and that seek as he will he shall not find me i had rather lie in the pool beneath golden falls than in ospakars hall  that shall be proved said swanhild at the least he is rich and noble and the greatest of men in size it would go hard with eric were those arms about him  i am not so sure of that said gudruda but it is not likely to be known  comes eric to the feast by the road of golden falls gudruda  nay no man may try that path and live  then he will die for eric will risk it  now gudruda thought and a great fire burned in her heart and shone through her eyes if eric dies she said on thee be his blood swanhildon thee and that dark mother of thine for ye have plotted to bring this evil on us how have i harmed thee that thou shouldst deal thus with me  swanhild turned white and wickedlooking for passion mastered her and she gazed into gudrudas face and answered how hast thou harmed me surely i will tell thee thy beauty has robbed me of erics love  it would be better to prate of erics love when he had told it thee swanhild  thou hast robbed me and therefore i hate thee and therefore i will deliver thee to ospakar whom thou dost loathay and yet win brighteyes to myself am i not also fair and can i not also love and shall i see thee snatch my joy by the gods never i will see thee dead and eric with thee ere it shall be so but first i will see thee shamed  thy words are illsuited to a maidens lips swanhild but of this be sure i fear thee not and shall never fear thee and one thing i know well that whether thou or i prevail in the end thou shalt harvest the greatest shame and in times to come men shall speak of thee with hatred and name thee by ill names moreover eric shall never love thee from year to year he shall hate thee with a deeper hate though it may well be that thou wilt bring ruin on him and now i thank thee that thou hast told me all thy mind showing me what indeed thou art and gudruda turned scornfully upon her heel and walked away  now asmund the priest went out into the courtyard and meeting ospakar blacktooth greeted him heartily though he did not like his looks and took him by the hand and led him to the hall that was bravely decked with tapestries and seated him by his side on the high seat and ospakars thralls brought good gifts for asmund who thanked the giver well  now it was supper time and gudruda came in and after her walked swanhild ospakar gazed hard at gudruda and a great desire entered into him to make her his wife but she passed coldly by nor looked on him at all  this then is that maid of thine of whom i have heard tell asmund i will say this fairer was never born of woman  then men ate and ospakar drank much ale but all the while he stared at gudruda and listened for her voice but as yet he said nothing of what he came to seek though all knew his errand and his two sons gizur and mord stared also at gudruda for they thought her most wonderfully fair but gizur found swanhild also fair  and so the night wore on till it was time to sleep    on this same day eric rode up from his farm on ran river and took his road along the brow of coldback till he came to stonefell now all along coldback and stonefell is a steep cliff facing to the south that grows ever higher till it comes to that point where golden river falls over it and parting its waters below runs east and westthe branch to the east being called ran river and that to the west laxàfor these two streams girdle round the rich plain of middalhof till at length they reach the sea but in the midst of golden river on the edge of the cliff a mass of rock juts up called sheepsaddle dividing the waters of the fall and over this the spray flies and in winter the ice gathers but the river does not cover it the great fall is thirty fathoms deep and shaped like a horseshoe of which the points lie towards middalhof yet if he could but gain the sheepsaddle rock that divides the midst of the waters a strong and hardy man might climb down some fifteen fathoms of this depth and scarcely wet his feet  now here at the foot of sheepsaddle rock the double arches of waters meet and fall in one torrent into the bottomless pool below but some three fathoms from this point of the meeting waters and beneath it just where the curve is deepest a single crag as large as a drinkingtable and no larger juts through the foam and if a man could reach it he might leap from it some twelve fathoms sheer into the sprayhidden pit beneath there to sink or swim as it might befall this crag is called wolfs fang  now eric stood for a long while on the edge of the fall and looked measuring every thing with his eye then he went up above where the river swirls down to the precipice and looked again for it is from this bank that the dividing islandrock sheepsaddle must be reached  a man may hardly do this thing yet i will try it he said to himself at last my honour shall be great for the feat if i chance to live and if i diewell there is an end of troubling after maids and all other things  so he went home and sat silent that evening now since thorgrimur irontoes death his housewife saevuna erics mother had grown dim of sight and though she peered and peered again from her seat in the ingle nook she could not see the face of her son  what ails thee eric that thou sittest so silent was not the meat then to thy mind at supper  yes mother the meat was well enough though a little undersmoked  now i see that thou art not thyself son for thou hadst no meat but only stockfishand i never knew a man forget his supper on the night of its eating except he was distraught or deep in love  was it so said brighteyes  what troubles thee ericthat sweet lass yonder  ay somewhat mother  what more then  this that i go down golden falls tomorrow and i do not know how i may come from sheepsaddle rock to wolfs fang crag and keep my life whole in me and now i pray thee weary me not with words for my brain is slow and i must use it  when she heard this saevuna screamed aloud and threw herself before eric praying him to forgo his mad venture but he would not listen to her for he was slow to make up his mind but that being made up nothing could change it then when she learned that it was to get sight of gudruda that he purposed thus to throw his life away she was very angry and cursed her and all her kith and kin  it is likely enough that thou wilt have cause to use such words before all this tale is told said eric nevertheless mother forbear to curse gudruda who is in no way to blame for these matters  thou art a faithless son saevuna said who wilt slay thyself striving to win speech with thy may and leave thy mother childless  eric said that it seemed so indeed but he was plighted to it and the feat must be tried then he kissed her and she sought her bed weeping    now it was the day of the yulefeast and there was no sun till one hour before noon but eric having kissed his mother and bidden her farewell called a thrall jon by name and giving him a sealskin bag full of his best apparel bade him ride to middalhof and tell asmund the priest that eric brighteyes would come down golden falls an hour after midday to join his feast and thence go to the foot of the golden falls to await him there and the man went wondering for he thought his master mad  then eric took a good rope and a staff tipped with iron and so soon as the light served mounted his horse forded ran river and rode along coldback till he came to the lip of golden falls here he stayed a while till at length he saw many people streaming up the snow from middalhof far beneath and among them two women who by their stature should be gudruda and swanhild and near to them a great man whom he did not know then he showed himself for a space on the brink of the gulf and turned his horse up stream the sun shone bright upon the edge of the sky but the frost bit like a sword still he must strip off his garments so that nothing remained on him except his sheepskin shoes shirt and hose and take the water now here the river runs mightily and he must cross full thirty fathoms of the swirling water before he can reach sheepsaddle and woe to him if his foot slip on the boulders for certainly he must be swept over the brink  eric rested the staff against the stony bottom and leaning his weight on it took the stream and he was so strong that it could not prevail against him till at length he was rather more than halfway across and the water swept above his shoulders now he was lifted from his feet and letting the staff float he swam for his life and with such mighty strokes that he felt little of that icy cold down he was sweptnow the lip of the fall was but three fathoms away on his left and already the green water boiled beneath him a fathom from him was the corner of sheepsaddle if he may grasp it all is well if not he dies  three great strokes and he held it his feet were swept out over the brink of the fall but he clung on grimly and by the strength of his arms drew himself on to the rock and rested a while presently he stood up for the cold began to nip him and the people below became aware that he had swum the river above the fall and raised a shout for the deed was great now eric must begin to clamber down sheepsaddle and this was no easy task for the rock is almost sheer and slippery with ice and on either side the waters rushed and thundered throwing their blinding spray about him as they leapt to the depths beneath he looked down studying the rock then feeling that he grew afraid made an end of doubt and grasping a point with both hands swung himself down his own length and more now for many minutes he climbed down sheepsaddle and the task was hard for he was bewildered with the booming of the waters that bent out on either side of him like the arc of a bow and the rock was very steep and slippery still he came down all those fifteen fathoms and fell not though twice he was near to falling and the watchers below marvelled greatly at his hardihood  he will be dashed to pieces where the waters meet said ospakar he can never gain wolfs fang crag beneath and if so it be that he come there and leaps to the pool the weight of water will drive him down and drown him  it is certainly so quoth asmund and it grieves me much for it was my jest that drove him to this perilous adventure and we cannot spare such a man as eric brighteyes  now swanhild turned white as death but gudruda said if great heart and strength and skill may avail at all then eric shall come safely down the waters  thou fool whispered swanhild in her ear how can these help him no troll could live in yonder cauldron dead is eric and thou art the bait that lured him to his death  spare thy words she answered as the norns have ordered so it shall be  now eric stood at the foot of sheepsaddle and within an arms length the mighty waters met tossing their yellow waves and seething furiously as they leapt to the misthid gulf beneath he bent over and looked through the spray three fathoms under him the rock wolfs fang split the waters and thence if he can come thither he may leap sheer into the pool below now he unwound the rope that was about his middle and made one end fast to a knob of rockand this was difficult for his hands were stiff with coldand the other end he passed through his leathern girdle then eric looked again and his heart sank within him how might he give himself to this boiling flood and not be shattered but as he looked lo a rainbow grew upon the face of the water and one end of it lit upon him and the other like a glory from the gods fell full upon gudruda as she stood a little way apart watching at the foot of golden falls  seest thou that said asmund to groa who was at his side the gods build their bifrost bridge between these two who now shall keep them asunder  read the portent thus she answered they shall be united but not here yon is a spirit bridge and see the waters of death foam and fall between them  eric too saw the omen and it seemed good to him and all fear left his heart round about him the waters thundered but amidst their roar he dreamed that he heard a voice calling  be of good cheer eric brighteyes for thou shalt live to do mightier deeds than this and in guerdon thou shalt win gudruda  so he paused no longer but shortening up the rope pulled on it with all his strength and then leapt out upon the arch of waters they struck him and he was dashed out like a stone from a sling again he fell against them and again was dashed away so that his girdle burst eric felt it go and clung wildly to the rope and lo with the inward swing he fell on wolfs fang where never a man has stood before and never a man shall stand again eric lay a little while on the rock till his breath came back to him and he listened to the roar of the waters then rising on his hands and knees he crept to its point for he could scarcely stand because of the trembling of the stone beneath the shock of the fall and when the people below saw that he was not dead they raised a great shout and the sound of their voices came to him through the noise of the waters  now twelve fathoms beneath him was the surface of the pool but he could not see it because of the wreaths of spray nevertheless he must leap and that swiftly for he grew cold so of a sudden eric stood up to his full height and with a loud cry and a mighty spring bounded out from the point of wolfs fang far into the air beyond the reach of the falling flood and rushed headlong towards the gulf beneath now all men watching held their breath as his body travelled and so great is the place and so high the leap that through the mist eric seemed but as a big white stone hurled down the face of the arching waters  he was gone and the watchers rushed down to the foot of the pool for there if he rose at all he must pass to the shallows swanhild could look no more but sank upon the ground the face of gudruda was set like a stone with doubt and anguish ospakar saw and read the meaning and he said to himself now odin grant that this youngling rise not again for the maid loves him dearly and he is too much a man to be lightly swept aside  eric struck the pool down he sank and down and downfor the water falling from so far must almost reach the bottom of the pool before it can rise againand he with it now he touched the bottom but very gently and slowly began to rise and as he rose was carried along by the stream but it was long before he could breathe and it seemed to him that his lungs would burst still he struggled up striking great strokes with his legs  farewell to eric said asmund he will rise no more now  but just as he spoke gudruda pointed to something that gleamed white and golden beneath the surface of the current and lo the bright hair of eric rose from the water and he drew a great breath shaking his head like a seal and though but feebly struck out for the shallows that are at the foot of the pool now he found footing but was swept over by the fierce current and cut his forehead and he carried that scar till his death again he rose and with a rush gained the bank unaided and fell upon the snow  now people gathered about him in silence and wondering for none had known so great a deed and presently eric opened his eyes and looked up and found the eyes of gudruda fixed on his and there was that in them which made him glad he had dared the path of golden falls     v  how eric won the sword whitefire  now asmund the priest bent down and eric saw him and spoke  thou badest me to thy yulefeast lord by yonder slippery road and i have come dost thou welcome me well  no man better quoth asmund thou art a gallant man though foolhardy and thou hast done a deed that shall be told of while skalds sing and men live in iceland  make place my father said gudruda for eric bleeds and she loosed the kerchief from her neck and bound it about his wounded brow and taking the rich cloak from her body threw it on his shoulders and no man said her nay  then they led him to the hall where eric clothed himself and rested and he sent back the thrall jon to coldback bidding him tell saevuna erics mother that he was safe but he was somewhat weak all that day and the sound of waters roared in his ears  now ospakar and groa were ill pleased at the turn things had taken but all the others rejoiced much for eric was well loved of men and they had grieved if the waters had prevailed against his might but swanhild brooded bitterly for eric never turned to look on her  the hour of the feast drew on and according to custom it was held in the temple and thither went all men when they were seated in the nave of the hof the fat ox that had been made ready for sacrifice was led in and dragged before the altar on which the holy fire burned now asmund the priest slew it amid silence before the figures of the gods and catching its blood in the bloodbowl sprinkled the altar and all the worshippers with the bloodtwigs then the ox was cut up and the figures of the almighty gods were anointed with its molten fat and wiped with fair linen next the flesh was boiled in the cauldrons that were hung over fires lighted all down the nave and the feast began  now men ate and drank much ale and mead and all were merry but ospakar blacktooth grew not glad though he drank much for he saw that the eyes of gudruda ever watched erics face and that they smiled on each other he was wroth at this for he knew that the bait must be good and the line strong that should win this fair fish to his angle and as he sat unknowingly his fingers loosed the peacestrings of his sword whitefire and he half drew it so that its brightness flamed in the firelight  thou hast a wondrous blade there ospakar said asmund though this is no place to draw it whence came it methinks no such swords are fashioned now  ay asmund a wondrous blade indeed there is no other such in the world for the dwarfs forged it of old and he shall be unconquered who holds it aloft this was king odins sword and it is named whitefire ralph the red took it from king erics cairn in norway and he strove long with the barrowdweller before he wrenched it from his grasp but my father won it and slew ralph though he had never done this had whitefire been aloft against him but ralph the red being in drink when the ships met in battle fought with an axe and was slain by my father and since then whitefire has been the last light that many a chiefs eyes have seen look at it asmund   the ghost in the cairn  now he drew the great sword and men were astonished as it flashed aloft its hilt was of gold and blue stones were set therein it measured two ells and a half from crossbar to point and so bright was the broad blade that no one could look on it for long and all down its length ran runes  a wondrous weapon truly said asmund how read the runes  i know not nor any manthey are ancient  let me look at them said groa i am skilled in runes now she took the sword and heaved it up and looked at the runes and said a strange writing truly  how runs it housekeeper said asmund  thus lord if my skill is not at fault       whitefire is my name      dwarffolk forged me      odins sword was i      erics sword was i      erics sword shall i be      and where i fall there he must follow me  now gudruda looked at eric brighteyes wonderingly and ospakar saw it and became very angry  look not so maiden he said for it shall be another eric than yon flapperduck who holds whitefire aloft though it may very well chance that he shall feel its edge  now gudruda bit her lip and eric burned red to the brow and spoke  it is ill lord to throw taunts like an angry woman thou art great and strong yet i may dare a deed with thee  peace boy thou canst climb a waterfall well i gainsay it not but beware ere thou settest up thyself against my strength say now what game wilt thou play with ospakar  i will go on holmgang with thee byrnieclad or baresark and fight thee with axe or sword or i will wrestle with thee and whitefire yonder shall be the winners prize        to a duel usually fought in mail or without it on an      islandholmwithin a circle of hazeltwigs  nay i will have no bloodshed here at middalhof said asmund sternly make play with fists or wrestle if ye will for that were great sport to see but weapons shall not be drawn  now ospakar grew mad with anger and drinkand he grinned like a dog till men saw the red gums beneath his lips  thou wilt wrestle with me younglingwith me whom no man has ever so much as lifted from my feet good i will lay thee on thy face and whip thee and whitefire shall be the stakei swear it on the holy altarring but what hast thou to set against the precious sword thy poor hovel and its lot of land shall be all too little  i set my life on it if i lose whitefire let whitefire slay me said eric  nay that i will not have and i am master here in this temple said asmund bethink thee of some other stake ospakar or let the game be off  now ospakar gnawed his lip with his black fang and thought then he laughed aloud and spoke  bright is whitefire and thou art named brighteyes see now i set the great sword against thy right eye and if i win the match it shall be mine to tear it out wilt thou play this game with me if thy heart fails thee let it go but i will set no other stake against my good sword  eyes and limbs are a poor mans wealth said eric so be it i stake my right eye against the sword whitefire and we will try the match tomorrow  and tomorrow night thou shalt be called eric oneeye said ospakarat which some few of his thralls laughed  but most of the men did not laugh for they thought this an ill game and a worst jest  now the feast went on and asmund rose from his high seat in the centre of the nave on the left hand looking down from the altar and gave out the holy toasts first men drank a full horn to odin praying for triumph on their foes then they drank to frey asking for plenty to thor for strength in battle to freya goddess of love and to her eric drank heartily to the memory of the dead and last of all to bragi god of all delight when this cup was drunk asmund rose again according to custom and asked if none had an oath to swear as to some deed that should be done  for a while there was no answer but presently eric brighteyes stood up  lord he said i would swear an oath  set forth the matter then said asmund  it is this quoth eric on mosfell mountain over by hecla dwells a baresark of whom all men have ill knowledge for there are few whom he has not harmed his name is skallagrim he is a mighty man and he has wrought much mischief in the south country and brought many to their deaths and robbed more of their goods for none can prevail against him still i swear this that when the days lengthen i will go up alone against him and challenge him to battle and conquer him or fall  then thou yellowheaded puppydog thou shalt go with one eye against a baresark with two growled ospakar  men took no heed of his words but shouted aloud for skallagrim had plagued them long and there were none who dared to fight with him any more only gudruda looked askance for it seemed to her that eric swore too fast nevertheless he went up to the altar and taking hold of the holy ring he set his foot on the holy stone and swore his oath while the feasters applauded striking their cups upon the board  and after that the feast went merrily till all men were drunk except asmund and eric  now eric went to rest but first he rubbed his limbs with the fat of seals for he was still sore with the beating of the waters and they must needs be supple on the morrow if he would keep his eye then he slept sound and rose strong and well and going to the stream behind the stead bathed and anointed his limbs afresh but ospakar did not sleep well because of the ale that he had drunk now as eric came back from bathing in the dark of the morning he met gudruda who watched for his coming and there being none to see he kissed her often but she chided him because of the match that he had made with ospakar and the oath that he had sworn  surely she said thou wilt lose thine eye for this ospakar is a giant and strong as a troll also he is merciless still thou art a mighty man and i shall love thee as well with one eye as with two oh eric methought i should have died yesterday when thou didst leap from wolfs fang my heart seemed to stop within me  yet i came safely to shore sweetheart and well does this kiss pay for all i did and as for ospakar if but once i get these arms about him i fear him little or any man and i covet that sword of his greatly but we can talk more certainly of these things tomorrow  now gudruda clung to him and told him all that had befallen and of the doings and words of swanhild  she honours me beyond my worth he said who am in no way set on her but on thee only gudruda  art thou so sure of that eric swanhild is fair and wise  ay and evil when i love swanhild then thou mayest love ospakar  it is a bargain she said laughing good luck go with thee in the wrestling and with a kiss she left him fearing lest she should be seen  eric went back to the hall and sat down by the centre hearth for all men slept being still heavy with drink and presently swanhild glided up to him and greeted him  thou art greedy of deeds eric she said yesterday thou camest here by a path that no man has travelled today thou dost wrestle with a giant for thine eye and presently thou goest up against skallagrim  it seems that this is true said eric  now all this thou doest for a woman who is the betrothed of another man  all this i do for fames sake swanhild moreover gudruda is betrothed to none  before another yulefeast is spread gudruda shall be the wife of ospakar  that is yet to be seen swanhild  now swanhild stood silent for a while and then spoke thou art a fool ericyes drunk with folly nothing but evil shall come to thee from this madness of thine forget it and pluck that which lies to thine hand and she looked sweetly at him  they call thee swanhild the fatherless he answered but i think that loki the god of guile was thy father for there is none to match thee in craft and evildoing and in beauty one only i know thy plots well and all the sorrow that thou hast brought upon us still each seeks honour after his own manner so seek thou as thou wilt but thou shalt find bitterness and empty days and thy plots shall come back on thine own headyes even though they bring gudruda and me to sorrow and death  swanhild laughed a day shall dawn eric when thou who dost hate me shalt hold me dear and this i promise thee another thing i promise thee also that gudruda shall never call thee husband  but eric did not answer fearing lest in his anger he should say words that were better unspoken  now men rose and sat down to meat and all talked of the wrestling that should be but in the morning ospakar repented of the match for it is truly said that ale is another man and men do not like that in the morning which seemed well enough on yester eve he remembered that he held whitefire dear above all things and that erics eye had no worth to him except that the loss of it would spoil his beauty so that perhaps gudruda would turn from him it would be very ill if he should chance to lose the playthough of this he had no fear for he was held the strongest man in iceland and the most skilled in all feats of strengthand at the best no fame is to be won from the overthrow of a deedless man and the plucking out of his eye thus it came to pass that when he saw eric he called to him in a big voice  hearken thou eric  i hear thee thou ospakar said eric mocking him and people laughed while ospakar grinned angrily and said thou must learn manners puppy still i shall find no honour in teaching thee in this wise last night we made a match in our cups and i staked my sword whitefire and thou thine eye it would be bad that either of us should lose sword or eye therefore what sayest thou shall we let it pass  ay blacktooth if thou fearest but first pay thou forfeit of the sword  now ospakar grew very mad and shouted thou wilt indeed stand against me in the ring i will break thy back anon youngster and afterwards tear out thine eye before thou diest  it may so befall answered eric but big words do not make big deeds  presently the light came and thralls went out with spades and cleared away the snow in a circle two rods across and brought dry sand and sprinkled it on the frozen turf so that the wrestlers should not slip and they piled the snow in a wall around the ring  but groa came up to ospakar and spoke to him apart  knowest thou lord she said that my heart bodes ill of this match eric is a mighty man and great though thou art i think that thou shalt lout low before him  it will be a bad business if i am overthrown by an untried man said ospakar and was troubled in his mind and it would be evil moreover to lose the sword for no price would i have it so  what wilt thou give me lord if i bring thee victory  i will give thee two hundred in silver  ask no questions and it shall be so said groa  now eric was without taking note of the ground in the ring and presently groa called to her the thrall koll the halfwitted whom she had sent to swinefell  see she said yonder by the wall stand the wrestling shoes of eric brighteyes haste thee now and take grease and rub the soles with it then hold them in the heat of the fire so that the fat sinks in do this swiftly and secretly and i will give thee three pennies  koll grinned and did as he was bid setting back the shoes just as they were before scarcely was the deed done when eric came in and made himself ready for the game binding the greased shoes upon his feet for he feared no trick  now everybody went out to the ring and ospakar and eric stripped for wrestling they were clad in tight woollen jerkins and hose and sheepskin shoes were on their feet  they named asmund master of the game and his word must be law to both of them eric claimed that asmund should hold the sword whitefire that was at stake but ospakar gainsaid him saying that if he gave whitefire into asmunds keeping eric must also give his eyeand about this they debated hotly now the matter was brought before asmund as umpire and he gave judgment for eric for he said if eric yield up his eye into my hand i can return it to his head no more if he should win but if ospakar gives me the good sword and conquers it is easy for me to pass it back to him unharmed  men said that this was a good judgment  thus then was the armgame set ospakar and eric must wrestle thrice and between each bout there would be a space while men could count a thousand they might strike no blow at one another with hand or head or elbow foot or knee and it should be counted no fall if the haunch and the head of the fallen were not on the ground at the selfsame time he who suffered two falls should be adjudged conquered and lose his stake  asmund called these rules aloud in the presence of witnesses and ospakar and eric said that should bind them ospakar drew a small knife and gave it to his son gizur to hold  thou shalt soon know youngling how steel tastes in the eyeball he said  we shall soon know many things eric answered  now they drew off their cloaks and stood in the ring ospakar was great beyond the bigness of men and his arms were clothed with black hair like the limbs of a goat beneath the shoulder joint they were almost as thick as a girls thigh his legs also were mighty and the muscles stood out upon him in knotty lumps he seemed a very giant and fierce as a baresark but still somewhat round about the body and heavy in movement  from him men looked at eric  lo baldur and the troll said swanhild and everybody laughed since so it was indeed for if ospakar was black and hideous as a troll eric was beautiful as baldur the loveliest of the gods he was taller than ospakar by the half of a hand and as broad in the chest still he was not yet come to his greatest strength and though his limbs were well knit they seemed but as a childs against the limbs of ospakar but he was quick as a cat and lithe his neck and arms were white as whey and beneath his golden hair his bright eyes shone like spears  now they stood face to face with arms outstretched waiting the word of asmund he gave it and they circled round each other with arms held low presently ospakar made a rush and seizing eric about the middle tried to lift him but with no avail thrice he strove and failed then eric moved his foot and lo it slipped upon the sanded turf again eric moved and again he slipped a third time and he slipped a third time and before he could recover himself he was full on his back and fairly thrown  gudruda saw and was sad at heart and those around her said that it was easy to know how the game would end  what said i quoth swanhild that it would go badly with eric were ospakars arms about him  all is not done yet answered gudruda methinks erics feet slipped most strangely as though he stood on ice  but eric was very sore at heart and could make nothing of this matterfor he was not overthrown by strength  he sat on the snow and ospakar and his sons mocked him but gudruda drew near and whispered to him to be of good cheer for fortune might yet change  i think that i am bewitched said eric sadly my feet have no hold of the ground  gudruda covered her eyes with her hand and thought presently she looked up quickly i seem to see guile here she said now look narrowly on thy shoes  he heard and loosening his shoestring drew a shoe from his foot and looked at the sole the cold of the snow had hardened the fat and there it was all white upon the leather  now eric rose in wrath methought he cried that i dealt with men of honourable mind not with cheating tricksters see now it is little wonder that i slipped for grease has been set upon my shoesand by thor i will cleave the man who did it to the chin and as he said it his eyes blazed so dreadfully that folk fell back from him asmund took the shoes and looked at them then he spoke  brighteyes tells the truth and we have a sorry knave among us ospakar canst thou clear thyself of this ill deed  i will swear on the holy ring that i know nothing of it and if any man in my company has had a hand therein he shall die said ospakar  that we will swear also cried his sons gizur and mord  this is more like a womans work said gudruda and she looked at swanhild  it is no work of mine quoth swanhild  then go and ask thy mother of it answered gudruda  now all men cried aloud that this was the greatest shame and that the match must be set afresh only ospakar bethought him of that two hundred in silver which he had promised to groa and looked around but she was not there still he gainsaid eric in the matter of the match being set afresh  then eric cried out in his anger that he would let the game stand as it was since ospakar swore himself free of the shameful deed men thought this a mad saying but asmund said it should be so still he swore in his heart that even if he were worsted eric should not lose his eyeno not if swords were held aloft to take it for of all tricks this seemed to him the very worst  now ospakar and eric faced each other again in the ring but this time the feet of eric were bare  ospakar rushed to get the upper hold but eric was too swift for him and sprang aside again he rushed but eric dropped and gripped him round the middle now they were face to face hugging each other like bears but moving little for a time things went thus while ospakar strove to lift eric but in nowise could he stir him then of a sudden eric put out his strength and they staggered round the ring tearing at each other till their jerkins were rent from them leaving them almost bare to the waist suddenly eric seemed to give and ospakar put out his foot to trip him but brighteyes was watching he caught the foot in the crook of his left leg and threw his weight forward on the chest of blacktooth backward he went falling with the thud of a tree on snow and there he lay on the ground and eric over him  then men shouted a fall a fair fall and were very glad for the fight seemed most uneven to them and the wrestlers rolled asunder breathing heavily  gudruda threw a cloak over erics naked shoulders  that was well done brighteyes she said  the game is still to play sweet he gasped and ospakar is a mighty man i threw him by skill not by strength next time it must be by strength or not at all  now breathingtime was done and once more the two were face to face thrice ospakar rushed and thrice did eric slip away for he would waste blacktooths strength again ospakar rushed roaring like a bear and fire seemed to come from his eyes and the steam went up from him and hung upon the frosty air like the steam of a horse this time eric could not get away but was swept up into that great grip for ospakar had the lower hold  now there is an end of eric said swanhild  the arrow is yet on the bow answered gudruda  blacktooth put out his might and reeled round and round the ring dragging eric with him this way and that he twisted and time on time erics leg was lifted from the ground but so he might not be thrown now they stood almost still while men shouted madly for no such wrestling had been known in the southlands grimly they hugged and strove forsooth it was a mighty sight to see grimly they hugged and their muscles strained and cracked but they could stir each other no inch  ospakar grew fearful for he could make no play with this youngling black rage swelled in his heart he ground his fangs and thought on guile by his foot gleamed the naked foot of eric suddenly he stamped on it so fiercely that the skin burst  ill done ill done folk cried but in his pain eric moved his foot  lo he was down but not altogether down for he did but sit upon his haunches and still he clung to blacktooths thighs and twined his legs about his ankles now with all his strength ospakar strove to force the head of brighteyes to the ground but still he could not for eric clung to him like a creeper to a tree  a losing game for eric said asmund and as he spoke brighteyes was pressed back till his yellow hair almost swept the sand  then the folk of ospakar shouted in triumph but gudruda cried aloud  be not overthrown eric loose thee and spring aside  eric heard and of a sudden loosed all his grip he fell on his outspread hand then with a swing sideways and a bound once more he stood upon his feet ospakar came at him like a bull made mad with goading but he could no longer roar aloud they closed and this time eric had the better hold for a while they struggled round and round till their feet tore the frozen turf then once more they stood face to face now the two were almost spent yet blacktooth gathered up his strength and swung eric from his feet but he found them again he grew mad with rage and hugged him till brighteyes was nearly pressed to death and black bruises sprang upon the whiteness of his flesh ospakar grew mad and madder yet till at length in his fury he fixed his fangs in erics shoulder and bit till the blood spurted  ill kissed thou rat gasped eric and with the pain and rush of blood his strength came back to him he shifted his grip swiftly now his right hand was beneath the fork of blacktooths thigh and his left on the hollow of blacktooths back twice he liftedtwice the bulk of ospakar rose from the grounda third mighty liftso mighty that the wrapping on erics forehead burst and the blood streamed down his faceand lo great blacktooth flew in air up he flew and backward he fell into the bank of snow and was buried there almost to the knees     vi  how asmund the priest was betrothed to unna  for a moment there was silence for all that company was wonderstruck at the greatness of the deed then they cheered and cheered again and to eric it seemed that he slept and the sound of shouting reached him but faintly as though he heard through snow suddenly he woke and saw a man rush at him with axe aloft it was mord ospakars son mad at his fathers overthrow eric sprang aside or the blow had been his bane and as he sprang smote with his fist and it struck heavily on the head of mord above the ear so that the axe flew from his hand and he fell senseless on his father in the snow  now swords flashed out and men ringed round eric to guard him and it came near to the spilling of blood for the people of ospakar gnashed their teeth to see so great a hero overthrown by a youngling while the southern folk of middalhof and ran river rejoiced loudly for eric was dear to their hearts  down swords cried asmund the priest and haul yon carcass from the snow  this then they did and ospakar sat up breathing in great gasps the blood running from his mouth and ears and he was an evil sight to see for what with blood and snow and rage his face was like the face of the swinefell goblin  but swanhild spoke in the ear of gudruda  here she said looking at eric we two have a man worth loving fostersister  ay answered gudruda worth and well worth  now asmund drew near and before all men kissed eric brighteyes on the brow  in sooth he said thou art a mighty man eric and the glory of the south this i prophesy of thee that thou shalt do deeds such as have not been done in iceland thou hast ill been served for a knave unknown greased thy shoes yon swarthy ospakar the most mighty of all men in iceland could not overthrow thee though like a wolf he fastened his fangs in thee and like a coward stamped upon thy naked foot take thou the great sword that thou hast won and wear it worthily  now eric took snow and wiped the blood from his brow then he grasped whitefire and drew it from the scabbard and high aloft flashed the warblade thrice he wheeled it round his head then sang aloud       fast yestermorn down golden falls      fared young eric to thy feast      asmund father of gudruda      maid whom much he longs to clasp      but today on giant blacktooth      hath he done a needful deed      hurling him in heapedup snowdrift      winning whitefire for his wage  and again he sang       lord if in very truth thou thinkest      brighteyes is a man midst men      swear to him the stalwart suitor      handsel of thy sweet maids hand      whom long loved to win down goldfoss      swift he sped through frost and foam      whom to win to trolllike ogre      he gainst whitefire waged his eye  men thought this well sung and turned to hear asmunds answer nor must they wait long  eric he said i will promise thee this that if thou goest on as thou hast begun i will give gudruda in marriage to no other man  that is good tidings lord said eric  this i say further in a year i will give thee full answer according as to how thou dost bear thyself between now and then for this is no light gift thou askest also that if ye will it you twain may now plight troth for the blame shall be yours if it is broken and not mine and i give thee my hand on it  eric took his hand and gudruda heard her fathers words and happiness shone in her dark eyes and she grew faint for very joy and now eric turned to her all torn and bloody from the fray the great sword in his hand and he spoke thus  thou hast heard thy fathers words gudruda now it seems that there is no great need of trothplighting between us two still here before all men i ask thee if thou dost love me and art willing to take me to husband  gudruda looked up into his face and answered in a sweet clear voice that could be heard by all  eric i say to thee now what i have said before that i love thee alone of all men and if it be my fathers wish i will wed no other whilst thou dost remain true to me and hold me dear  those are good words said eric now in pledge of them swear this troth of thine upon my sword that i have won  gudruda smiled and taking great whitefire in her hand she said the words again and in pledge of them kissed the bright blade  then eric took back the warsword and spoke thus i swear that i will love thee and thee only gudruda the fair asmunds daughter whom i have desired all my days and if i fail of this my oath then our troth is at an end and thou mayst wed whom thou wilt and in turn he put his lips upon the sword while swanhild watched them do the oath  now ospakar was recovered from the fight and he sat there upon the snow with bowed head for he knew well that he had won the greatest shame and had lost both wife and sword black rage filled his heart as he listened and he sprang to his feet  i came hither asmund he said to ask this maid of thine in marriage and methinks that had been a good match for her and thee but i have been overthrown by witchcraft of this man in a wrestlingbout and thereby lost my good sword and now i must seem to hear him betrothed to the maid before me  thou hast heard aright ospakar said asmund and thy wooing is soon sped get thee back whence thou camest and seek a wife in thine own quarter for thou art unfit in age and aspect to have so sweet a maid moreover here in the south we hold men of small account however great and rich they be who do not shame to seek to overcome a foe by foul means with my own eyes i saw thee stamp on the naked foot of eric thorgrimurs son with my own eyes i saw thee like a wolf fasten that black fang of thine upon himthere is the mark of it and as for the matter of the greased shoes thou knowest best what hand thou hadst in it  i had no hand if any did this thing it was groa the witch thy finnish bedmate for the rest i was mad and know not what i did but hearken asmund ill shall befall thee and thy house and i will ever be thy foe moreover i will yet wed this maid of thine and now thou eric hearken also i will have another game with thee this one was but the sport of boys when we meet againand the time shall not be longswords shall be aloft and thou shalt learn the play of men i tell thee that i will slay thee and tear gudruda shrieking from thy arms to be my wife i tell thee that with yonder good sword whitefire i will yet hew off thy headand he choked and stopped  thou art much foam and little water said eric these things are easily put to proof if thou willest it tomorrow i will come with thee to a holmgang and there we may set the twigs and finish what we have begun today  i cannot do that for thou hast my sword and till i am suited with another weapon i may fight no holmgang still fear not we shall soon meet with weapons aloft and byrnie on breast  never too soon can the hour come blacktooth said eric and turning on his heel he limped to the hall to clothe himself afresh on the threshold of the mens door he met groa the witch  thou didst put grease upon my shoes carline and witchhag that thou art he said  it is not true brighteyes  there thou liest and for all this i will repay thee thou art not yet the wife of asmund nor shalt be for a plan comes into my head about it  groa looked at him strangely if thou speakest so take heed to thy meat and drink she said i was not born among the finns for nothing and know i am still minded to wed asmund for thy shoes i would to the gods that they were hellshoon and that i was now binding them on thy dead feet  oh the cat begins to spit said eric but know this thou mayest grease my shoesfit work for a carlinebut thou mayest never bind them on thou art a witch and wilt come to the end of witches and what thy daughter is that i will not say and he pushed past her and entered the hall  presently asmund came to seek eric there and prayed him to be gone to his stead on ran river the horses of ospakar had strayed and he must stop at middalhof till they were found but if these two should abide under the same roof bloodshed would come of it and that asmund knew  eric said yea to this and when he had rested a while he kissed gudruda and taking a horse rode away to coldback bearing the sword whitefire with him and for a time he saw no more of ospakar  when he came there his mother saevuna greeted him as one risen from the dead and hung about his neck then he told her all that had come to pass and she thought it a marvellous story and sorrowed that thorgrimur her husband was not alive to know it but eric mused a while and spoke  mother he said now my uncle thorod of greenfell is dead and his daughter my cousin unna has no home she is a fair woman and skilled in all things it comes into my mind that we should bid her here to dwell with us  why i thought thou wast betrothed to gudruda the fair said saevuna wherefore then wouldst thou bring unna hither  for this cause said eric because it seems that asmund the priest wearies of groa the witch and would take another wife and i wish to draw the bands between us tighter if it may befall so  groa will take it ill said saevuna  things cannot be worse between us than they are now therefore i do not fear groa he answered  it shall be as thou wilt son tomorrow we will send to unna and bid her here if it pleases her to come  now ospakar stayed three more days at middalhof till his horses were found and he was fit to travel for eric had shaken him sorely but he had no words with gudruda and few with asmund still he saw swanhild and she bid him to be of good cheer for he should yet have gudruda for now that the maid had passed from him the mind of ospakar was set in winning her björn also asmunds son spoke words of good comfort to him for he envied eric his great fame and he thought the match with blacktooth would be good and so at length ospakar rode away to swinefell with all his company but gizur his son left his heart behind  for swanhild had not been idle this while her heart was sore but she must follow her illnature and so she had put out her womans strength and beguiled gizur into loving her but she did not love him at all and the temper of asmund the priest was so angry that gizur dared not ask her in marriage so nothing was said of the matter   now unna came to coldback to dwell with saevuna erics mother and she was a fair and buxom woman she had been once wedded but within a month of her marriage her husband was lost at sea this two years gone at first gudruda was somewhat jealous of this coming of unna to coldback but eric showed her what was in his mind and she fell into the plan for she hated and feared groa greatly and desired to be rid of her  since this matter of the greasing of erics wrestlingshoes great loathing of groa had come into asmunds mind and he bethought him often of those words that his wife gudruda the gentle spoke as she lay dying and grieved that the oath which he swore then had in part been broken he would have no more to do with groa now but he could not be rid of her and notwithstanding her evil doings he still loved swanhild but groa grew thin with spite and rage and wandered about the place glaring with her great black eyes and people hated her more and more  now asmund went to visit at coldback and there he saw unna and was pleased with her for she was a blithe woman and a bonny the end of it was that he asked her in marriage of eric at which brighteyes was glad but said that he must know unnas mind unna hearkened and did not say no for though asmund was somewhat gone in years still he was an upstanding man wealthy in lands goods and moneys out at interest and having many friends so they plighted troth and the weddingfeast was to be in the autumn after hayharvest now asmund rode back to middalhof somewhat troubled at heart for these tidings must be told to groa and he feared her and her witchcraft in the hall he found her standing alone  where hast thou been lord she asked  at coldback he answered  to see unna erics cousin perchance  that is so  what is unna to thee then lord  this much that after hayharvest she will be my wife and that is ill news for thee groa  now groa turned and grasped fiercely at the air with her thin hands her eyes started out foam was on her lips and she shook in her fury like a birchtree in the wind looking so evil that asmund drew back a little way saying  now a veil is lifted from thee and i see thee as thou art thou hast cast a glamour over me these many years groa and it is gone  mayhap asmund asmundsonmayhap thou knowest me but i tell thee that thou shalt see me in a worse guise before thou weddest unna what have i borne the greatest shame lying by thy side these many years and shall i live to see a rival young and fair creep into my place with honour that i will not while runes have power and spells can conjure the evil thing upon thee i call down ruin on thee and thineyea and on brighteyes also for he has brought this thing to pass death take ye all may thy blood no longer run in mortal veins anywhere on the earth go down to hela asmund and be forgotten and she began to mutter runes swiftly  now asmund turned white with wrath cease thy evil talk he said or thou shalt be hurled as a witch into goldfoss pool  into goldfoss poolyea there i may lie i see iti seem to see this shape of mine rolling where the waters boil fiercestbut thine eyes shall never see it thy eyes are shut and shut are the eyes of unna for ye have gone beforei do but follow after and thrice groa shrieked aloud throwing up her arms then fell foaming on the sanded floor  an evil woman and a fey said asmund as he called people to her it had been better for me if i had never seen her dark face  now it is to be told that groa lay beside herself for ten full days and swanhild nursed her then she found her sense again and craved to see asmund and spoke thus to him  it seems to me lord if indeed it be aught but a vision of my dreams that before this sickness struck me i spoke mad and angry words against thee because thou hast plighted troth to unna thorods daughter  that is so in truth said asmund  i have to say this then lord that most humbly i crave thy pardon for my ill words and ask thee to put them away from thy mind sore heart makes sour speech and thou knowest well that howsoever great my faults at least i have always loved thee and laboured for thee and methinks that in some fashion thy fortunes are the debtor to my wisdom therefore when my ears heard that thou hadst of a truth put me away and that another woman comes an honoured wife to rule in middalhof my tongue forgot its courtesy and i spoke words that are of all words the farthest from my mind for i know well that i grow old and have put off that beauty with which i was adorned of yore and that held thee to me carline eric brighteyes named me and carline i aman old hag no more now forgive me and in memory of all that has been between us let me creep to my place in the ingle and still watch and serve thee and thine till my service is outworn out of rans net i came to thee and if thou drivest me hence i tell thee that i will lie down and die upon thy threshold and when thou sinkest into eld surely the memory of it shall grieve thee  thus she spoke and wept much till asmunds heart softened in him and though with a doubting mind he said it should be as she willed  so groa stayed on at middalhof and was lowly in her bearing and soft of speech     vii  how eric went up mosfell against skallagrim the baresark  now atli the good earl of the orkneys comes into the story  it chanced that atli had sailed to iceland in the autumn on a business about certain lands that had fallen to him in right of his mother helga who was an icelander and he had wintered west of reyjanes spring being come he wished to sail home and when his ship was bound he put to sea full early in the year but it chanced that bad weather came up from the southeast with mist and rain so he must needs beach his ship in a creek under shelter of the westman islands  now atli asked what people dwelt in these parts and when he heard the name of asmund asmundson the priest he was glad for in old days he and asmund had gone many a viking cruise together  we will leave the ship here he said till the weather clears and go up to middalhof to stay with asmund  so they made the ship snug and left men to watch her but two of the company with earl atli rode up to middalhof  it must be told of atli that he was the best of the earls who lived in those days and he ruled the orkneys so well that men gave him a byname and called him atli the good it was said of him that he had never turned a poor man away unsuccoured nor bowed his head before a strong man nor drawn his sword without cause nor refused peace to him who prayed it he was sixty years old but age had left few marks on him except that of his long white beard he was keeneyed and wellfashioned of form and face a great warrior and the strongest of men his wife was dead leaving him no children and this was a sorrow to him but as yet he had taken no other wife for he would say love makes an old man blind and when age runs with youth both shall fall and again mix grey locks and golden and spoil two heads for this earl was a man of many wise sayings  now atli came to middalhof just as men sat down to meat and hearing the clatter of arms all sprang to their feet thinking that perhaps ospakar had come again as he had promised but when asmund saw atli he knew him at once though they had not met for nearly thirty years and he greeted him lovingly and put him in the high seat and gave place to his men upon the crossbenches atli told all his story and asmund bade him rest a while at middalhof till the weather grew clearer  now the earl saw swanhild and thought the maid wondrous fair and so indeed she was as she moved scornfully to and fro in her kirtle of white soft was her curling hair and deep were her dark blue eyes and bent were her red lips as is a bow above her dimpled chin and her teeth shone like pearls  is that fair maid thy daughter asmund asked atli  she is named swanhild the fatherless he answered turning his face away  well said atli looking sharply on him were the maid sprung from me she would not long be called the fatherless for few have such a daughter  she is fair enough said asmund in all save temper and that is bad to cross  in every sword a flaw answers atli but what has an old man to do with young maids and their beauty and he sighed  i have known younger men who would seem less brisk at bridals said asmund and for that time they talked no more of the matter  now swanhild heard something of this speech and she guessed more and it came into her mind that it would be the best of sport to make this old man love her and then to mock him and say him nay so she set herself to the task as it ever was her wont and she found it easy for all day long with downcast eyes and gentle looks she waited upon the earl and now at his bidding she sang to him in a voice soft and low and now she talked so wisely well that atli thought no such maid had trod the earth before but he checked himself with many learned saws and on a day when the weather had grown fair and they sat alone he told her that his ship was bound for orkney isles  then as though by chance swanhild laid her white hand in his and on a sudden looked deep into his eyes and said with trembling lips ah go not yet lordi pray thee go not yetand turning she fled away  but atli was much moved and he said to himself now a strange thing is come to pass a fair maid loves an old man and yet methinks he who looks into those eyes sees deep waters and he beat his brow and thought  but swanhild in her chamber laughed till the tears ran from those same eyes for she saw that the great fish was hooked and now the time had come to play him  for she did not know that it was otherwise fated  gudruda too saw all these things and knew not how to read them for she was of an honest mind and could not understand how a woman may love a man as swanhild loved eric and yet make such play with other men and that of her free will for she guessed little of swanhilds guilefulness nor of the coldness of her heart to all save eric nor of how this was the only joy left to her to make a sport of men and put them to grief and shame atli said to himself that he would watch this maid well before he uttered a word to asmund and he deemed himself very cunning for he was wondrous cautious after the fashion of those about to fall so he set himself to watching and swanhild set herself to smiling and he told her tales of warfare and of daring and she clasped her hands and said  was there ever such a man since odin trod the earth and so it went on till the servingwomen laughed at the old man in love and the wit of her that mocked him   now upon a day eric having made an end of sowing his corn bethought himself of his vow to go up alone against skallagrim the baresark in his den on mosfell over by hecla now this was a heavy task for skallagrim was held so mighty among men that none went up against him any more and at times eric thought of gudruda and sighed for it was likely that she would be a widow before she was made a wife still his oath must be fulfilled and moreover of late skallagrim having heard that a youngling named eric brighteyes had vowed to slay him singlehanded had made of a mock of him in this fashion for skallagrim rode down to coldback on ran river and at nighttime took a lamb from the fold holding the lamb beneath his arm he drew near to the house and smote thrice on the door with his battleaxe and they were thundering knocks then he leapt on to his horse and rode off a space and waited presently eric came out but half clad a shield in one hand and whitefire in the other and looking by the bright moonlight he saw a huge blackbearded man seated on a horse having a great axe in one hand and the lamb beneath his arm  who art thou roared eric  i am called skallagrim youngling answered the man on the horse many men have seen me once none have wished to see me twice and some few have never seen aught again now it has been echoed in my ears that thou hast vowed a vow to go up mosfell against skallagrim the baresark and i am come hither to say that i will make thee right welcome see and with his axe he cut off the lambs tail on the pommel of his saddle of the flesh of this lamb of thine i will brew broth and of his skin i will make me a vest take thou this tail and when thou fittest it on to the skin again skallagrim will own a lord and he hurled the tail towards him  bide thou there till i can come to thee shouted eric it will spare me a ride to mosfell  nay nay it is good for lads to take the mountain air and skallagrim turned his horse away laughing  eric watched skallagrim vanish over the knoll and then though he was very angry laughed also and went in but first he picked up the tail and on the morrow he skinned it  now the time was come when the matter must be tried and eric bade farewell to saevuna his mother and unna his cousin and girt whitefire round him and set upon his head a golden helm with wings on it then he found the byrnie which his father thorgrimur had stripped together with the helm from that baresark who cut off his legand this was a good piece forged of the welshmenand he put it on his breast and taking a stout shield of bulls hide studded with nails rode away with one thrall the strong carle named jon  but the women misdoubted them much of this venture nevertheless eric might not be gainsayed  now the road to mosfell runs past middalhof and thither he came atli standing at the mens door saw him and cried aloud ho a mighty man comes here  swanhild looked out and saw eric and he was a goodly sight in his wargear for now week by week he seemed to grow more fair and great as the full strength of his manhood rose in him like sap in the spring grass and gudruda was very proud of her lover that night eric stayed at middalhof and sat hand in hand with gudruda and talked with earl atli now the heart of the old viking went out to eric and he took great delight in him and in his strength and deeds and he longed much that the gods had given him such a son  i prophesy this of thee brighteyes he cried that it shall go ill with this baresark thou seekestyes and with all men who come within sweep of that great sword of thine but remember this lad guard thy head with thy buckler cut low beneath his shield if he carries one and mow the legs from him for ever a baresark rushes on shield up  eric thanked him for his good words and went to rest but before it was light he rose and gudruda rose also and came into the hall and buckled his harness on him with her own hands  this is a sad task for me eric she sighed for how do i know that baresarks hands shall not loose this helm of thine  that is as it may be sweet he said but i fear not the baresark or any man how goes it with swanhild now  i know not she makes herself sweet to that old earl and he is fain of her and that is beyond my sight  i have seen as much said eric it will be well for us if he should wed her  ay and ill for him but it is to be doubted if that is in her mind  now eric kissed her soft and sweet and went away bidding her look for his return on the day after the morrow  gudruda bore up bravely against her fears till he was gone but then she wept a little    now it is to be told that eric and his thrall jon rode hard up stonefell and across the mountains and over the black sand till two hours before sunset they came to the foot of mosfell having hecla on their right it is a grim mountain grey with moss standing alone in the desert plain but between it and hecla there is good grassland  here is the foxs earth now to start him said eric  he knows something of the path by which this fortress can be climbed from the south and horses may be ridden up it for a space so on they go till at length they come to a flat place where water runs down the black rocks and here eric drank of the water ate food and washed his face and hands this done he bid jon tend the horsesfor hereabouts there is a little grassand be watchful till he returned since he must go up against skallagrim alone and there with a doubtful heart jon stayed all that night for of all that came to pass he saw but one thing and that was the light of whitefire as it flashed out high above him on the brow of the mountain when first brighteyes smote at foe  eric went warily up the baresark path for he would keep his breath in him and the light shone redly on his golden helm high he went till at length he came to a pass narrow and dark and hedged on either side with sheer cliffs such as two armed men might hold against a score he peered down this path but he saw no baresark though it was worn by baresark feet he crept along its length moving like a sunbeam through the darkness of the pass for the light gathered on his helm and sword till suddenly the path turned and he was on the brink of a gulf that seemed to have no bottom and looking across and down he could see jon and the horses more than a hundred fathoms beneath now eric must stop for this path leads but into the black gulf also he was perplexed to know where skallagrim had his lair he crept to the brink and gazed then he saw that a point of rock jutted from the sheer face of the cliff and that the point was worn with the mark of feet  where baresark passes there may yeoman follow said eric and sheathing whitefire without more ado though he liked the task little he grasped the overhanging rock and stepped down on to the point below now he was perched like an eagle over the dizzy gulf and his brain swam backward he feared to go and forward he might not for there was nothing but air beside him growing from the face of the cliff was a birchbush he grasped it to steady himself it bent beneath his clutch and then he saw behind it a hole in the rock through which a man could creep and down this hole ran footmarks  first through air like a bird now through earth like a fox said eric and entered the hole doubling his body till his helm almost touched his knee he took three paces and lo he stood on a great platform of rock so large that a hall might be built on it which curving inwards cannot be seen from the narrow pass this platform that is backed by the sheer cliff looks straight to the south and from it he could search the plain and the path that he had travelled and there once more he saw jon and the horses far below him  a strong place truly and well chosen said eric and looked around on the floor of the rock and some paces from him a turf fire still smouldered and by it were sheeps bones and beyond in the face of the overhanging precipice was the mouth of a cave  the wolf is at home or was but lately said eric now for his lair and with that he walked warily to the mouth of the cave and peered in he could see nothing yet a while but surely he heard a sound of snoring  then he crept in and presently by the red light of the burning embers he saw a great blackbearded man stretched at length upon a rug of sheepskins and by his side an axe  now it would be easy to make an end of this cavedweller thought eric but that is a deed i will not dono not even to a baresarkto slay him in his sleep and therewith he stepped lightly to the side of skallagrim and was about to prick him with the point of whitefire when as he did so another man sat up behind skallagrim  by thor for two i did not bargain said eric and sprang from the cave  then with a grunt of rage that baresark who was behind skallagrim came out like a shebear robbed of her whelps and ran straight at eric sword aloft eric gives before him right to the edge of the cliff then the baresark smites at him and brighteyes catches the blow on his shield and smites at him in turn so well and truly that the head of the baresark flies from his shoulders and spins along the ground but his body with outstretched arms yet gripping at the air falls over the edge of the gulf sheer into the water a hundred fathoms down it was the flash that whitefire made as it circled ere it smote that jon saw while he waited in the dell upon the mountain side but of the baresark he saw nothing for he passed down into the great fireriven cleft and was never seen more save once only in a strange fashion that shall be told this was the first man whom brighteyes slew  now the old tale tells that eric cried aloud little chance had this one and that then a wonderful thing came to pass for the head on the rock opened its eyes and answered  little chance indeed against thee eric brighteyes still i tell thee this that where my body fell there thou shalt fall and where it lies there thou shalt lie also  now eric was afraid for he thought it a strange thing that a severed head should speak to him  here it seems i have to deal with trolls he said but at the least though he speak this one shall strike no more and he looked at the head but it answered nothing  now skallagrim slept through it all and the light grew so dim that eric thought it time to make an end this way or that therefore he took the head of the slain man though he feared to touch it and rolled it swiftly into the cave saying now being so glib of speech go tell thy mate that eric brighteyes knocks at his door  then came sounds as of a man rising and presently skallagrim rushed forth with axe aloft and his fellows head in his left hand he was clothed in nothing but a shirt and the skin of erics lamb was bound to his chest  where now is my mate he said then he saw eric leaning on whitefire his golden helm ablaze with the glory of the passing sun  it seems that thou holdest somewhat of him in thine hand skallagrim and for the rest go seek it in yonder rift  who art thou roared skallagrim  thou mayest know me by this token said eric and he threw towards him the skin of that lambs tail which skallagrim had lifted from coldback  now skallagrim knew him and the baresark fit came on his eyes rolled foam flew to his lips his mouth grinned and he was awesome to see he let fall the head and swinging the great axe aloft rushed at eric but brighteyes is too swift for him it would not be well to let that stroke fall and it must go hard with aught it struck he springs forward he louts low and sweeps upwards with whitefire skallagrim sees the sword flare and drops almost to his knee guarding his head with the axe but whitefire strikes on the iron half of the axe and shears it in two so that the axehead falls to earth now the baresark is weaponless but unharmed and it would be an easy task to slay him as he rushes by but it came into erics mind that it is an unworthy deed to slay a swordless man and this came into his mind also that he desired to match his naked might against a baresark in his rage so in the hardihood of his youth and strength he cast whitefire aside and crying come try a fall with me baresark rushed on skallagrim  thou art mad yells the baresark and they are at it hard now they grip and rend and tear ospakar was strong but the baresark strength of skallagrim is more than the strength of ospakar and soon brighteyes thinks longingly on whitefire that he has cast aside eric is mighty beyond the might of men but he can scarcely hold his own against this mad man and very soon he knows that only one chance is left to him and that is to cling to skallagrim till the baresark fit be passed and he is once more like other men but this is easier to tell of than to do and presently strive as he will eric is on his back and skallagrim on him but still he holds the baresark as with bands of iron and skallagrim may not free his arms though he strive furiously now they roll over and over on the rock and the gloom gathers fast about them till presently eric sees that they draw near to the brink of that mighty rift down which the severed head of the cavedweller has foretold his fall  then we go together says eric but the baresark does not heed now they are on the very brink and here as it chances or as the norns decree a little rock juts up and this keeps them from falling eric is uppermost and strive as he will skallagrim may not turn him on his back again still brighteyes strength may not endure very long for he grows faint and his legs slip slowly over the side of the rift till now he clings as it were by his ribs and shoulderblades alone that rub against the little rock the light dies away and eric thinks on sweet gudruda and makes ready to die also when suddenly a last ray from the sun falls on the fierce face of skallagrim and lo brighteyes sees it change for the madness goes out of it and in a moment the baresark becomes but as a child in his mighty grip  hold said skallagrim i crave peace and he loosed his clasp  not too soon then gasped eric as drawing his legs from over the brink of the rift he gained his feet and staggering to his sword grasped it very thankfully  i am fordone said skallagrim come drag me from this place for i fall or if thou wilt hew off my head  i will not serve thee thus said eric thou art a gallant foe and he put out his hand and drew him into safety  for a while skallagrim lay panting then he gained his hands and knees and crawled to where eric leaned against the rock  lord he said give me thy hand  eric stretched forth his left hand wondering and skallagrim took it he did not stretch out his right for fearing guile he gripped whitefire in it  lord skallagrim said again of all men who ever were thou art the mightiest five other men had not stood before me in my rage but scorning thy weapon thou didst overcome me in the noblest fashion and by thy naked strength alone now hearken thou hast given me my life and it is thine from this hour to the end here i swear fealty to thee slay me if thou wilt or use me if thou wilt but i think it will be better for thee to do this rather than that for there is but one who has mastered me and thou art he and it is borne in upon my mind that thou wilt have need of my strength and that shortly  that may well be skallagrim said eric yet i put little trust in outlaws and cavedwellers how do i know if i take thee to me that thou wilt not murder me in my sleep as it would have been easy for me to do by thee but now  what is it that runs from thy arm asked skallagrim  blood said eric  stretch out thine arm lord  eric did so and the baresark put his lips to the scratch and sucked the blood then said  in this blood of thine i pledge thee eric brighteyes may valhalla refuse me and hela take me may i be hunted like a fox from earth to earth may trolls torment me and wizards sport with me o night may my limbs shrivel and my heart turn to water may my foes overtake me and my bones be crushed across the doomstoneif i fail in one jot from this my oath that i have sworn i will guard thy back i will smite thy enemies thy hearthstone shall be my temple thy honour my honour thrall am i of thine and thrall i will be and whiles thou wilt we will live one life and in the end we will die one death  it seems that in going to seek a foe i have found a friend said eric and it is likely enough that i shall need one skallagrim baresark and outlaw as thou art i take thee at thy word henceforth we are master and man and we will do many a deed side by side and in token of it i lengthen thy name and call thee skallagrim lambstail now if thou hast it give me food and drink for i am faint from that hug of thine old bear     viii  how ospakar blacktooth found eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail on horsehead heights  now skallagrim led eric to his cave and fed the fire and gave him flesh to eat and ale to drink when he had eaten his fill eric looked at the baresark he had black hair streaked with grey that hung down upon his shoulders his nose was hooked like an eagles beak his beard was wild and his sunken eyes were keen as a hawks he was somewhat bent and not over tall but of a mighty make for his shoulders must pass many a door sideways  thou art a great man said eric and it is something to have overcome thee now tell me what turned thee baresark  a shameful deed that was done against me lord ten years ago i was a yeoman of small wealth in the north i had but one good thing and that was the fairest housewife in those partsthorunna by nameand i loved her much but we had no children now not far from my stead is a place called swinefell and there dwells a mighty chief named ospakar blacktooth he is an evil man and strong  eric started at the name and then bade skallagrim take up the tale  it chanced that ospakar saw my wife thorunna and would take her but at first she did not listen then he promised her wealth and all good things and she was weary of our hard way of life and hearkened still she would not go away openly for that had brought shame on her but plotted with ospakar that he should come and take her as though by force so it came about as i lay heavily asleep one night at thorunnas side having drunk somewhat too deeply of the autumn ale that armed men seized me bound me and haled me from my bed there were eight of them and with them was ospakar then blacktooth bid thorunna rise clothe herself and come to be his may and she made pretence to weep at this but fell to it readily enough now she bound her girdle round her and to it a knife hung  kill thyself sweet i cried death is better than shame  not so husband she answered it is true that i love but thee yet a woman may find another love but not another life and i saw her laugh through her mock tears now ospakar rode in hot haste away to swinefell and with him went thorunna but his men stayed a while and drank my ale and as they drank they mocked me who was bound before them and little by little all the truth was told of the doings of ospakar and thorunna my housewife and i learned that it was she who had planned this sport then my eyes grew dark and i drew near to death from very shame and bitterness but of a sudden something leaped up in my heart fire raged before my eyes and voices in my ears called on to war and vengeance i was baresarkand like hay bands i burst my cords my axe hung on the wainscot i snatched it thence and of what befell i know this alone that when the madness passed eight men lay stretched out before me and all the place was but a gore of blood  then i drew the dead together and piled drinking tables over them and benches and turf and anything else that would burn and put cods oil on the pile and fired the stead above them so that the tale went abroad that all these men were burned in their cups and i with them  but i took the name of skallagrim and swore an oath against all men ay and women too and away i went to the woodfolk and worked much mischief for i spared few and so on to mosfell here i have stayed these five years awaiting the time when i shall find ospakar and thorunna the harlot and i have fought many men but till thou camest up against me none could stand before my might  a strange tale truly said eric but now hearken thou to a stranger for of a truth it seems that we have not come together by chance and he told him of gudruda and the wrestling and of the overthrow of blacktooth and showed him whitefire which he won out of the hand of ospakar  skallagrim listened and laughed aloud surely he said this is the work of the norns see lord thou and i will yet smite this ospakar he has taken my wife and he would take thy betrothed let it be let it be ah would that i had been there to see the wrestlingospakar had never risen from his snowbed but there is time left to us and i shall yet see his head roll along the dust thou hast his goodly sword and with it thou shalt sweep blacktooths head from his shouldersor perchance that shall be my lot and with this skallagrim sprang up gnashing his teeth and clutching at the air  peace said eric blacktooth is not here save thy rage until it can run along thy sword and strike him  nay not here nor yet so far off lord hearken i know this ospakar if he has set eyes of longing on gudruda asmunds daughter he will not rest one hour till he have her or is slain and if he has set eyes of hate on theethen take heed to thy going and spy down every path before thy feet tread it soon shall the matter come on for judgment and even now odins valkyries choose their own        the corsechoosing sisters who were bidden by odin to      single out those warriors whose hour had come to die in      battle and win valhalla  it is well then said eric  yea lord it is well for we two have little to fear from any six men if so be that they fall on us in fair fight but i do not altogether like thy tale too many women are mixed up in it and women stab in the back a man may deal with swords aloft but not with tricks and lies and false womens witchery it was a woman who greased thy wrestling soles mayhap it will be a woman that binds on thy hellshoes when all is doneay and who makes them ready for thy feet  of women as of men answered eric there is this to be said that some are good and some evil  yes lord and this also that the evil ones plot the ill of their evil but the good do it of their blind foolishness forswear women and so shalt thou live happy and die in honourcherish them and live in wretchedness and die an outcast  thy talk is foolish said eric birds must to the air the sea to the shore and man must to woman as things are so let them be for they will soon seem as though they had never been i had rather kiss my dear and die if so it pleases me to do than kiss her not and live for at the last the end will be one end and kisses are sweet  that is a good saying said skallagrim and they fell asleep side by side and eric had no fear  now they awoke and the light was already full for they were weary and their sleep had been heavy  hard by the mouth of the cave is a little well of water that gathers there from the rocks above and in this eric washed himself then skallagrim showed him the cave and the goodly store of arms that he had won from those whom he had slain and robbed  a wondrous place truly said eric and well fitted to the uses of such a chapman as thou art but say how didst thou find it   merchant  i followed him who was here before me and gave him choiceto go or to fight for the stronghold but he needs must fight and that was his bane for i slew him  who was that then asked eric whose head lies yonder  a cavedweller lord whom i took to me because of the lonesomeness of the winter tide he was an evil man for though it is good to be baresark from time to time yet to dwell with one who is always baresark is not good and thou didst a needful deed in smiting his head from himand now let it go to find its trunk and he rolled it over the edge of the great rift  knowest thou skallagrim that this head spoke to me after it had left the mans shoulders saying that where its body fell there i should fall and where it lay there i should lie also  then lord that is likely to be thy doom for this man was foresighted and but the night before last as we rode out to seek sheep he felt his head and said that before the sun sank again a hundred fathoms of air should link it to his shoulders  it may be so answered eric i thought as i lay in thy grip yonder that the fate was near and now arm thyself and take such goods as thou needest and let us hence for that thrall of mine who waits me yonder will think thou hast been too mighty for me  skallagrim went to the edge of the rift and searched the plain with his hawk eyes  no need to hasten lord he said see yonder rides thy thrall across the black sand and with him goes thy horse surely he thought thou camest no more down the path by which thou wentest up and it is not thralls work to seek skallagrim in his lair and ask for tidings  wolves take him for a fool said eric in anger he will ride to middalhof and sing my deathsong and that will sound sadly in some ears  it is pleasant lord said skallagrim when good tidings dog the heels of bad and womenfolk can spare some tears and be little poorer i have horses in a secret dell that i will show thee and on them we will ride hence to middalhofand there thou must claim peace for me  it is well said eric now arm thyself for if thou goest with me thou must make an end of thy baresark ways or keep them for the hour of battle  i will do thy bidding lord said skallagrim then he entered the cave and set a plain black steel helm upon his black locks and a black chain byrnie about his breast he took the great axehead also and fitted to it the half of another axe that lay among the weapons then he drew out a purse of money and a store of golden rings and set them in a bag of otter skin and buckled it about him but the other goods he wrapped up in skins and hid behind some stones which were at the bottom of the cavepurposing to come another time and fetch them  then they went forth by that same perilous path which eric had trod and skallagrim showed him how he might pass the rock in safety  a rough road this said eric as he gained the deep cleft  yea lord and till thou camest one that none but woodfolk have trodden  i would tread it no more said eric again and yet that fellow thief of thine said that i should die here and for a while his heart was heavy  now skallagrim lambstail led him by secret paths to a dell rich in grass that is hid in the round of the mountain and here three good horses were at feed then going to a certain rock he brought out bits and saddles and they caught the horses and mounting them rode away from mosfell    now eric and his henchman skallagrim the baresark rode four hours and saw nobody till at length they came to the brow of a hill that is named horsehead heights and crossing it found themselves almost in the midst of a score of armed men who were about to mount their horses  now we have company said skallagrim  yes and bad company answered eric for yonder i spy ospakar blacktooth and gizur and mord his sons ay and others down and back to back for they will show us little gentleness  then they sprang to earth and took their stand upon a mound of rising groundand the men rode towards them  i shall soon know what thy fellowship is worth said eric  fear not lord answered skallagrim hold thou thy head and i will hold thy back we are met in a good hour  good or ill it is likely to be a short one hearken thou if thou must turn baresark when swords begin to flash at the least stand and be baresark where thou art for if thou rushest on the foe my back will be naked and i must soon be sped  it shall be as thou sayest lord  now men rode round them but at first they did not know eric because of the golden helm that hid his face in shadow  who are ye called ospakar  i think that thou shouldst know me blacktooth eric answered for i set thee heels up in the snow but latelyor at the least thou wilt know this and he drew great whitefire  thou mayest know me also ospakar cried the baresark skallagrim men called me lambstail eric brighteyes calls me but once thou didst call me ounound say lord what tidings of thorunna  now ospakar shook his sword laughing i came out to seek one foe and i have found two he cried hearken eric when thou art slain i go hence to burn and kill at middalhof shall i bear thy head as keepsake from thee to gudruda for thee ounound i thought thee dead but being yet alive thorunna my sweet love sends thee this and he hurled a spear at him with all his might  but skallagrim catches the spear as it flies and hurls it back it strikes right on the shield of ospakar and pierces it ay and the byrnie and the shoulder that is beneath the byrnie so that blacktooth was made unmeet for fight and howled with pain and rage  go bid thorunna draw that splinter forth says skallagrim and heal the hole with kisses  now ospakar writhing with his hurt shouts to his men to slay the two of them and then the fight begins  one rushes at eric and smites at him with an axe the blow falls on his shield and shears off the side of it then strikes the byrnie beneath but lightly in answer eric sweeps low at him with whitefire and cuts his leg from under him between knee and thigh and he falls and dies  another rushes in down flashes whitefire before he can smite and the carles shield is cloven through then he chooses to draw back and fights no more that day  skallagrim slays a man and wounds another sore a tall chief with a red scar on his face comes at brighteyes twice he feints at the head while eric watches then lowers the sword beneath the cover of his shield and sweeps suddenly at erics legs brighteyes leaps high into the air smiting downward with whitefire as he leaps and presently that chief is dead shorn through shoulder to breast  now skallagrim slays another man and grows baresark he looks so fierce that men fall back from him  two rush on eric one from either side the sword of him on the right falls on his shield and sinks in but brighteyes twists the shorn shield so strongly that the sword is wrenched from the smiters hand now the other sword is aloft above him and that had been erics bane but skallagrim glances round and sees it about to fall he has no time to turn but dashes the hammer of his axe backward it falls full on the swordsmans head and the head is shattered  that was well done says eric as the sword goes down  not so ill but it might be worse growls skallagrim  presently all men drew back from those two for they have had enough of whitefire and the baresarks axe  ospakar sits on his horse his shield pinned to his shoulder and curses aloud  close in you cowards he yells close in and cut them down but no man stirs  then eric mocks them there are but two of us he says will no man try a game with me let it not be sung that twenty were overcome of two  now ospakars son mord hears and he grows mad with rage he holds his shield aloft and rushes on but gizur the lawman does not come for gizur was a coward  skallagrim turns to meet mord but eric says  this one for me comrade and steps forward  mord strikes a mighty blow erics shield is all shattered and cannot stay it it crashes through and falls full on the golden helm beating brighteyes to his knee now he is up again and blows fall thick and fast mord is a strong man unwearied and skilled in war and erics arms grow faint and his strength sinks low mord smites again and wounds him somewhat on the shoulder  eric throws aside his cloven shield and shouting plies whitefire with both arms mord gives before him then rushes and smites eric leaps aside again he rushes and lo brighteyes has dropped his point and it stands a full span through the back of mord and instantly that was his bane  now men rush to their horses mount in hot haste and ride away crying that these are trolls whom they have to do with here not men skallagrim sees and the baresark fit takes him sore with axe aloft he charges after them screaming as he comes there is one man the same whom he had wounded he cannot mount easily and when the baresark comes he still lies on the neck of his horse the great axe wheels on high and falls and it is told of this stroke that it was so mighty that man and horse sank dead beneath it cloven through and through then the fit leaves skallagrim and he walks back and they are alone with the dead and dying  eric leans on whitefire and speaks  get thee gone skallagrim lambstail he said get thee gone  it shall be as thou wilt lord answered the baresark but i have not befriended thee so ill that thou shouldst fear for blows to come  i will keep no man with me who puts my word aside skallagrim what did i bid thee was it not that thou shouldst have done with the baresark ways and where thou stoodest there thou shouldst bide and see thou didst forget my word swiftly now get thee gone  it is true lord he said he who serves must serve wholly and skallagrim turned to seek his horse  stay said eric thou art a gallant man and i forgive thee but cross my will no more we have slain several men and ospakar goes hence wounded we have got honour and they loss and the greatest shame nevertheless ill shall come of this to me for ospakar has many friends and will set a lawsuit on foot against me at the althing and thou didst draw the first blood        the annual assembly of free men which in iceland      performed the functions of a parliament and supreme court of      law  would that the spear had gone more home said skallagrim  ospakars time is not yet answered eric still he has something by which to bear us in mind     ix  how swanhild dealt with gudruda  now jon erics thrall watched all night on mosfell but saw nothing except the light of whitefire as it smote the baresarks head from his shoulders he stayed there till daylight much afraid then making sure that eric was slain jon rode hard and fast for middalhof whither he came at evening  gudruda was watching by the womens door she strained her eyes towards mosfell to catch the light gleaming on erics golden helm and presently it gleamed indeed white not red  see said swanhild at her side eric comes  not eric but his thrall answered gudruda to tell us that eric is sped  they waited in silence while jon galloped towards them  what news of brighteyes cried swanhild  little need to ask said gudruda look at his face  now jon told his tale and gudruda listened clinging to the door post but swanhild cursed him for a coward so that he shrank before her eyes  gudruda turned and walked into the hall and her face was like the face of death men saw her and asmund asked why she wore so strange a mien then gudruda sang this song       up to mosfell battle eager      rode helmed brighteyen to the fray      back from mosfell battle shunning      slunk yon coward thrall i ween      now shall maid gudruda never      know a husbands dear embrace      widowed is shesunk in sorrow      eric treads valhallas halls  and with this she walked from the stead looking neither to the right nor to the left  let the maid be said atli the earl grief fares best alone but my heart is sore for eric it should go ill with that baresark if i might get a grip of him  that i will have before summer is gone said asmund for the death of eric seemed to him the worst of sorrows  gudruda walked far and crossing laxà by the stepping stones climbed stonefell till she came to the head of golden falls for like a stricken thing she desired to be alone in her grief but swanhild saw her and followed coming on her as she sat watching the water thunder down the mighty cleft presently swanhilds shadow fell athwart her and gudruda looked up  what wouldst thou with me swanhild she asked art thou come to mock my grief  nay fostersister for then i must mock my own i come to mix my tears with thine see we loved eric thou and i and eric is dead let our hate be buried in his grave whence neither may draw him back  gudruda looked upon her coldly for nothing could stir her now  get thee gone she said weep thine own tears and leave me to weep mine not with thee will i mourn eric  swanhild frowned and bit her lip i will not come to thee with words of peace a second time my rival she said eric is dead but my hate that was born of erics love for thee lives on and grows and its flower shall be thy death gudruda  now that brighteyes is dead i would fain follow on his path so if thou listest throw the gates wide gudruda answered and heeded her no more  swanhild went but not far on the further side of a knoll of grass she flung herself to earth and grieved as her fierce heart might she shed no tears but sat silently looking with empty eyes adown the past and onward to the future and finding no good therein  but gudruda wept as the weight of her loss pressed in upon herwept heavy silent tears and cried in her heart to eric who was gonecried to death to come upon her and bring her sleep or eric  so she sat and so she grieved till quite outworn with sorrow sleep stole upon her and she dreamed gudruda dreamed that she was dead and that she sat nigh to the golden door that is in odins house at valhalla by which the warriors pass and repass for ever there she sat from age to age listening to the thunder of ten thousand thousand tramping feet and watching the fierce faces of the chosen as they marched out in armies to do battle in the meads and as she sat at length a oneeyed man clad in gleaming garments drew near and spoke to her he was glorious to look on and old and she knew him for odin the allfather  whom seekest thou maid gudruda he asked and the voice he spoke with was the voice of waters  i seek eric brighteyes she answered who passed hither a thousand years ago and for love of whom i am heartbroken  eric brighteyes thorgrimurs son quoth odin i know him well no brisker warrior enters at valhallas doors and none shall do more service at the coming of grey wolf fenrir pass on and leave him to his glory and his god   the foe destined to bring destruction on the norse gods  then in her dream she wept sore and prayed of odin by the name of freya that he would give eric to her for a little space  what wilt thou pay then maid gudruda said odin  my life she answered  good he said for a night eric shall be thine then die and let thy death be his cause of death and odin sang this song       now corsechoosing daughters hearken      to the dread allfathers word      when the gale of spears breath gathers      count not eric midst the slain      till brighteyen once hath slumbered      wedded at gudrudas side      then maidens scream your battle call      whelmed with foes let eric fall  and gudruda awoke but in her ears the mighty waters still seemed to speak with odins voice saying       then maidens scream your battle call      whelmed with foes let eric fall  she awoke from that fey sleep and looked upwards and lo before her with shattered shield and all besmeared with wars red rain stood goldhelmed eric there he stood great and beautiful to see and she looked on him trembling and amazed  is it indeed thou eric or is it yet my dream she said  i am no dream surely said eric but why lookest thou thus on me gudruda  she rose slowly methought she said methought that thou wast dead at the hand of skallagrim and with a great cry she fell into his arms and lay there sobbing  it was a sweet sight thus to see gudruda the fair her head of gold pillowed on erics warstained byrnie her dark eyes afloat with tears of joy but not so thought swanhild watching she shook in jealous rage then crept away and hid herself where she could see no more lest she should be smitten with madness  whence camest thou ah whence camest thou said gudruda i thought thee dead my love but now i dreamed that i prayed odin and he spared thee to me for a little  well and that he hath though hardly and he told her all that had happened and how as he rode with skallagrim who yet sat yonder on his horse he caught sight of a woman seated on the grass and knew the colour of the cloak  then gudruda kissed him for very joy and they were happy each with eachfor of all things that are sweet on earth there is nothing more sweet that this to find him we loved and thought dead and cold alive and at our side  and so they talked and were very glad with the gladness of youth and love till eric said he must on to middalhof before the light failed for he could not come on horseback the way that gudruda took but must ride round the shoulder of the hill and moreover he was spent with toil and hunger and skallagrim grew weary of waiting  go said gudruda i will be there presently  so he kissed her and went and swanhild saw the kiss and saw him go  well lord said skallagrim hast thou had thy fill of kissing  not altogether answered eric  they rode a while in silence  i thought the maid seemed very fair said skallagrim  there are women less favoured skallagrim  rich bait for mighty fish said skallagrim this i tell thee that strive as thou mayest against thy fate that maid will be thy bane and mine also  things foredoomed will happen said eric but if thou fearest a maid the cure is easy depart from my company  who was the other asked the baresarkshe who crept and peered listened then crept back again hid her face in her hands and talked with a grey wolf that came to her like a dog  that must have been swanhild said eric but i did not see her ever does she hide like a rat in the thatch and as for the wolf he must be her familiar for like groa her mother swanhild plays much with witchcraft now i will away back to gudruda for my heart misdoubts me of this matter stay thou here till i come lambstail and eric turns and gallops back to the head of goldfoss    when eric left her gudruda drew yet nearer to the edge of the mighty falls and seated herself on their very brink her breast was full of joy and there she sat and let the splendour of the night and the greatness of the rushing sounds sink into her heart yonder shone the setting sun poised as it were on westmans distant peaks and here sped the waters and by that path eric had come back to her yea and there on sheepsaddle was the road that he had trod down goldfoss and but now he had slain one baresark and won another to be his thrall and they two alone had smitten the company of ospakar and come thence with honour and but little harmed surely no such man as eric had ever livednone so fair and strong and tender and she was right happy in his love she stretched out her arms towards him whom but an hour gone she had thought dead but who had lived to come back to her with honour and blessed his beloved name and laughed aloud in her joyousness of heart calling  eric eric  but swanhild creeping behind her did not laugh she heard gudrudas voice and guessed gudrudas gladness and jealousy arose within her and rent her should this fair rival like to take her joy from her  grey wolf grey wolf what sayest thou  see now if gudruda were gone if she rolled a corpse into those boiling waters eric might yet be hers or if he was not hers yet gudrudas he could never be  grey wolf grey wolf what is thy counsel  right on the brink of the great gulf sat gudruda one stroke and all would be ended eric had gone there was no eye to seenone save the grey wolfs there was no tongue to tell the deed that might be done who could call her to account the gods who were the gods what were the gods were they not dreams there were no gods save the gods of evilthe gods she knew and communed with  grey wolf grey wolf what is thy rede  there sat gudruda laughing in the triumph of her joy with the sunsetglow shining on her beauty and there behind her swanhild creptcrept like a fox upon his sleeping prey  now she is there  i hear thee grey wolf back to my breast grey wolf  surely gudruda heard something she half turned her head then again fell to calling aloud to the waters  eric beloved ericah is there ever a light like the light of thine eyesis there ever a joy like the joy of thy kiss  swanhild heard and her springs of mercy froze hate and fury entered into her she rose upon her knees and gathered up her strength  seek then thy joy in goldfoss she cried aloud and with all her force she thrust  gudruda fell a fathom or more then with a cry she clutched wildly at a little ledge of rock and hung there her feet resting on the shelving bank thirty fathoms down swirled and poured and rolled the waters of the golden falls a fathom above red in the red light of evening lowered the pitiless face of swanhild gudruda looked beneath her and saw pale with agony she looked up and saw but she said naught  let go my rival let go cried swanhild there is none to help thee and none to tell thy tale let go i say and seek thy marriagebed in goldfoss  but gudruda clung on and gazed upwards with white face and piteous eyes  what art thou so fain of a moments life said swanhild then i will save thee from thyself for it must be ill to suffer thus and she ran to seek a rock now she finds one and staggering beneath its weight to the brink of the gulf peers over still gudruda hangs space yawns beneath her the waters roar in her ears the red sky glows above she sees swanhild come and shrieks aloud  eric is there though swanhild hears him not for the sound of his horses galloping feet is lost in the roar of waters but that cry comes to his ears he sees the poised rock and all grows clear to him he leaps from his horse and even as she looses the stone clutches swanhilds kirtle and hurls her back the rock bounds sideways and presently is lost in the waters  eric looks over he sees gudrudas white face gleaming in the gloom down he leaps upon the ledge though this is no easy thing  hold fast i come hold fast he cries  i can no more gasps gudruda and one hand slips  eric grasps the rock and stretching downward grips her wrist just as her hold loosens he grips it and she swings loose her weight hanging on his arm  now he must needs lift her up and that with one hand for the ledge is narrow and he dare not loose his hold of the rock above she swings over the great gulf and she is senseless as one dead he gathers all his mighty strength and lifts his feet slip a little then catch and once more gudruda swings the sweat bursts out upon his forehead and his blood drums through him now it must be or not at all again he lifts and his muscles strain and crack and she lies beside him on the narrow ledge  all is not yet done the brink of the cleft is the height of a man above him there he must lay her for he may not leave her to find aid lest she should wake and roll into the chasm loosing his hold of the cliff he turns facing the rock and bending over gudruda twists his hands in her kirtle below the breast and above the knee then once more eric puts out his might and draws her up to the level of his breast and rests again with all his force he lifts her above the crest of his helm and throws her forward so that now she lies upon the brink of the great cliff he almost falls backward at the effort but clutching the rock he saves himself and with a struggle gains her side and lies there panting like a wearied hound of chase  of all trials of strength that ever were put upon his might eric was wont to say this lifting of gudruda was the greatest for she was no light woman and there was little to stand on and almost nothing to cling to  presently brighteyes rose and peered at gudruda through the gloom she still swooned then he gazed about himbut swanhild the witchgirl was gone  then he took gudruda in his arms and leading the horse stumbled through the darkness calling on skallagrim the baresark answered and presently his large form was seen looming in the gloom  eric told his tale in few words  the ways of womankind are evil said skallagrim but of all the deeds that i have known done at their hands this is the worst it had been well to hurl the wolfwitch from the cliff  ay well said eric but that song must yet be sung  now dimly lighted of the rising moon by turns they bore gudruda down the mountain side till at length utterly fordone they saw the fires of middalhof     x  how asmund spoke with swanhild  now as the days went though atlis ship was bound for sea she did not sail and it came about that the earl sank ever deeper in the toils of swanhild he called to mind many wise saws but these availed him little for when love rises like the sun wisdom melts like the mists so at length it came to this that on the day of erics coming back atli went to asmund the priest and asked him for the hand of swanhild the fatherless in marriage asmund heard and was glad for he knew well that things went badly between swanhild and gudruda and it seemed good to him that seas should be set between them nevertheless he thought it honest to warn the earl that swanhild was apart from other women  thou dost great honour earl to my fosterdaughter and my house he said still it behoves me to move gently in this matter swanhild is fair and she shall not go hence a wife undowered but i must tell thee this that her ways are dark and secret and strange and fiery are her moods and i think that she will bring evil on the man who weds her now i love thee atli were it only for our youths sake and thou art not altogether fit to mate with such a maid for age has met thee on thy way for as thou wouldst say youth draws to youth as the tide to the shore and falls away from eld as the wave from the rock think then is it well that thou shouldst take her atli  i have thought much and overmuch answered the earl stroking his grey beard but ships old and new drive before a gale  ay atli and the new ship rides where the old one founders  a true rede a heavy rede asmund yet i am minded to sail this sea and if it sink mewell i have known fair weather great longing has got hold of me and i think the maid looks gently on me and that things may yet go well between us i have many things to give such as women love at the least if thou givest me thy good word i will risk it asmund for the bold thrower sometimes wins the stake only i say this that if swanhild is unwilling let there be an end of my wooing for i do not wish to take a bride who turns from my grey hairs  asmund said that it should be so and they made an end of talking just as the light faded  now asmund went out seeking swanhild and presently he met her near the stead he could not see her face and that was well for it was not good to look on but her mien was wondrous wild  where hast thou been swanhild he asked  mourning eric brighteyes she made answer  it is meeter for gudruda to mourn over eric than for thee for her loss is heavy asmund said sternly what hast thou to do with eric  little or much or allread it as thou wilt fosterfather still all wept for are not lost nor all who are lost wept for  little do i know of thy dark redes said asmund where is gudruda now  high is she or low sleeping or perchance awakened naught reck i she also mourned for eric and we went nigh to mingling tearsnear together were brown curls and golden and she laughed aloud  thou art surely fey thou evil girl said asmund  ay fosterfather fey yet is this but the first of my feydom here starts the road that i must travel and my feet shall be red ere the journeys done  leave thy dark talk said asmund for to me it is as the winds song and listen a good thing has befallen theeay good beyond thy deserving  is it so well i stand greatly in need of good what is thy tidings fosterfather  this atli the earl asks thee in marriage and he is a mighty man well honoured in his own land and set higher moreover than i had looked for thee  ay answered swanhild set like the snow above the fells set in the years that long are dead nay fosterfather this whitebearded dotard is no mate for me what shall i mix my fire with his frost my breathing youth with the creeping palsy of his age never if swanhild weds she weds not so for it is better to go maiden to the grave than thus to shrink and wither at the touch of eld now is atlis wooing sped and theres an end  asmund heard and grew wroth for the matter seemed strange to him nor are maidens wont thus to put aside the word of those set over them  there is no end he said i will not be answered thus by a girl who lives upon my bounty it is my rede that thou weddest atli or else thou goest hence i have loved thee and for that loves sake i have borne thy wickedness thy dark secret ways and evil words but i will be crossed no more by thee swanhild  thou wouldst drive me hence with groa my mother though perchance thou hast yet more reason to hold me dear fosterfather fear not i will goperhaps further than thou thinkest and once more swanhild laughed and passed from him into the darkness  but asmund stood looking after her truly he said in his heart ill deeds are arrows that pierce him who shot them i have sowed evilly and now i reap the harvest what means she with her talk of gudruda and the rest  now as he thought he saw men and horses draw near and one man whose helm gleamed in the moonlight bore something in his arms  who passes he called  eric brighteyes skallagrim lambstail and gudruda asmunds daughter answered a voice who art thou  then asmund the priest sprang forward most glad at heart for he never thought to see eric again  welcome and thrice welcome art thou eric he cried for know we deemed thee dead  i have lately gone near to death lord said eric for he knew the voice but i am hale and whole though somewhat weary  what has come to pass then asked asmund and why holdest thou gudruda in thy arms is the maid dead  nay she does but swoon see even now she stirs and as he spake gudruda awoke shuddering and with a little cry threw her arms about the neck of eric  he set her down and comforted her then once more turned to asmund  three things have come about he said first i have slain one baresark and won another to be my thrall and for him i crave thy peace for he has served me well next we two were set upon by ospakar blacktooth and his fellowship and fighting for our hands have wounded ospakar slain mord his son and six other men of his following  that is good news and bad said asmund since ospakar will ask a great weregild for these men and thou wilt be outlawed eric   the penalty for manslaying  that may happen lord there is time enough to think of it now there are other tidings to tell coming to the head of goldfoss i found gudruda my betrothed mourning my death and spoke with her afterwards i left her and presently returned again to see her hanging over the gulf and swanhild hurling rocks upon her to crush her  these are tidings in truth said asmundsuch tidings as my heart feared is this true gudruda  it is true my father answered gudruda trembling as i sat on the brink of goldfoss swanhild crept behind me and thrust me into the gulf there i clung above the waters and she brought a rock to hurl upon me when suddenly i saw erics face and after that my mind left me and i can tell no more  now asmund grew as one mad he plucked at his beard and stamped on the ground maid though she be he cried yet shall swanhilds back be broken on the stone of doom for a witch and a murderess and her body hurled into the pool of faithless women and the earth will be well rid of her  now gudruda looked up and smiled it would be ill to wreak such a vengeance on her father she said and this would also bring the greatest shame on thee and all our house i am saved by the mercy of the gods and the might of erics arm and this is my counsel that nothing be told of this tale but that swanhild be sent away where she can harm us no more  she must be sent to the grave then said asmund and fell to thinking presently he spoke again bid yon man fall back i would speak with you twain and skallagrim went grumbling  hearken now eric and gudruda only an hour ago hath atli the good asked swanhild of me in marriage but now i met swanhild here and her mien was wild still i spoke of the matter to her and she would have none of it now this is my counsel that choice be given to swanhild either that she go hence atlis wife or take her trial in the doomring  that will be bad for the earl then said eric methinks he is too good a man to be played on thus  bairn first then friend answered asmund  now i will tell thee something that till this hour i have hidden from all for it is my shame this swanhild is my daughter and therefore i have loved her and put away her evil deeds and she is halfsister to thee gudruda see then how sore is my straight who must avenge daughter upon daughter  knows thy son björn of this asked eric  none knew it till this hour except groa and i  yet i have feared it long father said gudruda and therefore i have also borne with swanhild though she hates me much and has striven hard to draw my betrothed from me now thou canst only take one counsel and it is to give choice to swanhild of these two things though it is unworthy that atli should be deceived and at the best little good can come of it  yet it must be done for honour is often slain of heavy need said asmund but we must first swear this baresark thrall of thine though little faith lives in baresarks breast  now eric called to skallagrim and charged him strictly that he should tell nothing of swanhild and of the wolf that he saw by her and of how gudruda was found hanging over the gulf  fear not growled the baresark my tongue is now my masters what is it to me if women do their wickedness one on another let them work magic hate and slay by stealth so shall evil be lessened in the world  peace said eric if anything of this passes thy lips thou art no longer a thrall of mine and i give thee up to the men of thy quarter  and i cleave that wolfs head of thine down to thy hawks eyes but otherwise i give thee peace and will hold thee from harm wooddweller as thou art said asmund  the baresark laughed my hands will hold my head against ten such mannikins as thou art priest there was never but one man who might overcome me in fair fight and there he stands and his bidding is my law so waste no words and make not niddering threats against greater folk and he slouched back to his horse  a mighty man and a rough said asmund looking after him i like his looks little  natheless a strong in battle quoth eric had he not been at my back some six hours gone by now the ravens had torn out these eyes of mine therefore for my sake bear with him  asmund said it should be so and then they passed on to the stead  here eric stripped off his harness washed and bound up his wounds then followed by skallagrim axe in hand he came into the hall as men made ready to sit at meat now the tale of the mighty deeds that he had done except that of the saving of gudruda had gone abroad and as brighteyes came all men rose and with one voice shouted till the roof of the great hall rocked  welcome eric brighteyes thou glory of the south  only björn asmunds son bit his hand and did not shout for he hated eric because of the fame that he had won  brighteyes stood still till the clamour died then said  much noise for little deeds brethren it is true that i overthrew the mosfell baresarks see here is one and he turned to skallagrim i strangled him in my arms on mosfells brink and that was something of a deed then he swore fealty to me and we are bloodbrethren now and therefore i ask peace for him comradeseven from those whom he has wronged or whose kin he has slain i know this that when thereafter we stood back to back and met the company of ospakar blacktooth who came to slay usay and asmund also and bear away gudruda to be his wifehe warred right gallantly till seven of their band lay stiff on horsehead heights overthrown of us and among them mord blacktooths son and ospakar himself went thence sore smitten of this skallagrim therefore for my sake do no harm to this man who was baresark but now is my thrall and moreover i beg the aid and friendship of all men of this quarter in those suits that will be laid against me at the althing for these slayings which i hereby give out as done by my hand and by the hand of skallagrim lambstail the baresark  at these words all men shouted again but atli the earl sprang from the high seat where asmund had placed him and coming to eric kissed him and drawing a gold chain from his neck flung it about the neck of eric crying  thou art a glorious man eric brighteyes i thought the world had no more of such a breed listen to my bidding come thou to the earldom in orkneys and be a son to me and i will give thee all good gifts and when i die thou shalt sit in my seat after me  but eric thought of swanhild who must go from iceland as wife to atli and answered  thou doest me great honour earl but this may not be where the fir is planted there it must grow and fall iceland i love and i will stay here among my own people till i am driven away  that may well happen then said atli for be sure ospakar and his kin will not let the matter of these slayings rest and i think that it will not avail thee much that thou smotest for thine own hand then come thou and be my man  where the norns lead there i must follow said eric and sat down to meat skallagrim sat down also at the sidebench but men shrank from him and he glowered on them in answer  presently gudruda entered and she seemed pale and faint  when he had done eating eric drew gudruda on to his knee and she sat there resting her golden head upon his breast but swanhild did not come into the hall though ever earl atli sought her dark face and lovely eyes of blue and he wondered greatly how his wooing had sped still at this time he spoke no more of it to asmund  now skallagrim drank much ale and glared about him fiercely for he had this fault that at times he was drunken in front of him were two thralls of asmunds they were brothers and largemade men and they watched asmunds sheep upon the fells in winter these two also grew drunk and jeered at skallagrim asking him what atonement he would make for those ewes of asmunds that he had stolen last yule and how it came to pass that he a baresark had been overthrown of an unarmed man  skallagrim bore their gibes for a space as he drank on but suddenly he rose and rushed at them and seizing a mans throat in either hand thrust them to the ground beneath him and nearly choked them there  then eric ran down the hall and putting out his strength tore the baresark from them  this then is thy peacefulness thou wolf eric cried thou art drunk  ay growled skallagrim ale is many a mans doom  have a care that it is not thine and mine then said eric go sleep and know that if i see thee thus once more i see thee not again    but after this men jeered no more at skallagrim lambstail erics thrall     xi  how swanhild bid farewell to eric  now all this while asmund sat deep in thought but when at length men were sunk in sleep he took a candle of fat and passed to the shut bed where swanhild slept alone she lay on her bed and her curling hair was all about her she was awake for the light gleamed in her blue eyes and on a naked knife that was on the bed beside her half hidden by her hair  what wouldst thou fosterfather she asked rising in the couch asmund closed the curtains then looked at her sternly and spoke in a low voice  thou art fair to be so vile a thing swanhild he said who now would have dreamed that heart of thine could talk with goblins and with werewolvesthat those eyes of thine could bear to look on murder and those white hands find strength to do the sin  she held up her shapely arms and looking on them laughed would that they had been fashioned in a stronger mould she said may they wither in their womans weakness else had the deed been done outright now my crime is as heavy upon me and nothing gained by it say what fate for me fosterfatherthe stone of doom and the pool where faithless women lie ah then might gudruda laugh indeed and i will not live to hear that laugh see and she gripped the dagger at her side along this bright edge runs the path to peace and freedom and if need be i will tread it  be silent said asmund this gudruda my daughter whom thou wouldst have foully done to death is thine own sister and it is she who pitying thee hath pleaded for thy life  i will naught of her pity who have no pity she answered and this i say to thee who art my father shame be on thee who hast not dared to own thy child  hadst thou not been my child swanhild and had i not loved thee secretly as my child be sure of this i had long since driven thee hence for my eyes have been open to much that i have not seemed to see but at length thy wickedness has overcome my love and i will see thy face no more listen none have heard of this shameful deed of thine save those who saw it and their tongues are sealed now i give thee choice wed atli and go or stand in the doomring and take thy fate  have i not said father while death may be sought otherwise that i will never do this last nor will i do the first i am not all of the tame breed of you iceland folkother and quicker blood runs in my veins nor will i be sold in marriage to a dotard as a mare is sold at a market i have answered  fool think again for i go not back upon my word wed atli or dieby thy own hand if thou wiltthere i will not gainsay thee or if thou fearest this then anon in the doomring  now swanhild covered her eyes with her hands and shook the long hair about her face and she seemed wondrous fair to asmund the priest who watched and as she sat thus it came into her mind that marriage is not the end of a young maids lifethat old husbands have been known to die and that she might rule this atli and his earldom and become a rich and honoured woman setting her sails in such fashion that when the wind turned it would fill them otherwise she must dieay die shamed and leave gudruda with her love  suddenly she slipped from the bed to the floor of the chamber and clasping the knees of asmund looked up through the meshes of her hair while tears streamed from her beautiful eyes  i have sinned she sobbedi have sinned greatly against thee and my sister hearken i was mad with love of eric whom from a child i have turned to and gudruda is fairer than i and she took him from me most of all was i mad this night when i wrought the deed of shame for ill things counselled methings that i did not call and oh i thank the godsif there are godsthat gudruda died not at my hand see now father i put this evil from me and tear eric from my heart and she made as though she rent her bosomi will wed atli and be a good housewife to him and i crave but this of gudruda that she forgive me her wrong for it was not done of my will but of my madness and of the driving of those whom my mother taught me to know  asmund listened and the springs of his love thawed within him now thou dost take good counsel he said and of this be sure that so long as thou art in that mood none shall harm thee and for gudruda she is the most gentle of women and it may well be that she will put away thy sin so weep no more and have no more dealings with thy finnish witchcraft but sleep and tomorrow i will bear thy word to atli for his ship is bound and thou must swiftly be made a wife  he went out bearing the light with him but swanhild rose from the ground and sat on the edge of the bed staring into the darkness and shuddering from time to time  i shall soon be made his wife she murmured who would be but one mans wifeand methinks i shall soon be made a widow also thou wilt have me dotardtake me and thy fate well well better to wed an earl than to be shamed and stretched across the doomstone oh weak arms that failed me at my need no more will i put trust in you when next i wound it shall be with the tongue when next i strive to slay it shall be by anothers hand curses on thee thou ill counseller of darkness who didst betray me at the last is it for this that i worshipped thee and swore the oath    the morning came and at the first light asmund sought the earl his heart was heavy because of the guile that his tongue must practise and his face was dark as a winter dawn  what news asmund asked atli early tidings are bad tidings so runs the saw and thy looks give weight to it  not altogether bad earl swanhild gives herself to thee  of her own will asmund  ay of her own will but i have warned thee of her temper  her temper little hangs to a maids temper once a wife and it will melt in softness like the snow when summer comes these are glad tidings comrade and methinks i grow young again beneath the breath of them why art thou so glum then  there is something that must yet be told of swanhild said asmund she is called the fatherless but if thou wilt have the truth why here it is for theeshe is my daughter born out of wedlock and i know not how that will please thee  atli laughed aloud and his bright eyes shone in his wrinkled face it pleases me well asmund for then the maid is sprung from a sound stock the name of the priest of middalhof is famous far south of iceland and never that iceland bred a comelier girl is that all  one more thing earl this i charge thee watch thy wife and hold her back from witchcraft and from dealings with evil things and trolls of darkness she is of finnish blood and the women of the finns are much given to such wicked work  i set little store by witchwork goblins and their kin said atli i doubt me much of their power and i shall soon wean swanhild from such ways if indeed she practise them  then they fell to talking of swanhilds dower and that was not small afterwards asmund sought eric and gudruda and told them what had come to pass and they were glad at the news though they grieved for atli the earl and when swanhild met gudruda she came to her humbly and humbly kissed her hand and with tears craved pardon of her evil doing saying that she had been mad nor did gudruda withhold it for of all women she was the gentlest and most forgiving but to eric swanhild said nothing  the weddingfeast must be held on the third day from this for atli would sail on that same day since his people wearied of waiting and his ship might lie bound no longer blithe was atli the earl and swanhild was all changed for now she seemed the gentlest of maids and as befitted one about to be made a wife moved through the house with soft words and downcast eyes but skallagrim watching her bethought him of the grey wolf that he had seen by goldfoss and this seemed not well to him  it would be bad now he said to eric as they rode to coldback to stand in yon old earls shoes this womans weather has changed too fast and after such a calm therell come a storm indeed i am now minded of thorunna for she went just so the day before she gave herself to ospakar and me to shame and bonds  talk not of the raven till you hear his croak said eric  he is on the wing lord answered skallagrim  now eric came to coldback in the marsh and saevuna his mother and unna thorods daughter the betrothed of asmund were glad to welcome him for the tidings of his mighty deeds and of the overthrow of ospakar and the slaying of mord were noised far and wide but at skallagrim lambstail they looked askance still when they heard of those things that he had wrought on horsehead heights they welcomed him for his deeds sake  eric sat two nights at coldback and on the second day saevuna his mother and unna rode thence with their servants to the weddingfeast of swanhild the fatherless but eric stopped at coldback that night saying that he would be at middalhof within two hours of sunrise for he must talk with a shepherd who came from the fells  saevuna and her company came to middalhof and was asked first by gudruda then by swanhild why brighteyes tarried she answered that he would be there early on the morrow next morning before it was light eric girded on whitefire took horse and rode from coldback alone for he would not bring skallagrim fearing lest he should get drunk at the feast and shed some mans blood  it was swanhilds weddingday but she greeted it with little lightsomeness of heart and her eyes knew no sleep that night though they were heavy with tears  at the first light she rose and gliding from the house walked through the heavy dew down the path by which eric must draw near for she desired to speak with him gudruda also rose a while after though she did not know this and followed on the same path for she would greet her lover at his coming  now three furlongs or more from the stead stood a vetch stack and swanhild waited on the further side of this stack presently she heard a sound of singing come from behind the shoulder of the fell and of the tramp of a horses hoofs then she saw the golden wings of erics helm all ablaze with the sunlight as he rode merrily along and great bitterness laid hold of her that eric could be of such a joyous mood on the day when she who loved him must be made the wife of another man  presently he was before her and swanhild stepped from the shadow of the stack and laid her hand upon his horses bridle  eric she said humbly and with bowed head gudruda sleeps yet canst thou then find time to hearken to my words  he frowned and said methinks swanhild it would be better if thou gavest thy words to him who is thy lord  she let the bridlerein drop from her hands i am answered she said ride on  now pity stirred in erics heart for swanhilds mien was most heavy and he leaped down from his horse nay he said speak on if thou hast anything to tell me  i have this to tell thee eric that now before we part for ever i am come to ask thy pardon for my illdoingay and to wish all joy to thee and thy fair love and she sobbed and choked  speak no more of it swanhild he said but let thy good deeds cover up the ill which are not small so thou shalt be happy  she looked at him strangely and her face was white with pain  how then are we so differently fashioned that thou eric canst prate to me of happiness when my heart is racked with grief oh eric i blame thee not for thou hast not wrought this evil on me willingly but i say this that my heart is dead as i would that i were dead see those flowers they smell sweetfor me they have no odour look on the light leaping from coldback to the sea from the sea to westman isles and from the westman crown of rocks far into the wide heavens above it is beautiful is it not yet i tell thee eric that now to my eyes howling winter darkness is every whit as fair joy is dead within me musics but a jangled madness in my ears food hath no savour on my tongue my youth is sped ere my dawn is day nothing is left to me eric save this fair body that thou didst scorn and the dreams which i may gather from my hours of scanty sleep and such shame as befalls a loveless bride  speak not so swanhild he said and clasped her by the hand for though he loathed her wickedness being softhearted and but young it grieved him to hear her words and see the anguish of her mind for it is so with men that they are easily moved by the pleading of a fair woman who loves them even though they love her not  yea i will speak out all my mind before i seal it up for ever see eric this is my state and thou hast set this crown of sorrow on my brows and thou comest singing down the fell and i go weeping oer the sea i am not all so ill at heart it was love of thee that drove me down to sin as love of thee might otherwise have lifted me to holiness but loving thee as thou seest this day i wed a dotard and go his chattel and his bride across the sea and leave thee singing on the fell and by thy side her who is my foe thou hast done great deeds brighteyes and still greater shalt thou do yet but as echoes they shall reach my ears thou wilt be to me as one dead for it is gudrudas to bind the byrnie on thy breast when thou goest forth to war and hers to loose the winged helm from thy brow when thou returnest battleworn and conquering  now swanhild ceased and choked with grief then spoke again  so now farewell doubtless i weary thee andgudruda waits nay look not on my foolish tears they are the heritage of woman of naught else is she sure while i live eric morn by morn the thought of thee shall come to wake me as the sun wakes yon snowy peak and night by night thy memory shall pass as at eve he passes from the valleys but to dawn again in dreams for eric tis thee i wed todayat heart i am thy bride thine and thine only and when shalt thou find a wife who holds thee so dear as that swanhild whom once thou knewest so now farewell yes this time thou shalt kiss away my tears then let them stream for ever thus eric and thus and thus do i take farewell of thee  and now she clung about his neck gazing on him with great dewy eyes till things grew strange and dim and he must kiss her if only for her love and tender beautys sake and so he kissed and it chanced that as they clung thus gudruda passing by this path to give her betrothed greeting came upon them and stood astonished then she turned and putting her hands to her head fled back swiftly to the stead and waited there great anger burning in her heart for gudruda had this fault that she was very jealous  now eric and swanhild did not see her and presently they parted and swanhild wiped her eyes and glided thence  as she drew near the stead she found gudruda watching  where hast thou been swanhild she said  to bid farewell to brighteyes gudruda  then thou art foolish for doubtless he thrust thee from him  nay gudruda he drew me to him hearken i say thou sister vex me not for i go my ways and thou goest thine thou art strong and fair and hitherto thou hast overcome me but i am also fair and if i find space to strike in i also have a show of strength pray thou that i find not space gudruda now is eric thine perchance one day he may be mine it lies in the lap of the norns  fair words from atlis bride mocked gudruda  ay atlis bride but never atlis love said swanhild and swept on  a while after eric rode up he was shamefaced and vexed at heart because he had yielded thus to swanhilds beauty and been melted by her tender words and kissed her then he saw gudruda and at the sight of her all thought of swanhild passed from him for he loved gudruda and her alone he leapt down from his horse and ran to her but drawn to her full height she stood with dark flashing eyes and fair face set in anger  still he would have greeted her loverwise but she lifted her hand and waved him back and fear took hold of him  what now gudruda he asked faltering  what now eric she answered faltering not hast seen swanhild  yea i have seen swanhild she came to bid farewell to me what of it  what of it why thus and thus and thus didst thou bid farewell to atlis bride ay thus and thus with clinging lips and twined arms warm and soft was thy farewell kiss to her who would have slain me brighteyes  gudruda thou speakest truth though how thou sawest i know not think no ill of it and scourge me not with words for sooth to say i was melted by her grief and the music of her talk  it is shame to thee so to speak of her whom but now thou heldest in thine arms by the grief and the music of the talk of her who would have murdered me thou wast melted into kisses ericfor i saw it with these eyes knowest thou what i am minded to say to thee it is this go hence and see me no more for i have little wish to cleave to such a featherman to one so blown about by the first breath of womans tempting  yet methinks gudruda i have withstood some such winds i tell thee that hadst thou been in my place thyself hadst yielded to swanhild and kissed her in farewell for she was more than woman in that hour  nay eric i am no weak man to be led astray thus yet she is more than womantroll is she also that i know but less than man art thou eric thus to fall before her who hates me time may come when she shall woo thee after a stronger sort and what wilt thou say to her then thou who art so ready with thy kisses  i will withstand her gudruda for i love thee only and this is well known to thee  truly i know thou lovest me eric but tell me of what worth is this love of man that eyes of beauty and tongue of craft may so readily bewray i doubt me of thee eric  nay doubt me not gudruda i love thee alone but i grew soft as wax beneath her pleading my heart consented not yet i did consent i have no more to say  now gudruda looked on him long and steadfastly thy plight is sorry eric she said and this once i forgive thee look to it that thou givest me no more cause to doubt thee for then i shall remember how thou didst bid farewell to swanhild  i will give none he answered and would have embraced her but this she would not suffer then nor for many days after for she was angry with him but with swanhild she was still more angry though she said nothing of it that swanhild had tried to murder her gudruda could forgive for there she had failed but not that she had won eric to kiss her for in this she had succeeded well     xii  how eric was outlawed and sailed aviking  now the marriagefeast went on and swanhild draped in white and girt about with gold sat by atlis side upon the high seat he was fain of her and drew her to him but she looked at him with cold calm eyes in which hate lurked the feast was done and all the company rode to the sea strand where the earls ship lay at anchor they came there and swanhild kissed asmund and talked a while with groa her mother and bade farewell to all men but she bade no farewell to eric and to gudruda  why sayest thou no word to these two asked atli her husband  for this reason earl she answered because ere long we three shall meet again but i shall see asmund my father and groa my mother no more  that is an ill saying wife said atli methinks thou dost foretell their doom  mayhap and now i will add to my redes for i foretell thy doom also it is not yet but it draws on  then atli bethought him of many wise saws but spoke no more for it seemed to him this was a strange bride that he had wed  they hauled the anchor home shook out the great sail and passed away into the evening night but while land could still be seen swanhild stood near the helm gazing with her blue eyes upon the lessening coast then she passed to the hold and shut herself in alone and there she stayed saying that she was sick till at length after a fair voyage of twenty days they made the orkney islands  but all this pleased atli wondrous ill yet he dared not cross her mood    now in iceland the time drew on when men must ride to the althing and notice was given to eric brighteyes of many suits that were laid against him in that he had brought mord ospakars son to his death dealing him a brain or a body or a marrow wound and others of that company but no suits were laid against skallagrim for he was already outlaw therefore he must go in hiding for men were out to slay him and this he did unwillingly at erics bidding asmund took up erics case for he was the most famous of all lawmen in that day and when thirteen full weeks of summer were done they two rode to the thing and with them a great company of men of their quarter  now men go up to the lögberg and there came ospakar though he was not yet healed of his wound and all his company and laid their suits against eric by the mouth of gizur the lawman ospakars son the pleadings were long and cunning on either side but the end of it was that ospakar brought it about by the help of his friendsand of these had manythat eric must go into outlawry for three years but no weregild was to be paid to ospakar and his men for those who had been killed and no atonement for the great wound that skallagrim lambstail gave him or for the death of mord his son inasmuch as eric fought for his own hand to save his life  the party of ospakar were ill pleased at this finding and eric was not over glad for it was little to his mind that he should sail awarring across the seas while gudruda sat at home in iceland still there was no help for the matter  now ospakar spoke with his company and the end of it was that he called on them to take their weapons and avenge themselves by their own might asmund and eric seeing this mustered their army of freemen and thralls there were one hundred and five of them all stout men but ospakar blacktooths band numbered a hundred and thirtythree and they stood with their backs to the ravens rift  now i would that skallagrim was here to guard my back said eric for before this fight is done few will left standing to tell its tale  it is a sad thing said asmund that so many men must die because some men are now dead  a very sad thing said eric and took this counsel he stalked alone towards the ranks of ospakar and called in a loud voice saying  it would be grievous that so many warriors should fall in such a matter now hearken you company of ospakar blacktooth if there be any two among you who will dare to match their might against my single sword in holmgang here i eric brighteyes stand and wait them it is better that one man or perchance three men should fall than that anon so many should roll in the dust what say ye  now all those who watched called out that this was a good offer and a manly one though it might turn out ill for eric but ospakar answered  were i but well of my wound i alone would cut that golden comb of thine thou braggart as it is be sure that two shall be found  who is the braggart answered eric he who twice has learned the weight of this arm and yet boasts his strength or i who stand craving that two should come against me get thee hence ospakar get thee home and bid thorunna thy leman whom thou didst beguile from that ounound who now is named skallagrim lambstail the baresark nurse thee whole of the wound her husband gave thee be sure we shall yet stand face to face and that combs shall be cut then combs black or golden nurse thee nurse thee cease thy pratingget thee home and bid thorunna nurse thee but first name thou the two who shall stand against me in holmgang in oxaràs stream  folk laughed aloud while eric mocked but ospakar gnashed his teeth with rage still he named the two mightiest men in his company bidding them take up their swords against brighteyes this indeed they were loth to do still because of the shame that they must get if they hung back and for fear of the wrath of ospakar they made ready to obey his bidding  then all men passed down to the bank of oxarà and on the other side people came from their booths and sat upon the slope of all mans raft for it was a new thing that one man should fight two in holmgang  now eric crossed to the island where holmgangs are fought to this day and after him came the two chosen flourishing their swords bravely and taking counsel how one should rush at his face while the other passed behind his back and spitted him as woodfolk spit a lamb eric drew whitefire and leaned on it waiting for the word and all the women held him to be wondrous fair as clad in his byrnie and his golden helm he leaned thus on whitefire presently the word was given and eric standing not to defend himself as they deemed he surely would whirled whitefire round his helm and rushed headlong on his foes shield aloft  the great carles saw the light that played on whitefires edge and the other light that burned in erics eyes and terror got hold of them now he was almost come and whitefire sprang aloft like a tongue of flame then they stayed no more but running one this way and one that cast themselves into the flood and swam for the riveredge now from either bank rose up a roar of laughter that grew and grew till it echoed against the lava rifts and scared the ravens from their nests  eric too stopped his charge and laughed aloud then walked back to where asmund stood unarmed to second him in the holmgang  i can get little honour from such champions as these he said  nay answered asmund thou hast got the greatest honour and they and ospakar such shame as may not be wiped out  now when blacktooth saw what had come to pass he wellnigh choked and fell from his horse in fury still he could find no stomach for fighting but mustering his company rode straightway from the thing home again to swinefell but he caused those two whom he had put up to do battle with eric to be set upon with staves and driven from his following and the end of it was that they might stay no more in iceland but took ship and sailed south and now they are out of the story  on the next day asmund and with him eric and all their men rode back to middalhof gudruda greeted eric well and for the first time since swanhild went away she kissed him moreover she wept bitterly when she learned that he must go into outlawry while she must bide at home  how shall the days pass by eric she said when thou art far and i know not where thou art nor how it goes with thee nor if thou livest or art already dead  in sooth i cannot say sweet he answered but of this i am sure that wheresoever i am yet more weary shall be my hours  three years she went onthree long cold years and no sight of thee and perchance no tidings from thee till mayhap i learn that thou art in that land whence tidings cannot come oh it would be better to die than to part thus  well i wot that it is better to die than to live and better never to have been born than to live and die answered eric sadly here it would seem is nothing but hate and strife weariness and bitter envy to fret away our strength and at last if we come so far sorrowful age and death and thereafter we know not what little of good do we find to our hands and much of evil nor know i for what illdoing these burdens are laid upon us yet must we needs breathe such an air as is blown about us gudruda clasping at this happiness which is given though we may not hold it at the worst the game will soon be played and others will stand where we have stood and strive as we have striven and fail as we have failed and so on till man has worked out his doom and the gods cease from their wrath or ragnarrök come upon them and they too are lost in the jaws of grey wolf fenrir  men may win one good thing and that is fame eric  nay gudruda what is it to win fame is it not to raise up foes as it were from the very soil who made with secret hate seek to stab us in the back is it not to lose peace and toil on from height to height only to be hurled down at last happy then is the man whom fame flies from for hers is a deadly gift  yet there is one thing left that thou hast not numbered eric and it is lovefor love is to our life what the sun is to the world and though it seems to set in death yet it may rise again we are happy then in our love for there are many who live their lives and do not find it  so these two eric brighteyes and gudruda the fair talked sadly for their hearts were heavy and on them lay the shadow of sorrows that were to come  say sweet said eric at length wilt thou that i go not into banishment then i must fall into outlawry and my life will be in the hands of him who may take it yet i think that my foes will find it hard to come by while my strength remains and at the worst i do but turn to meet the fate that dogs me  nay that i will not suffer brighteyes now we will go to my father and he shall give thee his dragon of warshe is a good vesseland thou shalt man her with the briskest men of our quarter for there are many who will be glad to fare abroad with thee eric soon she shall be bound and thou shalt sail at once eric for the sooner thou art gone the sooner the three years will be sped and thou shalt come back to me but oh that i might go with thee  now gudruda and eric went to asmund and spoke of this matter  i desired he answered that thou eric shouldst bide here in iceland till after harvest for it is then that i would take unna thorods daughter to wife and it was meet that thou shouldst sit at the weddingfeast and give her to me  nay father let eric go said gudruda for well begun is surely half done he must remain three years in outlawry add thou no day to them for if he stays here for long i know this that i shall find no heart to let him go and if go he must then i shall go with him  that may never be said asmund thou art too young and fair to sail aviking down the seapath hearken eric i give thee the good ship and now we will go about to find stout men to man her  that is a good gift said eric and afterwards they rode to the seashore and overhauled the vessel as she lay in her shed she was a great dragon of war long and slender and standing high at stem and prow she was fashioned of oak all bolted together with iron and at her prow was a gilded dragon most wonderfully carved  eric looked on her and his eyes brightened  here rests a wavehorse that shall bear a viking well he said  ay answered asmund of all the things i own this ship is the very best she is so swift that none may catch her and she can almost go about in her own length that gale must be heavy that shall fill her with thee to steer yet i give her to thee freely eric and thou shalt do great deeds with this my gift and if things go well she shall come back to this shore at last and thou in her  now i will name this wargift with a new name said eric gudruda i name her for as gudruda here is the fairest of all women so is this the fairest of all wardragons  so be it said asmund  then they rode back to middalhof and now eric brighteyes let it be known that he needed men to sail the seas with him nor did he ask in vain for when it was told that eric went aviking so great was his fame grown that many a stout yeoman and many a greatlimbed carle reached down sword and shield and came up to middalhof to put their hands in his for mate he took a certain man named hall of lithdale and this because björn asked it for hall was a friend to björn and he had moreover great skill in all manner of seamanship and had often sailed the northern seasay and round england to the coast of france  but when gudruda saw this man she did not like him because of his sharp face uncanny eyes and smooth tongue and she prayed eric to have nothing to do with him  it is too late now to talk of that said eric hall is a wellskilled man and for the rest fear not i will watch him  then evil will come of it said gudruda  skallagrim also liked hall little nor did hall love skallagrim and his great axe  at length all were gathered they were fifty in number and it is said that no such band of men ever took ship from iceland  now the great dragon was bound and her faring goods were aboard of her for eric must sail on the morrow if the wind should be fair all day long he stalked to and fro among his men he would trust nothing to others and there was no sword or shield in his company but he himself had proved it all day long he stalked and at his back went skallagrim lambstail axe on shoulder for he would never leave eric if he had his will and they were a mighty pair  at length all was ready and men sat down to the faringfeast in the hall at middalhof and that was a great feast erics folk were gathered on the sidebenches and by the high seat at asmunds side sat brighteyes and near to him where björn asmunds son gudruda unna asmunds betrothed and saevuna erics mother for this had been settled between asmund and eric that his mother saevuna who was some somewhat sunk in age should flit from coldback and come with unna to dwell at middalhof but eric set a trusty grieve to dwell at coldback and mind the farm  when the faringtoasts had been drunk eric spoke to asmund and said i fear one thing lord and it is that when i am gone ospakar will trouble thee now i pray you all to beware of blacktooth for though the hound is whipped he can still bite and it seems that he has not yet put gudruda from his mind  now björn had sat silently thinking much and drinking more for he loved eric less than ever on this day when he saw how all men did him honour and mourned his going and his father not the least of them  methinks it is thou eric he said whom ospakar hates and thee on whom he would work his vengeance and that for no light cause  when bad fortune sits in thy neighbours house she knocks upon thy door björn gudruda thy sister is my betrothed and thou art a party to this feud said eric therefore it becomes thee better to hold her honour and thy own against this northlander than to gird at me for that in which i have no blame  björn grew wroth at these words prate not to me he said thou art an upstart who wouldst teach their duty to thy bettersay puffed up with lightwon fame like a feather on the breeze but i say this the breeze shall fail and thou shalt fall upon the gooses back once more and i say this also that had i my will gudruda should wed ospakar for he is a mighty chief and not a longlegged carle outlawed for manslaying  now eric sprang from his seat and laid hand upon the hilt of whitefire while men murmured in the hall for they held this an ill speech of björns  in thee it seems i have no friend said eric and hadst thou been any other man than gudrudas brother forsooth thou shouldst answer for thy mocking words this i tell thee björn that wert thou twice her brother if thou plottest with ospakar when i am gone thou shalt pay dearly for it when i come back again i know thy heart well it is cunning and greedy of gain and filled with envy as a cask with ale yet if thou lovest to feel it beating in thy breast strive not to work me mischief and to put gudruda from me  now björn sprang up also and drew his sword for he was white with rage but asmund his father cried peace in a great voice  peace he said be seated eric and take no heed of this foolish talk and for thee björn art thou the priest of middalhof and gudrudas father or am i it has pleased me to betroth brighteyes to gudruda and it pleased me not to betroth her to ospakar and that is enough for thee for the rest ospakar would have slain eric not he ospakar therefore erics hands are clean though thou art my son i say this that if thou workest ill to eric when he is over sea thou shalt rightly learn the weight of whitefire it is a niddering deed to plot against an absent man  eric sat down but björn strode scowling from the hall and taking horse rode south nor did he and eric meet again till three years had come and gone and then they met but once  maggots shall be bred of that fly nor shall they lack flesh to feed on said skallagrim in erics ears as he watched björn pass but eric bade him be silent and turned to gudruda  look not so sad sweet he said for hasty words rise like the foam on mead and pass as soon it vexes björn that thy father has given me the good ship but his anger will soon pass or at the very worst i fear him not while thou art true to me  then thou hast little to fear eric she answered look now on thy hair it grows long as a womans and that is ill for at sea the salt will hang to it say shall i cut it for thee  yes gudruda  so she cut his yellow locks and one of them lay upon her heart for many a day  now thou shalt swear to me she whispered in his ear that no other man or woman shall cut thy hair till thou comest back to me and i clip it again  that i swear and readily he answered i will go longhaired like a girl for thy sake gudruda  he spoke low but koll the halfwitted groas thrall heard this oath and kept it in his mind    very early on the morrow all men rose and taking horse rode once more to the seaside till they came to that shed where the gudruda lay  then when the tide was high erics company took hold of the black ships thwarts and at his word dragged her with might and main she ran down the greased blocks and sped on quivering to the sea and as her dragonprow dipped in the water people cheered aloud  now eric must bid farewell to all and this he did with a brave heart till at the last he came to saevuna his mother and gudruda his dear love  farewell son said the old dame i have little hope that these eyes shall look again upon that bonny face of thine yet i am well paid for my birthpains for few have borne such a man as thou think of me at times for without me thou hadst never been be not led astray of women nor lead them astray or ill shall overtake thee be not quarrelsome because of thy great might for there is a stronger than the strongest spare a fallen foe and take not a poor mans goods or a brave mans sword but when thou smitest smite home so shalt thou win honour and at the last peace that is more than honour  eric thanked her for her counsel and kissed her then turned to gudruda who stood white and still plucking at her golden girdle  what can i say to thee he asked  say nothing but go she answered go before i weep  weep not gudruda or thou wilt unman me say thou wilt think on me  ay eric by day and by night  and thou wilt be true to me  ay till death and after for so long as thou cleavest to me i will cleave to thee i will first die rather than betray thee but of thee i am not so sure perchance thou mayest find swanhild in thy journeyings and crave more kisses of her  anger me not gudruda thou knowest well that i hate swanhild more than any other woman when i kiss her again then thou mayst wed ospakar  speak not so rashly eric she said and as she spoke skallagrim drew near  if thou lingerest here lord the tide will serve us little round westmans he said eyeing gudruda as it were with jealousy  i come said eric gudruda fare thee well  she kissed him and clung to him but did not answer for she could not speak     xiii  how hall the mate cut the grapnel chain  gudruda bent her head like a drooping flower and presently sank to earth for her knees would bear her weight no more but eric marched to the lip of the sea his head held high and laughing merrily to hide his pain of heart here stood asmund who gripped him by both hands and kissed him on the brow bidding him good luck  i know not whether we shall meet again he said but if my hours be sped before thou returnest this i charge thee that thou mindest gudruda well for she is the sweetest of all women that i have known and i hold her the most dear  fear not for that lord said eric and i pray thee this that if i come back no more as well may happen do not force gudruda into marriage if she wills it not and i think she will have little leaning that way and i say this also do not count overmuch on björn thy son for he has no loyal heart and beware of groa who was thy housekeeper for she loves not that unna should take her place and more and now i thank thee for many good things and farewell  farewell my son said asmund for in this hour thou seemest as a son to me  eric turned to enter the sea and wade to the vessel but skallagrim caught him in his arms as though he were but a child and wading into the surf till the water covered his waistbelt bore him to the vessel and lifted him up so that eric reached the bulwarks with his hands  then they loosed the cable and got out the oars and soon were dancing over the sea presently the breeze caught them and they set the great sail and sped away like a gull towards the westman isles but gudruda sat on the shore watching till at length the light faded from erics golden helm as he stood upon the poop and the world grew dark to her    now ospakar blacktooth had news of this sailing and took counsel of gizur his son and the end of it was that they made ready two great ships dragons of war and placing sixty fighting men in each of them sailed round the iceland coast to the westmans and waited there to waylay eric they had spies on the land and from them they learned of brighteyes coming and sailed out to meet him in the channel between the greater and the lesser islands where they knew that he must pass  now it drew towards evening when eric rowed down this channel for the wind had fallen and he desired to be clear at sea presently as the gudruda came near to the mouth of the channel that had high cliffs on either hand eric saw two long dragons of warfor their bulwarks were shieldhungglide from the cover of the island and take their station side by side between him and the open sea  now here are vikings said eric to skallagrim  now here is ospakar blacktooth answered skallagrim for well i know that raven banner of his this is a good voyage for we must seek but a little while before we come to fighting  eric bade the men lay on their oars and spoke  before us is ospakar blacktooth in two great dragons and he is here to cut us off now two choices are left to us one is to bout ship and run before him and the other to row on and give him battle what say ye comrades  hall of lithdale the mate answered saying  let us go back lest we die the odds are too great eric  but a man among the crew cried out when thou didst go on holmgang at thingvalla eric ospakars two chosen champions stood before thee yet at whitefires flash they skurried through the water like startled ducks it was an omen for so shall his great ships fly when we swoop on them then the others shouted  ay ay never let it be said that we fled from ospakarfie on thy womans talk hall  then we are all of one mind save hall only said eric let us put ospakar to the proof and while men shouted yea he turned to speak with skallagrim the baresark was gone for wasting no breath in words already he was fixing the long shields on the bulwark rail  the men busked on their harness and made them fit for fight and when all was ready eric mounted the poop and with him skallagrim and bade the rowers give way the gudruda leapt forward and rushed on towards ospakars ships now they saw that these were bound together with a cable and yet they must go betwixt them  eric ran forward to the prow and with him skallagrim and called aloud to a great man who stood upon the ship to starboard wearing a black helm with ravens wings  who art thou that bars the sea against me  i am named ospakar blacktooth answered the great man  and what must we lose at thy hands ospakar  but one thingyour lives answered blacktooth  thrice have we stood face to face ospakar said eric and it seems that hitherto thou hast won no great glory now it shall be proved if thy luck has bettered  art yet healed lord of that prick in the shoulder which thou camest by on horsehead heights roared skallagrim  for answer ospakar seized a spear and hurled it straight at eric and it had been his death had he not caught it in his hand as it flew then he cast it back and that so mightily that it sped right through the shield of ospakar and was the bane of a man who stood beside him  a gift for a gift laughed eric on rushed the gudruda but now the cable was strained six fathoms from her bow that held together the ships of ospakar and it was too strong for breaking eric looked and saw then he drew whitefire and while all men wondered leaped over the prow of the ship and clasping the golden dragons head with his arm set his feet upon its claws and waited on sped the ship and spears flew thick and fast about him but there brighteyes hung now the gudrudas bow caught the great rope and strained it taut and as it rose beneath her weight eric smote swift and strong with whitefire and clove it in two so that the severed ends fell with a splash into the quiet water  eric sprang back to deck while stones and spears hissed about him  that was well done lord said skallagrim now we shall be snugly berthed  in oars and out grapplingirons shouted eric  up rose the rowers and their wargear rattled as they rose they drew in the long oars and not before it was time for now the gudruda forced her way between the two dragons of ospakar and lay with her bow to their sterns then with a shout erics men cast the irons and soon the ships were locked fast and the fight began the spears flew thick and on either side some got their death before them then the men of that vessel named the raven which was to larboard of the gudruda made ready to board on they came with a rush and were driven back though hardly for they were many and those who stood against them few again they came scrambling over the bulwarks and this time a score of them leapt aboard eric turned from the fight against the dragon of ospakar and saw it then with skallagrim he rushed to meet the boarders as they swarmed along the hold and naught might they withstand the axe and sword  through and through them swept the mighty pair now whitefire flashed and now the great axe fell and at every stroke a man lay dead or wounded six of the boarders turned to fly but just then the grapplingiron broke and their ship drifted out with the tide towards the open sea and presently no man of that twenty was left alive  now the men of the ship of ospakar and of the gudruda pressed each other hard thrice did ospakar strive to come aboard and thrice he was pushed back eric was ever where he was most needed and with him skallagrim for these two threw themselves from side to side and were now here and now there so that it seemed as though there were not one golden helm and one black but rather four on board the gudruda  eric looked and saw that the other ship was drawing round though somewhat slowly to come alongside of them once more  now we must make an end of ospakar else our hands will be overfull he said and therewith sprang up upon the bulwarks and after him many men once they were driven back but came on again and now they thrust all ospakars men before them and passed up his ship on both boards by the mast stood ospakar and with him gizur his son and eric strove to come to him but many men were between them and he could not do this  presently while the fight yet went on hotly and men fell fast brighteyes felt the dragon of ospakar strike and looking saw that they had drifted with the send of the tide on to the rocks of the island there was a great hole in the hull amidships and the water rushed in fast  back men back he cried and all his folk that were unhurt ran and leapt on board the gudruda but ospakar and his men sprang into the sea and swam for the shore then skallagrim cut loose the grapplingirons with his axe and that not too soon for scarcely had they pushed clear with great toil when the long warship slipped from the rock and foundered taking many dead and wounded men with her  now ospakar and some of his people stood safe upon the rocks and eric called to him in mockery bidding him come aboard the gudruda  ospakar made no answer but stood gnawing his hand while the water ran from him only gizur his son cursed them aloud  eric was greatly minded to follow them and land and fight them there but he might not do this because of the rocks and of the other dragon that hung about them fearing to come on and yet not willing to go back  we will have her at the least said eric and bade the rowers get out their oars  now when the men on board the other ship saw the gudruda drawing on they took to their oars at once and rowed swiftly for the sea and at this a great roar of laughter went down erics ship  they shall not slip from us so easily said eric give way comrades and after them  but the men were much wearied with fighting and the decks were all cumbered with dead and wounded so that by the time that the gudruda had put about and come to the mouth of the waterway ospakars vessel had shaken out her sails and caught the wind that now blew strong off shore and sped away six furlongs or more from erics prow  now we shall see how the gudruda sails said eric and they spread their canvas and gave chase  then eric bade men clear the decks of the dead and tend the wounded he had lost seven men slain outright and three were wounded one to death but on board the ship there lay of ospakars force twenty and three dead men  when all were cast into the sea men ate and rested  we have not done so badly said eric to skallagrim  we shall do better yet said skallagrim to eric rather had i seen ospakars head lying in the scuppers than those of all his carles for he may get more men but never another head  now the wind freshened till by midnight it blew strongly the mate hall came to eric and said  the gudruda dips her nose deep in rans cup say eric shall we shorten sail  nay answered eric keep her full and bail where yonder raven flies my seastag must follow and he pointed to the warship that rode the waves before them  after midnight clouds came up with rain and hid the face of the nightsun and the ship they sought the wind blew ever harder till at length when the rain had passed and the clouds lifted there was much water in the hold and the bailers could hardly stand at their work  men murmured and hall the mate murmured most of all but still eric held on for there not two furlongs ahead of them rode the dragon of ospakar but now being afraid of the wind and sea she had lowered her sail somewhat and made as though she would put about and run for iceland  that she may not do called eric to skallagrim if once she rolls side on to those seas ran has her for she must fill and sink  so they hold lord answered skallagrim see once more she runs  ay but we run fastershe is outsailed up men up for presently the fight begins  it is bad to join battle in such a sea quoth hall  good or bad growled skallagrim do thou thy lords bidding and he half lifted up his axe  the mate said no more for he misdoubted him of skallagrim lambstail and his axe  then men made ready for the fray as best they might and stood sword in hand and drenched with foam clinging to the bulwarks of the gudruda as she wallowed through the seas  eric went aft to the helm and seized it now but a length ahead ospakars ship laboured on beneath her small sail but the gudruda rushed towards her with all canvas set and at every leap plunged her golden dragon beneath the surf and shook the water from her foredeck  make ready the grapnel shouted eric through the storm skallagrim seized the iron and stood by now the gudruda rushed alongside the raven and eric steered so skilfully that there was a fathom space and no more between the ships  skallagrim cast the iron well and truly so that it hooked and held on sped the gudruda and the cable tautenednow her stern kissed the bow of ospakars ship as though she was towing her and thus for a space they travelled through the seas  erics folk shouted and strove to cast spears but they did this but ill because of the rocking of the vessel as for ospakars men they clung to their bulwarks and did nothing for all the heart was out of them between fear of eric and terror of the sea eric called to a man to hold the helm and skallagrim crept aft to where he stood  what counsel shall we take now said eric and as he spoke a sea broke over themfor the gale was strong  board them and make an end answered skallagrim  rough work still we will try it said eric for we may not lie thus for long and i am loath to leave them  then eric called for men to follow him and many answered creeping as best they might to where he stood  thou art mad eric said hall the mate cut loose and let us drive else we shall both founder and that is a poor tale to tell  eric took no heed but watching his chance leapt on to the bows of the raven and after him leapt skallagrim even as he did so a great sea came and swept past and over them so that half the ship was hid for foam now hall the mate stood near to the grapnel cable and fearing lest they should sink out of the cowardice of his heart he let his axe fall upon the chain and severed it so swiftly that no man saw him except skallagrim only forward sprang the gudruda freed from her burden and rushed away before the wind leaving eric and skallagrim alone upon the ravens prow  now we are in an evil plight said eric the cable has parted  ay answered skallagrim and that losel hall hath parted it i saw his axe fall     xiv  how eric dreamed a dream  now when the men of ospakar who were gathered on the poop of the raven saw what had come about they shouted aloud and made ready to slay the pair but eric and skallagrim clambered to the mast and got their backs against it and swiftly made themselves fast with a rope so that they might not fall with the rolling of the ship then the people of ospakar came on to cut them down  but this was no easy task for they might scarcely stand and they could not shoot with the bow moreover eric and skallagrim being bound to the mast had the use of both hands and were minded to die hard therefore ospakars folks got but one thing by their onslaught and that was death for three of their number fell beneath the long sweep of whitefire and one bowed before the axe of skallagrim then they drew back and strove to throw spears at these two but they flew wide because of the rolling of the vessel one spear struck the mast near the head of skallagrim he drew it out and waiting till the ship steadied herself in the trough of the sea hurled it at a knot of ospakars thralls and a man got his death from it after that they threw no more spears  thence once more the crew came on with swords and axes but faintheartedly and the end of it was that they lost some more men dead and wounded and fell back again  skallagrim mocked at them with bitter words and one of them made mad by his scoffing cast a heavy ballaststone at him it fell upon his shoulder and numbed him  now i am unmeet for fight lord said skallagrim for my right arm is dead and i can scarcely hold my axe  that is ill then said eric for we have little help except from each other and i too am wellnigh spent well we have done a great deed and now it is time to rest  my left arm is yet whole lord and i can make shift for a while with it cut loose the cord before they bait us to death and let us rush upon these wolves and fall fighting  a good counsel said eric and a quick end but stay a while what plan have they now  now the men of ospakar having little heart left in them for such work as this had taken thought together  we have got great hurt and little honour said the mate there are but nineteen of us left alive and that is scarcely enough to work the ship and it seems that we shall be fewer before eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail lie quiet by yonder mast they are mighty men indeed and it would be better methinks to deal with them by craft rather than by force  the sailors said that this was a good word for they were weary of the sight of whitefire as he flamed on high and the sound of the axe of skallagrim as it crashed through helm and byrnie and as fear crept in valour fled out  this is my rede then said the mate that we go to them and give them peace and lay them in bonds swearing that we will put them ashore when we are come back to iceland but when we have them fast as they sleep at night we will creep on them and hurl them into the sea and afterwards we will say that we slew them fighting  a shameful deed said a man  then go thou up against them answered the mate if we slay them not then shall this tale be told against us throughout iceland that a ships company were worsted by two men and we may not live beneath that dishonour  the man held his peace and the mate laying down his arms crept forward alone towards the mast just as eric and skallagrim were about to cut themselves loose and rush on them  what wouldest thou shouted eric has it gone so well with you with arms that ye are minded to come up against us bearing none  it has gone ill eric said the mate for ye twain are too mighty for us we have lost many men and we shall lose more ere ye are laid low therefore we make you this offer that you lay down your weapons and suffer yourselves to be bound till such time as we touch land where we will set you ashore and give you your arms again meanwhile we will deal with you in friendly fashion giving you of the best we have nor will we set foot any suit against you for those of our number whom ye two have slain  wherefore then should we be bound said eric  for this reason only that we dare not leave you free within our ship now choose and if ye will take peace which we swear by all the gods we will keep towards you and if ye will not then we will bear you down with beams and sails and stones and slay you  what thinkest thou skallagrim said eric beneath his breath  i think that i find little faith in yon carles face answered skallagrim still i am unfit to fight and thy strength is spent so it seems that we must lie low if we would rise again they can scarcely be so base as to do murder having handselled peace to us  i am not so sure of that said eric still starving beggars must eat bones hearken thou we take the terms trusting to your honour and i say this that ye shall get shame and death if ye depart from them to harm us  have no fear lord said the mate we are true men  that we shall look to your deeds to learn said eric laying down his sword and shield  skallagrim did likewise though with no good grace then men came with strong cords and bound them fast hand and foot handling them fearsomely as men handle a live bear in a net then they led them forward to the prow  as they went eric looked up yonder twenty furlongs and more away sailed the gudruda  this is good fellowship said skallagrim thus to leave us in the trap  nay answered eric they cannot put about in such a sea and doubtless also they think us dead nevertheless if ever it comes about that hall and i stand face to face again there will be need for me to think of gentleness  i shall think little thereon growled skallagrim  now they were come to the prow and there was a half deck under which they were set out of reach of the wind and water in the deck was a stout iron ring and the men made them fast with ropes to it so that they might move but little and they set their helms and weapons behind them in such fashion that they could not come at them then they flung cloaks about them and brought them food and drink of which they stood much in need and treated them well in every way but for all this skallagrim trusted them no more  we are newhooked lord he said and they give us line presently they will haul us in  evil comes soon enough answered eric no need to run to greet it and he fell to thinking of gudruda and of the days deeds till presently he dropped asleep for he was very weary    now it chanced that as eric slept he dreamed a dream so strong and strange that it seemed to live within him he dreamed that he slept there beneath the ravens deck and that a rat came and whispered spells into his ear then he dreamed that swanhild glided towards him walking on the stormy seas he saw her afar and she came swiftly and ever the sea grew smooth before her feet nor did the wind so much as stir her hair presently she stood by him in the ship and bending over him touched him on the shoulder saying  awake eric brighteyes awake awake  it seemed to him that he awoke and said what tidings swanhild and that she answered  ill tidings ericso ill that i am come hither from straumey to tell of themay come walking on the seas had gudruda done so much thinkest thou   stroma the southernmost of the orkneys  gudruda is no witch he said in his dream  nay but i am a witch and it is well for thee eric ay i am a witch now do i seem to sleep at atlis side and lo here i stand by thine and i must journey back again many a league before another day be bornay many a league and all for love of thee eric hearken for not long may the spell endure i have seen this by my magic that these men who bound thee come even now to take thee sleeping and cast thee and thy thrall into the deep there to drown  if it is fated it will befall he said in his dream  nay it shall not befall put forth all thy might and burst thy bonds then fetch whitefire cut away the bonds of skallagrim and give him his axe and shield this done cover yourselves with your cloaks and wait till ye hear the murderers come then rise and rush upon them the two of you and they shall melt before your might i have journeyed over the great deep to tell thee this eric had gudruda done as much thinkest thou  and it seemed to him that the wraith of swanhild kissed him on the brow sighed and vanished bearing the rat in her bosom    eric awoke suddenly just as though he had never slept and looked around he knew by the lowness of the sun that it was far into the night and that he had slept for many hours they were alone beneath the deck and far aft beyond the mast as the vessel rose upon the wavesfor the sea was still rough though the wind had falleneric saw the mate of the raven talking earnestly with some men of his crew skallagrim snored beside him  awake eric said in his ear awake and listen  he yawned and roused himself what now lord he said  this said eric and he told him the dream that he had dreamed  that was a fey dream said skallagrim and now we must do as the wraith bade thee  easy to say but hard to do quoth eric this is a great rope that holds us and a strong  yes it is great and strong still we must burst it  now eric and skallagrim were made fast in this fashion their hands were bound behind them and their legs were lashed above the feet and above the knee moreover a thick cord was fixed about the waist of each and this cord was passed through the iron ring and knotted there but it chanced that beneath the hollows of their knees ran an oaken beam which held the forepart of the dragon together  we may try this said eric to set our feet against the beam and strain with all our strength upon the rope though i think that no two men can part it  we shall know that presently said skallagrim gathering up his legs  then they set their feet against the beam and pulled till it groaned but though the rope gave somewhat it would not break they rested a while then strained again till the sweat burst out upon them and the rope cut into their flesh but still it would not part  we have found our match said eric  that is not altogether proved yet answered the baresark many a shield is riven at the third stroke  so once again they set their feet against the beam and put out all their strength  the ring bends gasped eric now when the roll of the ship throws our weight to leeward in the name of thor pull  they waited then put out their might and lo though the rope did not break the iron ring burst asunder and they rolled upon the deck  well pulled truly said skallagrim as he struggled to his haunches i am marked about the middle with ropetwists for many a day to come that i will swear what next lord  whitefire answered eric  now their arms were piled a fathom or more from where they sat and right in the prow of the ship hither then they must crawl upon their knees and this was weary work for ever as the ship rolled they fell and could in no wise save themselves from hurt eric was bleeding at the brow and bloody was the hooked nose of skallagrim before they came to where whitefire was at length they reached the sword and pushed aside the bucklers that were over it with their heads the great warblade was sheathed and eric must needs lie upon his breast and draw the weapon somewhat with his teeth  this is an ill razor to shave with he said rising for the keen blade had cut his chin  so some have thought and perchance more shall think answered skallagrim now set the rope on the edge and rub  this they did and presently the thick cord that bound them was in two then eric knelt upon the deck and pressed the bonds that bound his legs upon the blade and after him skallagrim they were free now except for their hands and it was no easy thing to cut away the bonds upon their wrists it was done thus skallagrim sat upon the deck and eric pushed the sword between his fingers with his feet then the baresark rose holding the sword and eric turning back to back with him fretted the cords upon his wrists against the blade twice he cut himself but the third time the cord parted and he was free he stretched his arms for they were stiff then took whitefire and cut away the bonds of skallagrim  how goes it with that hurt of thine he asked  better than i had thought answered skallagrim the soreness has come out with the bruise  that is good news said eric for methinks unless swanhild walked the seas for nothing thou wilt soon need thine arms  they have never failed me yet said skallagrim and took his axe and shield what counsel now  this skallagrim that we lie down as we were and put the cloaks about us as though we were yet in bonds then if these knaves come we can take them unawares as they think to take us  so they went again to where they had been bound and lay down upon their shields and weapons drawing cloaks over them scarcely had they done this and rested a while when they saw the mate and all the crew coming along both boards towards them they bore no weapons in their hands  none too soon did swanhild walk said eric now we shall learn their purpose be thou ready to leap forth when i give the word  ay lord answered skallagrim as he worked his stiff arms to and fro in such matters few have thought me backward  what news friends cried eric as the men drew near  bad news for thee brighteyes answered the mate and that baresark thrall of thine for we must loose your bands  that is good news then said eric for our limbs are numb and dead because of the nipping of the cords is land in sight  nay nor will be for thee eric  how now friend how now sure having handselled peace to us ye mean no harm towards two unarmed men  we swore to do you no harm nor will we eric this only will we do deliver you bound to ran and leave her to deal with you as she may  bethink you sirs said eric this is a cruel deed and most unmanly we yielded to you in faithwill ye break your troth  war has no troth he answered ye are too great to let slip between our fingers shall it be said of us that two men overcame us all  mayhap murmured skallagrim beneath his breath  oh sirs i beseech you said eric i am young and there is a maid who waits me out in iceland and it is hard to die and he made as though he wept while skallagrim laughed within his sleeve for it was strange to see eric feigning fear  but the men mocked aloud  this is the great man they cried this is that eric of whose deeds folk sing look he weeps like a child when he sees the water drag him forth and away with him into the sea  little need for that cried eric and lo the cloaks about him and skallagrim flew aside out they came with a roar they came out as a shebear from her cave and high above brighteyes golden curls whitefire shone in the pale light and nigh to it shone the axe of skallagrim whitefire flared aloft then down he fell and sought the false heart of the mate the great axe of skallagrim shone and was lost in the breast of the carle who stood before him  trolls shrieked one here are trolls and turned to fly but again whitefire was up and that man flew not farone pace and no more then they fled screaming and after them came axe and sword they fled they fell they leaped into the sea till none were left to fall and leap for they had no time or heart to find or draw their weapons and presently eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail stood alone upon the deckalone with the dead  swanhild is a wise witch gasped eric and whatever ill she has done i will remember this to her honour  little good comes of witchcraft answered skallagrim wiping his brow today it works for our hands tomorrow it shall work against them  to the helm said eric the ship yaws and comes side on to the seas  skallagrim sprang to the tiller and put his strength on it and but just in time for one big sea came aboard them and left much water in the hold  we owe this to thy baresark ways said eric hadst thou not slain the steersman we had not filled with water  true lord answered skallagrim but when once my axe is aloft it seems to fly of itself till nothing is left before it what course now  the same on which the gudruda was laid perhaps if we may endure till we come to the farey isles we shall find her in harbour there   the faroes  there is not much chance of that said skallagrim still the wind is fair and we fly fast before it  then they lashed the tiller and set to bailing they bailed long and it was heavy work but they rid the ship of much water after that they ate food for it was now morning and it came on to blow yet more strongly  for three days and three nights it blew thus and the raven sped along before the gale all this time turn and turn about eric and skallagrim stood at the helm and tended the sails they had little time to eat and none to sleep they were so hard pressed also and must harbour their strength so closely that the bodies of the dead men yet cumbered the hold thus they grew very weary and like to fall from faintness but still they held the raven on her course in the beginning of the fourth night a great sea struck the good ship so that she quivered from stem to stern  methinks i hear water bubbling up said skallagrim in a hoarse voice  eric climbed down into the well and lifted the bottom planks and there beneath them was a leak through which the water spouted in a thin stream he stopped up the rent as best he might with garments from the dead men and placed ballast stones upon them then clambered on to the deck again  our hours are short now he said the water rushes in apace  well it is time to rest said skallagrim but see lord and he pointed ahead what land is that  it must be the fareys answered eric now if we can but keep afloat for three hours more we may yet die ashore  after this the wind began to fall but still there was enough to drive the raven on swiftly  and ever the water gained in the hold  now they were not far from land for ahead of them the bleak hills towered up shining in the faint midnight light and between the hills was a cleft that seemed to be a fjord another hour passed and they were no more than ten furlongs from the mouth of the fjord when suddenly the wind fell and they were in calm water under shelter of the land they went amidships and looked the hold was half full of water and in it floated the bodies of ospakars men  she has not long to live said skallagrim but we may still be saved if the boat is not broken  now aft near the tiller a small boat was bound on the half deck of the raven they went to it and looked it was whole with oars lashed in it but half full of water which they must bail out this they did as swiftly as they might then they cut the little boat loose and having made it fast with a rope lifted it over the siderail and let it fall into the sea and that was no great way for the raven had sunk deep it fell on an even keel and eric let himself down the rope into it and called to skallagrim to follow  bide a while lord he answered there is that which i would bring with me  for a space eric waited and then called aloud swift thou fool swift the ship sinks  and as he called skallagrim came and his arms were full of swords and byrnies and red rings of gold that he had found time to gather from the dead and out of the cabin  throw all aside and come said eric laying on to the oars for the raven wallowed before she sank  there is yet time lord and the gear is good answered skallagrim and one by one he threw pieces down into the boat as the last fell the raven sank to her bulwarks then skallagrim stepped from the sinking deck into the boat and cut the cord not too soon  eric gave way with all his strength and as he pulled when he was no more than five fathoms from her the raven vanished with a huge swirl  hold still he said or we shall follow  round spun the boat in the eddy she was sucked down till the water trickled over her gunwale and for a moment they knew not if they were lost or saved eric held his breath and watched then slowly the boat lifted her nose and they were safe from the whirlpool of the lost dragon  greed is many a mans bane said eric and it was nearly thine and mine skallagrim  i had no heart to leave the good gear he answered and thou seest lord it is safe and we with it  then they got the boats head round slowly into the mouth of the fjord pausing now and again to rest for their strength was spent for two hours they rowed down a gulf as it were and on either side of them were barren hills at length the waterway opened out into a great basin and there on the further side of the basin they saw green slopes running down to the waters edge strewn with white stockfish set to dry in the wind and sun and above the slopes a large hall and about it booths moreover they saw a long dragon of war at anchor near the shore for a while they rowed on easing now and again then eric spoke to skallagrim  what thinkest thou of yonder ship lambstail  i think this lord that she is fashioned wondrous like to the gudruda  that is in my mind also said eric and our fortune is good if it is she  they rowed on again and presently a ray from the sun came over the hillsfor now it was three hours past midnightand the ship having swung a little with the tide lit upon her prow and lo there gleamed the golden dragon of the gudruda  this is a strange thing said eric  ay lord a strange and a merry for now i shall talk with hall the mate and the baresark smiled grimly  thou shalt do no hurt to hall said eric i am lord here and i must judge  thy will is my will said skallagrim but if my will were thine he would hang on the mast till seabirds nested amidst his bones  now they were close to the ship but they could see no man skallagrim would have called aloud but eric bade him hold his peace  either they are dead and thy calling cannot wake them or perchance they sleep and will wake of themselves we will row under the stern and having made fast climb aboard and see with our own eyes  this then they did as silently as might be and saw that the gudruda had not been handled gently by the winds and waves for her shield rail was washed away this they found also that all men lay deep in sleep now amidships a fire still burned and by it was food they came there and ate of the food of which they had great need then they took two cloaks that lay on the deck and throwing them about them warmed themselves over the fire for they were cold and wet ay and utterly outworn  as they sat thus warming themselves a man of the crew awoke and saw them and being amazed at once called to his fellows saying that two giants were aboard warming themselves at the fire now men sprang up and seizing their weapons ran towards them and among them was hall the mate  then suddenly eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail threw aside the cloaks and stood up they were gaunt and grim to see their cheeks were hollow and their eyes stared wide with want of sleep thick was their harness with brine and open wounds gaped upon their faces and their hands men saw and fell back in fear for they held them to be wizards risen from the sea in the shapes of eric and the baresark  then eric sang this song       swift and sure across the swans bath      sped seastag on ravens track      heavd rans breast in raging billows      streamd galebanners through the sky      yet did eric the wareager      leap with baresarkmate aboard      fierce their onset on the foemen      wherefore brake the grapnelchain  hall heard and slunk back for now he saw that these were indeed eric and skallagrim come up alive from the sea and that they knew his baseness  eric looked at him and sang again       swift away sped ship gudruda      left her lord in foemans ring      brighteyes back to back with baresark      held his head gainst mighty odds      down amidst the ballast tumbling      ospakars shieldcarles were rolled      holy peace at length they handselled      eric must in bonds be laid       came the grey rat came the earls wife      came the witchword from afar      cagd wolves roused them and with struggling      tore their fetter from its hold      now they watch upon their weapons      now they weep and pray for life      now they leap forth like a torrent      swept away in foemans strength       then alone upon the raven      three long days they steer and sail      till the waters welling upwards      wash dead men about their feet      fails the gale and sinks the dragon      barely may they win the boat      safe they stand on ship gudruda      say who cut the grapnelchain     xv  how eric dwelt in london town  men stood astonished but hall the mate slunk back  hold comrade said eric i have something to say that songs cannot carry hearken my shieldmates we swore to be true to each other even to death is it not so what then shall be said of that man who cut loose the gudruda and left us two to die at the foemans hand  who was the man asked a voice  that man was hall of lithdale said eric  it is false said hall gathering up his courage the cable parted beneath the straining of the ship and afterwards we could not put about because of the great sea  thou art false roared skallagrim with my eyes i saw thee let thine axe fall upon the cable liar art thou and dastard thou art jealous also of brighteyes thy lord and this was in thy mind to let him die upon the raven and then to bind his shoes upon thy cowardly feet though none else saw i saw and i say this that if i may have my will i will string thee living to the prow in that same cable till gulls tear out thy foxheart  now hall grew very white and his knees trembled beneath him it is true he said that i cut the chain but not from any thought of evil had i not cut it the vessel must have sunk and all been lost  did we not swear hall said eric sternly together to fight and together to falltogether to fare and if need be together to cease from faring and dost thou read the oath thus say mates what reward shall be paid to this man for his good fellowship to us and his tenderness for your lives  as with one voice the men answered death  thou hearest hall said eric yet i would deal more gently with one to whom i swore fellowship so lately get thee gone from our company and let us see thy curs face no more get thee gone i say before i repent of my mercy  then amidst a loud hooting hall took his weapons and without a word slunk into the boat of the raven that lay astern and rowed ashore nor did eric see his face for many months  thou hast done foolishly lord to let that weasel go said skallagrim for he will live to nip thy hand  for good or evil he is gone said eric and now i am worn out and desire to sleep    after this eric and skallagrim rested three full days and they were so weary that they were awake for little of this time but on the third day they rose up strong and well except for their hurts and soreness then they told the men of that which had come to pass and all wondered at their might and hardihood to them indeed eric seemed as a god for few such deeds as his had been told of since the godkind were on earth  but brighteyes thought little of his deeds and much of gudruda at times also he thought of swanhild and of that witchdream she sent him for it was wonderful to him that she should have saved him thus from rans net  eric was heartily welcomed by the earl of the farey isles for when he heard his deeds he made a feast in his honour and set him in the high seat it was a great feast but skallagrim became drunk at it and ran down the chamber axe aloft roaring for hall of lithdale  this angered eric much and he would scarcely speak to skallagrim for many days though the great baresark slunk about after him like his shadow or a whipped hound at its masters heel and at length humbled his pride so far as to ask pardon for his fault  i grant it for thy deeds sake said eric shortly but this is upon my mind that thou wilt err thus again and it shall be my cause of deathay and that of many more  first may my bones be white said skallagrim  they shall be white thereafter answered eric  at fareys eric shipped twelve good men and true to take the seats of those who had been slain by ospakars folk afterwards when the wounded were well of their hurts except one man who died and the gudruda was made fit to take the sea again brighteyes bade farewell to the earl of those isles who gave him a good cloak and a gold ring at parting and sailed away    now it were too long to tell of all the deeds that eric and his men did never so scalds sing was there a viking like him for strength and skill and hardihood and in those days no such wardragon as the gudruda had been known upon the sea wherever eric joined battle and that was in many places he conquered for none prevailed against him till at last foes would fly before the terror of his name and earls and kings would send from far craving the aid of his hands withal he was the best and gentlest of men it is said of eric that in all his days he did no base deed nor hurt the weak nor refused peace to him who prayed it nor lifted sword against prisoner or wounded foe from traders he would take a toll of their merchandise only and let them go and whatever gains he won he would share equally asking no larger part than the meanest of his band all men loved eric and even his foes gave him honour and spoke well of him now that hall of lithdale was gone there was no man among his mates who would not have passed to death for him for they held him dearer than their lives women too loved him much but his heart was set upon gudruda and he seldom turned to look on them  the first summer of his outlawry eric warred along the coast of ireland but in the winter he came to dublin and for a while served in the bodyguard of the king of that town who held him in honour and would have had him stay there but eric would not bide there and next spring the gudruda being ready for sea he sailed for the shores of england there he gave battle to two vikings ships of war and took them after a hard fight it was in this fight that skallagrim lambstail was wounded almost to death for when having taken one ship eric boarded the other with but few men he was driven back and fell over a beam and would have been slain had not skallagrim thrown himself across his body taking on his own back that blow of a battleaxe which was aimed at erics head this was a great wound for the axe shore through the steel of the byrnie and sank into the flesh but when erics men saw their lord down and skallagrim as they deemed dead athwart him they made so fierce a rush that the foemen fell before them like leaves before a winter gale and the end of it was that the vikings prayed peace of eric skallagrim lay sick for many days but he was hard to kill and eric nursed him back to life after this these two loved each other as brother loves twin brother and they could scarcely bear to be apart but other people did not love skallagrim nor he them  eric sailed on up the thames to london bringing the viking ships with him and he delivered their captains bound to edmund edwards son the king who was called edmund the magnificent these captains the king hung for they had wrought damage to his ships  eric found much favour with the king and indeed his fame had gone before him so when he came into the court bravely clad with skallagrim at his back who was now almost recovered of his wound the king called out to him to draw near saying that he desired to look on the bravest viking and most beauteous man who sailed the seas and on that fierce baresark whom men called erics deathshadow  so eric came forward up the long hall that was adorned with things more splendid than ever his eyes had seen and stood before the king with him came skallagrim driving the two captive viking chiefs before him with his axe as a flesher drives lambs now during these many months brighteyes had grown yet more great in girth and glorious to look on than he was before moreover his hair was now so long that it flowed like a flood of gold down towards his girdle for since gudruda trimmed it no shears had come near his head and his locks grew fast as a womans the king looked at him and was astonished  of a truth he said men have not lied about thee icelander nor concerning that great wolfhound of thine and he pointed at skallagrim with his sword of state never saw i such a man and he bade all the mightiest men of his bodyguard stand forward that he might measure them against eric but brighteyes was an inch taller than the tallest and measured half a span more round the chest than the biggest  what wouldest thou of me icelander asked the king  this lord said eric to serve thee a while and all my men with me  that is an offer that few would turn from answered the king thou shalt go into my bodyguard and if i have my will thou shalt be near me in battle and thy wolfdog also  eric said that he asked no better and thereafter he went up with edmund the king to make war on the danes of mercia and he and skallagrim did great deeds before the eyes of the englishmen  that winter eric and his company came back to london and abode with the king in much state and honour now there was a certain lady of the court named elfrida she was both fair and wealthy the sweetest of women and of royal blood by her mothers side so soon as her eyes fell on eric she loved him and no one thing did she desire more than to be his wife but brighteyes kept aloof from her for he loved gudruda alone and so the winter wore away and in the spring he went away warring nor did he come back till autumn was at hand  the lady elfrida sat at a window when eric rode through london town in the kings following and as he passed she threw him a wreath of flowers the king saw it and laughed  my cold kinswoman seems to melt before those bright eyes of thine icelander he said as my foes melt before whitefires flame well i could wish her a worse mate and he looked on him strangely  eric bowed but made no answer  that night as they sat at meat in the palace the lady elfrida being bidden in jest of edmund the king to fill the cup of the bravest passed down the board and before all men poured wine into erics cup and as she did so welcomed him back with short sweet words  eric grew red as dawn and thanked her graciously but after the feast he spoke with skallagrim asking him of the gudruda and when she could be ready to take the sea  in ten days lord said skallagrim but stay we not here with the king this winter it is late to sail  nay said eric we bide not here i would winter this year in fareys for they are the nighest place to iceland that i may reach next summer my three years of outlawry are over and i would fare back homewards  now i see the shadow of a womans hand said skallagrim it is very late to face the northern seas and we may sail to iceland from london in the spring  it is my will that we should sail answered eric  past orkneys runs the road to fareys said skallagrim and in orkneys sits a hawk to whom the lady elfrida is but a dove in faring from ill we may hap on worse  it is my will that we sail said eric stubbornly  as thou wilt and as the king wills answered skallagrim  on the morrow eric went in before the king and craved a boon  there is little that thou canst ask brighteyes said the king that i will not give thee for by my troth i hold thee dear  i am come back to seek no great thing lord answered eric but this only leave to bid thee farewell i would wend homeward  say eric said the king have i not dealt well with thee  well and overwell lord  why then wouldst thou leave me i have this in my mindto bring thee to great honour see now there is a fair lady in this court and in her veins runs blood that even an iceland viking might be proud to mate with she has great lands and mayhap she shall have more canst thou not find a home on them thinkest thou brighteyes  in iceland only i am at home lord said eric  then the king was wroth and bade him begone when it pleased him and eric bowed before him and went out  two days afterwards while eric was walking in the palace gardens he met the lady elfrida face to face she held white flowers in her hand and she was fair to see and pale as the flowers she bore  he greeted her and after a while she spoke to him in a gentle voice they say that thou goest from england brighteyes she said  yes lady i go he answered  she looked on him once and twice and then burst out weeping why goest thou hence to that cold land of thine she sobbedthat hateful land of snow and ice is not england good enough for thee  i am at home there lady and there my mother waits me  there thy mother waits thee ericsay does a maid called gudruda the fair wait thee there also  there is such a maid in iceland said eric  yes i know iti know it all she answered drying her tears and of a sudden growing cold and proud eric thou art betrothed to this gudruda and for thy welfare somewhat overfaithful to thy troth for hearken eric brighteyes i know this that little luck shall come to thee from the maid gudruda it would become me ill to say more nevertheless this is truethat here in england good fortune waits thy hand and there in iceland such fortune as men mete to their foes knowest thou this  eric looked at her and answered lady he said men are not born of their own will they live and do little that they will they do and go perchance whither they would not yet it may happen to a man that one meets him whose hand he fain would hold if it be but for an hours travel over icy ways and it is better to hold that hand for this short hour than to wend his life through at a strangers side  perhaps there is wisdom in thy folly said the lady elfrida still i tell thee this that no good luck waits thee there in iceland  it well may be said eric my days have been stormy and the gale is still brewing but it is a poor heart that fears the storm better to sink for coward or hero all must sink at last  say eric said the lady if that hand thou dost desire to hold is lost to thee what then  if that hand is cold in death then henceforth i wend my ways alone  and if it be held of another hand than thine  then i will journey back to england lady and here in this fair garden i may crave speech of thee again  they looked one on another fare thee well eric said the lady elfrida here in this garden we may talk again and if we talk no morewhy fare thee well days come and go the swallow takes flight at winter and lo at spring it twitters round the eaves and if it come not again then farewell to that swallow the world is a great house eric and there is room for many swallows but alas for her who is left desolatealas alas and she turned and went  it is told of this lady elfrida that she became very wealthy and was much honoured for her gentleness and wisdom and that when she was old she built a great church and named it ericskirk it is also told that though many sought her in marriage she wedded none     xvi  how swanhild walked the seas  within two days afterwards the gudruda being bound for sea eric went up to bid farewell to the king but edmund was so angry with him because of his going that he would not see him thereon eric took horse and rode down sadly from the palace to the riverbank where the gudruda lay but when he was about to give the word to get out the oars the king himself rode up and with him men bearing costly gifts eric went ashore to speak with him  i am angry with thee brighteyes said edmund yet it is not in my heart to let thee go without words and gifts of farewell this only i ask of thee now that if things go not well with thee there out in iceland thou wilt come back to me  i willthat i promise thee king said eric for i shall never find a better lord  nor i a braver servant said the king then he gave him the gifts and kissed him before all men to skallagrim also he gave a good byrnie of welsh steel coloured black  then eric went aboard again and dropped down the river with the tide  for five days all went well with them the sea being calm and the winds light and favourable but on the fifth night as they sailed slowly along the coasts of east anglia over against yarmouth sands the moon rose red and ringed and the sea fell dead calm  yonder hangs a stormlamp lord said skallagrim pointing to the angry moon we shall soon be bailing for the autumn gales draw near  wait till they come then speak said eric thou croakest ever like a raven  and ravens croak before foul weather answered skallagrim and just as he spoke a sudden gust of wind came up from the southeast and laid the gudruda over after this it came on to blow and so fiercely that for whole days and nights their clothes were scarcely dry they ran northwards before the storm and still northward sighting no land and seeing no stars and ever as they scudded on the gale grew fiercer till at length the men were worn out with bailing and starved with wet and cold three of their number also were washed away by the seas and all were in sorry plight  it was the fourth night of the gale eric stood at the helm and by him skallagrim they were alone for their comrades were spent and lay beneath decks waiting for death the ship was half full of water but they had no more strength to bail eric seemed grim and gaunt in the white light of the moon and his long hair streamed about him wildly grimmer yet was skallagrim as he clung to the shieldrail and stared across the deep  she rolls heavily lord he shouted and the water gains fast  can the men bail no more asked eric  nay they are outworn and wait for death  they need not wait long said eric what do they say of me  nothing  then eric groaned aloud it was my stubbornness that brought us to this pass he said i care little for myself but it is ill that all should die for one mans folly  grieve not lord answered skallagrim that is the worlds way and there are worse things than to drown listen methinks i hear the roar of breakers yonder and he pointed to the left  breakers they surely are said eric now the end is near but see is not that land looming up on the right or is it cloud  it is land said skallagrim and i am sure of this that we run into a firth look the seas boil like a hot spring hold on thy course lord perchance we may yet steer between rocks and land already the wind falls and the current lessens the seas  ay said eric already the fog and rain come up and he pointed ahead where dense clouds gathered in the shape of a giant whose head reached to the skies and moved towards them hiding the moon  skallagrim looked then spoke now here it seems is witchwork say lord hast thou ever seen mist travel against wind as it travels now  never before said eric and as he spoke the light of the moon went out    swanhild atlis wife sat in beauty in her bower on straumey isle and looked with wide eyes towards the sea it was midnight none stirred in atlis hall but still swanhild looked out towards the sea  now she turned and spoke into the darkness for there was no light in the bower save the light of her great eyes  art thou there she said i have summoned thee thrice in the words thou knowest say toad art there  ay swanhild the fatherless swanhild groas daughter witchmothers witchchild i am here what is thy will with me piped a thin voice like the voice of a dying babe  swanhild shuddered a little and her eyes grew brighteras bright as the eyes of a cat  this first she said that thou show thyself hideous as thou art i had rather see thee than speak with thee seeing thee not  mock not my form lady answered the thin voice for it is as thou dost fashion it in thy thought to the good i am fair as day to the evil foul as their heart toad thou didst call me look now i come as a toad  swanhild looked and behold a ring of the darkness grew white with light and in it crouched a thing hideous to see it was shaped as a great spotted toad and on it was set a hags face with white locks hanging down on either side its eyes were bloodred and sunken black were its fangs and its skin was dead yellow it grinned horribly as swanhild shrank from it then spoke again  grey wolf thou didst call me once swanhild when thou wouldst have thrust gudruda down goldfoss gulf and as a grey wolf i came and gave thee counsel that thou tookest but ill rat didst thou call me once when thou wouldst save brighteyes from the carles of ospakar and as a rat i came and in thy shape i walked the seas toad thou callest me now and as a toad i creep about thy feet name thy will swanhild and i will name my price but be swift for there are other fair ladies whose wish i must do ere dawn  thou art hideous to look on said swanhild placing her hand before her eyes  say not so lady say not so look at this face of mine knowest thou it not it is thy mothersdead groa lent it me i took it from where she lies and my toads skin i drew from thy spotted heart swanhild and more hideous than i am shalt thou be in a day to come as once i was more fair than thou art today  swanhild opened her lips to shriek but no sound came  troll she whispered mock me not with lies but hearken to my bidding where sails eric now  look out into the night lady and thou shalt see  swanhild looked and the ways of the darkness opened before her witchsight there at the mouth of pentland firth the gudruda laboured heavily in the great seas and by the tiller stood eric and with him skallagrim  seest thou thy love asked the familiar  yea she answered full clearly he is worn with wind and sea but more glorious than aforetime and his hair is long say what shall befall him if thou aidest not  this that he shall safely pass the firth for the gale falls and come safely to fareys and from fareys isles to gudrudas arms  and what canst thou do goblin  this i can lure erics ship to wreck and give his comrades all save skallagrim to rans net and bring him to thy arms swanhild witchmothers witchchild  she hearkened her breast heaved and her eyes flashed  and thy price toad  thou art the price lady piped the goblin thou shalt give thyself to me when thy day is done and merrily will we sisters dwell in helas halls and merrily for ever will we fare about the earth o nights doing such tasks as this task of thine swanhild and working wicked woe till the last woe is worked on us art thou content  swanhild thought twice her breath went from her lips in great sighs then she stood pale and silent  safely shall he sail the firth piped the thin voice safely shall he sit in fareys safely shall he lie in white gudrudas armshee hee think of it lady  then swanhild shook like a birthtree in the gale and her face grew ashen  i am content she said  hee hee brave lady she is content ah we sisters shall be merry hearken if i aid thee thus i may do no more thrice has the nightowl come at thy callnow it must wing away yet things will be as i have said thine own wisdom shall guide the rest ere morn brighteyes shall stand in atlis hall ere spring he will be thy love and ere autumn gudruda shall sit on the high seat in the hall of middalhof the bride of ospakar draw nigh give me thine arm sister that blood may seal our bargain  swanhild drew near the toad and shuddering stretched out her arm and then and there the red blood ran and there they sealed their sisterhood and as the nameless deed was wrought it seemed to swanhild as though fire shot through her veins and fire surged before her eyes and in the fire a shape passed up weeping  it is done bloodsister piped the voice now i must away in thy form to be about thy tasks seat thee here before meso now lay thy brow upon my browfear not it was thy motherslife on death curling locks on corpse hair see so we changewe change now thou art the deathtoad and i am swanhild atlis wife who shall be erics love  then swanhild knew that her beauty had entered into the foulness of the toad and the foulness of the toad into her beauty for there before her stood her own shape and here she crouched a toad upon the floor  away to work away said a soft low voice her own voice speaking from her own body that stood before her and lo it was gone  but swanhild crouched in the shape of a hagheaded toad upon the ground in her bower of atlis hall and felt wickedness and evil longings and hate boil and seethe within her heart she looked out through her sunken horny eyes and she seemed to see strange sights she saw atli her lord dead upon the grass she saw a woman asleep and above her flashed a sword she saw the hall of middalhof red with blood she saw a great gulf in a mountains heart and men fell down it and last she saw a warship sailing fast out on the sea afire and vanish there  now the witchhag who wore swanhilds loveliness stood upon the cliffs of straumey and tossed her white arms towards the north  come fog come sleet she cried come fog come sleet put out the moon and blind the eyes of eric and as she called the fog rose up like a giant and stretched his arms from shore to shore  move fog beat rain she cried move and beat against the gale and blind the eyes of eric  and the fog moved on against the wind and with it sleet and rain  now i am afeared said eric to skallagrim as they stood in darkness upon the ship the gale blows from behind us and yet the mist drives fast in our faces what comes now  this is witchwork lord answered skallagrim and in such things no counsel can avail hold the tiller straight and drive on say i methinks the gale lessens more and more  so they did for a little while and all around them sounded the roar of breakers darker grew the sky and darker yet till at the last though they stood side by side they could not see each others shapes  this is strange sailing said eric i hear the roar of breakers as it were beneath the prow  lash the helm lord and let us go forward if there are breakers perhaps we shall see their foam through the blackness said skallagrim  eric did so and they crept forward on the starboard board right to the prow of the ship and there skallagrim peered into the fog and sleet  lord he whispered presently and his voice shook strangely what is that yonder on the waters seest thou aught  eric stared and said by odin i see a shape of light like to the shape of a woman it walks upon the waters towards us and the mist melts before it and the sea grows calm beneath its feet  i see that also said skallagrim  she comes nigh gasped eric see how swift she comes by the dead it is swanhilds shape look skallagrim look how her eyes flamelook how her hair streams upon the wind  it is swanhild and we are fey quoth skallagrim and they ran back to the helm where skallagrim sank upon the deck in fear  see skallagrim she glides before the gudrudas beak she glides backwards and she points yonderthere to the right shall i put the helm down and follow her  nay lord nay set no faith in witchcraft or evil will befall us  as he spoke a great gust of wind shook the ship the music of the breakers roared in their ears and the gleaming shape upon the waters tossed its arms wildly and pointed to the right  the breakers call ahead said eric the shape points yonder where i hear no sound of sea once before thou mindest swanhild walked the waves to warn us and thereby saved us from the men of ospakar ever she swore she loved me now she is surely come in love to save us and all our comrades say shall i put about look once more she waves her arms and points and as he spoke he gripped the helm  i have no rede lord said skallagrim and i love not witchwork we can die but once and death is all around be it as thou wilt  eric put down the helm with all his might the good ship answered and her timbers groaned loudly as though in woe when the strain of the sea struck her abeam then once more she flew fast across the waters and fast before her glided the wraith of swanhild now it pointed here and now there and as it pointed so eric shaped his course for a while the noise of breakers lessened but now again came a thunder like the thunder of waves smiting on a cliff and about the sides of the gudruda the waves hissed like snakes  suddenly the shape threw up its arms and seemed to sink beneath the waves while a sound like the sound of a great laugh went up from sea to sky  now here is the end said skallagrim and we are lured to doom  ere ever the words had passed his lips the ship struck and so fiercely that they were rolled upon the deck suddenly the sky grew clear the moon shone out and before them were cliffs and rocks and behind them a great wave rushed on from the hold of the ship there came a cry for now their comrades were awake and they knew that death was here  eric gripped skallagrim round the middle and looked aft on rushed the wave no such wave had he ever seen now it struck and the gudruda burst asunder beneath the blow  but eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail were lifted on its crest and knew no more    swanhild crouching in hideous guise upon the ground in the bower of atlis hall looked upon the visions that passed before her suddenly a womans shape her own shape was there  it is done bloodsister said a voice her own voice merrily i walked the waves and oh merry was the cry of erics folk when ran caught them in her net be thyself again bloodsisterbe fair as thou art foul then arise wake atli thy lord and go down to the seas lip by the southern cliffs and see what thou shalt find we shall meet no more till all this game is played and another game is set and the shape of swanhild crouched upon the floor before the hagheaded toad muttering pass pass  then swanhild felt her flesh come back to her and as it grew upon her so the shape of the deathheaded toad faded away  farewell bloodsister piped a voice make merry as thou mayest but merrier shall be our nights when thou hast gone asailing with eric on the sea farewell farewell werewolf thou didst call me once and as a wolf i came rat thou didst call me once and as a rat i came toad didst thou call me once and as a toad i came say at the last what wilt thou call me and in what shape shall i come bloodsister till then farewell    and all was gone and all was still     xvii  how asmund the priest wedded unna thorods daughter  now the story goes back to iceland  when brighteyes was gone for a while gudruda the fair moved sadly about the stead like one newwidowed then came tidings men told how ospakar blacktooth had waylaid eric on the seas with two long ships dragons of war and how eric had given him battle and sunk one dragon with great loss to ospakar they told also how blacktooths other dragon the raven had sailed away before the wind and eric had sailed after it in a rising gale but of what befell these ships no news came for many a month and it was rumoured that this had befallen themthat both had sunk in the gale and that eric was dead  but gudruda would not believe this when asmund the priest her father asked her why she did not believe it she answered that had eric been dead her heart would surely have spoken to her of it to this asmund said that it might be so  hayharvest being done asmund made ready for his wedding with unna thorods daughter and erics cousin  now it was agreed that the marriagefeast should be held at middalhof for asmund wished to ask a great company to the wedding and there was no place at coldback to hold so many also some of the kin of thorod unnas father were bidden to the feast from the east and north at length all was prepared and the guests came in great companies for no such feast had been made in this quarter for many years  on the eve of the marriage asmund spoke with groa the witchwife had borne herself humbly since she was recovered from her sickness she passed about the stead like a rat at night speaking few words and with downcast eyes she was busy also making all things ready for the feasting  now as asmund went up the hall seeing that everything was in order groa drew near to him and touched him gently on the shoulder  are things to thy mind lord she said  yes groa he answered more to my mind than to thine i fear  fear not lord thy will is my will  say groa is it thy wish to bide here in middalhof when unna is my housewife  it is my wish to serve thee as aforetime she answered softly if so be that unna wills it  that is her desire said asmund and went his ways  but groa stood looking after him and her face was fierce and evil  while bane has virtue while runes have power and while hand has cunning never unna shalt thou take my place at asmunds side out of the water i came to thee asmund into the water i go again unquiet shall i lie thereunquiet shall i wend through helas halls but unna shall rest at asmunds sidein asmunds cairn  then again she moved about the hall making all things ready for the feast but at midnight when the light was low and folk slept groa rose and veiled in a black robe with a basket in her hand passed like a shadow through the mists that hang about the rivers edge and in silence always looking behind her like one who fears a hidden foe culled flowers of noisome plants that grow in the marsh her basket being filled she passed round the stead to a hidden dell upon the mountain side here a man stood waiting and near him burned a fire of turf in his hand he held an ironpot it was koll the halfwitted groas thrall  are all things ready koll she said  yes he answered but i like not these tasks of thine mistress say now what wouldst thou do with the fire and the pot  this then koll i would brew a lovepotion for asmund the priest as he has bidden me to do  i have done many an ill deed for thee mistress but of all of them i love this the least said the thrall doubtfully  i have done many a good deed for thee koll it was i who saved thee from the doomstone seeming to prove thee innocentay even when thy back was stretched on it because thou hadst slain a man in his sleep is it not so  yea mistress  and yet thou wast guilty koll and i have given thee many good gifts is it not so  yes it is so  listen then serve me this once and i will give thee one last giftthy freedom and with it two hundred in silver  kolls eyes glistened what must i do mistress  today at the weddingfeast it will be thy part to pour the cups while asmund calls the toasts last of all when men are merry thou wilt mix that cup in which asmund shall pledge unna his wife and unna must pledge asmund now when thou hast poured thou shalt pass the cup to me as i stand at the foot of the high seat waiting to give the bride greeting on behalf of the servingwomen of the household thou shalt hand the cup to me as though in error and that is but a little thing to ask of thee  a little thing indeed said koll staring at her and pulling with his hand at his red hair yet i like it not what if i say no mistress  say no or speak of this and i will promise thee one thing only thou knave and it is before winter comes that the crows shall pick thy bones now brave me if thou darest and straightway groa began to mutter some witchwords  nay said koll holding up his hand as though to ward away a blow curse me not i will do as thou wilt but when shall i touch the two hundred in silver  i will give thee half before the feast begins and half when it is ended and with it freedom to go where thou wilt and now leave me and on thy life see that thou fail me not  i have never failed thee yet said koll and went his ways  now groa set the pot upon the fire and placing in it the herbs that she had gathered poured water on them presently they began to boil and as they boiled she stirred them with a peeled stick and muttered spells over them for long she sat in that dim and lonely place stirring the pot and muttering spells till at length the brew was done  she lifted the pot from the fire and smelt at it then drawing a phial from her robe she poured out the liquor and held it to the sky the witchwater was white as milk but presently it grew clear she looked at it then smiled evilly  here is a lovedraught for a queenah a lovedraught for a queen she said and still smiling she placed the phial in her breast  then having scattered the fire with her foot groa took the pot and threw it into a deep pool of water where it could not be found readily and crept back to the stead before men were awake    now the day wore on and all the company were gathered at the marriagefeast to the number of nearly two hundred unna sat in the high seat and men thought her a bonny bride and by her side sat asmund the priest he was a hale strong man to look on though he had seen some threescore winters but his mien was sad and his heart heavy he drank cup after cup to cheer him but all without avail for his thought sped back across the years and once more he seemed to see the face of gudruda the gentle as she lay dying and to hear her voice when she foretold evil to him if he had aught to do with groa the witchwife and now it seemed to him that the evil was at hand though whence it should come he knew not he looked up there groa moved along the hall ministering to the guests but he saw as she moved that her eyes were always fixed now on him and now on unna he remembered that curse also which groa had called down upon him when he had told her that he was betrothed to unna and his heart grew cold with fear now i will change my counsel asmund said to himself groa shall not stay here in this stead for i will look no longer on that dark face of hers she goes hence tomorrow  not far from asmund sat björn his son as gudruda the fair his sister brought him mead he caught her by the sleeve whispering in her ear methinks our father is sad what weighs upon his heart  i know not said gudruda but as she spoke she looked first on asmund then at groa  it is ill that groa should stop here whispered björn again  it is ill answered gudruda and glided away  asmund saw their talk and guessed its purport rousing himself he laughed aloud and called to koll the halfwitted to pour the cups that he might name the toasts  koll filled and as asmund called the toasts one by one koll handed the cups to him asmund drank deep of each till at length his sorrow passed from him and together with all who sat there he grew merry  last of all came the toast of the brides cup but before asmund called it the women of the household drew near the high seat to welcome unna when she should have drunk gudruda stood foremost and groa was next to her  now koll filled as before and it was a great cup of gold that he filled  asmund rose to call the toast and with him all who were in the hall koll brought up the cup and handed it not to asmund but to groa but there were few who noted this for all were listening to asmunds toast and most of the guests were somewhat drunken  the cup cried asmundgive me the cup that i may drink  then groa started forward and as she did so she seemed to stumble so that for a moment her robe covered up the great bridecup then she gathered herself together slowly and smiling passed up the cup  asmund lifted it to his lips and drank deep then he turned and gave it to unna his wife but before she drank he kissed her on the lips  now while all men shouted such a welcome that the hall shook and as unna smiling drank from the cup the eyes of asmund fell upon groa who stood beneath him and lo her eyes seemed to flame and her face was hideous as the face of a troll  asmund grew white and put his hand to his head as though to think then cried aloud  drink not unna the draught is drugged and he struck at the vessel with his hand  he smote it indeed and so hard that it flew from her hand far down the hall  but unna had already drunk deep  the draught is drugged asmund cried and pointed to groa while all men stood silent not knowing what to do  the draught is drugged he cried a third time and that witch has drugged it and he began to tear at his breast  then groa laughed so shrilly that men trembled to hear her  yes lord she screamed the draught is drugged and groa the witchwife hath drugged it ay tear thy heart out asmund and unna grow thou white as snowsoon if my medicine has virtue thou shalt be whiter yet hearken all men asmund the priest is swanhilds father and for many a year i have been asmunds mate what did i tell thee lordthat i would see the two of you dead ere unna should take my placeay and on gudruda the fair thy daughter and björn thy son and eric brighteyes gudrudas love and many another manon them too shall my curse fall tear thy heart out asmund unna grow thou white as snow the draught is drugged and groa rans gift groa the witchwife groa asmunds love hath drugged it  and ere ever a man might lift a hand to stay her groa glided past the high seat and was gone  for a space all stood silent asmund ceased clutching at his breast rising he spoke heavily  now i learn that sin is a stone to smite him who hurled it gudruda the gentle spoke sooth when she warned me against this woman new wed new dead unna fare thee well  and straightway asmund fell down and died there by the high seat in his own hall  unna gazed at him with ashen face then plucking at her bosom she sprang from the dais and rushed along the hall screaming men made way for her and at the door she also fell dead    this then was the end of asmund asmundson the priest and unna thorods daughter erics cousin his newmade wife    for a moment there was silence in the hall but before the echoes of unnas screams had died away björn cried aloud  the witch where is the witch  then with a yell of rage men leaped to their feet seizing their weapons and rushed from the stead out they ran there on the hillside far above them a black shape climbed and leapt swiftly they gave tongue like dogs set upon a wolf and sped up the hill  they gained the crest of the hill and now they were at goldfoss brink lo the witchwife had crossed the bed of the torrent for little rain had fallen and the river was low she stood on sheepsaddle the water running from her robes on sheepsaddle she stood and cursed them  björn took a bow and set a shaft upon the string he drew it and the arrow sung through the air and smote her speeding through her heart with a cry groa threw up her arms  then down she plunged she fell on wolfs fang where eric once had stood and bouncing thence rushed to the boiling deeps below and was no more seen for ever  thus then did asmund the priest wed unna thorods daughter and this was the end of the feasting  thereafter björn asmunds son ruled at middalhof and was priest in his place he sought for koll the halfwitted to kill him but koll took the fells and after many months he found passage in a ship that was bound for scotland  now björn was a hard man and a greedy he was no friend to eric brighteyes and always pressed it on gudruda that she should wed ospakar blacktooth but to this counsel gudruda would not listen for day and night she thought upon her love next summer there came tidings that eric was safe in ireland and men spoke of his deeds and of how he and skallagrim had swept the ship of ospakar singlehanded now after these tidings for a while gudruda walked singing through the meads and no flower that grew in them was half so fair as she  that summer also ospakar blacktooth met björn asmunds son at the thing and they talked much together in secret     xviii  how earl atli found eric and skallagrim on the southern rocks of straumey isle  swanhild robed in white as though new risen from sleep stood candle in hand by the bed of atli the earl her lord crying awake  what passes now said atli lifting himself upon his arm what passes swanhild and why dost thou ever wander alone at nights looking so strangely i love not thy dark witchways swanhild and i was wed to thee in an ill hour wife who art no wife  in an ill hour indeed earl atli she answered an ill hour for thee and me for as thou hast said eld and youth are strange yokefellows and pull different paths arise now earl for i have dreamed a dream  tell it to me on the morrow then quoth atli there is small joyousness in thy dreams that always point to evil and i must bear enough evil of late  nay lord my rede may not be put aside so listen now i have dreamed that a great dragon of war has been cast away upon straumeys southwestern rocks the cries of those who drowned rang in my ears but i thought that some came living to the shore and lie there senseless to perish of the cold arise therefore take men and go down to the rocks  i will go at daybreak said atli letting his head fall upon the pillow i have little faith in such visions and it is too late for ships of war to try the passage of the firth  arise i say answered swanhild sternly and do my bidding else i will myself go to search the rocks  then atli rose grumbling and shook the heavy sleep from his eyes for of all living folk he most feared swanhild his wife he donned his garments threw a thick cloak about him and going to the hall where men snored around the dying fires for the night was bitter he awoke some of them now among those men whom he called was hall of lithdale hall the mate who had cut the grapnelchain for this hall fearing to return to iceland had come hither saying that he had been wounded off fareys in the great fight between eric and ospakars men and left there to grow well of his hurt or die then atli not knowing that the carle lied had bid him welcome for erics sake for he still loved eric above all men  but hall loved not labour and nightfarings to search for shipwrecked men of whom the lady swanhild had chanced to dream so he turned himself upon his side and slept again still certain of atlis folk rose at his bidding and they went together down to the southwestern rocks  but swanhild a cloak thrown over her nightgear sat herself in the high seat of the hall and fixing her eyes now upon the dying fires and now upon the bloodmarks in her arm waited in silence the night was cold and windy but the moon shone bright and by its light atli and his people made their way to the southwestern rocks on which the sea beat madly  what lies yonder said atli pointing to some black things that lay beneath them upon the rock cast there by the waves a man climbed down the cliffs side that is here as though it were cut in steps and then cried aloud  a ships mast new broken lord  it seems that swanhild dreams true muttered atli but i am sure of this that none have come ashore alive in such a sea  presently the man who searched the rocks below cried aloud again  here lie two great men locked in each others arms they seem to be dead  now all the men climb down the slippery rocks as best they may though the spray wets them and with them goes atli the earl is a brisk man though old in years and he comes first to where the two lie he who was undermost lay upon his back but his face is hid by the thick golden hair that flowed across it  mans body indeed but womans locks said atli as he put out his hand and drew the hair away so that the light of the moon fell on the face beneath  he looked then staggered back against the rock  by thor he cried here lies the corpse of eric brighteyes and atli wrung his hands and wept for he loved eric much  be not so sure that the men are dead earl said one i thought i saw yon great carle move but now  he is skallagrim lambstail erics deathshadow said atli again up with them ladssee yonder lies a plankand away to the hall i will give twenty in silver to each of you if eric lives and he unclasped his cloak and threw it over both of them  then with much labour they loosed the grip of the two men one from the other and they set skallagrim on the plank but eight men bore eric up the cliff between them and the task was not light though the earl held his head from which the golden hair hung like seaweed from a rock  at length they came to the hall and carried them in swanhild seeing them come moved down from the high seat  bring lamps and pile up the fires cried atli a strange thing has come to pass swanhild and thou dost dream wisely indeed for here we have eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail they were locked like lovers in each others arms but i know not if they are dead or living  now swanhild started and came on swiftly had the familiar tricked her and had she paid the price for nothing was eric taken from gudruda and given to her indeedbut given dead she bent over him gazing keenly on his face then she spoke  he is not dead but senseless bring dry clothes and make water hot and kneeling down she loosed erics helm and harness and ungirded whitefire from his side  for long swanhild and atli tended eric at one fire and the serving women tended skallagrim at the other presently there came a cry that skallagrim stirred and atli with others ran to see at this moment also the eyes of eric were unsealed and swanhild saw them looking at her dimly from beneath moved to it by her passion and her joy that he yet lived swanhild let her face fall till his was hidden in her unbound hair and kissed him upon the lips eric shut his eyes again sighing heavily and presently he was asleep they bore him to a bed and heaped warm wrappings upon him at daybreak he woke and atli who sat watching at his side gave him hot mead to drink  do i dream said eric or is it earl atli who tends me and did i but now see the face of swanhild bending over me  it is no dream eric but the truth thou hast been cast away here on my isle of straumey  and skallagrimwhere is skallagrim  skallagrim livesfear not  and my comrades how went it with them  but ill eric ran has them all now sleep  eric groaned aloud i had rather died also than live to hear such heavy tidings he said witchwork witchwork and that fair witchface wrought it and once again he slept nor did he wake till the sun was high but atli could make nothing of his words    when swanhild left the side of eric she met hall of lithdale face to face and his looks were troubled  say lady he asked will brighteyes live  grieve not hall she answered eric will surely live and he will be glad to find a messmate here to greet him having left so many yonder and she pointed to the sea  i shall not be glad said hall letting his eyes fall  why not hall fearest thou skallagrim or hast thou done ill by eric  ay lady i fear skallagrim for he swore to slay me and that kind of promise he ever keeps also if the truth must out i have not dealt altogether well with eric and of all men i least wish to talk with him  speak on she said  then being forced to it hall told her something of the tale of the cutting of the cable being careful to put another colour on it  now it seems that thou art a coward hall swanhild said when he had done and i scarcely looked for that in thee for she had not been deceived by the glozing of his speech it will be bad for thee to meet eric and skallagrim and this is my counsel that thou goest hence before they wake for they will sit this winter here in atlis hall  and whither shall i go lady  swanhild gazed on him and as she did so a dark thought came into her heart here was a knave who might serve her ends  hall she said thou art an icelander and i have known of thee from a child and therefore i wish to serve thee in thy strait though thou deservest it little see now atli the earl has a farm on the mainland not two hours ride from the sea thither thou shalt go if thou art wise and thou shalt sit there this winter and be hidden from eric and skallagrim nay thank me not but listen it may chance that i shall have a service for thee to do before spring is come  lady i shall wait upon thy word said hall  good now so soon as it is light i will find a man to sail with thee across the firth for the sea falls and bear my message to the steward at atlis farm also if thou needest faringmoney thou shalt have it farewell  thus then did hall fly before eric and skallagrim    on the morrow eric and skallagrim arose sick and bruised indeed but not at all harmed and went down to the shore there they found many dead men of their company but never a one in whom the breath of life remained  skallagrim looked at eric and spoke last night the mist came up against the wind last night we saw swanhilds wraith upon the waves and there is the path it showed and thereand he pointed to the dead menis the witchseeds flower now today we sit in atlis hall and here we must stay this winter at swanhilds side and in all this there lies a riddle that i cannot read  but eric shook his head making no answer then leaving skallagrim with the dead he turned and striding back alone towards the hall sat down on a rock in the home meadows and covering his face with his hands wept for his comrades  as he wept swanhild came to him for she had seen him from afar and touched him gently on the arm  why weepest thou eric she said  i weep for the dead swanhild he answered  weep not for the deadthey are at peace if thou must weep weep for the living nay weep not at all rejoice rather that thou art here to mourn hast thou no word of greeting for me who have not heard thy voice these many months  how shall i greet thee swanhild who would never have seen thy face again if i might have had my will knowest thou that yesternight as we laboured in yonder firth we saw a shape walking the waters to lead us to our doom how shall i greet thee swanhild who art a witch and evil  and knowest thou eric that yesternight i woke from sleep having dreamed that thou didst lie upon the shore and thus i saved thee alive as perchance i have saved thee aforetime if thou didst see a shape walking the waters it was that shape which led thee here hadst thou sailed on not only those thou mournest but skallagrim and thou thyself had now been numbered with the lost  better so than thus said brighteyes knowest thou also swanhild that when last night my life came back again in atlis hall methought that atlis wife leaned over me and kissed me on the lips that was an ill dream swanhild  some had found it none so ill eric she made answer looking on him strangely still it was but a dream thou didst dream that atlis wife breathed back the breath of life into thy pale lipsbe sure of it thou didst but dream ah eric fear me no more forget the evil that i have wrought in the blindness and folly of my youth now things are otherwise with me now i am a wedded wife and faithful hearted to my lord now if i still love thee it is with a sisters love therefore forget my sins remember only that as children we played upon the iceland fells remember that as boy and girl we rode along the marshes while the seamews clamoured round our heads the world is cold eric and few are the friends we find in it many are already gone and soon the friendless dark draws near so put me not away my brother and my friend but for a little space whilst thou art here in atlis hall let us walk hand in hand as we walked long years ago in iceland gathering up the fifabloom and watching the midnight shadows creep up the icy jökuls crest  thus swanhild spoke to him most sweetly in a low voice of music while the tears gathered in her eyes talking ever of iceland that he loved and of days long dead till erics heart softened in him  almost do i believe thee swanhild he said stretching out his hand but i know thus that thou art never twice in the same mood and that is beyond my measuring thou hast done much evil and thou hast striven to do more also i love not those who seem to walk the seas o nights still hold thou to this last saying of thine and there shall be peace between us while i bide here  she touched his hand humbly and turned to go but as she went eric spoke again say swanhild hast thou tidings from iceland yonder i have heard no word of asmund or of gudruda for two long years and more  she stood still and a dark shadow that he could not see flitted across her face  i have few tidings eric she said turning and those few if i may trust them bad enough for this is the rumour that i have heard that asmund the priest my father is dead that groa my mother is deadhow i know not and lastly that gudruda the fair thy love is betrothed to ospakar blacktooth and weds him in the spring  now eric sprang up with an oath and grasped the hilt of whitefire then he sat down again upon the stone and covered his face with his hands  grieve not eric she said gently i put no faith in this news for rumour like the blackbacked gull often changes colour in its flight across the seas also i had it but at fifth hand i am sure of this at least that gudruda will never forsake thee without a cause  it shall go ill with ospakar if this be true said eric smiling grimly for whitefire is yet left me and with it one true friend  run not to meet the evil eric thou shalt come to iceland with the summer flowers and find gudruda faithful and yet fairer than of yore knowest thou that hall of lithdale who was thy mate has sat here these two months he is gone but this morning i know not whither leaving a message that he returns no more  he did well to go said eric and he told her how hall had cut the cable  ay well indeed answered swanhild had atli known this he would have scourged hall hence with rods of seaweed and now eric i desire to ask thee one more thing why wearest thou thy hair long like a womans indeed few women have such hair as thine is now  for this cause swanhild i swore to gudruda that none should cut my hair till she cut it once more it is a great burden to me surely for never did hair grow so fast and strong as mine and once in a fray i was held fast by it and went near to the losing of my life still i will keep the oath even if it grows on to my feet and he laughed a little and shook back his golden locks  swanhild smiled also and turning went but when her face was hidden from him she smiled no more  as i live she said in her heart before spring rains fall i again will cause thee to break this oath eric ay i will cut a lock of that bright hair of thine and send it for a lovetoken to gudruda  but eric still sat upon the rock thinking swanhild had set an evil seed of doubt in his heart and already it put forth roots what if the tale were true what if gudruda had given herself to ospakar well if soshe should soon be a widow that he swore  then he rose and stalked grimly towards the hall     xix  how koll the halfwitted brought tidings from iceland  presently as eric walked he met atli the earl seeking him atli greeted him  i have seen strange things eric he said but none more strange than this coming of thine and the manner of it swanhild is foresighted and that was a doomdream of hers  i think her foresighted also said eric and now earl knowest thou this that little good can come to thee at the hands of one whom thou hast saved from the sea  i set no faith in such old wives tales answered atli here thou art come and it is my will that thou shouldest sit here at the least i will give thee no help to go hence  then we must bide in straumey it seems said eric for of all my goods and gear this alone is left me and he looked at whitefire  thou hast still a gold ring or two upon thy arm answered the earl laughing but surely eric thou wouldst not begone  i know not earl listen it is well that i should be plain with thee once before thou didst wed swanhild she had another mind  i have heard something of that and i have guessed more brighteyes but methinks swanhild is little given to gadding now she is as cold as ice and no good wife for any man and atli sighed snow melts not if sun shines not so runs the saw thou art an honest man eric and no whisperer in the ears of others wives  i am not minded indeed to do thee such harm earl but this thou knowest that womans guile and beauty are swords few shields can brook now i have spokenand they are hard words to speakbe it as thou wilt  it is my will that thou shouldest sit here this winter eric had i my way indeed never wouldest thou sit elsewhere listen things have not gone well with me of late age hath a grip of me and foes rise up against one who has no sons that was an ill marriage too which i made with swanhild yonder for she loves me not and i have found no luck since first i saw her face moreover it is in my mind that my days are almost sped swanhild has already foretold my death and as thou knowest well she is foresighted so i pray thee eric bide thou here while thou mayest for i would have thee at my side  it shall be as thou wilt earl said eric    so eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail sat that winter in the hall of atli the earl at straumey for many weeks all things went well and eric forgot his fears swanhild was gentle to him and kindly she loved much to talk with him even of gudruda her rival but no word of love passed her lips nevertheless she did but bide her time for when she struck she determined to strike home atli and eric were ever side by side and eric gave the earl much good counsel he promised to do this also for now being simpleminded his doubts had passed and he had no more fear of swanhild on the mainland lived a certain chief who had seized large lands of atlis and held them for a year or more now eric gave his word that before he sailed for iceland in the early summer he would go up against this man and drive him from the lands if he could for brighteyes might not come to iceland till hard upon midsummer when his three years of outlawry were spent  the winter wore away and the spring came then atli gathered his men and went with eric in boats to where the chief dwelt who held his lands there they fell on him and there was a fierce fight but in the end the man was slain by skallagrim and eric did great deeds as was his wont now in this fray eric was wounded in the foot by a spear so that he must be borne back to straumey and he lay there in the hall for many days swanhild nursed him and most days he sat talking with her in her bower  when eric was nearly healed of his hurt the earl went with all his people to a certain island of the orkneys to gather scat that was unpaid and skallagrim went with him but eric did not go because of his hurt fearing lest the wound should open if he walked overmuch thus it came to pass that except for some women he was left almost alone with swanhild   tribute  now when atli had been gone three days it chanced on an afternoon that swanhild heard how a man from iceland sought speech with her she bade them bring him in to where she was alone in her bower for eric was not there having gone down to the sea to fish  the man came and she knew him at once for koll the halfwitted who had been her mother groas thrall on his shoulders was the cloak that ospakar blacktooth had given him it was much torn now and he had a worn and hungry look  whence comest thou koll she asked and what are thy tidings  from scotland last lady where i sat this winter before that from iceland as for my tidings they are heavy if thou hast not heard them asmund the priest is dead and dead is unna his wife poisoned by thy mother groa at their marriagefeast dead too is thy mother groa björn asmunds son shot her with an arrow and she lies in goldfoss pool  now swanhild hid her face for a while in her hands then she lifted it and it was white to see speakest thou truth fox if thou liest this i swear to theethy tongue shall be dragged from thee by the roots  i speak the truth lady he answered but still he spoke not all the truth for he said nothing of the part which he had played in the deaths of asmund and unna then he told her of the manner of their end  swanhild listened silentlythen said  what news of gudruda asmunds daughter is she wed  nay lady folk spoke of her and ospakar that was all  hearken koll said swanhild bearing such heavy tidings canst thou not weight the ship a little more eric brighteyes is here canst thou not swear to him that when thou didst leave iceland it was said without question that gudruda had betrothed herself to ospakar and that the weddingfeast was set for this last yule thou hast a hungry look koll and methinks that things have not gone altogether well with thee of late now if thou canst so charge thy memory thou shalt lose little by it but if thou canst not then thou goest hence from straumey with never a luckpenny in thy purse and never a sup to stay thy stomach with  now of all things koll least desired to be sent from straumey for though swanhild did not know it he was sought for on the mainland as a thief  that i may do lady he said looking at her cunningly now i remember that gudruda the fair charged me with a certain message for eric brighteyes if i should chance to see him as i journeyed  then swanhild atlis wife and koll the halfwitted talked long and earnestly together    at nightfall eric came in from his fishing his heart was light for the time drew near when he should sail for home and he did not think on evil for now he feared swanhild no longer and no fresh tidings having come from iceland about ospakar and gudruda he had almost put the matter from his mind on he walked to the hall limping somewhat from his wound but singing as he came and bearing his fish slung upon a pole  at the mens door of the hall a woman stood waiting she told eric that the lady swanhild would speak with him in her bower thither he went and knocked getting no answer he knocked again then entered  swanhild sat on a couch she was weeping and her hair fell about her face  what now swanhild he said  she looked up heavily ill news for thee and me eric koll who was my mothers thrall has come hither from iceland and these are his tidings that asmund is dead and unna thy cousin thorod of greenfells daughter is dead and my mother groa is dead also  heavy tidings truly said eric and what of gudruda is she also dead  nay eric she is wedwed to ospakar  now eric reeled against the wall clutching it and for a space all things swam round him where is this koll he gasped send me koll hither  presently he came and eric questioned him coldly and calmly but koll could lie full well it is said that in his day there was no one in iceland who could lie so well as koll the halfwitted he told eric how it was said that gudruda was plighted to ospakar and how the match had been agreed on at the althing in the summer that was gone and indeed there had been some such talk and how that the feast was to be at middalhof on last yule day  is that all thy tidings said eric if so i give no heed to them for ever koll i have known thee for a liar  nay eric it is not all answered koll as it chanced two days before the ship in which i sailed was bound i saw gudruda the fair then she asked me whither i was going and i told her that i would journey to london where men said thou wert and asked her if she would send a message then she alighted from her horse blackmane and spoke with me apart koll she said it well may happen that thou wilt see eric brighteyes in london town now if thou seest him i charge thee straightly tell him this tell him that my father is dead and my brother björn who rules in his place is a hard man and has ever urged me on to wed ospakar till at last having no choice i have consented to it and say to eric that i grieve much and sorely and that though we twain should never meet more yet i shall always hold his memory dear  it is not like gudruda to speak thus said eric she had ever a stout heart and these are craven words koll i hold that thou liest and if indeed i find it so ill wring the head from off thee  nay eric i lie not wherefore should i lie hearken thou hast not heard all my tale when the lady gudruda had made an end of speaking she drew something from her breast and gave it me saying give this to eric in witness of my words  show me the token said eric  now many years ago when they were yet boy and girl it chanced that eric had given to gudruda the half of an ancient gold piece that he had found upon the shore he had given her half and half he had kept wearing it next his heart but he knew not this for she feared to tell him that gudruda had lost her half nor indeed had she lost it for swanhild had taken the lovetoken and hidden it away now she brought it forth for koll to build his lies upon  then koll drew out the halfpiece from a leather purse and passed it to him eric plunged his hand into his breast and found his half he placed the two side by side while swanhild watched him lo they fitted well  then eric laughed aloud a hard and bitter laugh there will be slaying he cried before all this tale is told take thy fee and begone thou messenger of ill and he cast the broken piece at koll for once thou hast spoken the truth  koll stooped found the gold and went leaving brighteyes and swanhild face to face  he hid his brow in his arms and groaned aloud softly swanhild crept up to himsoftly she drew his hands away holding them between her own  heavy tidings eric she said heavy tidings for thee and me she is a murderess who gave me birth and she has slain my own fathermy father and thy cousin unna also gudruda is a traitress a traitress fair and false i did ill to be born of such a woman thou didst ill to put thy faith in such a woman together let us weep for our woe is equal  ay let us weep together eric answered nay why should we weep together let us be merry for we know the worst all words are saidall hopes are sped let us be merry then for now we have no more tidings to fear  ay swanhild answered looking on him darkly we will be merry and laugh our sorrows down ah thou foolish eric under what unlucky star wast thou born that thou knewest not true from false and she called the servingwomen bidding them bring food and wine  now eric sat alone with swanhild in her bower and made pretence to eat but he could eat little though he drank deep of the southern wine close beside him sat swanhild filling his cup she was wondrous fair that night and it seemed to eric that her eyes gleamed like stars sweetly she spoke also and wisely she told strange tales and she sang strange songs and ever her eyes shone more and more and ever she crept closer to him erics brain was afire though his heart was cold and dead he laughed loud and mightily he told great tales of deeds that he had done growing boastful in his folly and still swanhilds eyes shone more and more and still she crept closer wooing him in many ways  now of a sudden eric thought of his friend earl atli and his mind grew clear  this may not be swanhild he said yet i would that i had loved thee from the first and not the false gudruda for with all thy dark ways at least thou art better than she  thou speakest wisely eric swanhild answered though she meant not that he should go the norns have appointed us an evil fate giving me as wife to an old man whom i do not love and thee for a lover to a woman who has betrayed thee ah eric brighteyes thou foolish eric why knewest thou not the false from the true while yet there was time now are all words said and all things donenor can they be undone go hence eric ere ill come of it but before thou goest drink one cup of parting and then farewell  and she slipped from him and filled the cup mixing in it a certain loveportion that she had made ready  give it me that i may swear an oath on it said eric  swanhild gave him the cup and stood before him watching him  hearken he said i swear this that before snow falls again in iceland i will see ospakar dead at my feet or lie dead at the feet of ospakar  well spoken eric swanhild answered now before thou drinkest grant me one little boon it is but a womans fancy and thou canst scarce deny me the years will be long when thou art gone for from this night it is best that we should meet no more and i would keep something of thee to call back thy memory and the memories of our youth when thou hast passed away and i grow old  what wouldst have then swanhild i have nothing left to give except whitefire alone  i do not ask whitefire eric though whitefire shall kiss the gift i ask nothing but one tress of that golden hair of thine  once i swore that none should touch my hair again except gudrudas self  it will grow long then eric for now gudruda tends black locks and thinks little on golden broken are all oaths  eric groaned all oaths are broken in sooth he said have then thy will and loosing the peacestrings he drew whitefire from its sheath and gave her the great warsword  swanhild took it by the hilt and lifting a tress of erics yellow hair she shore through it deftly with whitefires razoredge smiling as she shore with the same warblade on which eric and gudruda had pledged their troth did swanhild cut the locks that eric had sworn no hand should clip except gudrudas  he took back the sword and sheathed it and knotting the long tress swanhild hid it in her bosom  now drink the cup eric she saidpledge me and go  eric drank to the dregs and cast the cup down and lo all things changed to him for his blood was afire and seas seemed to roll within his brain only before him stood swanhild like a shape of light and glory and he thought that she sang softly over him always drawing nearer and that with her came a scent of flowers like the scent of the iceland meads in may  all oaths are broken eric she murmured all oaths are broken indeed and now must new oaths be sworn for cut is thy golden hair brighteyes and not by gudrudas hand     xx  how eric was named anew  eric dreamed he dreamed that gudruda stood by him looking at him with soft sad eyes while with her hand she pointed to his hair and spake  thou hast done ill eric she seemed to say thou hast done ill to doubt me and now thou art for ever shamed for thou hast betrayed atli thy friend thou hast broken thy oath and therefore hast thou fallen into this pit for when swanhild shore that lock of thine my watching spirit passed leaving thee to swanhild and thy fate now i tell thee this that shame shall lead to shame and many lives shall pay forfeit for thy sin eric  eric awoke thinking that this was indeed an evil dream which he had dreamed he woke and lo by him was swanhild atlis wife he looked upon her beauty and fear and shame crept into his heart for now he knew that it was no dream but he was lost indeed he looked again at swanhild and hatred and loathing of her shook him she had overcome him by her arts that cup was drugged which he had drunk and he was mad with grief yes she had played upon his woe like a harper on a harp and now he was ashamednow he had betrayed his friend who loved him had whitefire been to his hand at that moment eric had surely slain himself but the great sword was not there for it hung in swanhilds bower eric groaned aloud and swanhild turned at the sound but he sprang away and stood over her cursing her  thou witch he cried what hast thou done what didst thou mix in that cup yestreen thou hast brought me to this that i have betrayed atli my friendatli thy lord who left thee in my keeping  he seemed so terrible in his woe and rage that swanhild shrank from him and throwing her hair about her face peeped at him through its meshes as once she had peeped at asmund  it is like a man she said gathering up her courage and her wit tis like a man having won my love now to turn upon me and upbraid me fie upon thee eric thou hast dealt ill with me to bring me to this  now eric ceased his raving and spoke more calmly  well thou knowest the truth swanhild he said  hearken eric she answered let this be secret between us atli is old and methinks that not for long shall he bide here in straumey soon he will die it is upon my mind that he soon will die and being childless his lands and goods pass to me then eric thou shalt sit in atlis hall and in all honour shall atlis wife become thy bride  eric listened coldly i can well believe he said that thou hast it in mind to slay thy lord for all evil is in thy heart swanhild now know this that if in honour or dishonour my lips touch that fair face of thine again may the limbs rot from thy trunk and may i lie a log for ever in the halls of hela if ever my eyes of their own will look again upon thy beauty may i go blind and beg my meat from homestead to homestead if ever my tongue whisper word of love into thy ears may dumbness seize it and may it wither to the root  swanhild heard and sank upon the ground before him her head bowed almost to her feet  now swanhild fare thee well said eric living or dead may i never see thy face again  she gazed up through her falling hair her face was wild and white and her eyes glowed in it as live embers glow in the ashes of burnt wood  we are not so easily parted eric she said not for this came i to witchcraft and to sin thou fool hast thou never heard that of all the foes a man may have none is so terrible as the woman he has scorned thou shalt learn this lesson eric brighteyes thorgrimurs son for here we have but the beginning of the tale for its end i will write it in runes of blood  write on said eric thou canst do no worse than thou hast done and he passed thence  for a while swanhild crouched upon the ground brooding in silence then she rose and throwing up her arms wept aloud  is it for this that i have sold my soul to the hellhag she cried is it for this that i have become a witch and sunk so low as i sank last nightto be scorned to be hated to be betrayed now eric will go to atli and tell this tale nay there i will be beforehand with him and with another storyan ancient wile of women truly but one that never yet has failed them nor ever will and then for vengeance i will see thee dead eric and dead will i see gudruda at thy side afterwards let darkness comeay though the horror rides it swifti must be swift    eric passed into swanhilds bower and finding whitefire bore it thence on the table was food he took it then going to the place where he was wont to sleep he armed himself girding his byrnie on his breast and his golden helm upon his head and taking shield and spear in his hand then he passed out by the mens door he found some women spreading fish in the sun eric greeted them saying that when the earl came back for he was to come on that morning he would find him on the southwestern rocks nigh to where the gudruda sank this he begged of them to tell atli for he desired speech with him  the women wondered that brighteyes should go forth thus and fully armed but holding that he had some deed to do they said nothing  eric came to the rocks and there he sat all day long looking on the sea and grieving so bitterly that he thought his heart would burst within him for of all the days of erics life this was the heaviest except one other only  but swanhild going to her bower caused koll the halfwitted to be summoned to him she spoke long and earnestly and they made a shameful plot together then she bade koll watch for atlis coming and when he saw the earl leave his boats to run to him and say that she would speak with him  after this swanhild sent a man across the firth to the stead where hall of lithdale sat bidding him to come to her at speed  when the afternoon grew towards the evening koll watching saw the boats of atli draw to the landingplace then he went down and going to the earl bowed before him  what wouldst thou fellow and who art thou asked atli  i am a man from iceland perchance lord thou sawest me in asmunds hall at middalhof i am sent here by the lady swanhild to say that she desires speech with thee and that at once then seeing skallagrim koll fled back to the house for he feared skallagrim  now atli was uneasy in his mind and saying nothing he hurried up to the hall and through it into swanhilds bower  there she sat on a couch her eyes red with weeping and her curling hair unbound  what now swanhild he asked why lookest thou thus  why look i thus my lord she answered heavily because i have to tell thee that which i cannot find words to fit and she ceased  speak on he said is aught wrong with eric  then swanhild drew near and told him a false tale  when it was done for a moment or so atli stood still and grew white beneath his ruddy skin white as his beard then he staggered back against the wainscoting of the bower  woman thou liest he said never will i believe so vile a thing of eric brighteyes whom i have loved  would that i could not believe it she answered would that i could think it was but an evil dream but alas nay i will prove it suffer that i summon koll the icelander who was my mothers thrallgroa who now is dead for i have that tidings also he saw something of this thing and he will bear me witness  call the man said atli sternly  so koll was summoned and told his lies with a bold face he was so well taught and so closely did his story tally with that of swanhild that atli could find no flaw in it  now i am sure swanhild that thou speakest truth said the earl when koll had gone and now also i have somewhat to say to this eric for thee rest thyself that which cannot be mended must be borne and he went out    now when skallagrim came to the house he asked for eric the women told him that brighteyes had gone down to the sea fully armed in the morning and had not returned  then there must be fighting toward and that i am loth to miss said skallagrim and axe aloft he started for the southwestern rocks at a run skallagrim came to the rocks there he found eric sitting in his harness looking out across the sea the evening was wet and windy the rain beat upon him as he sat but eric took no heed  what seekest thou lord asked the baresark  rest said eric and i find none  thou seekest rest helm on head and sword in hand this is a strange thing truly  stranger things have been skallagrim wouldst thou hear a tale and he told him all  what said i asked skallagrim we had fared better in london town flying from the dove thou hast found the falcon  i have found the falcon comrade and she has pecked out my eyes now i would speak with atli and then i go hence  hence go the twain of us lord the earl will be here presently and rough words will fly in this rough weather is whitefire sharp brighteyes  whitefire was sharp enough to shear my hair skallagrim but if atli would strike let him lay on whitefire will not be aloft for him  that we shall see said skallagrim at least if thou art harmed because of this loose quean my axe will be aloft  keep thou thine axe in its place said eric and as he spoke atli came and with him many men  eric rose and turned to meet the earl looking on him with sad eyes for atli his face was as the face of a trapped wolf for he was mad with rage at the shame that had been put upon him and the ill tale that swanhild had told of erics dealings with her  it seems that the earl has heard of these tidings said skallagrim  then i shall be spared the telling of them answered eric  now they stood face to face atli leaned upon his drawn sword and his wrath was so fierce that for a while he could not speak at length he found words  see ye that man comrades he said pointing at eric with the sword he has been my guest these many months he has sat in my hall and eaten of my bread and i have loved him as a son and wot ye how he has repaid me he has put me to the greatest shame me and my wife the lady swanhild whom i left in his guardto such shame indeed that i cannot speak it  true words earl said eric while folk murmured and handled their swords  true but not all the truth growled skallagrim methinks the earl has heard a garbled tale  true words thyself thou sayest it went on atli thou hound that i saved from the sea rans gift helas gift so runs the saw and now from ran to hela thou shalt go thou mishandler of defenceless women  here is somewhat of which i know nothing said eric  and here is something of which thou shalt know answered atli and he shook his sword before erics eyes guard thyself  nay earl thou art old and i have done the wrongi may not fight with thee  art thou a coward also said the earl  some have deemed otherwise said eric but it is true that heavy heart makes weak hand nevertheless this is my rede with thee are ten men stand thou aside and let them fall on me till i am slain  the odds are too heavy even for thee said skallagrim back to back lord as we have stood aforetime and let us play this game together  not so cried atli this shame is mine and i have sworn to swanhild that i will wipe it out in erics blood stand thou before me and draw  then eric drew whitefire and raised his shield atli the earl rushed at him and smote a great twohanded blow eric caught it on his shield and suffered no harm but he would not smite back  atli dropped his point niddering art thou and coward to the last he cried see men eric brighteyes fears to fight i am not come to this that i will cut down a man who is too fainthearted to give blow for blow this is my word take ye your spearshafts and push this coward to the shore then put him in a boat and drive him hence  now eric grew red as the red light of sunset for his manhood might not bear this  take shield he said and earl on thine own head be thy blood for none shall live to call eric niddering and coward  atli laughed in his folly and his rage he took a shield and once more springing on brighteyes struck a great blow  eric parried then whirled whitefire on high and smoteonce and once only down rushed the bright blade like a star through the night sword and shield did atli lift to catch the blow through shield it sheared and arm that held the shield through byrnie mail and deep into earl atlis side he fell prone to earth while men held their breath wondering at the greatness of that stroke  but eric leaned on whitefire and looked at the old earl upon the rock  now atli thou hast had thy way he said and methinks things are worse than they were before but i will say this would that i lay there and thou stoodest to watch me die for as lief would i have slain my father as thee earl atli there lies swanhilds work  atli gazed upwards into erics sad eyes and while he gazed so his rage left him and of a sudden a light brake upon his mind as even then the light of the setting sun brake through the driving mist  eric he said draw near and speak with me ere i am sped methinks that i have been beguiled and that thou didst not do this thing that swanhild said and koll bore witness to  what did swanhild say then earl atli  the earl told him  it was to be looked for from her said eric though i never thought of it now hearken and he told him all  atli groaned aloud i know this now eric he said that thou speakest truth and once more i have been deceived eric i forgive thee all for no man may fight against womans witchcraft and witchs wine swanhild is evil to the heart yet eric i lay this doom upon theei do not lay it of my own will for i would not harm thee whom i love but because of the words that the norns put in my mouth for now i am fey in this the hour of my death thou hast sinned and that thou didst sin against thy will shall avail thee nothing for of thy sin fate shall fashion a handle to the spear which pierces thee henceforth thou art accursed for i tell thee that this wicked woman swanhild shall drag thee down to death and worse than death and with thee those thou lovest by witchcraft she brought thee to straumey by lies she laid me here before thee now by hate and might and cruel deeds shall she bring thee to lie more low than i do for eric thou art bound to her and thou shalt never loose the bond  atli ceased a while then spoke again more faintly  hearken comrades he cried my strength is wellnigh spent ye shall swear four things to methat ye will give eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail safe passage from straumey that ye will tell swanhild the fatherless groas daughter and atlis wife that at last i know her for what she isa murderess a harlot a witch and a liar and that i forgive eric whom she tricked but that her i hate and spit upon that ye will slay koll the halfwitted groas thrall who came hither about two days gone since by his lies he hath set an edge upon this sword of falsehood that ye will raise no bloodfeud against eric for this my slaying for i goaded him to the deed do ye swear  we swear said the men  then farewell and to thee farewell also eric brighteyes now take my hand and hold it while i die behold i give thee a new name and by that name thou shalt be called in story i name thee eric the unlucky of all tales that are told thine shall be the greatest a mighty stroke that was of thinea mighty stroke farewell  then his head fell back upon the rock and earl atli died and as he died the last rays of light went out of the sky     xxi  how hall of lithdale took tidings to iceland  now on the same night that atli died at the hand of eric swanhild spake with hall of lithdale whom she had summoned from the mainland she bade him do this take passage in a certain ship that should sail for iceland on the morrow from the island that is called westra and there tell all these tidings of the illdoings of eric and of the slaying of atli by his hand  thou shalt say this she went on that eric had been my love for long but that at length the matter came to the ears of atli the earl then holding this the greatest shame he went on holmgang with eric and was slain by him this shalt thou add to thy tale also that presently eric and i will wed and that eric shall rule as earl in orkneys now these tidings must soon come to the ears of gudruda the fair and she will send for thee and question thee straightly concerning them and thou shalt tell her the tale as thou toldest it at first then thou shalt give gudruda this packet which i send her as a gift saying that i bade her remember a certain oath which eric took as to the cutting of his hair and when she sees that which is within the packet is somewhat stained tell her that is but the blood of atli that is upon it as his blood is upon erics hands now remember thou this hall that if thou fail in the errand thy life shall pay forfeit for presently i will also come to iceland and hear how thou hast sped  then swanhild gave him faringmoney and gifts of wadmal and gold rings promising that he should have so much again when she came to iceland  hall said that he would do all these things and went at once nor did he fail in his tasks    atli being dead eric loosed his hand and called to the men to take up his body and bear it to the hall this they did eric stood and watched them till they were lost in the darkness  whither now lord said skallagrim  it matters little said eric what is thy counsel  this is my counsel that we take ship and sail back to the king in london there we will tell all this tale it is a far cry from straumey to london town and there we shall sit in peace for the king will think little of the slaying of an orkney earl in a brawl about a woman mayhap too the lady elfrida will not set great store by it therefore i say let us fare back to london  in but one place am i at home and that is iceland said eric thither i will go skallagrim though it be but to miss friend from stead and bride from bed at the least i shall find ospakar there  listen lord said skallagrim was it not my rede that we should bide this winter through in london thou wouldst none of it and what came about our ship is sunk gone are our comrades thine honour is tarnished and dead is thy host at thine own hand yet i say all is not lost let us hence south and see no more of swanhild of gudruda of björn and ospakar so shall we break the spell but if thou goest to iceland i am sure of this that the evil fate which atli foretold will fall on thee and the days to come shall be even more unlucky than the days that have been  it may be so said eric methinks indeed it will be so henceforth i am eric the unlucky i will go back to iceland and there play out the game i care little if i live or am slaini have no more joy in my life i stand alone like a fir upon a mountaintop and every wind from heaven and every storm of hail and snow beats upon my head but i say to thee skallagrim go thy road and leave a luckless man to his ill fate otherwise it shall be thine also good friend hast thou been to me now let us part and wend south and north the king will be glad to greet thee yonder in london lambstail  but one severing shall we know lord said skallagrim and that shall be swords work nor will it be for long it is ill to speak such words as these of the parting of lord and thrall bethink thee of the oath i swore on mosfell let us go north since it is thy will in fifty years it will count for little which way we wended from the isles  so they went together down to the shore and finding a boat and men who as yet knew nothing of what had chanced to atli they sailed across the firth at the rising of the moon  two days afterwards they found a ship at wick that was bound for fareys and sailed in her eric buying a passage with the half of a gold ring that the king had given him in london  here at fareys they sat a month or more but not in the earls hall as when eric came with honour in the gudruda but in a farmers stead for the tale of erics dealings with atli and atlis wife had reached fareys and the earl there had been a friend of atlis moreover eric was now a poor man having neither ship nor goods nor friends therefore all looked coldly on him though they wondered at his beauty and his might still they dared not to speak ill or make a mock of him for two men having done so were nearly slain of skallagrim who seized the twain by the throat one in either hand and dashed their heads together after that men said little  they sat there a month till at length a chapman put in at fareys bound for iceland and they took passage with him eric paying the other half of his gold ring for shiproom the chapman was not willing to give them place at first for he too had heard the tale but skallagrim offered him choice either to do so or to go on holmgang with him then the chapman gave them passage    now it is told that when his thralls and housecarles bore the corpse of atli the earl to his hall in straumey swanhild met it and wept over it and when the spokesman among them stood forward and told her those words that atli had bidden them to say to her sparing none she spoke thus  my lord was distraught and weak with loss of blood when he spoke thus the tale i told him was true and now eric has added to his sin by shedding the blood of him whom he wronged so sorely  and thereafter she spoke so sweetly and with so much gentleness craft and wisdom that though they still doubted them all men held her words weighty for swanhild had this art that she could make the false sound true in the ears of men and the true sound false  still being mindful of their oath they hunted for koll and found him and when the thrall knew that they would slay him he ran thence screaming nor did swanhild lift a hand to save his life for she desired that koll should die lest he should bear witness against her away he ran towards the cliffs and after him sped atlis housecarles till he came to the great cliffs that edge in the sea now they were close upon him and their swords were aloft then sooner than know the kiss of steel the liar leapt from the cliffs and was crushed dying miserably on the rocks below this was the end of koll the halfwitted groas thrall  swanhild sat in straumey for a while and took all atlis heritage into her keeping for he had no male kin nor did any say her nay also she called in the moneys that he had out at interest and that was a great sum for atli was a careful and a wealthy man then swanhild made ready to go to iceland atli had a great dragon of war and she manned that ship and filled it with stores and all things needful this done she set stewards and grieves over the orkney lands and farms and when the earl was six weeks dead she sailed for iceland giving out that she went thither to set a bloodsuit on foot against eric for the death of atli her lord there she came in safety just as folk rode to the thing    now hall of lithdale came to iceland and told his tale of the doings of eric and the death of atli oft and loud he told it and soon people gossiped of it in field and fair and stead björn asmunds son heard this talk and sent for hall to him also hall told the tale  now said björn we will go to my sister gudruda the fair and learn how she takes these tidings  so they went in to where gudruda sat spinning in the hall singing as she span  greeting gudruda said björn say hast thou tidings of eric brighteyes thy betrothed  i have no tidings said gudruda  then here is one who brings them  now for the first time gudruda the fair saw hall of lithdale up she sprang thou hast tidings of eric hall ah thou art welcome for no tidings have come of him for many a month speak on and she pressed her hand against her heart and leaned towards him  my tidings are ill lady  is eric dead say not that my love is dead  he is worse than dead said hall he is shamed  there thou liest hall she answered shame and eric are things apart  mayst thou think so when thou hast heard my tale lady said hall for i am sad at heart to speak it of one who was my mate  speak on i say answered gudruda in such a voice that hall shrank from her speak on but of this i warn thee that if in one word thou liest that shall be thy death when eric comes  now hall was afraid thinking of the axe of skallagrim still he might not go back upon his word so he began at the beginning telling the story of how he was wounded in the fight with ospakars ships and left farey isles and how he came thence to scotland and sat in atlis hall on orkneys then he told how the gudruda was wrecked on straumey and of all aboard eric and skallagrim alone were saved because of swanhilds dream  herein i see witchwork said gudruda  then hall told that eric became swanhilds love but of the other tale which swanhild had whispered to atli he said nothing for he knew that gudruda would not believe this and moreover if it were so swanhild had not sent the token which he should give  it may well be said gudruda proudly swanhild is fair and light of mind perchance she led brighteyes into this snare but though she spoke thus bitter jealousy and anger burned in her breast and she remembered the sight which she had seen when eric and swanhild met on the morn of atlis wedding  then hall told of the slaying of atli the good by eric but he said nothing of the earls dying words nor of how he goaded brighteyes with his bitter words  it was an ill deed in sooth said gudruda for eric to slay an old man whom he had wronged still it may chance that he was driven to it for his own lifes sake  then hall said that he had seen swanhild after atlis slaying and that she had told him that she and eric should wed shortly and that eric would rule in orkneys by her side  gudruda asked if that was all his tale  yes lady answered hall that is all my tale for after that i sailed and know not what happened but i am charged to give something to thee and that by the lady swanhild she bade me say this also that when thou lookest on the gift thou shouldst think on a certain oath which eric took as to the cutting of his hair and he drew a linen packet from his breast and gave it to her  thrice gudruda looked on it fearing to open it then seeing the smile of mockery on björns cold face she took the shears that hung at her side and cut the thread with them and as she cut a lock of golden hair rose from the packet untwisting itself like a living snake the lock was long and its end was caked with gore  whose hair is this said gudruda though she knew the hair well  erics hair said hall that swanhild cut from his head with erics sword  now gudruda put her hand to her bosom she drew out a satchel and from the satchel a lock of yellow hair side by side she placed the locks looking first at one and then at the other  this is erics hair in sooth she saiderics hair that he swore none but i should cut erics hair that swanhild shore with whitefire from erics headwhitefire whereon we plighted troth say now whose blood is this that stains the hair of eric  it is atlis blood whom eric first dishonoured and then slew with his own hand answered hall  now there burned a fire on the hearth for the day was cold gudruda the fair stood over the fire and with either hand she let the two locks of erics hair fall upon the embers slowly they twisted up and burned she watched them burn then she threw up her hands and with a great cry fled from the hall  björn and hall of lithdale looked on each other  thou hadst best go hence said björn and of this i warn thee hall though i hold thy tidings good that if thou hast spoken one false word that will be thy death for then it would be better for thee to face all the wolves in iceland than to stand before eric in his rage  again hall bethought himself of the axe of skallagrim and he went out heavily    that day a messenger came from gudruda to björn saying that she would speak with him he went to where she sat alone upon her bed her face was white as death and her dark eyes glowed  eric has dealt badly with thee sister to bring thee to this sorrow said björn  speak no evil of eric to me gudruda answered the evil that he has done will be paid back to him there is little need for thee to heap words upon his head hearken björn my brother is it yet thy will that i should wed ospakar blacktooth  that is my will surely there is no match in iceland as this ospakar and i should win many friends by it  do this then björn send messengers to swinefell and say to ospakar that if he would still wed gudruda the fair asmunds daughter let him come to middalhof when folk ride from the thing and he shall not go hence alone nay i have done now i pray thee speak no more to me of eric or of ospakar of the one i have seen and heard enough and of the other i shall hear and see enough in the years that are to come     xxii  how eric came home again  swanhild made a good passage from the orkneys and was in iceland thirtyfive days before eric and skallagrim set foot there but she did not land by westman isles for she had no wish to face gudruda at that time but by reyjaness now she rode thence with her company to thingvalla for here all men were gathered for the thing at first people hung aloof from her notwithstanding her wealth and beauty but swanhild knew well how to win the hearts of men for now she told the same story of eric that she had told to atli and there were none to say her nay so it came to pass that she was believed and eric brighteyes held to be shamed indeed now too she set a suit on foot against eric for the death of atli at his hand claiming that sentence of the greater outlawry should be passed against him and that his lands at coldback in the marsh on ran river should be given half to her in atonement for the earls death and half to the men of erics quarter  on the day of the opening of the thing ospakar blacktooth came from the north and with him his son gizur and a great company of men ospakar was blithe for from the thing he should ride to middalhof there to wed gudruda the fair then swanhild clad herself in beautiful attire and taking men with her went to the booth of ospakar  blacktooth sat in his booth and by him sat gizur his son the lawman when he saw a beauteous lady very richly clad enter the booth he did not know who it might be but gizur knew her well for he could never put swanhild from his mind  lo here comes swanhild the fatherless atlis widow said gizur flushing red with joy at the sight of her  then ospakar greeted her heartily and made place for her by him at the top of the booth  ospakar blacktooth she said i am come to ask this of thee that thou shalt befriend me in the suit which i have against eric brighteyes for the slaying of earl atli my husband  thou couldst have come to no man who is more willing said ospakar for if thou hast something against eric i have yet more  i would ask this too ospakar that thy son gizur should take up my suit and plead it for i know well that he is the most skilful of all lawmen  i will do that said gizur his eyes yet fixed upon her face  i looked for no less from thee said swanhild and be sure of this that thou shalt not plead for nothing and she glanced at him meaningly then she set out her case with a lying tongue and afterwards went back to her booth glad at heart for now she learned that hall had not failed in his errand seeing that gudruda was about to wed ospakar  gizur gave warning of the bloodsuit and the end of it was that though he had no notice and was not there to answer to the charge against all right and custom eric was declared outlaw and his lands were given half to swanhild and half to the men of his quarter for now all held that swanhilds was a true tale and eric the most shameful of men and therefore they were willing to stretch the law against him also being absent he had few friends and those men of small account whereas ospakar who backed swanhilds suit was the most powerful of the northern chiefs as gizur was the most skilled lawman in iceland moreover björn the priest asmunds son was among the judges and though swanhilds tale seemed strange to him after that which he had heard from hall of lithdale he loved eric little he feared also that if eric came a free man to iceland before gudruda was wed to ospakar her love would conquer her anger for he could see well that she still loved brighteyes therefore he strove with might and main that eric should be brought in guilty nor did he fail in this  so the end of it was that eric brighteyes was outlawed his lands declared forfeit and his head a wolfs head to be taken by him who might should he set foot in iceland  thereafter the althing being ended björn gizur and ospakar with all their company rode away to middalhof to sit at the marriagefeast but swanhild and her folk went by sea in the long warship to westmans for this was her plan to seize on coldback and to sit there for a while till she saw if eric came out to iceland also she desired to see the wedding of ospakar and gudruda for she had been bidden to it by björn her halfbrother  now ospakar came to middalhof and found gudruda waiting his coming  she stood in the great hall pale and cold as april snow and greeted him courteously but when he would have kissed her she shrank from him for now he was more hideous in her sight than he had ever been and she loathed him in her heart  that night there was feasting in the hall and at the feast gudruda heard that eric had been made outlaw then she spoke  this is an ill deed thus to judge an absent man  say gudruda said björn in her ear hast thou not also judged eric who is absent  she turned her head and spoke no more of eric but björns words fixed themselves in her heart like arrows the tale was strange to her for it seemed that eric had been made outlaw at swanhilds suit and yet eric was swanhilds love for swanhilds self had sent the lock of brighteyes hair by hall saying that he was her love and soon would wed her how then did swanhild bring a suit against him who should be her husband moreover she heard that swanhild sailed down to coldback and was bidden to the marriagefeast that should be on the third day from now could it be then when all was said and done that eric was less faithless than she deemed gudrudas heart stood still and the blood rushed to her brow when she thought on it also even if it were so it was now too late and surely it was not so for had not eric been made outlaw men were not made outlaw for a little thing nay she would meet her fate and ask no more of eric and his doings  on the morrow as gudruda sat in her chamber it was told her that saevuna thorgrimurs widow and erics mother had come from coldback to speak with her for after the death of asmund and of unna saevuna had moved back to coldback on the marsh  nay how can this be said gudruda astonished for she knew well that saevuna was now both blind and bedridden  she has been borne here in a chair said the woman who told her and that is a strange sight to see  at first gudruda was minded to say her nay but her heart softened and she bade them bring saevuna in presently she came being set in a chair upon the shoulders of four men she was white to see for sickness had aged her much and she stared about her with sightless eyes but she was still tall and straight and her face was stern to look on to gudruda it seemed like that of eric when he was angered  am i nigh to gudruda the fair asmunds daughter asked saevuna methinks i hear her breathe  i am here mother said gudruda what is thy will with me  set down carles and begone quoth saevuna that which i have to say i would say alone when i summon you come  the carles set down the chair upon the floor and went  gudruda said the dame i am risen from my deathbed and i have caused myself to be borne on my last journey here across the meads that i may speak with thee and warn thee i hear that thou hast put away my son eric brighteyes to whom thou art sworn in marriage and art about to give thyself to ospakar blacktooth i hear also that thou hast done this deed because a certain man hall of lithdalewhom from his youth up i have known for a liar and a knave and whom thou thyself didst mistrust in years gone byhas come hither to iceland from orkneys bearing a tale of erics dealings with thy halfsister swanhild this i hear further that swanhild atlis widow hath come out to iceland and laid a suit against eric for the slaying of atli the earl her husband and that eric has been outlawed and his lands at coldback are forfeit tell me now gudruda asmunds daughter if these tales be true  the tales are true mother said gudruda  then hearken to me girl eric sprang from my womb who of all living men is the best and first as he is the bravest and most strong i have reared this eric from a babe and i know his heart well now i tell thee this that whatever eric has done or left undone naught of dishonour is on his hands mayhap swanhild has deceived himthou art a woman and thou knowest well the arts which women have and the strength that freya gives them well thou knowest also of what breed this swanhild came and perchance thou canst remember how she dealt with thee and with what mind she looked on eric perchance thou canst remember how she plotted against thee and ericay how she thrust thee from goldfoss brink say then wilt thou take her word wilt thou take the word of this witchdaughter of a witch wilt thou not think on groa her mother and of groas dealings with thy father and with unna my kinswoman as the mother is so shall the daughter be wilt thou cast eric aside and that unheard  there is no more room for doubt mother said gudruda i have proof of this that eric has forsaken me  so thou thinkest child but i tell thee that thou art wrong eric loves thee now as he loved thee aforetime and will love thee always  would that i could believe it said gudruda if i could believe that eric still loved meay even though he had been faithless to mei would die ere i wed ospakar  thou art foolish gudruda and thou shalt rue thy folly bitterly i am outworn and death draws near to mefar from me now are hates and loves hopes and fears but i know this that woman is mad who loving a man weds where she loves not shame shall be her portion and bitterness her bread unhappy shall she live and when she comes to die but as a wildernessbut as the desolate winter snow shall be the record of her days  now gudruda wept aloud what is done is done she cried the bridegroom sits within the hallthe bride awaits him in the bower what is done is donei may hope no more to be saved from ospakar  what is done is done yet it can be brought to nothing but soon that shall be done which may never be undone gudruda fare thee well never shall i listen to thy voice again i hold thee shameless thou unfaithful woman who in thy foolish jealousy art ready to sell thyself to the arms of one thou hatest ho carles come hither bear me hence  now the men came in and took up saevunas chair gudruda watched them bear her forth then suddenly she sprang from her seat and ran after her into the hall weeping bitterly  now as saevuna erics mother was carried out she was met by ospakar and björn  stay said björn what does this carline hereand why weeps gudruda my sister  the men halted who calls me carline said saevuna is the voice i hear the voice of björn asmunds son  it is my voice truly said björn and i would know thisand this would ospakar who stands at my side know alsowhy thou comest here carline and why gudruda weeps  gudruda weeps because she has good cause to weep björn she weeps because she has betrayed her love eric brighteyes my son and is about to be sold in marriageto be sold to thee ospakar blacktooth like a heifer at a fair  then björn grew angry and cursed saevuna nor did ospakar spare to add his ill words but the old dame sat in her chair listening silently till all their curses were spent  ye are evil the twain of you she said and ye have told lies of eric my son and ye have taken his bride for lust and greed playing on the jealous folly of a maid like harpers on a harp now i tell you this björn and ospakar my blind eyes are opened and i see this hall of middalhof and lo it is but a gore of blood blood flows upon the boardblood streams along the floor and yeye twainlie dead thereon and about your shapes are shrouds and on her feet are hellshoon eric comes and whitefire is aloft and no more shall ye stand before him whom ye have slandered than stands the birch before the lightning stroke eric comes i see his angry eyesi see his helm flash in the doorplace red was that marriagefeast at which sat unna my kinswoman and asmund thy fatherredder shall be the feast where sit gudruda thy sister and ospakar the wolf howls at thy door björn the graveworm opens his mouth trolls run to and fro upon thy threshold and the ghosts of men speed hellwards ill were the deeds of groaworse shall be the deeds of groas daughter red is thy hall with blood björnfor whitefire is aloft andi tell thee eric comesand with one great cry she fell backdead  now they stood amazed and trembling in their fear  saevuna hath spoken strange words said björn  shall we be frightened by a dead hag quoth ospakar drawing his breath again fellows bear this carrion forth or we fling it to the dogs  then the men tied the body of saevuna thorgrimurs widow erics mother fast in the chair and bore it thence but when at length they came to coldback they found that swanhild was there with all her following and had driven erics grieve and his folk to the fells but one old carline who had been nurse to eric was left there and she sat wailing in an outhouse being too weak to move  then the men set down the corpse of saevuna in the outhouse and having told all their tale to the carline they fled also  that night passed and passed the morrow but on the next day at dawn eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail landed near westman isles they had made a bad passage from fareys having been beat about by contrary winds but at length they came safe and well to land  now this was the day of the marriagefeast of gudruda the fair and ospakar but eric knew nothing of these tidings  where to now lord said skallagrim  to coldback first to see my mother if she yet lives and to learn tidings of gudruda then as it may chance  near to the beach was a yeomans house thither they went to hire horses but none were in the house for all had gone to gudrudas marriagefeast in the home meadow ran two good horses and in the outhouses were saddles and bridles they caught the horses saddled them and rode for coldback when they had ridden for something over an hour they came to the crest of a height whence they could see coldback in the marsh  eric drew rein and looked and his heart swelled within him at the sight of the place where he was born but as he looked he saw a great train of people ride away from coldback towards middalhofand in the company a woman wearing a purple cloak  now what may this mean said eric  ride on and we shall learn answered skallagrim  so they rode on and as they rode erics breast grew heavy with fear now they passed up the banked way through the home meadows of the house but they could see no one and now they were at the door down sprang eric and walked into the hall but none were there to greet him though a fire yet burned upon the earth only a gaunt hound wandered about the hall and seeing him sprang towards him growling eric knew him for his old wolfhound and called him by his name the dog listened then ran up and smelt his hands and straightway howled with joy and leapt upon him for a while he leapt thus while eric stared around him wondering and sad at heart then the dog ran to the door and stopped whining eric followed after him the hound passed through the entrance and across the yard till he came to an outhouse here the dog stopped and scratched at the door still whining eric thrust it open lo there before him sat saevuna his mother dead in a chair and at her feet crouched the carlineshe who had been erics nurse  now he grasped the doorposts to steady himself and his shadow fell upon the white face of his mother and the old carline at her feet     xxiii  how eric was a guest at the weddingfeast of gudruda the fair  eric looked but said nothing  who art thou whined the carline gazing up at him with tearblinded eyes but erics face was in the shadow and she only saw the glint of his golden hair and the flash of the golden helm for eric could not speak yet a while  art thou one of the swanhilds folk come to drive me hence with the rest good sir i cannot go to the fells my limbs are too weak slay me if thou wilt but drive me not from this and she pointed to the corpse say now will thou not help me to give it burial it is unmeet that she who in her time had husband and goods and son should lie unburied like a dead cow on the fells i have still a hundred in silver if i might but come at it it is hidden sir and i will pay thee if thou wilt help me to bury her these old hands are too feeble to dig a grave nor could i bear her there alone if it were dug thou wilt not help methen may thine own mothers bones lie uncovered and be picked of gulls and ravens oh that eric brighteyes would come home again oh that eric was here there is work to do and never a man to do it  now eric gave a great sob and cried nurse nurse knowest thou me not i am eric brighteyes  she uttered a loud cry and clasping him by the knees looked up into his face  thanks be to odin thou art ericeric come home again but alas thou hast come too late  what has happened then said eric  what has happened all evil things thou art outlawed eric at the suit of swanhild for the slaying of atli the earl swanhild sits here in coldback for she hath seized thy lands saevuna thy mother died two days ago in the hall of middalhof whither she went to speak with gudruda  gudruda what of gudruda cried eric  this brighteyes today she weds ospakar blacktooth  eric covered his face with his hand presently he lifted it  thou art rich in evil tidings nurse though it would seem poor in all besides tell me at what hour is the weddingfeast  an hour after noon eric but now swanhild has ridden thither with her company  then room must be found at middalhof for one more guest said eric and laughed aloud go onpour out thy evil news and spare me notfor nothing has any more power to harm me now come hither skallagrim and see and hearken  skallagrim came and looked on the face of dead saevuna  i am outlawed at swanhilds suit lambstail my life lies in thy hand if so be thou wouldst take it hew off my head if thou wilt and bear it to gudruda the fairshe will thank thee for the gift lay on lambstail lay on with that axe of thine  childs talk said skallagrim  childs talk but mans work thou hast not heard the tale out swanhild hath seized my lands and sits here at coldback andwhat thinkest thou skallagrimbut now she has ridden aguesting to the marriagefeast of ospakar blacktooth with gudruda the fair swanhild at gudrudas weddingthe eagle in the wild swans nest but there will be another guest and again he laughed aloud  two other guests said skallagrim  more of thy tale old nursemore of thy tale quoth eric no better didst thou ever tell me when as a lad i sat by thee in the ingle o winter nightsand the company is fitting to the tale and he pointed to dead saevuna  then the carline told on she told how hall of lithdale had come out to iceland and of the story that he bore to gudruda and of the giving of the lock of hair  what did i say lord broke in skallagrimthat in hall thou hadst let a weasel go who would live to nip thee  him i will surely live to shorten by a head quoth eric  nay lord this one for meospakar for thee hall for me  as thou wilt baresark among so many there is room to pick and choose tell on nurse  then she told how swanhild came out to iceland and having won ospakar blacktooth and gizur to her side had laid a suit against eric at the thing and there bore false witness against him so that brighteyes was declared outlaw being absent she told too how gudruda had betrothed herself to ospakar and how swanhild had moved down to coldback and seized the lands lastly she told of the rising of saevuna from her deathbed of her going to middalhof of the words she spoke to björn and ospakar and of her death in the hall at middalhof  when all was told eric stooped and kissed the cold brow of his mother  there is little time to bury thee now my mother he said and perchance before six hours are sped there will be one to bury at thy side nevertheless thou shalt sit in a better place than this  then he cut loose the cords that bound the body of saevuna to the chair and lifting it in his arms bore it to the hall there he set the corpse in the high seat of the hall  we need not start yet a while skallagrim said eric if indeed thou wouldst go aguesting with me to middalhof therefore let us eat and drink for there are deeds to do this day  so they found meat and mead and ate and drank then eric washed himself combed out his golden locks and looked well to his harness and to whitefires edge skallagrim also ground his great axe upon the whetstone in the yard singing as he ground when all was ready the horses were caught and eric spoke to the carline  hearken nurse if it may be that thou canst find any of our folkand perchance now that they see that swanhild has ridden to middalhof some one of them will come down to spythou shalt say this to them thou shalt say that if eric brighteyes yet lives he will be at the foot of mosfell tomorrow before midday and if for the sake of old days and fellowship they are minded to befriend a friendless man let them come thither with food for by then food will be needed and i will speak with them and now farewell and eric kissed her and went leaving her weeping  as it chanced before another hour was sped jon erics thrall who had stayed at home in iceland seeing coldback empty crept down from the fells and looked in the carline saw him and told him these tidings then he went thence to find the other men having found them he told them erics words and a great gladness came upon them when they learned that brighteyes still lived and was in iceland then they gathered food and gear and rode away to the foot of mosfell that is now called ericsfell    ospakar sat in the hall at middalhof near to the high seat he was fully armed and a black helm with a ravens crest was on his head for though he said nothing of it not a little did he fear that saevuna spoke sooththat her words would come true and before this day was done he and eric should once more stand face to face at his side sat gudruda the fair robed in white a worked headdress on her head golden clasps upon her breast and golden rings about her arms never had she been more beautiful to see but her face was whiter than her robes she looked with loathing on blacktooth at her side rough like a bear and hideous as a troll but he looked on her with longing and laughed from side to side of his great mouth when he thought that at last he had got her for his own  ah if eric would but come faithless though he beif eric would but come thought gudruda but no eric came to save her the guests gathered fast and presently swanhild swept in with all her company wrapped about in her purple cloak she came up to the high seat where gudruda sat and bent the knee before her looking on her with lovely mocking face and hate in her blue eyes  greeting gudruda my sister she said when last we met i sat atlis bride where today thou sittest the bride of ospakar then eric brighteyes held thy hand and little thou didst think of wedding ospakar now eric is afarso strangely do things come aboutand blacktooth brighteyes foe holds that fair hand of thine  gudruda looked on her and turned whiter yet in her pain but she answered never a word  what no word for me sister said swanhild and yet it is through me that thou comest to this glad hour it is through me that thou art rid of eric and it is i who have given thee to the arms of mighty ospakar no word of thanks for so great a servicefie on thee gudruda fie  then gudruda spoke strange tales are told of thee and eric groas daughter i have done with eric but i have done with thee also thou hast thrust thyself here against my will and if i may i would see thy face no more  wouldst thou see erics face gudrudasay wouldst see erics face i tell thee it is fair  but gudruda answered nothing and swanhild fell back laughing  now the feast began and men waxed merry but ever gudrudas heart grew heavier for in it echoed those words that saevuna had spoken her eyes were dim and she seemed to see naught but the face of eric as it had looked when he came back to her that day on the brink of goldfoss falls and she had thought him dead oh what if he still loved her and were yet true at heart swanhild mocked herwhat if this was a plot of swanhilds had not swanhild plotted aforetime and could a wolf cease from ravening or a witch from witchwork nay she had seen erics hairthat he had sworn none save she should touch perchance he had been drugged and the hair shorn from him in his sleep too late to think of what use was thoughtbeside her sat ospakar in one short hour she would be his ah that she could see him deadthe troll who had trafficked her to shame the foe she had summoned in her wrath and jealousy she had done illshe had fallen into swanhilds snare and now swanhild came to mock her  the feast went oncup followed cup now they poured the bridecup before her heart beat two hundred times she would be the wife of ospakar  blacktooth took the cuppledged her in it and drank deep then he turned and strove to kiss her but gudruda shrank from him with horror in her eyes and all men wondered still she must drink the bridal cup she took it dimly she saw the upturned faces faintly she heard the murmur of a hundred voices  what was that voice she caught above them alltherewithout the hall  holding the cup in her hand gudruda bent forward staring down the skali then she cried aloud pointing to the door and the cup fell clattering from her hand and rolled along the ground  men turned and looked they saw this there on the threshold stood a man glorious to look at and from his winged helm of gold the rays of light flashed through the dusky hall the man was great and beautiful to see he had long yellow hair bound in about his girdle and in his left hand he held a pointed shield in his right a spear and at his thigh there hung a mighty sword nor was he alone for by his side a broad axe on his shoulder and shield in hand stood another man clad in blackhued maila man wellnigh as broad and big with hawks eyes eagle beak and black hair streaked with grey  for a moment there was silence then a voice spoke  lo here be the gods baldur and thorcome from valhalla to grace the marriagefeast  then the man with golden hair cried aloud in a voice that made the rafters ring  here are eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail his thrall come from over sea to grace the feast indeed  i could have looked for no worse guests said björn beneath his breath and rose to bid men thrust them out but before he could speak lo goldhelmed eric and blackhelmed skallagrim were stalking up the length of that great hall side by side they stalked with faces fierce and cold nor stayed they till they stood before the high seat eric looked up and round and the light of his eyes was as the light of a sword men marvelled at his greatness and his wonderful beauty and to gudruda he seemed like a god  here i see faces that are known to me said eric greetings comrades  greetings brighteyes shouted the middalhof folk and the company of swanhild but the carles of ospakar laid hand on swordthey too knew eric for still all men loved eric and the people of his quarter were proud of the deeds he had done oversea  greeting björn asmunds son quoth eric greeting ospakar blacktooth greeting swanhild the fatherless atlis witchwifegroas witchbairn greeting hall of lithdale hall the liarhall who cut the grapnelchain and to thee sweet bride to thee gudruda the fair greeting  now björn spoke i will take no greeting from a shamed and outlawed man get thee gone eric brighteyes and take thy wolfhound with thee lest thou bidest here stiff and cold  speak not so loud rat lest hounds fang worry thee growled skallagrim  but eric laughed aloud and cried  words must be said and perchance men shall die ere ever i leave this hall björn     xxiv  how the feast went  hearken all men said eric  thrust him out quoth björn  nay cut him down said ospakar he is an outlawed man  words first then deeds answered skallagrim thou shalt have thy fill of both blacktooth before day is done  let eric say his say said gudruda lifting her head he has been doomed unheard and it is my will that he shall say his say  what hast thou to do with eric snarled ospakar  the bridecup is not yet drunk lord she answered  to thee then i will speak lady quoth eric how comes it that being betrothed to me thou dost sit there the bride of ospakar  ask of swanhild said gudruda in a low voice ask also of hall of lithdale yonder who brought me swanhilds gift from straumey  i must ask much of hall and he must answer much said eric what tale then did he bring thee from straumey  he said this eric gudruda answered that thou wast swanhilds love that for swanhilds sake thou hadst basely killed atli the good and that thou wast about to wed swanhilds self and take the earls seat in orkneys  and for what cause was i made outlaw at the althing  for this cause eric said björn that thou hadst dealt evilly with swanhild bringing her to shame against her will and thereafter that thou hadst slain the earl her husband  which then of these tales is true for both cannot be true said brighteyes speak swanhild  thou knowest well that the last is true said swanhild boldly  how then comes it that thou didst charge hall with that message to gudruda how then comes it that thou didst send her the lock of hair which thou didst cozen me to give thee  i charged hall with no message and i sent no lock of hair swanhild answered  stand thou forward hall said eric and liar and coward though thou art dare not to speak other than the truth nay look not at the door for if thou stirrest this spear shall find thee before thou hast gone a pace  now hall stood forward trembling with fear for he saw the eye of skallagrim watching him close and while lambstail watched his fingers toyed with the handle of his axe  it is true lord that swanhild charged me with that message which i gave to the lady gudruda also she bade me give the lock of hair  and for this service thou didst take money hall  ay lord she gave me money for my faring  and all the while thou knewest the tidings false  hall made no reply  answer thundered ericanswer the truth knave or by every god that passes the hundred gates i will not spare thee twice  it is so lord said hall  thou liest fox cried swanhild white with wrath and casting a fierce look upon hall but men took no heed of swanhilds words for all eyes were bent on eric  is it now your pleasure comrades that i should tell you the truth said brighteyes  the most part of the company shouted yea but the men of ospakar stood silent  speak on eric quoth gudruda  this is the truth then swanhild the fatherless atlis wife has always sought my love and she has ever hated gudruda whom i loved from a child she has striven to work mischief between us ay and she did this though till now it has been hidden she strove to murder gudruda it was on the day that skallagrim and i overcame ospakar and his band on horsehead heights she thrust gudruda from the brink of golden falls while she sat looking on the waters and as she hung there i dragged her back is it not so gudruda  it is so said gudruda  now men murmured and looked at swanhild but she shrank back plucking at her purple cloak  it was for this cause said eric that asmund swanhilds father gave her choice to wed atli the earl and pass over sea or to take her trial in the doomring she wedded atli and went away afterwards by witchcraft she brought my ship to wreck on straumeys isleay she walked the waters like a shape of light and lured us on to ruin so that all were drowned except skallagrim and myself is it not so skallagrim  it is so lord i saw her with my eyes  again folk murmured  then we must sit in atlis hall said eric and there we dwelt last winter for a while swanhild did no harm till i feared her no more but some three months ago i was left with her and a man called koll groas thrall of whom ye know came out from iceland bringing news of the death of asmund the priest of unna my cousin and of groa the witch to these illtidings swanhild bribed him to add something she bribed him to add this that thou gudruda wast betrothed to ospakar and wouldst wed him on last yule day moreover he gave me a certain message from thee gudruda and in token of its truth the half of that coin which i broke with thee long years ago say now lady didst thou send the coin  nay never cried gudruda many years ago i lost the half thou gavest me though i feared to tell thee  perchance one stands there who found it said eric pointing with his spear at swanhild at the least i was deceived by it now the tale is short swanhild mourned with me and in my sorrow i mourned bitterly then it was she asked a boon that lock of mine gudruda and thinking thee faithless i gave it holding all oaths broken then too when i would have left her she drugged me with a witchdraughtay she drugged me and i woke to find myself false to my oath false to atli and false to thee gudruda i cursed her and i left her waiting for the earl to tell him all but swanhild outwitted me she told him that other tale of shame that ye have heard and brought koll to him as witness of the tale atli was deceived by her and not until i had cut him down in anger at the bitter words he spoke calling me coward and niddering did he know the truth but before he died he knew it and he died holding my hand and bidding those about him find koll and slay him is it not so ye who were atlis men  it is so eric they cried we heard it with our own ears and we slew koll but afterwards swanhild brought is to believe that earl atli was distraught when he spoke thus and that things were indeed as she had said  again men murmured and a strange light shone in gudrudas eyes  now gudruda thou hast heard all my story said eric say dost thou believe me  i believe thee eric  say then wilt thou still wed yon ospakar  gudruda looked on blacktooth then she looked at golden eric and opened her lips to speak but before a word could pass them ospakar rose in wrath laying his hand upon his sword  thinkest thou thus to lure away my dove outlaw first i will see thee food for crows  well spoken blacktooth laughed eric i waited for such words from thee thrice have we striven togetheronce out yonder in the snow once on horsehead heights and once by westman islesand still we live to tell the tale come down ospakar come down from that soft seat of thine and here and now let us put it to the proof who is the better man when we met before the stake was whitefire set against my eye now the stake is our lives and fair gudrudas hand talk no more ospakar but fall to it  gudruda shall never wed thee while i live said björn thou art a landless loon a brawler and an outlaw get thee gone eric with thy wolfhound  squeak not so loud ratsqueak not so loud lest hounds fang worry thee said skallagrim  whether i wed gudruda or whether i wed her not is a matter that shall be known in its season said eric for thy words i say this that it is risky to hurl names at such as i am björn lest perchance i answer them with spearthrusts thy answer ospakar what need to wait thy answer  now ospakar looked at brighteyes and grew afraid he was a mighty man but he knew the weight of erics arm  i will not fight with thee carle he said who hast naught to lose  then thou art coward and niddering said eric ospakar niddering i name thee here before all men what thou couldst plot against methou couldst waylay me ten to one and two ships to one but face to face with me alone thou dost not dare to stand comrades look on your lordlook at ospakar the niddering  now the swarthy brow of blacktooth grew red with rage and his breath came in great gasps ho men he cried drive this knave away strip his harness off him and whip him hence with rods  let but a man stir towards me and this spear flies through thy heart niddering cried eric gudruda what thinkest thou of thy lord  i know this said gudruda that i will not wed a man who is named niddering in the face of all and lifts no sword  gudruda spoke thus because she was mad with love and fear and shame and she desired that eric should stand face to face with ospakar blacktooth for thus alone she might perhaps be rid of ospakar  such words do not come well from gentle lips said björn  is it to be borne brother answered gudruda that the man who would call me wife should be named ospakar the niddering when that shame is washed away and then only can i think on marriage i will never be nidderings bride  thou hearest ospakar niddering said eric then he gave the spear in his hand to skallagrim and gripping whitefires hilt he burst the peacestrings and tore it from the scabbard  now the great sword shone on high like lightning leaping from a cloud and as it shone men shouted ospakar ospakar niddering come win back whitefire from erics hand or be for ever shamed  blacktooth could endure this no more he snatched sword and shield and like a bear from a cave like a wolf from his lair rushed roaring from his seat on he came and the ground shook beneath his bulk  at last niddering cried eric and sprang to meet him  back all men back shouted skallagrim now we shall see blows  as he spoke the great swords flashed aloft and clanged upon the iron shields so heavy were the blows that fire leapt out from them ospakar reeled back beneath the shock and eric was beaten to his knee now he was up but as he rushed ospakar struck again and swept away half of brighteyens pointed shield so that it fell upon the floor eric smote also but ospakar dropped his knee to earth and the sword hissed over him blacktooth cut at erics legs but brighteyes sprang from the ground and took no harm  now some cried eric eric and some cried ospakar ospakar for no one knew how the fight would go  gudruda sat watching in the high seat and as blows fell her colour came and went  swanhild drew near watching also and she desired in her fierce heart to see eric brought to shame and death for should he win then gudruda would be rid of ospakar now by her side stood gizur ospakars son and near to her was björn these two held their breath for if eric conquered all their plans were brought to nothing  even as he sprang into the air eric smote down with all his strength the blow fell on ospakars shield it shore through the shield and struck on the shoulder beneath but blacktooths byrnie was good nor did the sword bite into it still the stroke was so heavy that ospakar staggered back four paces beneath it then fell upon the ground  now folk raised a shout of eric eric for it seemed that ospakar was sped brighteyes too cried aloud then rushed forward now as he came swanhild whispered an eager word into the ear of björn by björns foot lay that half of erics shield which had been shorn away by the sword of ospakar gudruda watching saw björn push it with his shoe so that it slid before the feet of brighteyes his right foot caught on it he stumbled heavilystumbled again then fell prone on his face and as he fell stretched out his sword hand to save himself so that whitefire flew from his grasp the blade struck its hilt against the ground then circled in the air and fixed itself point downwards in the clay of the flooring the hand of ospakar rising from the ground smote against the hilt of whitefire he saw it with a shout he cast his own sword away and clasped whitefire  away circled the sword of ospakar and of that cast this strange thing is told false or true far in the corner of the hall lurked thorunna she who had betrayed skallagrim when he was named ounound she had come with a heavy heart to middalhof in the company of ospakar but when she saw skallagrim her husbandwhom she had betrayed and who had turned baresark because of her wickednessshame smote her and she crept away and hid herself behind the hangings of the hall the sword sped along point first it rushed like a spear through the air it fell on the hangings piercing them piercing the heart of thorunna who cowered behind them so that with one cry she sank dead to earth slain by her lovers hand    now when men saw that ospakar once more held whitefire in his handwhitefire that brighteyes had won from himthey called aloud that it was an omen the sword of blacktooth had come back to blacktooth and now eric would surely be slain of it  eric sprang from the ground he heard the shouts and saw whitefire blazing in ospakars hand  now thou art weaponless fly brighteyes fly cried some  gudrudas cheek grew white with fear and for a moment erics heart failed him  fly not roared skallagrim björn tripped thee yet hast thou half a shield  ospakar rushed on and whitefire flickered over erics helm down it came and shore one wing from the helm again it shone and fell but brighteyes caught the blow on his broken shield  then while men waited to see him slain eric gave a great warshout and sprang forward  thou art mad shouted the folk  ye shall see ye shall see screamed skallagrim  again ospakar smote and again eric caught the blow and behold he struck back thrusting with the point of the shorn shield straight at the face of ospakar  peck eagle peck cried skallagrim  once more whitefire shone above him eric rushed in beneath the sword and with all his mighty strength thrust the bucklerpoint at blacktooths face it struck fair and full and lo the helm of ospakar burst asunder he threw wide his giant arms then fell as a pine falls upon the mountain edge he fell back and he lay still  but eric stooping over him took whitefire from his hand     xxv  how the feast ended  for a moment there was silence in the hall for men had known no such fight as this  why then do ye gape laughed skallagrim pointing with the spear dead is ospakarslain by the swordless man eric brighteyes hath slain ospakar blacktooth  then there went up such a shout as never was heard in the hall of middalhof  now when gudruda knew that ospakar was sped she looked at eric as he rested leaning on his sword and her heart was filled with awe and love she sprang from her seat and coming to where brighteyes stood she greeted him  welcome to iceland eric she said welcome thou glory of the south  now swanhild grew wild for she saw that eric was about to take gudruda in his arms and kiss her before all men  say björn she cried wilt thou suffer that this outlaw having slain ospakar should lead gudruda hence as wife  he shall never do so while i live cried björn nearly mad with rage this is my command sister that thou dost see eric no more  say björn answered gudruda did i dream or did i indeed see thee thrust the broken buckler before erics feet so that he stumbled on it and fell  that thou sawest lady said skallagrim for i saw it also  now björn grew white in his anger he did not answer gudruda but called aloud to his men to slay eric and skallagrim gizur called also to the folk of ospakar and swanhild to those who came with her  then gudruda fled back to her seat  but eric cried aloud also ye who love me cleave to me suffer it not that brighteyes be cut down of northerners and outland men hear me atlis folk hear me carles of coldback and of middalhof  and so greatly did many love eric that half of the thralls of björn and almost all of the company of swanhild who had been atlis shieldmen and brighteyes comrades drew swords shouting eric eric but the carles of ospakar came on to make an end of him  björn saw and drawing sword smote at brighteyes taking him unawares but skallagrim caught the blow upon his axe and before björn could smite again whitefire was aloft and down fell björn dead  that was the end of björn asmunds son  thou hast squeaked thy last rat what did i tell thee cried skallagrim take björns shield and back to back lord for here come foes  there goes one answered eric pointing to the door  now hall of lithdale slunk through the doorwayhall the liar who cut the grapnelchainfor he wished to see the last of skallagrim but the baresark still held erics spear in his hand he whirled it aloft and it hissed through the air the aim was good for as he crept away the spear struck hall between neck and shoulder pinning him to the doorpost and there the liar died  now the weasel is nailed to the beam said skallagrim hall of lithdale what did i promise thee  guard thy head and my back quoth eric blows fall  now men smote at eric and skallagrim nor did they spare to smite in turn and as foes fell before him eric stepped one pace forward towards the door and skallagrim who back to back with him held off those who pressed behind took one step rearwards thus a foe for every step they won their way down the long hall fierce raged the fray around them for made with hate and drink and the lust of fight swanhilds folkerics friendsremembering the words of atli fell on ospakars and the people of björn fell on each other brother on brother and father on sonnor might the fray be stayed the boards were overthrown dead men lay among the meats and mead and the blood of freeman lord and thrall ran adown the floor everywhere through the dusky hall glittered the sheen of flashing swords and rose the clang of war darts clove the air like tongues of flame and the clamour of battle beat against the roof  blinded of the norns who brought these things to pass men sought no mercy and they gave none but smote and slew till few were left to slay  and still gudruda sat in her brideseat and with eyes fixed in horror watched the waxing of the war near to her stood swanhild marking all things with a fierceset face and calling down curses on her folk who one and all cried eric eric and swept the thralls of ospakar as corn is swept of the sickle  and there nigh to the door pale of face and beautiful to see golden eric clove his way and with him went black skallagrim terrible was the flare of whitefire as he flicked aloft like the levin in the cloud terrible was the flare of whitefire but more terrible was the light of erics eyes for they seemed to flame in his head and wherever that fire fell it lighted men the way to death whitefire sung and flickered and crashed the axe of skallagrim and still through the press of war they won their way now gizur stands before them spear aloft and whitefire leaps up to meet him lo he turns and flies the coward son of ospakar does not seek the fate of ospakar  the door is won they stand without but little harmed while women wail aloud  to horse cried skallagrim to horse ere our luck fail us  there is no luck in this gasped eric for i have slain many men and among them is björn the brother of her whom i would make my bride  better one such fight than many brides said skallagrim shaking his red axe we have won great glory this day brighteyes and ospakar is deadslain by a swordless man    now eric and skallagrim ran to their horses none hindering them and mounting rode towards mosfell  all that evening and all the night they rode and at morning they came across the black sand to mosfell slopes that are by the hecla here they rested and taking off their armour washed themselves in the stream for they were very weary and foul with blood and wounds when they had finished washing and had buckled on their harness again skallagrim peering across the plain with his hawks eyes saw men riding fast towards them  foes are soon afoot lord he said i thought we had stayed their hunger for a while  would that i might stay mine quoth eric i am weary and unfit for fight  i have still strength for one or two said skallagrim and then goodnight but these are no foes they are of the coldback folk the carline has kept her word  then eric was glad and presently six men headed by jon his thrall the same man who had watched on mosfell when eric went up to slay the baresark rode to them and greeted them beggar women said jon whom they met at ran river had told them of the death of ospakar and of the great slaying at middalhof and they would know if the tidings were true  it is true jon said eric but first give us food if ye have it for we are hungered and spent when we have eaten we will speak  so they led up a packhorse and from it took stockfish and smoked meat of which eric and skallagrim ate heartily till their strength came back to them  then eric spoke comrades he said i am an outlawed man and though i have not sought it much blood is on my head atli is dead at my hand ospakar is dead at my hand björn the priest asmunds son is dead at my hand and with them many another man nor may the matter stay here for gizur blacktooths son yet lives and björn has kin in the south and swanhild will buy friends with gold and all of these will set on me to slay me so that at the last i die by the sword  no need for that said skallagrim our vengeance is wrought and now as before the sea is open and i think that a welcome awaits us in london  now gudruda is widowed before she was fully wed said eric therefore i bide an outlawed man here in iceland i go hence no more though it be death to stay unless indeed gudruda the fair goes with me  it will be death then said skallagrim and the swords are forged that we shall feel the odds are too heavy lord  mayhap answered eric no man may flee his fate and i shall not altogether grieve when mine finds me hearken comrades i go up to mosfell height and there i stay till those be found who can drag me from my hole but this is my counsel to you that ye leave me to my doom for i am an unlucky man who always chooses the wrong road  that will not i said skallagrim  nor we said erics folk swanhild holds coldback and we are driven to the fells to the fells then we will go with thee eric brighteyes and become cavedwellers and outlaws for thy sake fear not thou shalt still find many friends  i did not look for such a thing at your hands said eric but stormy waters show how the boat is built may no bad luck come to you from your good fellowship and now let us to our nest  then they caught the horses and rode with brighteyes up the steep side of mosfell till at length they came to that secret dell which skallagrim had once shown to eric here they turned the horses loose to feed and going forward on foot reached the dark and narrow pass that brighteyes had trod when he sought for the baresark foe skallagrim led the way along it then came eric and the rest one by one they stepped on to the giddy point of rock and catching at the birchbush entered the hole so they gained the platform and the great cave beyond and they found that no man had set foot there since the day when eric had striven with skallagrim for there on the rock rotten with the weather lay that haft of wood which brighteyes had hewed from the axe of skallagrim and in the cave were many things beside as the baresark had left them  so they took up their dwelling in the cave eric skallagrim and the six coldback men and there they dwelt many months but eric sent out his men one at a time and got together food and a store of sheepskins and other needful things for he knew this well that gizur and swanhild would before long come up against them and if they could not take them by force would set themselves to watch the mountainpath and starve them out    when eric and skallagrim rode away from middalhof the fight still raged fiercely in the hall and nothing but death might stay it the minds of men were mad and they smote one another and slew each other till at length of all that marriage company few were left unharmed except gizur swanhild and gudruda for the serving thralls and womenfolk had fled the hall and with them some peaceful men  then gudruda spoke as one in a dream  saevunas prophecy was true she said red was the marriagefeast of asmund my father redder has been the marriagefeast of ospakar she saw the hall of middalhof one gore of blood and lo it is so look upon thy work swanhild and she pointed to the piledup deadlook upon thy work witchsister and grow fearful for all this death is on thy head  swanhild laughed aloud i think it a merry sight she cried the marriagefeast of asmund our father was red and thy marriagefeast gudruda has been redder would that thy blood and the blood of eric ran with the blood of björn and ospakar that tale must yet be told gudruda there shall be binding on of hellshoes at middalhof but i bind them not my task is still to come for i will live to fasten the hellshoes on the feet of eric and on thy feet gudruda at the least i have brought about this much that thou canst scarcely wed eric the outlaw for with his own hand he slew björn our brother and because of this i count all that death as nothing thou canst not mate with brighteyes lest the wide wounds of björn thy brother should take tongues and cry thy shame from sea to sea  gudruda made no answer but sat as one carved in stone then swanhild spoke again  let us away to the north gizur there to gather strength to make an end of eric say wilt thou help us gudruda the bloodfeud for the death of björn is thine  ye are enough to bring about the fall of one unfriended man gudruda said go and leave me with my sorrow and the dead nay before thou goest listen swanhild for there is that in my heart which tells me i shall never look again upon thy face from evil to evil thou hast ever gone swanhild and from evil to evil thou wilt go it may well chance that thy wickedness will win it may well chance that thou wilt crown thy crimes with my slaying and the slaying of the man who loves me but i tell thee this traitressmurderess as thou artthat here the tale ends not not by death swanhild shalt thou escape the deeds of life there they shall rise up against thee and there every shame that thou hast worked every sin that thou hast sinned and every soul that thou hast brought to helas halls shall come to haunt thee and to drive thee on from age to age that witchcraft which thou lovest shall mesh thee shadows shall bewilder thee from the bowl of empty longings thou shalt drink and drink and not be satisfied yea lusts shall mock and madden thee thou shalt ride the winds thou shalt sail the seas but thou shalt find no harbour and never shalt thou set foot upon a shore of peace  go on swanhilddye those hands in bloodwade through the river of shame seek thy desire and finding lose work thy evil and winning fail i yet shall triumphi yet shall trample thee and in a place to come with eric at my side i shall make a mock of swanhild the murderess swanhild the liar and the wanton and the witch now get thee gone  swanhild heard she looked up at gudrudas face and it was alight as with a fire she strove to answer but no words came then groas daughter turned and went and with her went gizur    now women and thralls came in and drew out the wounded and those who still breathed from among the dead taking them to the temple they bore away the body of ospakar also but they left the rest    all night long gudruda sat in the brides seat there she sat in the silver summer midnight looking on the slain who were strewn about the great hall all night she sat alone in the brides seat thinkingever thinking  how then would it end there her brother björn lay acoldbjörn the justly slain of brighteyes yet how could she wed the man who slew her brother from ospakar she was divorced by death from eric she was divorced by the blood of björn her brother how might she unravel this tangled skein and float to weal upon this sea of death all things went amiss the doom was on her she had lived to an ill purposeher love had wrought evil what availed it to have been born to be fair among women and to have desired that which might not be and she herself had brought these things to passshe had loosed the rock which crushed her why had she hearkened to that false tale  gudruda sat on high in the brides seat asking wisdom of the piledup dead while the cold blue shadows of the nightless night gathered over her and themgathered and waned and grew at last to the glare of day     xxvi  how eric ventured down to middalhof and what he found  gizur went north to swinefell and swanhild went with him for now that ospakar was dead at erics hand gizur ruled in his place at swinefell and was the greatest lord in all the north he loved swanhild and desired to make her his wife but she played with him talking darkly of what might be swanhild was not minded to be the wife of any man except of eric to all others she was cold as the winter earth still she fooled gizur as she had fooled atli the good and he grew blind with love of her for still the beauty of swanhild waxed as the moon waxes in the sky and her wicked eyes shone as the stars shine when the moon has set  now they came to swinefell and there gizur buried ospakar blacktooth his father with much state he set him in a chamber of rock and timbers on a mountaintop whence he might see all the lands that once were his and built up a great mound of earth above him to this day people tell that here on yule night black ospakar bursts out and golden eric rides down the blast to meet him then come the clang of swords and groans and the sound of riven helms till presently brighteyes passes southward on the wind bearing in his hand the half of a cloven shield  so gizur bound the hellshoes on his father and swore that he would neither rest nor stay till eric brighteyes was dead and dead was skallagrim lambstail then he gathered a great force of men and rode south to coldback to the slaying of eric and with him went swanhild    gudruda sat alone in the haunted hall of middalhof and brooded on her love and on her fate eric too sat in mosfell cave and brooded on his evil chance his heart was sick with sorrow and there was little that he could do except think about the past he would not go to foray after the fashion of outlaws and there was no need of this for the talk of his mighty deeds spread through the land so that the people spoke of little else and the men of his quarter were so proud of these deeds of erics that though some of their kind had fallen at his hands in the great fight of middalhof and some at the hands of skallagrim yet they spoke of him as men speak of a god moreover they brought him gifts of food and clothing and arms as many as his people could carry away and laid them in a booth that is on the plain near the foot of mosfell which thenceforth was named ericsfell further they bade his thralls tell him that if he wished it they would find him a good ship of war to take him from icelanday and man it with loyal men and true  eric thanked them through jon his thrall but answered that he wished to die here in iceland    now when eric had sat two months and more in mosfell cave and autumn was coming he learned that gizur and swanhild had moved down to coldback and with them a great company of men who were sworn to slay him he asked if gudruda the fair had also gathered men for his slaying they told him no that gudruda stayed with her thralls and women at middalhof mourning for björn her brother from these tidings eric took some heart of hope at the least gudruda laid no bloodfeud against him for he waited thinking if indeed she yet loved him that gudruda would send him some word or token of her love but no word came since between them ran the blood of björn on the morrow of these tidings skallagrim spoke to eric  this is my counsel lord he said that we ride out by night and fall on the folk of gizur at coldback and burn the stead over them putting them to the sword i am weary of sitting here like an eagle in a cage  such is no counsel of mine skallagrim answered brighteyes i am weary of sitting here indeed but i am yet more weary of bringing men to their death i will shed no more blood unless it is to save my own head when the people of gizur came to seek me on mosfell they shall find me here but i will not go to them  thy heart is out of thee lord said skallagrim thou wast not wont to speak thus  ay skallagrim said eric the heart is out of me yet i ride from mosfell today  whither lord  to middalhof to have speech with gudruda the fair  like enough then thou wilt be silent thereafter  it well may be said eric yet i will ride i can bear this doubt no longer  then i shall come with thee said skallagrim  as thou wilt answered eric  so at midday eric and skallagrim rode away from mosfell in a storm of rain the rain was so heavy that those of gizurs spies who watched the mountain did not see them all that day they rode and all the night till by morning they came to middalhof eric told skallagrim to stay with the horses and let them feed while he went on foot to see if by chance he might get speech with gudruda this the baresark did though he grumbled at the task fearing lest eric should be done to death and he not there to die with him  now eric walked to within two bowshots of the house then sat down in a dell by the river from the edge of which he could see those who passed in and out presently his heart gave a leap for there came out from the womans door a lady tall and beautiful to see and with golden hair that flowed about her breast it was gudruda and he saw that she bore a napkin in her hand then eric knew according to her custom on the warm mornings that she came alone to bathe in the river as she had always done from a child it was her habit to bathe here in this place for at the bottom of the dell was a spot where reeds and bushes grew thick and the water lay in a basin of rock and was clear and still for at this spot a hot spring ran into the river  eric went down the dell hid himself close in the bushes and waited for he feared to speak with gudruda in the open field a while passed and presently the shadow of the lady crept over the edge of the dell then she came herself in that beauty which since her day has not been known in iceland her face was sad and sweet her dark and lovely eyes were sad on she came till she stood within a spears length of where eric lay crouched in the bush and looking at her through the hedge of reeds here a flat rock overhung the water and gudruda sat herself on this rock and shaking off her shoes dipped her white feet in the water then suddenly she threw aside her cloak baring her arms and gazing upon the shadow of her beauty in the mirror of the water sighed and sighed again while eric looked at her with a bursting heart for as yet he could find no words to say  now she spoke aloud of what use to be so fair she said oh wherefore was i born so fair to bring death to many and sorrow on myself and him i love and she shook her golden hair about her arms of snow and holding the napkin to her eyes wept softly but it seemed to eric that between her sobs she called upon his name  now eric could no longer bear the sight of gudruda weeping while she wept hiding her eyes he rose from behind the screen of reeds and stood beside her in such fashion that his shadow fell upon her she felt the sunlight pass and looked up lo it was no cloud but the shape of eric and the sun glittered on his golden helm and hair  eric gudruda cried eric then remembering how she was attired snatching her cloak she threw it about her arms and thrust her wet feet into her shoes out upon thee she said is it not enough then that thou shouldst break thy troth for swanhilds sake that thou shouldst slay my brother and turn my hall to shambles wouldst now steal upon me thus  methought that thou didst weep and call upon my name gudruda he said humbly  by what right art thou here to hearken to my words she answered is it then strange that i should speak the name of him who slew my brother is it strange that i should weep over that brother whom thou didst slay get thee gone brighteyes before i call my folk to kill thee  call on gudruda i set little price upon my life i laid it in the hands of chance when i came from mosfell to speak with thee and now i will pay it down if so it pleases thee fear not thy thralls shall have an easy task for i shall scarcely care to hold my own say shall i call for thee  hush speak not so loud folk may hear thee eric and then thou wilt be in dangeri would say that then shall ill things be told of me because i am found with him who slew my brother  i slew ospakar too gudruda surely the death of him by whose side thou didst sit as wife is more to thee than the death of björn  the bridecup was not yet drunk eric therefore i have no bloodfeud for ospakar  is it then thy will that i should go lady  yes gogo never let me see thy face again  brighteyes turned without a word he took three paces and gudruda watched him as he went  eric she called eric thou mayest not go yet for at this hour the thralls bring down the kine to milk and they will see thee liest thou hid here ii will go for though indeed thou dost deserve to die i am not willing to bring thee to thy endbecause of old friendship i am not willing  if thou goest i will go also said eric thralls or no thralls i will go gudruda  thou art cruel to drive me to such a choice and i have a mind to give thee to thy fate  as thou wilt said eric but she made as though she did not hear his words  now she said if we must stay here it is better that we hide where thou didst hide lest some come upon thee and she passed through the screen of rushes and sat down in a grassy place beyond and spoke again  nay sit not near me sit yonder i would not touch thee nor look upon thee who wast swanhilds love and didst slay björn my brother  say gudruda said eric did i not tell thee of the magic arts of swanhild did i not tell thee before all men yonder in the hall and didst thou not say that thou didst believe my words speak  that is true said gudruda  wherefore then dost thou taunt me with being swanhilds lovewith being the love of her whom of all alive i hate the mostand whose wicked guile has brought these sorrows on us  but gudruda did not answer  and for this matter of the death of björn at my hands think gudruda was i to blame in it did not björn thrust the cloven shield before my feet and thus give me into the hand of ospakar did he not afterwards smite at me from behind and would he not have slain me if skallagrim had not caught the blow was i then to blame if i smote back and if the sword flew home wilt thou let the needful deed rise up against our love speak gudruda  talk no more of love to me eric she answered the blood of björn has blotted out our love it cries to me for vengeance how may i speak of love with him who slew my brother listen she went on looking on him sidelong as one who wished to look and yet not seem to see here thou must hide an hour and since thou wilt not sit in silence speak no tender words to me for it is not fitting but tell me of those deeds thou didst in the south lands over sea before thou wentest to woo swanhild and camest hither to kill my brother for till then thou wast minetill then i loved theewho now love thee not therefore i would hear of the deeds of that eric whom once i loved before he became as one dead to me  heavy words lady said ericwords to make death easy  speak not so she said it is unmanly thus to work upon my fears tell me those tidings of which i ask  so eric told her all his deeds though he showed small boastfulness about them he told her how he had smitten the wardragons of ospakar how he had boarded the raven and with skallagrim slain those who sailed in her he told her also of his deeds in ireland and of how he took the viking ships and came to london town  and as he told gudruda listened as one who hung upon her lovers dying words and there was but one light in the world for her the light of erics eyes and there was but one music the music of his voice now she looked upon him sidelong no longer but with open eyes and parted lips she drank in his words and always though she knew it not herself she crept closer to his side  then he told her how he had been greatly honoured of the king of england and of the battles he had fought in at his side lastly eric told her how the king would have given him a certain great lady of royal blood in marriage and how edmund had been angered because he would not stay in england  tell me of this lady said gudruda quickly is she fair and how is she named  she is fair and her name is elfrida said eric  and didst thou have speech with her on this matter  somewhat  now gudruda drew herself away from erics side  what was the purport of thy speech she said looking down speak truly eric  it came to little he answered i told her that there was one in iceland to whom i was betrothed and to iceland i must go  and what said this elfrida then  she said that i should get little luck at the hands of gudruda the fair moreover she asked should my betrothed be faithless to me or put me from her if i should come again to england  now gudruda looked him in the face and spoke say eric is it in thy mind to sail for england in the spring if thou canst escape thy foes so long  now eric took counsel with himself and in his love and doubt grew guileful as he had never been before for he knew well that gudruda had this weaknessshe was a jealous woman  since thou dost put me from thee that is in my mind lady he answered  gudruda heard she thought on the great and beauteous lady elfrida far away in england and of eric walking at her side and sorrow took hold of her she said no word but fixed her dark eyes on brighteyes face and lo they filled with tears  eric might not bear this sight for his heart beat within him as though it would burst the byrnie over it suddenly he stretched out his arms and swept her to his breast soft and sweet he kissed her again and yet again and she struggled not though she wept a little  it is small blame to me she whispered if thou dost hold me on thy breast and kiss me for thou art more strong than i björn must know this if his dead eyes see aught yet for thee eric it is the greatest shame of all thy shames  talk not my sweet talk not said eric but kiss thou me for thou knowest well that thou lovest me yet as i love thee  now the end of it was that gudruda yielded and kissed him whom she had not kissed for many years  loose me eric she said i would speak with thee and he loosed her though unwillingly  hearken she went on hiding her fair face in her hands it is true that for life and death i love thee now as everhow much thou mayest never know though björn be dead at thy hands yet i love thee but how i may wed thee and not win the greatest shame that i know not i am sure of one thing that we may not bide here in iceland now if indeed thou lovest me listen to my rede get thee back to mosfell eric and sit there in safety through this winter for they may not come at thee yonder on mosfell then if thou art willing in the spring i will make ready a ship for i have no ship now and moreover it is too late to sail then perchance leaving all my lands and goods i will take thy hand eric and we will fare together to england seeking such fortune as the norns may give us what sayest thou  i say it is a good rede and would that the spring were come  ay eric would that the spring were come our lot has been hard and i doubt much if things will go well with us at the last and now thou must hence for presently the servingwomen will come to seek me guard thyself eric as thou lovest meguard thyself and beware of swanhild then once more they kissed soft and long and eric went  but gudruda sat a while behind the screen of reeds and was very happy for a space for it was as though the winter were past and summer shone upon her heart again     xxvii  how gudruda went up to mosfell  eric walked warily till he came to the dell where he had left skallagrim and the horses it was the same dell in which groa had brewed the poisondraught for asmund the priest and unna thorods daughter  what news lord said skallagrim thou wast gone so long that i thought of seeking thee hast thou seen gudruda  ay said eric and this is the upshot of it that in the spring we sail for england and bid farewell to iceland and our ill luck  would then that it were spring said skallagrim speaking brighteyes own words why not sail now and make an end  gudruda has no ship and it is late to take the sea also i think that she would let a time go by because of the bloodfeud which she has against me for the death of björn  i would rather risk these things than stay the winter through in iceland said skallagrim it is long from now to spring and yon wolfs den is coldlying in the dark months as i know well  there is light beyond the darkness said eric and they rode away everything went well with them till late at night they came to the slopes of mosfell they were half asleep on their horses being weary with much riding and the horses were weary also suddenly skallagrim looking up caught the faint gleam of light from swords hidden behind some stones  awake lord he cried here are foes ahead  gizurs folk behind the stones heard his voice and came out from their ambush there were six of them and they formed in line before the pair they were watching the mountain for a rumour had reached them that eric was abroad and seeing him they had hidden hastily behind the stones  now what counsel shall we take said eric drawing whitefire  we have often stood against men more than six and sometimes we have left more men than six to mark where we stood answered skallagrim it is my counsel that we ride at them  so be it said eric and he spurred his weary horse with his heels now when the six saw eric and skallagrim charge on them boldly they wavered and the end of it was that they broke and fled to either side before a blow was struck for it had come to this pass so great was the terror of the names of eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail that no six men dared to stand before them in open fight  so the path being clear they rode on up the slope but when they had gone a little way skallagrim turned his horse and mocked those who had lain in ambush saying  ye fight well ye carles of gizur ospakars son ye are heroes surely say now mighty men will ye stand there if i come down alone against you  at these words the men grew mad with wrath and flung their spears skallagrim caught one on his shield and it fell to the earth but another passed over his head and struck eric on the left shoulder near the neck making a deep wound feeling the spear fast in him eric grasped it with his right hand drew it forth and turning hurled it so hard that the man before it got his death from the blow for his shield did not serve to stay it then the rest fled  skallagrim bound up erics wound as well as he could and they went on to the cave but when erics folk watching above saw the fight they ran down and met him now the hurt was bad and eric bled much still within ten days it healed up for the time  but a little while after erics wound was skinned over the snows set in on mosfell and the days grew short and the nights long once gizurs men to the number of fifty came half way up the mountain to take it but when they saw how strong the place was they feared and went back and after that returned no more though they always watched the fell  it was very dark and lonesome there upon the fell for a while eric kept in good heart but as the days went by he grew troubled for since he was wounded this had come upon him that he feared the dark and the death of atli at his hand and atlis words weighed more and more upon his mind they had no candles on the fell yet rather than stay in the blackness of the cave eric would wrap sheepskins about him and sit by the edge of that gulf down which the head of the baresark had foretold his fall and look out at the wide plains and fells and icemountains gleaming in the silver shine of the northern lights or in the white beams of the stars  it chanced that eric had bidden the men who stayed with him to build a stone hut upon the flat space of rock before the cave and to roof it with turves he had done this that work might keep them in heart also that they might have a place to store such goods as they had gathered now there was one stone lying near that no two men of their number could move except skallagrim and one other one day while it was light eric watched these two rolling the stone along to where it must stand and it was slow work presently they stayed to rest then eric came and putting his hands beneath the stone lifted and while men wondered he rolled the mass alone to where it should be set as the corner stone of the hut  ye are all children he said and laughed merrily  ay when we set our strength against thine lord answered skallagrim but look the blood runs from thy neckthe spearwound has broken out afresh  so it is surely said eric then he washed the wound and bound it up thinking little of the matter  but that night according to his custom eric sat on the edge of the gulf and looked at the winter lights as they played over heclas snows he was sad and heavy at heart for he thought of gudruda and wondered much if they should live to wed remembering atlis words he had little faith in his good luck now as eric sat and thought the bandage on his neck slipped so that the hurt bled and the frost got hold of the wound and froze it and froze his long hair to it also in such fashion that when he went to the cave where all men slept he could not loose his hair from the sore but lay down with it frozen to him on the morrow the hair was caked so fast about his neck that it could only be freed by shearing it but this eric would not suffer none he said should shear his hair except gudruda thus he had sworn and when he broke the oath misfortune had come of it he would break that vow no more if it cost him his life for sorrow and his ill luck had taken so great a hold of erics mind that in some ways he was scarcely himself  so it came to pass that he fell more and more sick till at length he could not rise from his bed in the cave but lay there all day and night staring at the little light which pierced the gloom still he would not suffer that anyone should touch his hair and when one stole upon him sleeping thinking so to cut it before he woke and come at the wound suddenly he sat up and dealt the man such a buffet on the head that he went near to death from it  then skallagrim spoke  on this matter he said it seems that brighteyes is mad he will not suffer that any touch his hair except gudruda and yet if his hair is not shorn he must die for the wound will fester under it nor may we cut it by strength for then he will kill himself in struggling it is come to this then either gudruda must be brought hither or eric will shortly die  that may not be they answered how can the lady gudruda come here across the snows even if she will come  come she can if she has the heart said skallagrim though i put little trust in womens hearts still i ride down to middalhof and thou jon shalt go with me for the rest i charge you watch your lord for if i come back and find anything amiss that shall be the death of some and if i do not come back but perish on the road yet i will haunt you  now jon liked not this task still for love of eric and fear of skallagrim he set out with the baresark they had a hard journey through the snowdrifts and the dark but on the third day they came to middalhof knocked upon the door and entered  now it was suppertime and people sitting at meat saw a great black man covered with snow and rime stalk up the hall and after him another smaller man who groaned with the cold and they wondered at the sight gudruda sat on the high seat and the firelight beat upon her face  who comes here she said  one who would speak with thee lady answered skallagrim  here is skallagrim the baresark said a man he is an outlaw let us kill him  ay it is skallagrim he answered and if there is killing to be done why heres that which shall do it and he drew out his axe and smiled grimly  then all held their peace for they feared the axe of skallagrim  lady he said i do not come for slaying or such childs play i come to speak a word in thine earbut first i ask a cup of mead and a morsel of food for we have spent three days in the snows  so they ate and drank then gudruda bade the baresark draw near and tell her his tale  lady said he eric my lord lies dying on mosfell  gudruda turned white as the snow  dyingeric lies dying she said why then art thou here  for this cause lady i think that thou canst save him if he is not already sped and he told her all the tale  now gudruda thought a while  this is a hard journey she said and it does not become a maid to visit outlaws in their caves yet i am come to this that i will die before i shrink from anything that may save the life of eric when must we ride skallagrim  this night said the baresark this night while the men sleep for now night and day are almost the same the snow is deep and we have no time to lose if we would find brighteyes living  then we will ride tonight answered gudruda  afterwards when people slept gudruda the fair summoned her women and bade them say to all who asked for her that she lay sick in bed but she called three trusty thralls bidding them bring two packhorses laden with hay food drugs candles made of sheeps fat and other goods and ride with her then all being ready they rode away secretly up stonefell gudruda on her horse blackmane and the others on good geldings that had been hayfed in the yard and by daylight they passed up horsehead heights they slept two nights in the snow and on the second night almost perished there for much soft snow fell but afterwards came frost and a bitter northerly wind and they passed on gudruda was a strong woman and great of heart and will and so it came about that on the third day she reached mosfell weary but little harmed though the fingers of her left hand were frostbitten they climbed the mountain and when they came to the dell where the horses were kept certain of erics men met them and their faces were sad  how goes it now with brighteyes said skallagrim for gudruda could scarcely speak because of doubt and cold is he dead then  nay they answered but like to die for he is beside himself and raves wildly  push on quoth gudruda push on lest it be too late  so they climbed the mountain on foot won the pass and came to that giddy point of rock where he must tread who would reach the platform that is before the cave now since she had hung by her hands over goldfoss gulf gudruda had feared to tread upon a height with nothing to hold to skallagrim went first then called to her to follow thrice she looked and turned away trembling for the place was awful and the fall bottomless then she spoke aloud to herself  eric did not fear to risk his life to save me when i hung over golden falls less then should i fear to risk mine to save him and she stepped boldly down upon the point but when she stood there over the giddy height shivers ran along her body and her mind grew dark she clutched at the rock gave one low cry and began to fall indeed she would have fallen and been lost had not skallagrim lying on his breast in the narrow hole stretched out his arms caught her by the cloak and kirtle and dragged her to him presently her senses came back  i am safe she gasped but by a very little methinks that here in this place i must live and die for i can never tread yonder rock again  thou shalt pass it safe enough lady with a rope round thee said skallagrim and led the way to the cave  gudruda entered forgetting all things in her love of eric a great fire of turf burned in the mouth of the cave to temper the bitter wind and frost and by its light gudruda saw her love through the smokereek he lay upon a bed of skins at the far end of the cave and his bright grey eyes were wild his wan face was white and now of a sudden it grew red with fever and then was white again he had thrown the sheepskins from his mighty chest the bones of which stood out grimly his long arms were thrust through the locks of his golden hair and on one side of his neck the hair clung to him and it was but a black mass  he raved loudly in his madness touch me not carles touch me not ye think me spent and weak but by thor if ye touch my hair i will loosen the knees of some gudruda alone shall shear my hair i have sworn and i will keep the oath that i once broke give me snow snow my throat burns heap snow on my head i bid you ye will not ye mock me thinking me weak where then is whitefirei have yet a deed to do who comes yonder is it a womans shape or is it but a smokewraith tis swanhild the fatherless who walks the waters begone swanhild thou witch thou hast worked evil enough upon me nay it is not swanhild it is elfrida lady here in england i may not stay in iceland i am at home yea yea things go crossly perchance in this garden we may speak again  now gudruda could bear his words no longer bur ran to him and knelt beside him  peace eric she whispered peace it is i thy love it is gudruda who am come to thee  he turned his head and looked upon her strangely  no no he said it is not gudruda the fair she will have little to do with outlaws and this is too rough a place for her to come to it is dark also and atli speaks in the darkness if thou art gudruda give me a sign why comest thou here and where is skallagrim ah that was a good fight       down among the ballast tumbling      ospakars shieldcarles were rolled  but he should never have slain the steersman the axe goes first and skallagrim follows after ha ha ay swanhild well mingle tears give me the cup why what is this thou art afire a glory glows about thee and from thee floats a scent like the scent of the iceland meads in may  eric eric cried gudruda i am come to shear thy hair as thou didst swear that i alone should do  now i know that thou art gudruda said the crazed man cut cut but let not those knaves touch my head lest i should slay them  then gudruda drew out her shears and without more ado shore off brighteyes golden locks it was no easy task for they were thick as a horses mane and glued to the wound yet when she had cut them she loosened the hair from the flesh with water which she heated upon the fire the wound was in a bad state and blue still eric never winced while she dragged the hair from it then she washed the sore clean and put sweet ointment on it and covered it with napkins  this done she gave eric broth and he drank then laying her hand upon his head she looked into his eyes and bade him sleep and presently he sleptwhich he had scarcely done for many daysslept like a little child  eric slept for a day and a night but at that same hour of the evening when he had fallen asleep gudruda watching him by the light of a taper that was set upon a rock saw him smile in his dreams presently he opened his eyes and stared at the fire which glowed in the mouth of the cave and the great shadows that fell upon the rocks  strange she heard him murmur it is very strange but i dreamed i slept and that gudruda the fair leaned over me as i slept where then is skallagrim perhaps i am dead and that is helas fire and he tried to lift himself upon his arm but fell back from faintness for he was very weak then gudruda took his hand and leaning over him spoke  hush eric she said that was no dream for i am here thou hast been sick to death eric but now if thou wilt rest things shall go well with thee  thou art here said eric turning his white face towards her do i still dream or how comest thou here to mosfell gudruda  i came through the snows eric to cut thy hair which clung to the festering wound for in thy madness thou wouldst not suffer anyone to touch it  thou camest through the snowsover the snowsto nurse me gudruda thou must love me much then and he was so weak that as he spoke the tears rolled down erics cheeks  then gudruda kissed him weeping also and laying her face by his bade him be at peace for she was there to watch him     xxviii  how swanhild won tidings of eric  now erics strength came back to him and his heart opened in the light of gudrudas eyes like a flower in the sunshine for all day long she sat at his side holding his hand and talking to him and they found much to say  but on the fifth day from the day of his awakening she spoke thus  eric now i must go back to middalhof thou art safe and it is not well that i should stay here  not yet gudruda he said leave me not yet  yes love i must leave thee the moon is bright the sky has cleared and the snow is hard with frost and fit for the hoofs of horses i must go before more storms come listen now in the second week of spring if all is well i will send thee a messenger with words of token then shalt thou come down secretly to middalhof and there eric we will be wed then on the next day we will sail for england in a tradingship that i shall get ready to seek our fortune there  it will be a good fortune if thou art by my side said eric so good that i doubt greatly if i may find it for i am eric the unlucky swanhild must yet be reckoned with gudruda yes thou art right thou must go hence gudruda and swiftly though it grieves me much to part with thee  then eric called skallagrim and bade him make things ready to ride down to middalhof with the lady gudruda  this skallagrim did swiftly and afterwards eric and gudruda kissed and parted and they were sad at heart to part  now on the fifth day after the going of gudruda skallagrim came back to mosfell somewhat cold and weary and he told eric who could now walk and grew strong again that he and jon had ridden with gudruda the fair to horsehead heights seeing no man and had left her there to go on with her thralls he had come back also seeing no one for the weather was too cold for the men of gizur to watch the fell in the snows    now gudruda came safely to middalhof having been eleven days gone and found that few had visited the house and that these had been told that she lay sick abed her secret had been well kept and though swanhild had no lack of spies many days went by before she learned that gudruda had gone up to mosfell to nurse eric  after this gudruda began to make ready for her flight from iceland she called in the moneys that she had out at interest and with them bought from a certain chapman a good tradingship which lay in its shed under the shelter of westman isles this ship she began to make ready for sea so soon as the heart of the winter was broken putting it about that she intended to send her on a trading voyage to scotland in the spring and also to give colour to this tale she bought many pelts and other goods such as chapmen deal in  thus the days passed onnot so badly for gudruda who strove to fill their emptiness in making ready for the full and happy time but for eric in his cave they were very heavy for he could find nothing to do except to sleep and eat and think of gudruda whom he might not see  for swanhild also sitting at coldback the days did not go well she was weary of the courting of gizur whom she played with as a cat plays with a rat and her heart was sick with love hate and jealousy for she well knew that gudruda and eric still clung to each other and found means of greeting if not of speech at that time she wished to kill eric if she could though she would rather kill gudruda if she dared still she could not come at eric for her men feared to try the narrow way of mosfell and when they met him in the open they fled before him  presently it came to her ears that gudruda made a ship ready to sail to scotland on a trading voyage and she was perplexed by this tale for she knew that gudruda had no love of trading and never thought of gain so she set spies to watch the ship still the slow days drew on and at length the air grew soft with spring and flowers showed through the snow  eric sat in his mountain nest waiting for tidings and watched the nesting eagles wheel about the cliffs at length news came for one morning as he rose skallagrim told him that a man wanted to speak with him he had come to the mountain in the darkness and had lain in a dell till the breaking of the light for now that the snows were melting the men of gizur and swanhild watched the ways  eric bade them bring the man to him when he saw him he knew that he was a thrall of gudrudas and welcomed him heartily  what tidings he asked  this lord said the thrall gudruda the fair bids me say that she is well and that the snows melt on the roof of middalhof  now this was the signal word that had been agreed upon between eric and gudruda that she should send him when all was ready  good said eric ride back to gudruda the fair and say that eric brighteyes is well but on hecla the snows melt not  by this answer he meant that he would be with her presently though the thrall could make nothing of it then skallagrim asked tidings of the man and learned that swanhild was still at middalhof and with her gizur and that they gave out that they wished to make an end of waiting and slay eric  first snare your bird then wring his neck laughed skallagrim  then eric did this among his men were some who he knew were not willing to sail from iceland and jon his thrall was of them for jon did not love the angry sea he bade these bide a while on mosfell and make fires nightly on the platform of rock which is in front of the cave that the spies of gizur and swanhild might be deceived by them and think that eric was still on the fell then when they heard that he had sailed they were to come down and hide themselves with friends till gizur and his following rode north but he told two of the men who would sail with him to make ready  that night before the moon rose eric said farewell to jon and the others who stayed on mosfell and rode away with skallagrim and the two who went with him they passed the plain of black sand in safety and so on to horsehead heights now at length as the afternoon drew on to evening from stonefells crest they saw the hall of middalhof before them and erics heart swelled in his breast yet they must wait till darkness fell before they dared enter the place lest they should be seen and notice of their coming should be carried to gizur and swanhild and this came into the mind of eric that of all the hours of his life that hour of waiting was the longest scarcely indeed could skallagrim hold him back from going down the mountain side he was so set on coming to gudruda whom he should wed that night  at length the darkness fell and they went on eric rode swiftly down the rough mountain path while skallagrim and the two men followed grumbling for they feared that their horses would fall at length they came to the place and riding into the yard eric sprang from his horse and strode to the womens door now gudruda stood in the porch listening and while he was yet some way off she heard the clang of brighteyens harness and the colour came and went upon her cheek then she turned and fled to the high seat of the hall and sat down there only two women were left in middalhof with her and some thralls who tended the kine and horses but these slept not in the hall but in an outhouse gudruda had sent the rest of her people down to the ship to help in the lading for it was given out that the vessel sailed on the morrow she had done this that there might be no talk of the coming of eric to middalhof  now brighteyes came to the porch and finding the door wide walked in but skallagrim and the men stayed without a while and tended the horses a fire burned upon the centre hearth in the hall and threw shadows on the panelling eric walked on by its light looking to left and right but seeing neither man nor woman then a great fear took him lest gudruda should be gone or perhaps slain of swanhild groas daughter and he trembled at the thought he stood by the fire and gudruda watching from the shadow of the high seat saw the dull light glow upon his golden helm and a sigh of joy broke from her lips eric heard the sigh and looked and as he looked a stick of pitchy driftwood fell into the fire and flared up fiercely then he saw there in the carved high seat robed all in bridal white sat gudruda the fair his love her golden hair flowed about her breast her white arms were stretched towards him and on her sweet face shone such a look of love as he had never seen  eric she whispered softly and the breath of her voice ran down the empty panelled hall that from all sides seemed to answer eric  slowly he drew near to her he saw nothing but the glory of gudrudas face and the light shining on gudrudas hair he heard nothing save the sighing of her breath he knew nothing except that before him sat his fair bride won after many years  now he had climbed the high seat and now wrapped in each others arms they sat and gazed into each others eyes and lo the air of the great hall rolled round them a sea of glory and sweet voices whispered in their ears now freya smiled upon them and led them through her gates of love and they were glad that they had been born  thus then they were wed    now the story tells that swanhild spoke with gizur ospakars son in the house at coldback  i tire of this slow play she said we have tarried here for many weeks and atlis blood yet cries out for vengeance and cries for vengeance the blood of black ospakar thy father and the blood of many another dead at great erics hand  i tire also said gizur and i am much needed in the north i say this to thee swanhild that hadst thou not so strictly laid it on me that eric must die ere thou weddest me i had flitted back to swinefell before now and there bided my time to bring brighteyes to his end  i will never wed thee gizur till eric is dead said swanhild fiercely  how shall we come at him then he answered we may not go up that mountain path for two men can hold it against all our strength and folk do not love to meet eric and skallagrim in a narrow way  the place has been badly watched said swanhild i am sure of this that eric has been down to middalhof and seen gudruda my halfsister she is shameless who still holds commune with him who slew her brother and my husband death should be her reward and i am minded to slay her because of the shame that she has brought upon our blood  that is a deed which thou wilt do alone then said gizur for i will have no hand in the murder of that fair maidno nor will any who live in iceland  swanhild glanced at him strangely hearken gizur she said gudruda makes a ship ready to sail with goods to scotland and bring a cargo thence before winter comes again now i find this strange for never before did i know gudruda turn her thoughts to trading i think that she has it in her mind to sail from iceland with this outlaw eric and seek a home over seas and that i will not bear  it may be said gizur and i should not be sorry to see the last of brighteyes for i think that more men will die at his hand before he stiffens in his barrow  thou art cowardlyhearted thou son of ospakar swanhild said thou sayest thou lovest me and wouldest win me to wife i tell thee that there is but one road to my arms and it leads over the corpse of eric now this is my counsel that we send the most of our men to watch that ship of gudrudas and when she lifts anchor to board her and search for she is already bound for sea also among the people here i have a carle who was born near hecla and he swears this to me that when he was a lad searching for an eagles eyrie he found a path by which mosfell might be climbed from the north and that in the end he came to a large flat place and looking over saw that platform where eric dwells with his thralls but he could not see the cave because of the overhanging brow of the rock now we will do this thou and i and the carle aloneno more for i do not wish that our search should be noised abroadtomorrow at the dawn we will ride away for mosfell and passing under hecla come round the mountain and see if this path may still be scaled for if so we will return with men and make an end of brighteyes  this plan pleased gizur and he said that it should be so  so very early on the following morning swanhild having sent many men to watch gudrudas ship rode away secretly with gizur and the thrall and before it was again dawn they were on the northern slopes of mosfell it was on this same night that eric went down from the mountain to wed gudruda  for a while the climbing was easy but at length they came to a great wall of rock a hundred fathoms high on which no fox might find a foothold nor anything that had not wings  here now is an end of our journey said gizur and i only pray this that eric may not ride round the mountain before we are down again for he did not know that brighteyes already rode hard for middalhof  not so said the thrall if only i can find the place by which some thirty summers ago i won yonder rift and through it the crest of the fell and he pointed to a narrow cleft in the face of the rock high above their heads that was clothed with grey moss  then he moved to the right and searched peering behind stones and birchbushes till presently he held up his hand and whistled they passed along the slope and found him standing by a little stream of water which welled from beneath a great rock  here is the place the man said  i see no place answered swanhild  still it is there lady and he climbed on to the rock drawing her after him at the back of it was a hole almost overgrown with moss here is the path he said again  then it is one that i have no mind to follow answered swanhild gizur go thou with the man and see if his tale is true i will stay here till ye come back  then the thrall let himself down into the hole and gizur went after him but swanhild sat there in the shadow of the rock her chin resting on her hand and waited presently as she sat she saw two men ride round the base of the fell and strike off to the right towards a turfbooth which stood the half of an hours ride away now swanhild was the keenestsighted of all women of her day in iceland and when she looked at these two men she knew one of them for jon erics thrall and she knew the horse alsoit was a white horse with black patches that jon had ridden for many years she watched them go till they came to the booth and it seemed to her that they left their horses and entered  swanhild waited upon the side of the fell for nearly two hours in all then hearing a noise above her she looked up and there black with dirt and wet with water was gizur and with him was the thrall  what luck gizur she asked  this swanhild eric may hold mosfell no more for we have found a way to bolt the fox  that is good news then said swanhild say on  yonder hole swanhild leads to the cleft above having been cut through the cliff by fire or perhaps by water now up that cleft a man may climb though hardly as by a difficult stair till he comes to the flat crest of the fell then crossing the crest on the further side perhaps six fathoms below him he sees that space of rock where is erics cave but he cannot see the cave itself because the brow of the cliff hangs over and so it is that if any come from the cave on to the space of rock it will be an easy matter to roll stones upon them from above and crush them  now when swanhild heard this she laughed aloud  eric shall mock us no more she said and his might can avail nothing against rocks rolled on him from above let us go back to coldback and summon men to make an end of brighteyes  so they went on down the mountain till they came to the place where they had hidden their horses then swanhild remembered jon and the other man whom she had seen riding to the booth and she told gizur of them  now she said we will snare these birds and perchance they will twitter tidings when we squeeze them  so they turned and rode for the booth and drawing near they saw two horses grazing without now they got off their horses and creeping up to the booth looked in through the door which was ajar and they saw this that one man sat on the ground with his back to the door eating stockfish while jon made bundles of fish and meal ready to tie on the horses for it was here that those of his quarter who loved eric brought food to be carried by his men to the cave on mosfell  now swanhild touched gizur on the arm pointing first to the man who sat eating the fish and then to the spear in gizurs hand gizur thought a while for he shrank from this deed  then swanhild whispered in his ear slay the man and seize the other i would learn tidings from him  so gizur cast the spear and it passed through the mans heart and he was dead at once then he and the thrall leapt into the booth and threw themselves on jon hurling him to the ground and holding swords over him now jon was a man of small heart and when he saw his plight and his fellow dead he was afraid and prayed for mercy  if i spare thee knave said swanhild thou shalt do this thou shalt lead me up mosfell to speak with eric  i may not do that lady groaned jon for eric is not on mosfell  where is he then asked swanhild  now jon saw that he had said an unlucky thing and answered  nay i know not last night he rode from mosfell with skallagrim lambstail  thou liest knave said swanhild speak or thou shalt be slain  slay on groaned jon glancing at the swords above him and shutting his eyes for though he feared much to die he had no will to make known erics plans  look not at the swords thou shalt not die so easily hearken speak and speak truly or thou shalt seek helas lap after this fashion and bending down she whispered in his ear then laughed aloud  now jon grew faint with fear his lips turned blue and his teeth chattered at the thought of how he should be made to die still he would say nothing  then swanhild spoke to gizur and the thrall and bade them bind him with a rope tear the garments from him and bring snow they did this and pushed the matter to the drawing of knives but when he saw the steel jon cried aloud that he would tell all  now thou takest good counsel said swanhild  then in his fear jon told how eric had gone down to middalhof to wed gudruda and thence to fly with her to england  now swanhild was mad with wrath for she had sooner died than that this should come about  let us away she said to gizur but first kill this man  nay said gizur i will not do that he has told his tidings let him go free  thou art chickenhearted said swanhild who after the fashion of witches had no mercy in her at the least he shall not go hence to warn eric and gudruda of our coming if thou wilt not kill him then bind him and leave him  so jon was bound and there in the booth he sat two days before anyone came to loose him  whither away said gizur to swanhild  to middalhof first swanhild answered     xxix  how went the bridal night  now eric and gudruda sat silent in the high seat of the hall at middalhof till they heard skallagrim enter by the womens door then they came down from the high seat and stood hand in hand by the fire on the hearth skallagrim greeted gudruda looking at her askance for skallagrim stood in fear of women alone  what counsel now lord said the baresark  tell us thy plans gudruda said eric for as yet no word had passed between them of what they should do  this is my plan eric she answered first that we eat then that thy men take horse and ride hence through the night to where the ship lies bearing word that we will be there at dawn when the tide serves and bidding the mate make everything ready for sailing but thou and i and skallagrim will stay here till tomorrow is three hours old and this because i have tidings that gizurs folk will search the ship tonight now when they search and do not find us they will go away then at the dawning thou and i and skallagrim will row on board the ship as she lies at anchor and slipping the cable put to sea before they know we are there and so bid farewell to swanhild and our woes  yet it is a risk for us to sleep here alone said eric  there is little danger said gudruda nearly all of gizurs men watch the ship and i have learned this from a spy that two days ago gizur swanhild and one thrall rode from coldback towards mosfell and they have not come back yet moreover the place is strong and thou and skallagrim are here to guard it  so be it then answered eric for indeed he had little thought left for anything except gudruda  after this the women came in and set meat on the board and all ate  now when they had eaten eric bade skallagrim fill a cup and bring it to him as he sat on the high seat with gudruda skallagrim did so and then looking deep into each others eyes eric brighteyes and gudruda the fair asmunds daughter drank the brides cup  there are few guests to grace our marriagefeast husband said gudruda  yet shall our vows hold true wife said eric  ay brighteyes she answered in life and in death now and for ever and they kissed  it is time for us to be going methinks growled skallagrim to those about him we are not wanted here  then the men who were to go on to the ship rose fetched their horses and rode away also they caught the horses of skallagrim eric and gudruda saddled them and slipping their bridles made them fast in a shed in the yard giving them hay to eat afterwards skallagrim barred the mens door and the womens door and going to gudruda asked where he should stay the night till it was time to ride for the sea  in the storechamber she answered for there is a shutter of which the latch has gone see that thou watch it well skallagrim though i think none will come to trouble thee  i know the place it shall go badly with the head that looks through yonder hole said skallagrim glancing at his axe  now gudruda forgot this that in the storechamber were casks of strong ale  then gudruda told him to wake them when the morrow was two hours old for eric had neither eyes nor words except for gudruda alone and skallagrim went  the women went also to their shut bed at the end of the hall leaving brighteyes and gudruda alone eric looked at her  where do i sleep tonight he asked  thou sleepest with me husband she answered soft for nothing except death shall come between us any more  now skallagrim went to the storeroom and sat down with his back against a cask his heart was heavy in him for he boded no good of this marriage moreover he was jealous skallagrim loved but one thing in the world truly and that was eric brighteyes his lord now he knew that henceforth he must take a second place and that for one thought which eric gave to him he would give ten to gudruda therefore skallagrim was very sad at heart  a pest upon the women he said to himself for from them comes all evil brighteyes owes his ill luck to swanhild and this fair wife of his and that is scarcely done with yet well well tis nature but would that we were safe at sea had i my will we had not slept here tonight but they are newly wed andwell tis nature better the bride loves to lie abed than to ride the cold wolds and seek the common deck  now as skallagrim grumbled fear gathered in his heart he knew not of what he began to think on trolls and goblins it was dark in the storeroom except for a little line of light that crept through the crack of the shutter at length he could bear the darkness and his thoughts no longer but rising threw the shutter wide and let the bright moonlight pour into the chamber whence he could see the hillside behind and watch the shadows of the clouds as they floated across it again skallagrim sat down against his cask and as he sat it moved and he heard the wash of ale inside it  that is a good sound said skallagrim and he turned and smelt at the cask aye and a good smell too we tasted little ale yonder on mosfell and we shall find less at sea again he looked at the cask there was a spigot in it and lo on the shelf stood horn cups  it surely is on draught he said and now it will stand till it goes sour tis a pity but i will not drink i fear aleale is another man no i will not drink and all the while his hand went up to the cups upon the shelf eric is better lain yonder in gudrudas chamber than i am here alone with evil thoughts and trolls he said why what fish was that we ate at supper my throat is cracked with thirst if there were water now id drink it but i see none well one cup to wish them joy there is no harm in a cup of ale and he drew the spigot from the cask and watched the brown drink flow into the cup then he lifted it to his lips and drank saying skoll skoll nor did he cease till the horn was drained this is wondrous good ale said skallagrim as he wiped his grizzled beard one more cup and evil thoughts shall cease to haunt me   health health  again he filled drank sat down and for a while was merry but presently the black thoughts came back into his mind he rose looked through the shutterhole to the hillside he could see nothing on it except the shadows of the clouds  trolls walk the winds tonight he said i feel them pulling at my beard one more cup to frighten them  he drank another draught of ale and grew merry then ale called for ale and skallagrim drained cup on cup singing as he drained till at last heavy sleep overcame him and he sank drunken on the ground there by the barrel while the brown ale trickled round him    now eric brighteyes and gudruda the fair slept side by side locked in each others arms presently gudruda was wide awake  rouse thee eric she said i have dreamed an evil dream  he awoke and kissed her  what then was thy dream sweet he said this is no hour for bad dreams  no hour for bad dreams truly husband yet dreams do not weigh the hour of their coming i dreamed this that i lay dead beside thee and thou knewest it not while swanhild looked at thee and mocked  an evil dream truly said eric but see thou art not dead thou hast thought too much on swanhild of late  now they slept once more till presently eric was wide awake  rouse thee gudruda he said i too have dreamed a dream and it is full of evil  what then was thy dream husband she asked  i dreamed that atli the earl whom i slew stood by the bed his face was white and white as snow was his beard and blood from his great wound ran down his byrnie eric brighteyes he said i am he whom thou didst slay and i come to tell thee this that before the moon is young again thou shalt lie stiff with hellshoes on thy feet thou art eric the unlucky take thy joy and say thy say to her who lies at thy side for wet and cold is the bed that waits thee and soon shall thy white lips be dumb then he was gone and lo in his place stood asmund thy father and he also spoke to me saying thou who dost lie in my bed and at my daughters side know this the words of atli are true but i add these to them ye shall die yet is death but the gate of life and love and rest and he was gone  now gudruda shivered with fear and crept closer to erics side  we are surely fey for the norns speak with the voices of atli and of asmund she said oh eric eric whither go we when we die will valhalla take thee being so mighty a man and must i away to helas halls where thou art not oh that would be death indeed say eric whither do we go  what said the voice of asmund answered brighteyes that death is but the gate of life and love and rest hearken gudruda my may odin does not reign over all the world for when i sat out yonder in england a certain holy man taught me of another goda god who loves not slaughter a god who died that men might live for ever in peace with those they love  how is this god named eric  they name him the white christ and there are many who cling to him  would that i knew this christ eric i am weary of death and blood and evil deeds such as are pleasing to our gods oh eric if i am taken from thee swear this to me that thou wilt slay no more save for thy lifes sake only  i swear that sweet he made answer for i too am weary of death and blood and desire peace most of all things the world is sad and sad have been our days yet it is well to have lived for through many heavy days we have wandered to this happy night  yea eric it is well to have lived though i think that death draws on now this is my counsel that we rise and that thou dost put on thy harness and summon skallagrim so that if evil comes thou mayst meet it armed surely i thought i heard a soundyonder in the hall  there is little use in that said eric for things will befall as they are fated we may do nothing of our own will i am sure of this and it is no good to struggle with the norns yet i will rise  so he kissed her and made ready to leave the bed when suddenly as he lingered a great heaviness seized him  gudruda he said i am pressed down with sleep  that i am also eric she said my eyes shut of themselves and i can scarcely stir my limbs ah eric we are fey indeed and this isdeath that comes  perchance he said speaking heavily  ericwake eric thou canst not move yet hearken to meah this weight of sleep thou lovest me ericis it not so  yea he answered  now and for ever thou lovest meand wilt cleave to me always wherever we go  surely sweet oh sweet farewell he said and his voice sounded like the voice of one who speaks across the water  farewell eric brighteyesmy lovemy love farewell she answered very slowly and together they sank into a sleep that was heavy as death    now gizur ospakars son and swanhild atlis widow rode fast and hard from mosfell giving no rest to their horses and with them rode that thrall who had showed the secret path to gizur they stayed a while on horsehead heights till the moon rose now one path led hence to the shore that is against the westmans where gudrudas ship lay bound then swanhild turned to the thrall her beautiful face was fierce and she had said few words all this while but in her heart raged a fire of hate and jealousy which shone through her blue eyes  listen she said to the thrall thou shalt ride hence to the bay where the ship of gudruda the fair lies at anchor thou knowest where our folk are in hiding thou shalt speak thus to them before it is dawn they must take boats and board gudrudas ship and search her and if they find eric the outlaw aboard they shall slay him if they may  that will be no easy task said the thrall  and if they find gudruda they shall keep her prisoner but if they find neither the one nor the other they shall do this they shall drive the crew ashore killing as few as may be and burn the ship  it is an ill deed thus to burn anothers ship said gizur  good or ill it shall be done answered swanhild fiercely thou art a lawman and well canst thou meet the suit moreover gudruda has wedded an outlaw and shall suffer for her sin now go and see thou tarry not or thy back shall pay the price  the man rode away swiftly then gizur turned to swanhild asking whither then go we  i have said to middalhof  that is into the wolfs den if eric and skallagrim are there he answered i have little chance against the two of them  nay nor against the one gizur why if erics right hand were hewn from him and he stood unarmed he would still slay thee with his left as swordless he slew ospakar thy father yet i shall find a way to come at him if he is there  then they rode on and gizurs heart was heavy for fear of eric and skallagrim the baresark so fiercely did they ride that within one hour after midnight they were at the stead of middalhof  we will leave the horses here in the field said swanhild  so they leaped to earth and tying the reins of the horses together left them to feed on the growing grass then they crept into the yard and listened presently there came a sound of horses stamping in the far corner of the yard they went thither and there they found a horse and two geldings saddled but with the bits slipped and on the horse was such a saddle as women use  eric brighteyes skallagrim lambstail and gudruda the fair whispered swanhild naming the horses and laughing evillythe birds are within now to snare them  were it not best to meet them by the ship asked gizur  nay thou fool if once eric and skallagrim are back to back and whitefire is aloft how many shall be dead before they are down thinkest thou we shall not find them sleeping twice  it is shameful to slay sleeping men said gizur  they are outlaws she answered hearken ospakars son thou sayest thou dost love me and wouldst wed me know this that if thou dost fail me now i will never look upon thy face again but will name thee niddering in all mens ears  now gizur loved swanhild much for she had thrown her glamour on him as once she did on atli and he thought of her day and night for there was this strange thing about swanhild that though she was a witch and wicked being both fair and gentle she could lead all men except eric to love her  but of men she loved eric alone  then gizur held his peace but swanhild spoke again  it will be of no use to try the doors for they are strong yet when i was a child before now i have passed in and out the house at night by the storeroom casement follow me gizur then she crept along the shadow of the wall for she knew it every stone till she came to the storeroom and lo the shutter stood open and through it the moonlight poured into the chamber swanhild lifted her head above the sill and looked then started back  hush she said skallagrim lies asleep within  pray the gods he wake not said gizur beneath his breath and turned to go but swanhild caught him by the arm then gently raised her head and looked again long and steadily presently she turned and laughed softly  things go well for us she said the sot lies drunk we have nothing to fear from him he lies drunk in a pool of ale  then gizur looked the moonlight poured into the little room and by it he saw the great shape of skallagrim his head was thrown back his mouth was wide he snored loudly in his drunken sleep and all about him ran the brown ale for the spigot of the cask lay upon the floor in his left hand was a horn cup but in his right he still grasped his axe  now we must enter said swanhild gizur hung back but she sprang upon the sill lightly as a fox and slid thence into the storeroom then gizur must follow and presently he stood beside her in the room and at their feet lay drunken skallagrim gizur looked first at his sword then on the baresark and lastly at swanhild  nay she whispered touch him not perchance he would cry outand we seek higher game he has that within him which will hold him fast for a while follow where i shall lead  she took his hand and gliding through the doorway passed along the passage till she came to the great hall swanhild could see well in the dark and moreover she knew the road presently they stood in the empty hall the fire had burnt down but two embers yet glowed upon the hearth like red and angry eyes  for a while swanhild stood still listening but there was nothing to hear then she drew near to the shut bed where gudruda slept and with her ear to the curtain listened once more gizur came with her and as he came his foot struck against a bench and stirred it now swanhild heard murmured words and the sound of kisses she started back and fury filled her heart gizur also heard the voice of eric saying i will rise then he would have fled but swanhild caught him by the arm  fear not she whispered they shall soon sleep sound  he felt her stretch out her arms and presently he saw this wonderful thing the eyes of swanhild glowing in the darkness as the embers glowed upon the hearth now they glowed brightly so brightly that he could see the outstretched arms and the hard white face beneath them and now they grew dim of a sudden to shine bright again and all the while she hissed words through her clenched teeth  thus she hissed fierce and low       gudruda sister mine hearken and sleep      by the bond of blood i bid thee sleep      by the strength that is in me i bid thee sleep      sleep sleep sound       eric brighteyes hearken and sleep      by the bond of sin i charge thee sleep      by the blood of atli i charge thee sleep      sleep sleep sound  then thrice she tossed her hands aloft saying       from love to sleep      from sleep to death      from death to hela      say lovers where shall ye kiss again  then the light went out of her eyes and she laughed low and ever as she whispered the spoken words of the two in the shut bed grew fainter and more faint till at length they died away and a silence fell upon the place  thou hast no cause to fear the sword of eric gizur she said nothing will wake him now till daylight comes  thou art awesome answered gizur for he shook with fear look not on me with those flaming eyes i pray thee  fear not she said the fire is out now to the work  what must we do then  thou must do this thou must enter and slay eric  that i can notthat i will not said gizur  she turned and looked at him and lo her eyes began to flame againupon his eyes they seemed to burn  thou wilt do as i bid thee she said with erics sword thou shalt slay eric else i will curse thee where thou art and bring such evil on thee as thou knowest not of  look not so swanhild he said lead oni come  now they creep into the shut chamber of gudruda it is so dark that they can see nothing and nothing can they hear except the heavy breathing of the sleepers  this is to be told that at this time swanhild had it in her mind to kill not eric but gudruda for thus she would smite the heart of brighteyes moreover she loved eric and while he lived she might yet win him but eric dead must be eric lost but on gudruda she would be bitterly avengedgudruda who for all her scheming had yet been a wife to eric  now they stand by the bed swanhild puts out her hand draws down the clothes and feels the breast of gudruda beneath for gudruda slept on the outside of the bed  then she searches by the head of the bed and finds whitefire which hung there and draws the sword  here lies eric on the outside she says to gizur and here is whitefire strike and strike home leaving whitefire in the wound  gizur takes the sword and lifts it he is sore at heart that he must do such a coward deed but the spell of swanhild is upon him and he may not flinch from it then a thought takes him and he also puts down his hand to feel it lights upon gudrudas golden hair that hangs about her breast and falls from the bed to the ground  here is womans hair he whispers  no swanhild answers it is erics hair the hair of eric is long as thou hast seen  now neither of them knows that gudruda cut erics locks when he lay sick on mosfell though swanhild knows well that it is not brighteyes whom she bids gizur slay  then gizur ospakars son lifts the sword and the faint starlight struggling into the chamber gathers and gleams upon the blade thrice he lifts it and thrice it draws it back then with an oath he strikesand drives it home with all his strength  from the bed beneath there comes one long sigh and a sound as of limbs trembling against the bedgear then all is still  it is done he says faintly  swanhild puts down her hand once more lo it is wet and warm then she bends herself and looks and behold the dead eyes of gudruda glare up into her eyes she can see them plainly but none know what she read there at the least it was something that she loved not for she reels back against the panelling then falls upon the floor  presently while gizur stands as one in a dream she rises saying i am avenged of the death of atli let us henceah let us hence swiftly give me thy hand gizur for i am faint  so gizur gives her his hand and they pass thence presently they stand in the storeroom and there lies skallagrim still plunged in his drunken sleep  must i do more murder asks gizur hoarsely  nay swanhild says i am sick with blood leave the knave  they pass out by the casement into the yard and so on till they find their horses  lift me gizur i can no more says swanhild  he lifts her to the saddle  whither away he asks  to coldback gizur and thence to cold death    thus did gudruda erics bride and asmunds daughter the fairest woman who ever lived in iceland die on her marriage night by the hand of gizur ospakars son and through the hate and witchcraft of swanhild the fatherless her halfsister     xxx  how the dawn came  the dawn broke over middalhof slowly the light gathered in the empty hall it crept slowly into the little chamber where eric slept and gudruda slept also with a deeper sleep  now the two women came from their chamber at the far end of the hall and drew near the hearth shivering for the air was cold they knelt by the fire blowing at the embers till the sticks they cast upon them crackled to a blaze  it seems that gudruda is not yet gone said one to the other i thought she should ride away with eric before the dawn  newly wed lie long abed laughed the other  i am glad to see the blessed light said the first woman for last night i dreamed that once again this hall ran red with blood as at the marriagefeast of ospakar  ah answered the other it will be well for the south when eric brighteyes and gudruda are gone over sea for their loves have brought much bloodshed upon the land  well indeed sighed the first had asmund the priest never found groa rans gift singing by the sea valhalla had not been so full today mindest thou the day he brought her here  i remember it well she answered though i was but a girl at the time still when i saw those dark eyes of hersjust such eyes as swanhildsi knew her for a witch as all finn women are it is an evil world my husband is dead by the sword dead are both my sons fighting for eric dead is unna thorods daughter asmund my lord is dead and dead is björn and now gudruda the fair whom i have rocked to sleep leaves us to go over sea i may not go with her for my daughters sake yet i almost wish that i too were dead  that will come soon enough said the other who was young and fair    now the witchsleep began to roll from erics heart though his eyes were not yet open but the talk of the women echoed in his ears and the words dead dead dead fell heavily on his slumbering sense at length he opened his eyes only to shut them again because of a bright gleam of light that ran up and down something at his side heavily he wondered what this might be that shone so keen and brightthat shone like a naked sword  now he looked again yes it was a sword which stood by him upon the bed and the golden hilt was like the hilt of whitefire he lifted up his hand to touch it thinking that he dreamed lo his hand and arm were red  then he remembered and the thought of gudruda flashed through his heart he sat up gazing down into the shadow at his side    presently the women at the fire heard a sound as of a great man falling to earth  what is that noise said one  eric leaping from his bed answered the other he has slept too long as we have also  as they spoke the curtain of the shut bed was pushed away and through it staggered eric in his nightgear and lo the left side of it was red his eyes were wide with horror his mouth was open and his face was white as ice  he stopped looking at them made as though to speak and could not then while they shrank from him in terror he turned and walking like a drunken man staggered from the hall down that passage which led to the storechamber the door stood wide the shutter was wide and on the floor soaked in the dregs of ale skallagrim yet lay snoring his axe in one hand and a cup in the other  eric looked and understood  awake drunkard he cried in so terrible a voice that the room shook awake and look upon thy work  skallagrim sat up yawning  forsooth my head swims he said give me ale i am thirsty  never wilt thou look on ale again skallagrim when thou hast seen that which i have to show said eric in the same dread voice  then skallagrim rose to his feet and gaped upon him  what means this lord is it time to ride and say why is thy shirt red with blood  follow me drunkard and look upon thy work eric said again  then skallagrim grew altogether sober and grasping his axe followed after brighteyes sore afraid of what he might see  they went down the passage past the high seat of the hall till they came to the curtain of the shut bed and after them followed the women eric seized the curtain in his hand rent it from its fastenings and cast it on the ground now the light flowed in and struck upon the bed it fell upon the bed it fell upon whitefires hilt and ran along the blade it gleamed on a womans snowy breast and golden hair and shone in her staring eyesa woman who lay stiff and cold upon the bed the great sword fixed within her heart  look upon thy work drunkard eric cried again while the women who peeped behind sent their long wail of woe echoing down the panelled hall  hearken said eric while thou didst lie wallowing in thy swines sleep foes crept across thy carcase and this is their handiworkyonder she lies who was my bridenow is gudruda the fair a deathwife who last night was my bride this is thy work drunkard and now what meed for thee  skallagrim looked then he spoke in a hoarse slow voice  what meed lord but onedeath  then with one hand he covered his eyes and with the other held out his axe to eric brighteyes  eric took the axe and while the women ran thence screaming he whirled it thrice about his head then he smote down towards the skull of skallagrim but as he smote it seemed to him that a voice whispered in his ear thy oathand he remembered that he had sworn to slay no more save for his own lifes sake  the mighty blow was falling and he might only do thisloose the axe before it clove skallagrim in twain he loosed and away the great axe flew it passed over the head of skallagrim and sped like light across the wide hall till it crashed through the panelling on the further side and buried itself to the haft in the wall beyond  it is not for me to kill thee drunkard go die in thy drink  then i will kill myself cried the baresark and rushing across the hall he tore the great axe from its bed  hold said eric perhaps there is yet a deed for thee to do then thou mayest die if it pleases thee  ay said skallagrim coming back perchance there is still a deed to do  and flinging down the axe skallagrim lambstail the baresark fell upon the floor and wept  but eric did not weep only he drew whitefire from the heart of gudruda and looked at it  thou art a strange sword whitefire he said who slayest both friend and foe shame on thee whitefire we swore our oath on thee whitefire and thou hast cut its chain now i am minded to shatter thee and as eric looked on the great blade lo it hummed strangely in answer  first must thou be the death of some thou sayest well maybe whitefire but never yet didst thou drink so sweet a life as hers who now lies dead nor ever shalt again  then he sheathed the sword but neither then nor afterwards did he wipe the blood of gudruda from its blade  last night amarryingtoday aburying said eric and he called to the women to bring spades then having clothed himself he went to the centre of the hall and brushing away the sand broke the hard clayflooring dealing great blows on it with an axe now skallagrim seeing his purpose came to him and took one of the spades and together they laboured in silence till they had dug a grave a fathom deep  here said eric here in thine own hall where thou wast born and lived gudruda the fair thou shalt sleep at the last and of middalhof i say this that none shall live there henceforth it shall be haunted and accursed till the rafters rot and the walls fall in making thy barrow gudruda  now this indeed came to pass for none have lived in middalhof since the days of gudruda the fair asmunds daughter it has been ruined these many years and now it is but a pile of stones    when the grave was dug eric washed himself and ate some food then he went in to where gudruda lay dead and bade the women make her ready for burial this they did when she was washed and clad in a clean white robe eric came to her and with his own hand bound the hellshoes on her feet and closed her eyes  it was just then that a man came who said that the people of gizur and of swanhild had burned gudrudas ship driving the crew ashore  it is well said eric we need the ship no more now hath she whom it should bear wings with which to fly then he went in and sat down on the bed by the body of gudruda while skallagrim crouched on the ground without tearing at his beard and muttering for the fierce heart of skallagrim was broken because of that evil which his drunkenness had brought about  all day eric sat thus looking on his dead loves face till the hour came round when he and gudruda had drunk the bridecup then he rose and kissed dead gudruda on the lips saying  i did not look to part with thee thus sweet it is sad that thou shouldst have gone and left me here natheless i shall soon follow on thy path  then he called aloud  art sober drunkard  skallagrim came and stood before him saying nothing  take thou the feet of her whom thou didst bring to death and i will take her head  so they lifted up gudruda and bore her to the grave then eric stood near the grave and taking dead gudruda in his arms looked upon her face by the light of the fire and of the candles that were set about  he looked thrice then sang aloud       long ago when swept the snowblast      close we clung and plighted troth      many a year through storm and swordsong      sore i strove to win thee sweet      but last night i held thee fairest      lockd a wife in lovers arms      now gudruda in thy deathrest      sleep thou soft till eric come       hence i go to wreak thy murder      hissing fire of flaming stead      groan of spearcarles wail of women      soon shall startle through the night      then on mosfell kirtlewearer      eric waits the face of death      freed from weary life and sorrow      soon well kiss in helas halls  then he laid her in the grave and having shrouded a sheet over her they filled it in together hiding gudruda the fair from the sight of men for ever  afterwards eric armed himself and this skallagrim did also then he strode from the hall and skallagrim followed him in the yard those horses were still tied that should have carried them to the ship and on one was the saddle of gudruda she had ridden on this horse for many years and loved it much for it would follow her like a dog eric looked at him then said aloud  gudruda may need thee where she is blackmane for so the horse was named at the least none shall ride thee more and he snatched the axe from the hand of skallagrim and slew the horse at a blow  then they rode away heading for coldback the night was wild and windy and the sky dark with scudding clouds through which the moon peeped out at times eric looked up then spoke to skallagrim  a good night for burning drunkard  ay lord the flames will fly briskly answered skallagrim  how many thinkest thou walked over thee drunkard when thou didst lie yonder in the ale  i know not groaned skallagrim but i found this in the soft earth without the print of a mans and a womans feet and this on the hill side the track of two horses ridden hard  gizur and swanhild drunkard said eric swanhild cast us into deep sleep by witchcraft and gizur dealt the blow better for him that he had never been born than that he has lived to deal that cowards blow    then they rode on and when midnight was a little while gone they came to the stead at coldback now this house was roofed with turves and the windows were barred so that none could pass through them also in the yard were faggots of birch and a stack of hay  eric and skallagrim tied their horses in a dell that is to the north of the stead and crept up to the house all was still but a fire burnt in the hall and looking through a crack eric could see many men sleeping about it then he made signs to skallagrim and together very silently they fetched hay and faggots piling them against the north door of the house for the wind blew from the north now eric spoke to skallagrim bidding him stand axe in hand by the south door and slay those who came out when the reek began to smart them but he went himself to fire the pile  when brighteyes had made all things ready for the burning it came into his mind that perhaps gizur and swanhild were not in the house but he would not hold his hand for this for he was mad with grief and rage so once more he prepared for the deed when again he heard a voice in his earthe voice of gudruda and it seemed to say  thine oath eric remember thine oath  then he turned and the rage went out of his heart  let them seek me on mosfell he said i will not slay them secretly and by reek the innocent and the guilty together and he strode round the house to where skallagrim stood at the south door axe aloft and watching  does the fire burn lord i see no smoke whispered skallagrim  nay i have made none i will shed no more blood except to save my life i leave vengeance to the norns  now skallagrim thought that brighteyes was mad but he dared say nothing so they went to their horses and when they found them eric rode back to the house presently they drew near and eric told skallagrim to stay where he was and riding on to the house smote heavy blows upon the door just as skallagrim once had smitten before eric went up to mosfell  now swanhild lay in her shut bed but she could not sleep because of what she saw in the eyes of gudruda little may she ever sleep again for when she shuts her eyes once more she sees that which was written in the dead eyes of gudruda so as she lay she heard the blows upon the door and sprang frightened from her bed now there was tumult in the hall for every man rose to his feet in fear searching for his weapons again the loud knocks came  it is the ghost of eric cried one for gizur had given out that eric was dead at his hand in fair fight  open said gizur and they opened and there a little way from the door sat brighteyes on a horse great and shadowy to see and behind him was skallagrim the baresark  it is the ghost of eric they cried again  i am no ghost said brighteyes i am no ghost ye men of swanhild tell me is gizur the son of ospakar among you  gizur is here said a voice but he swore he slew thee last night  then he lied quoth eric gizur did not slay mehe murdered gudruda the fair as she lay asleep at my side see and he drew whitefire from its scabbard and held it in the rays of the moon that now shone out between the cloud rifts whitefire is red with gudrudas bloodgudruda slaughtered in her sleep by gizurs coward hand  now men murmured for this seemed to them the most shameful of all deeds but gizur hearing shrank back aghast  listen again said eric i was minded but now to burn you all as ye sleptay the firing is piled against the door still i held my hand for i have sworn to slay no more except to save my life now i ride hence to mosfell thither let gizur come gizur the murderer and swanhild the witch and with them all who will there i will give them greeting and wipe away the blood of gudruda from whitefires blade  fear not eric cried swanhild i will come and there thou mayst kill me if thou canst  against thee swanhild said eric i lift no hand do thy worst i leave thee to thy fate and the vengeance of the norns i am no womanslayer but to gizur the murderer i say come  then he turned and went and skallagrim went with him  up men and cut eric down cried gizur seeking to cover his shame  but no man stirred     xxxi  how eric sent away his men from mosfell  now eric and skallagrim came to mosfell in safety and during all that ride brighteyes spoke no word he rode in silence and in silence skallagrim rode after him the heart of skallagrim was broken because of the sorrow which his drunkenness had brought about and the heart of eric was buried in gudrudas grave  on mosfell eric found four of his own men two of whom had been among those that the people of gizur and swanhild had driven from gudrudas ship before they fired her for no fight had been made on the ship there also he found jon who had been loosed from his bands in the booth by one who heard his cries as he rode past now when jon saw brighteyes he told him all and fell at erics feet and wept because he had betrayed him in his fear  but eric spoke no angry word to him stooping down he raised him saying thou wast never overstout of heart jon and thou art scarcely to be blamed because thou didst speak rather than die in torment though perhaps some had chosen so to die and not to speak now i am a luckless man and all things happen as they are fated and the words of atli come true as was to be looked for the norns against whom none may stand did but work their will through thy mouth jon so grieve no more for that which cannot be undone  then he turned away but jon wept long and loudly  that night eric slept well and dreamed no dreams but on the morrow he woke at dawn and clothed himself and ate then he called his men together and with them skallagrim they came and stood before him and eric drawing whitefire leaned upon it and spoke  hearken mates he said i know this that my hours are short and death draws on my years have been few and evil and i cannot read the purpose of my life she whom i loved has been slain by the witchcraft of swanhild and the coward hand of gizur the murderer and i go to seek her where she waits i am very glad to go for now i have no more joy in life being but a luckless man it is an ill world friends and all the ways are red with blood i have shed much blood though but one life haunts me now at the last and that is the life of atli the earl for he was no match for my might and he is dead because of my sin with my own blood i will wash away the blood of atli and then i seek another place leaving nothing but a tale to be told in the ingle when fall the winter snows for to this end we all come at the last and it matters little if it find us at midday or at nightfall we live in sorrow we die in pain and darkness for this is the curse that the gods have laid upon men and each must taste it in his season but i have sworn that no more men shall die for me i will fight the last great fight alone for i know this i shall not easily be overcome and with my fallen foes i will tread on bifrost bridge therefore farewell when the bones of eric brighteyes lie in their barrow or are picked by ravens on the mountain side gizur will not trouble to hunt out those who clung to him if indeed gizur shall live to tell the tale nor need ye fear the hate of swanhild for she aims her spears at me alone go therefore and when i am dead do not forget me and do not seek to avenge me for death the avenger of all will find them also  now erics men heard and groaned aloud saying that they would die with him for they loved eric one and all only skallagrim said nothing  then brighteyes spoke again hear me comrades if ye will not go my blood will be on your heads for i will ride out alone and meet the men of gizur in the plain and fall there fighting  then one by one they crept away to seek their horses in the dell and each man as he went came to eric and kissed his hand then passed thence weeping jon was the last to go except skallagrim only and he was so moved that he could not speak at all  it was this jon who in after years when he was grown very old wandered from stead to stead telling the deeds of eric brighteyes and always finding a welcome because of his tale till at length as he journeyed he was overtaken by a snowstorm and buried in a drift for jon who lacked much had this gift he had a skalds tongue men have always held that it was to the honour of jon that he told the tale thus hiding nothing seeing that some of it is against himself    now when all had gone eric looked at skallagrim who still stood near him axe in hand  wherefore goest thou not drunkard he said surely thou wilt find ale and mead in the vales or oversea here there is none hasten i would be alone  now the great body of skallagrim shook with grief and shame and the red blood poured up beneath his dark sin then he spoke in a thick voice  i did not think to live to hear such words from the lips of eric brighteyes they are well earned yet it is unmanly of thee lord thus to taunt one who loves thee i would sooner die as swanhild said yonder thrall should die than live to listen to such words i have sinned against thee indeed and because of my sin my heart is broken hast thou then never sinned that thou wouldst tear it living from my breast as eagles tear a foundered horse think on thine own sins eric and pity mine taunt me thus once more or bid me go once more and i will go indeed i will go thuson the edge of yonder gulf thou didst overcome me by thy naked might and there i swore fealty to thee eric brighteyes many a year have we wandered side by side and standing back to back have struck many a blow i am minded to do this to stand by thee in the last great fight that draws on and to die there with thee i have loved no other man save thee and i am too old to seek new lords yet if still thou biddest me i will go thus where i swore my oath to thee there i will end it for i will lay me down on the brink of yonder gulf as once i lay when thy hand was at my throat and call out that thou art no more my lord and i am no more thy thrall then i will roll into the depths beneath and by this death of shame thou shalt be freed of me eric brighteyes  eric looked at the great manhe looked long and sadly then he spoke  skallagrim lambstail thou hast a true heart i too have sinned and now i put away thy sin although gudruda is dead through thee and i must die because of thee stay by me if thou wilt and let us fall together  then skallagrim came to eric and kneeling before him took his hands and kissed them  now i am once more a man he said and i know this we two shall die such a great death that it will be well to have lived to die it and he arose and shouted       a hai a hai i see foes pass in pride      a hai a hai valkyries ride the wind      hear the song of the sword      whitefire is aloftaloft      bare is the axe of the baresark      croak ye nesting ravens      flap your wings ye eagles      for bright is mosfells cave with blood      lap lap thou grey wolf      laugh aloud odin       laugh till shake the golden doors      heroes feet are set on bifrost      open ye hundred gates      a hai a hai red runs the fray      a hai a hai valkyries ride the wind  then skallagrim turned and went to clean his harness and the golden helm of eric    now at coldback gizur spoke with swanhild  thou hast brought the greatest shame upon me he said for thou hast caused me to slay a sleeping woman knowest thou that my own men will scarcely speak with me i have come to this evil pass through love of thee that i have slain a sleeping woman  it was not my fault that thou didst kill gudruda answered swanhild surely i thought it was eric whom thy sword pierced i have not sought thy love gizur and i say this to thee go if thou wilt and leave me alone  now gizur looked at her and was minded to go but as swanhild knew well she held him too fast in the net of her witcheries  i would go if i might go answered gizur but i am bound to thee for good or evil since it is fated that i shall wed thee  thou wilt never wed me while eric lives said swanhild  now she spoke thus truthfully and by chance as it were not as driving gizur on to slay ericfor now that gudruda was dead she was in two minds as to this matter since if she might she still desired to take eric to herselfbut meaning that while eric lived she would wed no other man but gizur took it otherwise  eric shall certainly die if i may bring it about he answered and went to speak with his men  now all were gathered in the yard at coldback and that was a great company but their looks were heavy because of the shame that gizur ospakars son had brought upon them by the murder of gudruda in her sleep  hearken comrades said gizur great shame is come upon me because of a deed that i have done unwittingly for i aimed at the eagle eric and i have slain the swan gudruda  then a certain old viking in the company named ketel whom gizur had hired for the slaying of eric spoke  man or woman it is a niddering deed to kill folk in their sleep gizur it is murder and no less and small luck can be hoped for from the stroke  now gizur felt that his people looked on him askance and heavily and knew that it would be hard to show them that he was driven to this deed against his will and by the witchcraft of swanhild so as was his nature he turned to guile for shelter like a fox to his hole and spoke to them with the tongue of a lawman for gizur had great skill in speech  that tale was not all true which eric brighteyes told you he said he was mad with grief and moreover it seems that he slept and only woke to find gudruda dead it came about thus i stood with the lady swanhild and was about to call aloud on eric to arm himself and come forth and meet me face to face  then lord methinks thou hadst never met another foe quoth the viking ketel who had spoken first  when of a sudden went on gizur taking no note of ketels words one clothed in white sprang from the bed and rushed on me then i thinking that it was eric lifted sword not to smite but to ward him away but the linenwearer met the sword and fell down dead then i fled fearing lest men should wake and trap us and that is all the tale it was no fault of mine if gudruda died upon the sword  thus he spoke but still men looked doubtfully upon him for his eye was the eye of a liarand eric as they knew did not lie  it is hard to find the truth between lawmans brain and tongue said the old viking ketel eric is no lawman but a true man and he sang another song i would slay eric indeed for between him and me there is a bloodfeud since my brother died at his hand when with whitefire for a crook brighteyes drove armed men like sheep down the hall of middalhofay and swordless slew ospakar yet i say that eric is a true man and whether or no thou art true gizur the lawman that thou knowest bestthou and swanhild the fatherless groas daughter if thou didst slay gudruda as thou tellest say how come gudrudas blood on whitefires blade how did it chance gizur that thou heldest whitefire in thy hand and not thine own sword now i tell thee this either thou shalt go up against eric and clear thyself by blows or i leave thee and methinks there are others among this company who will do the same for we have no wish to be partners with murderers and their wickedness  ay a good word said many who stood by let gizur go up with us to mosfell and there stand face to face with eric and clear himself by blows  i ask no more said gizur we will ride tonight  but much more shalt thou get liar quoth ketel to himself for that hour when thou lookest once again on whitefire shall be thy last    so gizur and swanhild made ready to go up against eric that day they rode away with a great company a hundred and one in all and this was their plan they sent six men with that thrall who had shown them the secret path bidding him guide them to the mountaintop then when they were come thither and heard the shouts of those who sought to gain the platform from the south they were to watch till eric and his folk came out from the cave and shoot them with arrows from above or crush them with stones but if perchance eric left the platform and came to meet his foes in the narrow pass then they must let themselves down with ropes from the height above and creeping after him round the rock must smite him in the back moreover in secret gizur promised a great reward of ten hundreds in silver to him who should kill eric for he did not long to stand face to face with him alone swanhild also in secret made promise of reward to those who should bring eric to her bound but living and she bade them do thisto bear him down with shields and tie him with ropes    so they rode away the seven who should climb the mountain from behind going first and on the morrow morning they crossed the sand and came to mosfell     xxxii  how eric and skallagrim grew fey  now the night came down upon mosfell and of all nights this was the strangest the air was quiet and heavy yet no rain fell it was so silent moreover that did a stone slip upon the mountain side or a horse neigh far off on the plains the sound of it crept up the fell and was echoed from the crags  eric and skallagrim sat together on the open space of rock that is before the cave and great heaviness and fear came into their hearts so that they had no desire to sleep  methinks the night is ghostridden said eric and i am fey for i grow cold and it seems to me that one strokes my hair  it is ghostridden lord answered skallagrim trolls are abroad and the godkind gather to see eric die  for a while they sat in silence then suddenly the mountain heaved up gently beneath them thrice it seemed to heave like a womans breast and left them frightened  now the dwarffolk come from their caves quoth skallagrim and great deeds may be looked for since they are not drawn to the upper earth by a little thing  then once more they sat silent and thick darkness came down upon the mountain hiding the stars  look said eric of a sudden and he pointed to hecla  skallagrim looked and lo the snowy dome of hecla was aglow with a rosy flame like the light of dawn  winter lights said lambstail shuddering  death lights answered eric look again  they looked and behold in the rosy glow there sat three giant forms of fire and their shapes were the shapes of women before them was a loom of blackness that stretched from earth to sky and they wove at it with threads of flame they were splendid and terrible to see their hair streamed behind them like meteor flames their eyes shone like lightning and their breasts gleamed like the polished bucklers of the gods they wove fiercely at the loom of blackness and as they wove they sang the voice of the one was as the wind whistling through the pines the voice of the other was as the sound of rain hissing on deep waters and the voice of the third was as the moan of the sea they wove fearfully and they sang loudly but what they sang might not be known now the web grew and the woof grew and a picture came upon the looma great picture written in fire  behold it was the semblance of a stormawakened sea and a giant ship fled before the galea dragon of war and in the ship were piled the corses of men and on these lay another corse as one lies upon a bed they looked and the face of the corse grew bright it was the face of eric and his head rested upon the dead heart of skallagrim  clinging to each other eric and skallagrim saw the sight of fear that was written on the loom of the norns they saw it for a breath then with a laugh like the wail of wolves the shapes of fire sprang up and rent the web asunder then the first passed upward to the sky the second southward towards middalhof but the third swept over mosfell so that the brightness of her flaming form shone on the rock where they sat by the cave and the lightning of her eyes was mirrored in the byrnie of skallagrim and on erics golden helm she swept past pointing downwards as she went and lo she was gone and once more darkness and silence lay upon the earth  now this sight was seen of jon the thrall also and he told it in his story of the deeds of eric for jon lay hid in a secret place on mosfell waiting for tidings of what came to pass    for a while eric and skallagrim clung to each other then skallagrim spoke  we have seen the valkyries he said  nay answered eric we have seen the nornswho are come to warn us of our doom we shall die tomorrow  at the least said skallagrim we shall not die alone we had a goodly bed on yonder goblin ship and all of our own slaying methinks it is not so ill to die thus lord  not so ill said eric and yet i am weary of blood and war of glory and of my strength now i desire rest alone light firei can bear this darkness no longer the marrow freezes in my bones  fire can be seen of foes said skallagrim  it matters little now said eric we are feyfolk  so skallagrim lighted the fire piling much brushwood and dry turf over it till presently it burnt up brightly throwing light on all the space of rock and heavy shadows against the cliff behind they sat thus a while in the light of the flames looking towards the deep gulf till suddenly there came a sound as of one who climbed the gulf  who comes now climbing where no man may pass cried eric seizing whitefire and springing to his feet presently he sank down again with white face and staring eyes and pointed at the edge of the cliff and as he pointed the neck of a man rose in the shadow above the brink and the hands of a man grasped the rock but there was no head on the neck the shape of the headless man drew itself slowly over the brink it walked slowly into the light towards the fire then sat itself down in the glare of the flames which shrank away from it as from a draught of wind pale with terror eric and skallagrim looked on the headless thing and knew it it was the wraith of the baresark that brighteyes had slainthe first of all the men he slew  it is my mate eric whom thou didst kill years ago and whose severed head spoke with thee gasped skallagrim  it is he sure enough said eric but where may his head be  perchance the head will come answered skallagrim he is an evil sight to see surely say lord shall i fall upon him though i love not the task  nay skallagrim let him bide he does but come to warn us of our fate moreover ghosts can only be laid in one wayby the hewing off of the head and the laying of it at the thigh but this one has no head to hew  now as he spoke the headless man turned his neck as though to look once more there came the sound of feet and lo men marched in from the darkness on either side eric and skallagrim looked up and knew them they were those of ospakars folk whom they had slain on horsehead heights all their wounds were on them and in front of them marched mord ospakars son the ghosts gazed upon eric and skallagrim with cold dead eyes then they too sat down by the fire now once more there came the sound of feet and from every side men poured in who had died at the hands of eric and skallagrim first came those who fell on that ship of ospakars which eric sank by westmans then the crew of the raven who had perished upon the seapath even as the man died so did each ghost come some had been drowned and their harness dripped water some had died of spearthrusts and the spears were yet fixed in their breasts some had fallen beneath the flash of whitefire and the weight of the axe of skallagrim and there they sat looking on their wide wounds  then came more and more there were those whom eric and skallagrim had slain upon the seas those who had fallen before them in the english wars and all that company who had been drowned in the waters of the pentland firth when the witchcraft of swanhild had brought the gudruda to her wreck  now here we have a goodly crew said eric at length is it done thinkest thou or will mosfell send forth more dead  as he spoke the wraith of a greyheaded man drew near he had but one arm for the other was hewn from him and the byrnie on his left side was red with blood  welcome earl atli cried eric sit thou over against me who tomorrow shall be with thee  the ghost of the earl seated itself and looked on eric with sad eyes but it spake never a word  then came another company and at their head stalked black ospakar  these be they who died at middalhof cried eric welcome ospakar that marriagefeast of thine went ill  now methinks we are overdone with trolls said skallagrim but see here come more  as he spoke hall of lithdale came and with him koll the halfwitted and others and so it went on till all the men whom eric and skallagrim had slain or who had died because of them or at their side were gathered in deep ranks before them  now it is surely done said eric  there is yet a space said skallagrim pointing to the other side of the fire and hell holds many dead  even as the words left his lips there came a noise of the galloping of horses hoofs and one clad in white rode up it was a woman for her golden hair flowed down about her white arms then she slid from the horse and stood in the light of the fire and behold her white robe was red with blood a great sword was set in her heart and the face and eyes were the face and eyes of gudruda the fair and the horse she rode was blackmane that eric had slain  now when brighteyes saw her he gave a great cry  greeting sweet he said i am no longer afraid since thou comest to bear me company thou art dear to my sightay even in yon deathsheet greeting sweet my may i laid thee stiff and cold in the earth at middalhof but like a loving wife thou hast burst thy bonds and art come to save me from the grip of trolls thou art welcome gudruda asmunds daughter come wife sit thou at my side  the ghost of gudruda spake no word she walked through the fire towards him and the flames went out beneath her feet to burn up again when she had passed then she sat down over against eric and looked on him with wide and tender eyes thrice he stretched out his arms to clasp her but thrice their strength left them and they fell back to his side it was as though they struck a wall of ice and were numbed by the bitter cold  look here are more groaned skallagrim  then eric looked and lo the empty space to the left of the fire was filled with shadowy shapes like shapes of mist amongst them was gizur ospakars son and many a man of his company there too was swanhild groas daughter and a toad nestled in her breast she looked with wide eyes upon the eyes of dead gudrudas ghost that seemed not to see her and a stare of fear was set on her lovely face nor was this all for there before that shadowy throng stood two great shapes clad in their harness and one was the shape of eric and one the shape of skallagrim  thus being yet alive did these two look upon their own wraiths  then eric and skallagrim cried out aloud and their brains swam and their senses left them so that they swooned    when they opened their eyes and life came back to them the fire was dead and it was day nor was there any sign of that company which had been gathered on the rock before them  skallagrim quoth eric it seems that i have dreamed a strange dreama most strange dream of norns and trolls  tell me thy dream lord said skallagrim  so eric told all the vision and the baresark listened in silence  it was no dream lord said skallagrim for i myself have seen the same things now this is in my mind that yonder sun is the last that we shall see for we have beheld the deathshadows all those who were gathered here last night wait to welcome us on bifrost bridge and the mistshapes who sat there amongst whom our wraiths were numbered are the shapes of those who shall die in the great fight today for days are fled and we are sped  i would not have it otherwise said eric we have been greatly honoured of the gods and of the ghostkind that are around us and above us now let us make ready to die as becomes men who have never turned back to blow for the end of the story should fit the beginning and of us there is a tale to tell  a good word lord answered skallagrim i have struck few strokes to be shamed of and i do not fear to tread bifrost bridge in thy company now we will wash ourselves and eat so that our strength may be whole in us  so they washed themselves with water and ate merrily and for the first time for many months eric was merry for now that the end was at hand his heart grew light within him and when they had put the desire of food from them and buckled on their harness they looked out from their mountain height and saw a cloud of dust rise in the desert plain of black sand beneath and through it the sheen of spears  here come those of whom if there is truth in visions some few shall never go back again said eric now what counsel hast thou skallagrim where shall we meet them here on the space of rock or yonder in the deep way of the cliff  my counsel is that we meet them here said skallagrim and cut them down one by one as they try to turn the rock they can scarcely come at us to slay us here so long as our arms have strength to smite  yet they will come though i know not how answered eric for i am sure of this that our death lies before us here then we will meet them  now the cloud of dust drew nearer and they saw that this was a great company which came up against them at the foot of the fell the men stayed and rested a while and it was not till afternoon that they began to climb the mountain  night will be at hand before the game is played said skallagrim see they climb slowly saving their strength and yonder among them is swanhild in a purple cloak  ay night will be at hand skallagrima last long night a hundred to twothe odds are heavy yet some shall wish them heavier now let us bind on our helms    meanwhile gizur and his folk crept up the paths from below now that thrall who knew the secret way had gone on with six chosen men and already they climbed the watercourse and drew near to the flat crest of the fell but eric and skallagrim knew nothing of this so they sat down by the turning place that is over the gulf and waited singing of the taking of the raven and of the slaying in the stead at middalhof and telling tales of deeds that they had done and the thrall and his six men climbed on till at length they gained the crest of the fell and looking over saw eric and skallagrim beneath them  the birds are in the snare and hark they sing said the thrall now bring rocks and be silent  but gizur and his people having learned that eric and skallagrim were alone upon the mountain pushed on  we have not much to fear from two men said gizur  that we shall learn presently answered swanhild i tell thee this that i saw strange sights last night though i did not sleep i may sleep little now that gudruda is dead for that which i saw in her eyes haunts me  then they went on and the face of gizur grew white with fear     xxxiii  how eric and skallagrim fought their last great fight  now the thrall and those with him on the crest of the fell heard the murmur of the company of gizur and swanhild as they won the mountain side though they could not see them because of the rocks  now it is time to begin and knock these birds from their perch said the thrall for that is an awkward corner for our folk to turn with whitefire and the axe of skallagrim waiting on the farther side  so he balanced a great stone as heavy as three men could lift on the brow of the rock and aimed it then he pushed and let it go it smote the platform beneath with a crash two fathoms behind the spot where eric and skallagrim sat then it flew into the air and just as brighteyes turned at the sound it struck the wings of his helm and bursting the straps tore the golden helmpiece from his head and carried it away into the gulf beneath  skallagrim looked up and saw what had come about  they have gained the crest of the fell he cried now we must fly into the cave or down the narrow way and hold it  down the narrow way then said eric and while rocks spears and arrows rushed between and around them they stepped on to the stone and won the path beyond it was clear for gizurs folk had not yet come and they ran nearly to the mouth of it where there was a bend in the way and stood there side by side  thou wast at deaths door then lord said skallagrim  headpiece is not head answered eric but i wonder how they won the crest of the fell i have never heard tell of any path by which it might be gained  there they are at the least said skallagrim now this is my will that thou shouldst take my helm i am baresark and put little trust in harness but rather in my axe and strength alone  i will not do that said eric listen i hear them come  presently the tumult of voices and the tramp of feet grew clearer and after a while gizur swanhild and the men of their following turned the corner of the narrow way and lo there before themay within three paces of themstood eric and skallagrim shoulder to shoulder and the light poured down upon them from above  they were terrible to see and the light shone brightly on erics golden hair and whitefires flashing blade and the shadows lay dark on the black helm of skallagrim and in the fierce black eyes beneath  back surged gizur and those with him skallagrim would have sprung upon them but eric caught him by the arm saying a truce to thy baresark ways rush not and move not let us stand here till they overwhelm us  now those behind gizur cried out to know what ailed them that they pushed back  only this said gizur that eric brighteyes and skallagrim lambstail stand like two grey wolves and hold the narrow way  now we shall have fighting worth the telling of quoth ketel the viking on gizur ospakars son and cut them down  hold said swanhild i will speak with eric first and together with gizur and ketel she passed round the corner of the path and came face to face with those who stood at bay there  now yield eric she cried foes are behind and before thee thou art trapped and hast little chance of life yield thee i say with thy black wolfhound so perchance thou mayest find mercy even at the hands of her whose husband thou didst wrong and slay  it is not my way to yield lady answered eric and still less perchance is it the way of skallagrim least of all will we yield to thee who after working many ills didst throw me in a witchsleep and to him who slew the wife sleeping at my side hearken swanhild here we stand awaiting death nor will we take mercy from thy hand for know this we shall not die alone last night as we sat on mosfell we saw the norns weave our web of fate upon their loom of darkness they sat on helcas dome and wove their pictures in living flame then rent the web and flew upward and southward and westward crying our doom to sky and earth and sea last night as we sat by the fire on mosfell all the company of the dead were gathered round usay and all the company of those who shall die today thou wast there gizur the murderer ospakars son thou wast there swanhild the witch groas daughter thou wast there ketel viking with many another man and there were we two also valkyries have kissed us and death draws near therefore talk no more but come and make an end greeting gizur thou womanmurderer draw nigh draw nigh out sword up shield and on thou son of ospakar  swanhild spoke no more and gizur had no word  on gizur eric calls thee quoth ketel viking but gizur slunk back not forward  then ketel grew mad with rage and shame he called to the men and they drew near as many as might and looked doubtfully at the pair who stood before them like rocks upon a plain eric laughed aloud and skallagrim gnawed the edge of his shield eric laughed aloud and the sound of his laughter ran up the rocks  we are but two he cried and ye are many is there never a pair among you will stand face to face with a baresark and a helmless man and he tossed whitefire high into the air and caught it by the hilt  then ketel and another man of his following sprang forward with an oath and their axes thundered loud on the shields of eric and of skallagrim but whitefire flickered up and the axe of skallagrim crashed and at once their knees were loosened so that they sank down dead  more men more men cried eric these were brave but their might was little more men for the grey wolfs maw  then swanhild lashed the folk with bitter words and two of them sprang on they sprang on like hounds upon a deer at bay and they rolled back as gored hounds roll from the deers horns  more men more men cried eric here lie but four and a hundred press behind now he shall win great honour who lays brighteyes low and brings down the helm of skallagrim  again two came on but they found no luck for presently they also were down upon the bodies of those who went before now none could be found to come up against the pair for they fought like baldur and thor and none could touch them and no harness might withstand the weight of their blows that shore through shield and helm and byrnie deep to the bone beneath then eric and skallagrim leaned upon their weapons and mocked their foes while these cursed and tore their beards with rage and shame  now it is to be told that when the thrall and those with him saw eric and skallagrim had escaped their rocks and spears they took counsel and the end of it was that they slid down a rope to the platform that is under the crest of the fell thence though they could see nothing they could hear the clang of blows and the shouts of those who fought and fellay and the mocking of eric and of skallagrim  now it goes thus said the thrall who was a cunning man eric and skallagrim hold the narrow way and none can stand against them this then is my rede that we turn the rock and take them in the back  his fellows thought this a good saying and one by one they stood upon the little rock and won the narrow way they crept along this till they were near to eric and skallagrim now swanhild looking up saw them and started skallagrim noted this and glanced over his shoulder and that not too soon for as he looked the thrall lifted sword to smite the head of eric  with a shout of back to back the baresark swung round and ere ever the sword might fall his axe was buried deep in the thralls breast  now we must cut our path through them said skallagrim and if it may be win the space that is before the cave keep them off in front and i will mind these mannikins  now gizurs folk seeing what had come about took heart and fell upon eric with a rush and those who were with the dead thrall rushed at skallagrim and there began such a fight as has not been known in iceland but the way was so narrow that scarce more than one man could come to each of them at a time and so fierce and true were the blows of eric and skallagrim that of those who came on few went back down they fell and where they fell they died and for every man who died eric and skallagrim won a pace towards the point of rock whitefire flamed so swift and swept so wide that it seemed to swanhild watching as though three swords were aloft at once and the axe of skallagrim thundered down like the axe of a woodman against a tree and those groaned on whom it fell as groans a falling tree now the shields of these twain were hewn through and through and cast away and their blood ran from many wounds still their life was whole in them and they plied axe and sword with both hands and ever men fell and ever fighting hard they drew nearer to the point of rock  now it was won and now all the company that came with the thrall from over the mountain brow were dead or sorely wounded at the hands of black skallagrim lo one springs on eric and gizur creeps behind him whitefire leaps to meet the man and does not leap in vain but gizur smites a coward blow at erics uncovered head and wounds him sorely so that he falls to his knee  now i am smitten to the death skallagrim cries eric win the rock and leave me yet he rises from his knee  then skallagrim turns red with blood and terrible to see  tis but a scratch climb thou the rocki follow he says and screaming like a horse with weapon aloft he leaps alone upon the foe they break before the baresark rush they break they fallthey are cloven by baresark axe and trodden of baresark feet they roll back leaving the way clearsave for the dead then skallagrim follows brighteyes to the rock  now eric wipes the gore from his eyes and sees then slowly and with a reeling brain he steps down upon the giddy point he goes near to falling yet does not fall for now he lies upon the open space and creeps on hands and knees to the rockwall that is by the cave and sits resting his back against it whitefire on his knee  before he is there skallagrim staggers to his side with a rush  now we have time to breathe lord he gasps see here is water and he takes a pitcher that stands by and gives eric to drink from the pool then drinks himself and pours the rest of the water on erics wound then new life comes to them and they both stand on their feet and win back their breath  we have not done so badly says skallagrim and we are still a match for one or two see they come say where shall we meet them lord  here quoth eric i cannot stand well upon my legs without the help of the rock now i am all unmeet for fight  yet shall this last stand of thine be sung of says skallagrim  now finding none to stay them the men of gizur climb one by one upon the rock and win the space that is beyond swanhild goes first of all because she knows well that eric will not harm her and after her come gizur and the others but many do not come for they will lift sword no more  now swanhild draws near and looks on eric and mocks him in the fierceness of her heart and the rage of her wolflove  now she says now are brighteyes dim eyes what weepest thou eric  ay swanhild he answered i weep tears of blood for those whom thou hast brought to doom  she draws nearer and speaks low to him hearken eric yield thee thou hast done enough for honour and thou art not smitten to the death of yonder cowardly hound yield and i will nurse thee back to health and bear thee hence and together we will forget our hates and woes  not twice may a man lie in a witchs bed said eric and my troth is plighted to other than thee swanhild  she is dead says swanhild  yes she is dead swanhild and i go to seek her amongst the deadi go to seek her and to find her  but the face of swanhild grew fierce as the winter sea  thou hast put me away for the last time eric now thou shalt die as i have promised thee and as i promised gudruda the fair  so shall i the more quickly find gudruda and lose sight of thy evil face swanhild the harlot swanhild the murderess swanhild the witch for i know this thou shalt not escapethy doom draws on alsoand haunted and accursed shalt thou be for ever fare thee well swanhild we shall meet no more and the hour comes when thou shalt grieve that thou wast ever born  now swanhild turned and called to the folk come cut down these outlaw rogues and make an end come cut them down for night draws on  then once more the men of gizur closed in upon them eric smote thrice and thrice the blow went home then he could smite no more for his strength was spent with toil and wounds and he sank upon the ground for a while skallagrim stood over him like a shebear oer her young and held the mob at bay then gizur watching cast a spear at eric it entered his side through a cleft in his byrnie and pierced him deep  i am sped skallagrim lambstail cried eric in a loud voice and all men drew back to see giant brighteyes die now his head fell against the rock and his eyes closed  then skallagrim stooping drew out the spear and kissed eric on the forehead  farewell eric brighteyes he said iceland shall never see such another man and few have died so great a death tarry a while lord tarry a whilei comei come  then crying eric eric the baresark fit took him and once more and for the last time skallagrim rushed screaming upon the foe and once more they rolled to earth before him to and fro he rushed dealing great blows and ever as he went they stabbed and cut and thrust at his side and back for they dared not stand before him till he bled from a hundred wounds now having slain three more men and wounded two others skallagrim might no more he stood a moment swaying to and fro then let his axe drop threw his arms high above him and with one loud cry of eric fell as a rock fallsdead upon the dead  but eric was not yet gone he opened his eyes and saw the death of skallagrim and smiled  well ended lambstail he said in a faint voice  lo cried gizur yon outlawed hound still lives now i will do a needful task and make an end of him and so shall ospakars sword come back to ospakars son  thou art wondrous brave now that the bear lies dying said swanhild  now it seemed that eric heard the words for suddenly his might came back to him and he staggered to his knees and thence to his feet then as folk fall from him with all his strength he whirls whitefire round his head till it shines like a wheel of fire thy service is done and thou art clean of gudrudas bloodgo back to those who forged thee brighteyes cries and casts whitefire from him towards the gulf  away speeds the great blade flashing like lightning through the rays of the setting sun and behold as men watch it is gonegone in midair  since that day no such sword as whitefire has been known in iceland  now slay thou me gizur says the dying eric  gizur comes on with little eagerness and eric cries aloud  swordless i slew thy fatherswordless shieldless and wounded to the death i will yet slay thee gizur the murderer and with a loud cry he staggered towards him  gizur smites him with his sword but eric does not stay and while men wait and wonder brighteyes sweeps him into his great armsay sweeps him up lifts him from the ground and reels on  eric reels on to the brink of the gulf gizur sees his purpose struggles and shrieks aloud but the strength of the dying eric is more than the strength of gizur now brighteyes stands on the dizzy edge and the light of the passing sun flames about his head and now bearing gizur with him he hurls himself out into the gulf and lo the sun sinks  men stand wondering but swanhild cries aloud  nobly done eric nobly done so i would have seen thee die who of all men wast the first    this then was the end of eric brighteyes the unlucky who of all warriors that have lived in iceland was the mightiest the goodliest and the best beloved of women and of those who clung to him  now on the morrow swanhild caused the body of eric to be searched for in the cleft and there they found it floating in water and with the dead gizur yet clasped in its beargrip then she cleansed it and clothed it again in its rent armour and bound on the hellshoes and it was carried on horses to the seaside and with it were borne the bodies of skallagrim lambstail the baresark erics thrall and of all those men whom they had slain in the last great fight on mosfell that is now named ericsfell  then swanhild drew her long dragon of war in which she had come from orkneys from its shed over against westman isles and in the centre of the ship she piled the bodies of the slain in the shape of a bed and lashed them fast and on this bed she laid the corpse of eric brighteyes and the breast of black skallagrim the baresark was his pillow and the breast of gizur ospakars son was his footrest  then she caused the sails to be hoisted and went alone aboard the long ship the rails of which were hung with the shields of the dead men  and when at evening the breeze freshened to a gale that blew from the land she cut the cable with her own hand and the ship leapt forward like a thing alive and rushed out in the red light of the sunset towards the open sea  now ever the gale freshened and folk standing on westman heights saw the long ship plunge past dipping her prow beneath the waves and sending the water in a rain of spray over the living swanhild over the dead eric and those he lay upon  and by the head of eric brighteyes her hair streaming on the wind stood swanhild the witch clad in her purple cloak and with rings of gold about her throat and arms she stood by erics head swaying with the rush of the ship and singing so sweet and wild a song that men grew weak who heard it  now as the people watched two white swans came down from the clouds and sped on wide wings side by side over the vessels mast  the ship rushed on through the glow of sunset into the gathering night on sped the ship but still swanhild sung and still the swans flew over her  the gale grew fierce and fiercer yet the darkness gathered deep upon the raging sea  now that ship was seen no more and the deathsong of swanhild as she passed to doom was never heard again  for swans and ship and swanhild and dead eric and his dead foes were lost in the wind and the night  but far out on the sea a great flame of fire leapt up towards the sky    now this is the tale of eric brighteyes thorgrimurs son of gudruda the fair asmunds daughter of swanhild the fatherless atlis wife and of ounound named skallagrim lambstail the baresark erics thrall all of whom lived and died before thangbrand wilibalds son preached the white christ in iceland
