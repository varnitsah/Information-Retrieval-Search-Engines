77255537	richard dares venture   or  striking out for himself   by edward stratemeyer author of oliver brights search to alaska for gold the last cruise of the spitfire shorthand tom etc      preface to the revised edition   richard dares venture although a complete story in itself forms the initial volume of the bound to succeed series a line of books written primarily for boys but which it would seem not only girls but also persons of mature age have taken up with more or less interest  the story relates the adventures of a country youth who comes to new york to seek his fortune just as many country lads have done in the past and many are likely to do in the future richard feels that there is nothing for him to do in the sleepy village in which he resides and that he must strike out for himself and he does so with no cash capital to speak of but with plenty of true american backbone and with the firm conviction that if he does his duty as he finds it and watches his chances he will be sure to make a place for himself  richard finds life in the metropolis no bed of roses and when he at length gains a footing he is confronted by many a snare and pitfall but thanks to the christian teachings of the best of mothers and his natural uprightness of character he escapes these evils and gives a practical teaching of the biblical admonition of returning evil with good  when the first edition of this work was placed on the market several years ago the author had hoped that it would receive some notice but he was hardly prepared for the warm reception which readers and critics alike all over the country accorded it for this enthusiasm he is profoundly grateful the street scenes in new york have been particularly commended the author would add that these are not fictitious but are

chapter i  a serious accident   it is high time mother that i found something to do father seems to be worse and im afraid before long he wont be able to go to work every day ever since i finished schooling ive felt like a fish out of water  and stowing away the remainder of the slice of bread he was eating richard dare leaned back in his chair and gazed inquiringly across the breakfasttable to where his mother stood ready to clear away the dishes when he had finished his meal  im sure you have been busy enough richard responded mrs dare fondly i am well satisfied with the way you have planted the garden and no carpenter could have made a neater job of the front fence you havent wasted your time  oh i dont mean that fixing up around the house is well enough but i mean some regular worksome position where i could bring home my weekly wages i know it would be a big help all around it takes a heap of money to run a family of three girls and a growing boy  mrs dare smiled sadly  what do you know about that she asked we all have enough to eat and drink and our own roof over our heads  yes but i know that my dear mother sits up sewing sometimes long after we have gone to bed so that our clothing may be cared for and i know that she hasnt had a new dress in a year though she deserves a dozen added richard heartily  i havent much use for a new dressi go out so little said his mother but what kind of work do you wish to get  oh anything that pays im not particular so long as its honest  im afraid you will find but few chances in mossvale times are dull hereever since the hat factory moved away i guess the stores have all the help they want you might get a place on one of the farms  i dont think any farmer would pay much besides my board replied the boy ive got another plan he continued with some hesitation  and what is that  to try my luck in new york there ought to be room enough for me in such a big city  new york exclaimed mrs dare in astonishment why you have never been there in your whole life  i know it but ive read the papers pretty well and i wouldnt be afraid but what i could get along first rate  mrs dare shook her head doubtfully  it is almost impossible to get a footing there she declared when we were first married your father struggled hard enough both there and in brooklyn but somehow he didnt seem to make it go and so we moved here everything rushes in the city and unless you have some one to speak for you no one will give you a chance  i would take the first thing that came to hand no matter what it paid and then watch for something better  it might be that you would have luck said mrs dare reflectively i dont like to discourage you still  you wouldnt like to see me go away and then fail is that it  yes failures at the start of life often influence all the after years suppose you have a talk with your father about this  i thought id speak to you first mother i wanted to know if you would be willing to let me go  if your father thinks it best i shall be satisfied richard of course i will miss you  i know that mother returned richard rising but then i could come home once in a while the city is not so very far away  the plan of striking out had been in richard dares mind for several months the country school at mossvale had closed for the season early in the springso as to allow the farmer boys to do their work and richard was satisfied that he had about learned all that mr parsons the pedagogue was able or willing to teach and saw no good reason for his returning in the fall he would have liked to continue his studies but there was only one other institute of learning in the neighborhooda boarding academy where the rates for tuition were high and to this he well knew his parents could not afford to send him  mr dare was by trade a house painter and decorator when a young man he had served three years in the army during the great rebellion from which he had come away with a bullet in his shoulder and a strong tendency towards chronic rheumatism shortly after he had married and now twenty years later his family included four children of which richard age sixteen was next to the oldest  mr dare was a steady sober man who disliked excitement and the quiet plodding along in mossvale just suited him he was only a journeyman and it is doubtful if his ambition had ever risen beyond his present station by frugality he and his wife had saved enough to buy a half acre of land in this pretty new jersey village on which they had erected a neat cottage and here apparently john dare was content to spend the remainder of his life  but richard dare partook of but little of his fathers retiring disposition he was a bright active boy with a clear heart and brain and he longed to get at some work where energy would be the road to success his comprehension was rapid and beneath an outwardly calm spirit lurked the fire of a youth well trained to grapple with noble purposes and bring them to a successful issue  richards desire to go to the metropolis was a natural one there was nothing in quiet mossvale to entice any one with push to remain there the entire population of the district did not number three hundred people and the only business places were three general stores a blacksmith shop and a crossroads hotel  a number of years previous mr dixon maillard a rich man from newark had endeavored to boom the village by starting a hat factory there then trying to make his employees buy houses and lots from him on the installment plan but this scheme had fallen flat and the factory plant was removed to a more promising locality  the dare cottage stood some little distance from the village center as mrs dare had said richard had the garden in excellent condition not only the larger portion devoted to the vegetables and small fruits but also the front part in which were planted a great variety of flowers in which his mother took keen delight  is father coming home to dinner today asked richard a little later on as he entered the kitchen with a pail of water which nancy the oldest of his three sisters had asked him to draw from the well  i guess not replied the girl his rheumatism hurt him so much he said he might not be able to walk from dr melvins new house  ma put up his dinner put in grace the second oldest  then he wont be back returned richard somewhat disappointed for he had been calculating on broaching the subject of going to new york to his father after the midday meal  he said his shoulder hurt him awfully last night added grace i heard him tell ma he could almost feel the bullet worrying him in the flesh  its mighty queer he doesnt get a pension said nancy im sure he deserves one didnt he ever apply dick i read in a philadelphia paper the other day about a man getting sixteen dollars a month allowed and a whole lot of back paymore than two or three thousand dollars  two or three thousand dollars cried grace oh nancy its a fortune  but its true every word  i believe father has tried replied richard but it seems that he must have witnesses to prove his identity and all that  and cant he get them asked grace eagerly  i believe not all his old comrades are either dead or scattered and he hasnt a single address  did he ever hunt for any of them  i think he wrote two or three letters but thats all you know how father is  i just guess i wouldnt let it rest there declared grace diving into the bread batter with a vim id advertise in the papers and turn the whole country upside down before id give up  well father looks at it as a kind of charity anyway explained richard and he doesnt care much to accept it so long as he is able to work  yes but dick if hes entitled to it by law dont you think he ought to take it  he has certainly lost many a days work on account of his failing nancy he ought to get something for that  then why dont you speak to him about it asked grace hell listen to you quicker than he will to any of us  perhaps i will maybe he will give me a list of those who knew him in the army and then i can start a grand search as you suggested but ive got a little plan of my own to carry out first and i want you girls to help me  what plan asked nancy and grace ceased her breadmaking to listen to what her brother might have to say  im thinking of going to new york and i  new york both girls ejaculated they would have been no more astonished had he said paris or pekin why dick what put that idea into your head continued nancy  take me along if you go added grace  nobody but myself put it into my head nan replied richard and i wont be able to take anybody along grace  going to make your fortune queried the younger girl  youll get lost put in the other  nonsense catch dick getting lost cried grace indignantly didnt he bring us all safe through bakers woods last fall when we were nutting  bakers woods isnt new york city replied her elder sister hundreds of streets and millions of people hed have to keep his eyes wide open and his wits about him  and that is just what i would do broke in richard you dont suppose id stand around like a gawk staring at people  but is it for fortune repeated grace freeing her hands from the dough and coming up close  yes its for fortune if thats what you call it said richard bluntly im tired of mossvale and im going to strike out that is if i can get consent ive spoken to mother about it already and if  a heavy knock on the back stoop caused richard to stop speaking going to the door he was confronted by nicholas boswell a young farmer who lived a short distance down the road  hello nick exclaimed richard that you come in  nicholas boswell was pale and his face showed a troubled expression for several seconds ho seemed hardly able to speak  no thankee dick he said at last i come to tell you that and here his eyes roved over to nancy and grace and he stopped short  what asked the boy you aint sick are you he continued noticing the unusual pallor on the others countenance  oh no i aint sick replied boswell i never get sick i was never sick in my lifecepting when i was a babby but ithat istheres a mansome men wants to see you he faltered  to see me where  they are down the road aways ill show you  what do they want  come onnever mind asking questions closing one eye and bobbing his head as if he did not wish the girls to hear more  all right returned richard and closing the door he followed boswell up the lane to the road  accidents is bad things dick began the young farmer as they drew away from the house but they will happen you knowthey will happen  what do you mean asked the boy quickly whos had an accident  well you see a man with the rheumatism aint so sure of his footing as is one who aint got no such affliction  and my father began richard his heart jumping suddenly into his throat  your father as a painter often climbed long limbery ladders as he hadnt oughter continued boswell soberly  is heis he dead gasped the boy standing stockstill  no oh no exclaimed the young farmer but he had an awful fall and hes pretty bad i thought id tell you first cause it might shock your mother  where is he  the men is bringing him up the road here they come now youd better go back and kinder break the news to the folks im terribly grittyas gritty as any manbut i cant do that  richard did not hear the last words trembling from head to foot he sped up the road to meet four men carrying a rude stretcher between them and slowly approaching     chapter ii  bitter moments   the serious accident that had befallen mr dare was in reality a very simple one the ladder that he had been ascending was covered with early morning dew and when near the top his foot had slipped and being unable on account of his rheumatism to catch a quick hold he had fallen on his side to the ground no one had seen his fall and he lay unconscious for full ten minutes before a fellow workman who had been busy on the other side of the building discovered him and summoned assistance  the five or six men that were soon gathered did what they could to bring him to consciousness but without success one of them ran off to hunt up the doctor and then the others took a door that had not yet been hung in the new house and fastening a heavy strip at either end for handles covered it with their coats and placed the wounded man upon it  none of the men cared to face mrs dare with such painful news and it was only after repeated urging that nicholas boswell had been induced to go on ahead  my father my poor father was all richard could say as he gazed at the motionless form upon the litter  illustration my father my poor father  reckon hes hurt pretty bad said sandy stone a mason who had been the first to be called to the scene of the accident taint outside so much as its in wait till we get him home  for richard was bending over his father and trying his best to do something that would help the unconscious sufferer  did you send for the doctor  yes sent for dr melvin first thing replied one of the others but we dont know where he is  i think he is over at old mrs browns returned the boy i saw him walking that way a while ago  ill go and see put in nicholas boswell meanwhile youd better go and tell your mother  my mother what will she say and nancy and grace and baby madge oh its dreadful broke out richard im sure none of them can stand it  ill send my wife over soon as i can said sandy stone shes as good as a doctor and can quiet your mother too be a brave boy dick and go and tell her it will be easier coming from you than it would from any of us  so richard returned to the house his mother was dusting in the parlor and going straight to her he said  mother the men are bringing father home he slipped on the ladder and got hurt pretty badly you had better get a bed ready for him and some bandages because hes got a cut or two on his head and then as the mothers breast began to heave dont worry mother it may not be near as bad as we believe it is  it was over in a moment and when the men arrived mrs dare was as calm as any of them  in the cottage one of the bedrooms was situated upon the lower floor and to this mr dare was carried and laid down as tenderly as these men were able to do such an unaccustomed task he drew a deep breath when his head touched the pillow and an instant later opened his eyes  where am i were his first words  home john replied his wife you had a fail and  yes i remember oh how my side hurts  lie still the doctor will soon be here would you like a drink  yes  mrs dare gave him some water but he only drank a little and then began to cough  its inside he gasped my ribs are broken i think  richard comforted his sisters as best he could it was not long before dr melvin arrived and his coming inspired the little household with hope  is it very serious asked richard after an examination into his fathers condition had been made  i cannot tell yet two of his ribs are dislocated but i dare not touch them until i find out the extent of his other internal injuries replied the doctor he must keep quiet and every ten minutes give him a tablespoonful of this mixture  but though dr melvin gave these directions it was fully an hour before he left and then he promised to return late in the afternoon  the whole family were gathered in the sick chamber baby madge three years old sitting on richards knee nancy and grace had been frightened into almost absolute silence and mrs dare addressed herself to her husband with an occasional remark to the boy as to what might further help the sufferer  dont trouble yourself jane said mr dare feebly youve done enough already and then the pain caused him to faint away  when dr melvin came back they all left the room but mrs dare a thorough examination was made that lasted nearly an hour by the grave look on his face when the doctor called him richard knew that he was to receive no encouraging news  your father is worse than i expected were the doctors words he has ruptured a blood vessel and that is bad  will he die do you think faltered the boy  while there is life there is hope he responded evasively after richard had repeated his question  then you are afraid it will be fatal cried the boy terrorstricken oh dr melvin cant we do something  the doctor shook his head  i have done all i can such things are beyond our reach and mere medicine does no good  have you told my mother and my sisters  i have told your mother she expected it from the start replied the doctor you had better go in now your father wishes to speak to you he added  richard entered the front chamber at once as he did so his mother passed out her eyes filled with tears  did he tell you she asked  yes he replied without being able to utter another word  oh richard i never never thought that such a thing would happen where are nan and the rest  in the kitchen  i must tell them it is hard on the poor girls  and hard on you said dick and me too he added with a sigh  the curtains of the windows had been drawn and it was quite dark in the room richard approached the bed and grasped his fathers hand  is it you richard questioned the sufferer  yes father  im glad youve come i want to talk to you  but it may hurt you to talk too much said the boy feelingly  never mind it will all be over soon replied mr dare with a heavy cough i suppose the doctor has told you he said he would  the boy nodded his head  it is gods will and we must bow to his judgment continued the injured man but i want to talk to you about what to do when i am gone  oh father  hush i feel that i am sinking even faster than dr melvin thinks listen then to what i have to say  i am listening  when im gone richard you will have to take my place your mother is strong and can do much but she is a woman and she as well as your sisters will need your help  they shall have all that i can possibly give them i will work and do all i can  i know you will richard you have always been a good boy i am sorry that i cannot leave you all better off than im doing  never mind father we will get along  i suppose i might have done so if id had the courage to strike out continued mr dare with a sigh i always calculated to do something for myself but thats all over now but you take after your mother the same as your sister grace and if you make the right start i feel you will succeed  i shall remember what you say  do so but remember also to be always sober industrious and considerate of those around you be true to yourself and to every one with whom you have dealings you may not get along so fast but people will respect you more and your success will be ten times sweeter than it would have been had you risen by pushing others down  i shall try to deserve success even if i dont rise very high father  thats right mr dare paused for a moment im sorry that i cannot leave you more of a capital upon which to start in life  never mind i have a common school education and my health what more can a boy wish  it is as much as i had upon which to start but i might have left you more i deserve a pension as a soldier  you never pushed your claim did you  yes once but i never told any of you for fear of raising false hopes i did apply and it was all straight but at the last moment the department decided that i must have another witness to prove my identity and this i could not get  you had one witness then  yes a man named crawford who was in our regiment he was appointed an officer on the same day i was shot but as he was appointed after the occurrence they held that his single witnessing was not enough and so i had to hunt for another  and you never found the other  no though i hunted high and low some who saw the affair must be still living but i have not their addresses nor do i know how to find them  did you ever advertise in the papers  yes i spent fifty dollars in the columns of the leading dailies but without success  you have all the papers in the case  they are in the trunk upstairs if you can ever push the claim do sofor the others sake as well as your own  i will father  how much it will be worth i do not know but it may be several thousands of dollars and that along with this house which is free and clear may suffice to keep the family many a year  at this juncture a violent fit of coughing seized mr dare and by the time he had recovered his wife and the three girls entered     chapter iii  preparing to start   two days later the blinds of the little cottage were closed and crape hung in solemn black upon the front door the neighbors and indeed the whole population of the village came and went continuallysome few with genuine grief and sympathy and the many others to satisfy a morbid curiosity regarding the man whose life had so suddenly ended  it was a dismal enough time for the inmates richard did all a brave boy can do to comfort his mother and sisters but he himself needed consolation fully as much as any of them he had thought much of his father and the cold form lying in the draped coffin in the parlor sent a chill through his heart that would have an effect in all after life  at last the funeral was over and the last of the neighbors had gone away it was nearly sunset and the entire family had gathered in the little kitchen to partake of a cup of tea and to talk over the situation mrs dare sat in a rockingchair beside the table her face plainly showing her intense grief and near her on a low stool sat richard  well mother i suppose i will have to do something very soon now began the boy it wont do for me to remain idle when there is no money coming in  mrs dare sighed  i cant think of money matters yet richard she replied shaking her head sadly it is all so sudden so unexpected i cannot realize our terrible loss  there isnt a chance for any one in mossvale put in nancy she herself had been secretly wondering what they were going to do for support  so i told mother some time ago responded richard the few places here are all filled  thought you were going to try new york said grace who was serving the tea  so i was but the boy did not finish but glanced over to where his mother sat  i could hardly bear to have you go away said mrs dare it would be so lonelyyour father and you both out of the house i would rather have you home even if we had a good deal less to live upon  tomorrow i will go out and see what mossvale has to offer returned richard in our circumstances it would not be right for me to waste any time  do as you think best was mrs dares reply you are old enough to think and act for yourself  but richard did not wait for the next day before he began his hunt that evening he called upon dr melvin to obtain some medicine for his mother and after this portion of his errand was over he broached the subject of securing a position  you will find it a hard matter said the doctor kindly unless you wish to go on one of the farms but they are poor pay even if you can stand the labor which i doubt  i would not go on a farm unless i could find nothing else replied the boy could you give me a place he asked  dr melvin nodded his head reflectively  i might take you in as an office assistant he replied it would be a good chance to learn medicine but there would not be much to do and the pay would be necessarily small  then i couldnt afford to accept it was richards prompt reply it is kind in you to make the offer but i have got to earn enough to support the family  i suppose so well i wish you success i have known you for a number of years and if you need a recommendation i will give it to you gladly  thank you doctor ill remember that replied the boy and after a few more words of conversation he left  on the following morning he called upon mr barrows the master painter for whom his father had worked he found the old workman busy in his shed mixing up colors for his journeymen to use  i suppose youve come down for the money due your father remarked mr barrows after he had expressed numerous regrets over the sad accident well here it is the week in full and im mighty sorry he isnt here to receive it himself and many another besides and he held out the amount  no i didnt come for this exactly replied the boy besides there is too much here he added as he counted the bills father did not finish out the week  never mind you take it anyhow returned mr barrows briefly what was it you wanted  work i want to earn something to support my mother and sisters on we cant live on nothing and what we have saved up wont last long  its hard luck dick so it is exclaimed the old painter tell you what ill do though ill teach you the tradeteach you it just as good as your father knew it and pay you a little in the bargain  how much i dont care about the money for myself but  yes i understand broke in mr barrows well ill tell you ill take you to learn the trade for three years and start you at two dollars a week i wouldnt give any other boy half of that but i know youre smart and i feel it my duty to help you along  richard bit his lip in disappointment he knew that what mr barrows said about the amount was true but still he needed more and for that reason he had somehow expected a larger sum to be offered  im much obliged but ill have to think it over before i decide he said three years is a long time to bind ones self  oh theyll slip by before you know it besides ill raise your wages just as soon as you are worth it said mr barrows  ill see about it was all the boy could answer  two dollars a week would not go far towards supporting a family of five sighed richard as he walked away and then to be a house painter all ones life i must strike something else  but striking something else was no easy matter as the boy soon learned a visit to the two stores the blacksmith shop and to several people whom he thought might give him employment brought forth no results of value either they had nothing for him to do or else the pay offered was altogether too small  richard returned home late in the afternoon grace met him at the end of the lane  any luck dick she asked eagerly  no he replied and related his experience  never mind returned his sister maybe it isnt so bad after all the minister is here  mr cook  yes hes in the parlor talking to mamma and i heard them mention your name and say something about new york  richards heart gave a bound he knew that mr cook who was their old family pastor had great influence with his mother and that she would probably go to him for advice  guess ill go in and hear what he has to say said richard and a moment later he knocked on the parlor door and entered  mr cook shook him cordially by the hand  we have just been speaking about you he said how have you fared in your search for employment  the boy told him  mossvale is so small there is hardly any chance he added  your mother tells me that you have an idea you could do better in new york went on the minister it is a big place and nearly every one is almost too busy to notice a newcomer  i know that but i should watch my chances  and there are many temptations there that never arise in such a place as this continued mr cook earnestly and it very often takes all the will power a person possesses to keep in the straight and narrow path  i wouldnt do what wasnt right burst out richard id starve first  mr cook looked down into the clear outspoken face before him  i believe it he declared you have had a good training thanks to your mother and father well i have advised her to let you try your luck in the great metropolis  oh mr cook  yes now dont get excited she has thought it over and agrees to let you go for two weeks at least the fare is only four dollars and a half and board for that length of time will not be much of course you cant put up at an expensive hotel  i wont put up anywhere until i find a job declared richard i only want my railroad ticket and a dollar or two extra  indeed not put in mrs dare i would not have you stay out doors all night like a tramp there are plenty of cheap lodginghouses  and when can i go asked richard eagerly  his mother gave a sad little smile  do you want to leave your mother so very soon she asked  oh no only i want to be doing somethinghelping you and the rest he replied quickly  then you shall go bright and early next monday morning returned mrs dare and she turned away to hide the tears that sprang up at the thought of her only boy leaving the shelter of the quiet country home to mingle with strangers in the great city more than a hundred miles away  as for richard he was delighted with the prospects at last the dream of many months was to be realized he was to go to new york to tread the streets of the great metropolis to find a place for himself and make a fortune  little did he know or care for the many trials and disappointments in store for him he was striking out for himself and intended to do his level best  would he succeed or fail  we shall see     chapter iv  on the train   of course there was a good deal of talking about richards proposed venture the girls seemed never to tire of it and the amount of advice that they gave their brother was enough as the boy declared to help him along until eternity and two days afterwards  youll want your best clothes city folks are so particular declared grace and your shirts and collars will have to be as stiff as old deacon moores i expect  i only want things clean and neat replied richard im not going there to be a dude im going there to workif i can get anything to do  nevertheless grace was bound that he should look his best and spent an extra hour over the washtub and ironingboard  it was decided that he should not be hampered with a trunk but should take a valise instead  this mrs dare packed herself and placed in the hallway late on saturday afternoon  meanwhile richard was not idle he did not wish to leave any work around the place unfinished and early and late he spent many hours in the house and in the garden doing the things that were most needed  sunday morning the whole family including little madge attended the pretty white church that was the one pride of mossvale richard suspected that mr cook had expected him to be there for the sermon was on the text be thou strong in the faith and advised all especially the young to stick to their christian principles despite the alluring but harmful enticements of the great world around them  it was a sober little crowd that gathered in the kitchen in the dusk after supper richard was a trifle louder in his manner than usual but this was only an effort to cover up the evidence of his real seriousness  you must not forget to write as soon as you arrive and find a stopping place cautioned mrs dare for at least the fifth time  yes and dont forget to tell us all about what happened on the train put in grace im sure that in such a long ride as that you ought to have some kind of an adventure  i trust that he does not returned the mother an adventure would probably mean an accident and we have had enough already and she gave a long sigh  dont fear but what ill write replied richard and if anything unusual happens ill put it down  but all evenings must come to an end and finally as the clock struck ten the goodnight word went its round and they separated  no need to call richard on the following morning he was up and dressed at five and impatient for the start every one turned in towards serving him a hot breakfast and in addition mrs dare put him up a tidy lunch in a box  there was one thing though that the boy was obstinate about he would not accept all of the money that mrs dare thought it her duty to make him take the price of his ticket and five dollars was richards limit and to this he stuck  if i get real hard up ill write for more was his declaration you will need what you have saved and i am sure i can get along without it  mrs dare shook her head but it was all to no purpose richard was firm and doubly so when grace gave him a pert look of approval  the news of the departure had spread and at the depot the boy met several who had come to see him offmr cook and two or three boy friends including charley wood the son of a neighbor who was not slow in giving the lions share of his attention to grace  here comes the train exclaimed nancy after a rather long wait and a moment later with ringing bell the locomotive rounded the curve below and the cars rolled into the depot  all aboard for rockvale beverly and new york way train for hurley allendale hobbs dam and all stations south of bakersville junction shouted the conductor lively please  there was a hurried handshaking and several warm kisses  goodby richard said mrs dare god be with you and then she added in a whisper dont be afraid to come home as soon as you dont like it any more  ill remember mother he replied dont worry about me its all right goodby each and everybody  valise in hand he climbed up the steps and entered one of the cars he had hardly time to reach a window seat and wave a parting adieu when the train moved off  he looked back as long as he could mother and sister were waving their handkerchiefs grace having brought her largest for this special occasion  but the train went swiftly on its way and soon mossvale and its people were left behind  off at last was richards mental comment its sink or swim now goodby to mossvale and the old life  yet it must in truth be confessed that there was just the suspicion of a tear in his eye and a lump in his throat as he settled back in his seat but he hastily brushed away the one and swallowed the other and put on as bold a front as he could  the car was only partially filled and he had a double seat all to himself he placed his valise beside him and then gazed at the evervarying panorama that rushed past  but his mind was not given to the scenes that were thus presenting themselves his thoughts were far ahead speculating upon what it would be best to do when his destination was reached  he knew new york was a big place and felt tolerably certain that few if indeed any would care to give him the information that he knew he needed  presently the train began to stop at various stations and the car commenced to fill up  this seat taken said a gentleman as he stopped beside richard  no sir replied the boy and made room for the other  thank you returned the gentleman rather crowded he continued as he sat down and deposited a huge valise beside richards which had been placed upon the floor  i might have checked my satchel remarked richard noting that the two valises rather crowded things  so might i was the newcomers reply but i thought it would be too much trouble in new york getting it  im not used to travelling explained richard and so i thought it best to have my baggage where i could lay my hands on it  the gentleman looked at him curiously  going to the city he asked  yes sir  first trip  yes sir  youll see a good many strange sights going to stay several days i presume  longer than that sir im going there to try my luck  the gentleman looked surprised  i hope youll succeed he said you will find it rather uphill work im afraid where are you from if i may ask  i come from mossvale my name is richard dare my father died from an accident a short while ago and as there didnt seem to be anything in our village for me to work at i made up my mind to try new york  the boys open manner evidently pleased his listener  i am glad to know you he returned my name is joycetimothy joyce i am a leather dealerdown in the swamp here is my card  the swamp queried richard puzzled by the appellation  yesat least thats what us oldtime folks call it there used to be a swamp there years ago im on jacob street maybe i can help you around a bit  thank you mr joyce im glad to know you replied richard gratefully im a perfect stranger as i said and it will be right handy to have some one to give me a few points  mr joyce smiled he was quite taken by the boys frank manner  ill give you all the points i can he said you must keep your eyes and ears open though for there are many pitfalls for the unwary  mr joyce felt in his coat pocket here is a map of the city i am going out in the smoker presently to enjoy a cigar i would advise you to study it while i am gone and when i come back ill explain anything that you cant understand  thank you i will  just look to my bag while i am gone will you continued mr joyce as he arose when alone richard became absorbed in the map at once  on and on sped the train now running faster than ever but richard took no notice he was deep in the little volume trying his best to memorize the names of the streets and their locations  its not a very regular city he sighed streets run in all directions and some of them are as crooked as a rams horn if i ever  a sudden jar at this instant caused richard to pitch forward from his seat then before he realized what had happened the car tilted and then turned completely over on its side     chapter v  the smashup   richard was bewildered and alarmed by what had happened as the car went over upon the side nearest to which he was sitting he fell down between the windows with his head resting upon the bundleholder that a moment before had been over him  his own valise and that belonging to mr joyce came down on top of him and as both were heavy they knocked the breath completely out of him  as soon as the boy had somewhat regained this and his scattered senses he scrambled to his feet and tried to look around him  daylight shone into the car from the windows above but all was dust and confusion mingled with the cries of women and the loud exclamations of men  luckily richard was not far from the rear door and having somewhat recovered from the shock he resolved to get out as speedily as possible  the car had now stopped moving and as there seemed to be no immediate danger of anything more happening the boy stopped to get the two valises  with such a load it was no easy matter climbing over the seats to the door yet the feat was accomplished and two minutes later with an exclamation of relief richard pitched his baggage to the bank beside the track and sprang to the solid ground  his foot had been slightly sprained when the shock came but in the excitement he hardly noticed the pain he could readily see that assistance was needed on all sides and he was not slow to render all that lay in his power  the cause of the accident could be seen at a glance a heavy freight train had backed down from a side track smashing the locomotive attached to the passenger cars and throwing three of the latter off the track  one of the carsthe firsthad been turned completely over and to this every one was hurrying  its the smoking car replied a man to richards eager question its full of men too  setting down the two valises within easy reach the boy hurried forward  mr joyce is in there was his thought oh i hope he isnt hurt  though richard had known the man but a short hour yet the city merchants cordial manner had completely captivated the boy  it was no easy matter for the men in the smoker to free themselves in turning over a number of the seats in the car had become loosened falling on many and blocking up both doors as well  but presently several windows were smashed out and the occupants began to pour from these some with their clothing badly torn others hatless and several severely injured  there are two men in there stuck fast exclaimed a short stout man as puffing and blowing he reached the ground i tried to help em both but it was no usethe seats all piled up atop of em beckon theyll have to be cut away theyre jammed in so tight  instantly richard thought of mr joyce nowhere in the crowd could he catch sight of the gentleman it was possible that one of the two might be his newlymade friend  theres a toolhouse down the road a ways continued the stout man i noticed it as we rode past a moment before we went over  where asked richard eagerly  on the other side up the embankment was the reply  ill see if i can get something to work with returned the boy just watch my baggage while im gone  in an instant he was off running as fast as possible he found the building just as it had been described the door was open and rushing in he confronted an irish laborer who was cleaning up some tools  the train has been wrecked just below he exclaimed hurriedly we want some toolsan axe or a crowbarsomethingquick  train wrecked repeated the man in astonishment  yesjust below richard picked up an axe and an iron bar  bring some more tools with you he cried as he started to go it may mean life or death richards earnest manner made an impression upon the laborer and in a few seconds the man was following the boy with his arms full of such implements as were handy  down at the wreck richard found that one of the two men a lean sallow complexioned individual had already been liberated but the other was still a prisoner  just what we want cried one of the workers as he took the axe from the boys hand can you use the bar  i guess so  follow me then  richard crawled into the car after the man inside it was full of dust and the thick tobacco smoke nearly stifled the boy  near the center of the car they found the unfortunate passenger it was not mr timothy joyce  the man was on his back and a seat fastened in some strange manner pinned him down  help me help me he gasped that thing is staving in all my ribs  it did not take richard long to insert the iron bar under one end of the slat and thus pry it up this done the man with the axe gave the side of the seat a couple of blows and then the prisoner was free  thank god exclaimed the man as he sprang to his feet and followed the others out of the car and thank you too my hearties he continued to the other man and to richard i thought as how i was strangled sure but doc linyard allers was a lucky tar thanky messmates thanky  he was a nauticallooking fellow of perhaps forty he wore a blue pea jacket and trousers and under the rolling collar of his gray flannel shirt was tied a black bandanna in true sailor style  is your chest hurt much asked richard as he thought he noticed a look of pain cross the mans countenance  no bones broken was the reply after a deep breath  the two were soon standing side by side on the bank near the track  wish i could reward you went on the man but i aint got a dollar all told  and diving into his capacious pocket he brought to light only a miscellaneous collection of small coins  oh never mind that said the boy coloring a trifle im glad youre all right  so am idownright glad and no mistake as i said afore my name is linyard doc linyard general manager along with my wife of the watch below the neatest sailors lunchroom on west street new york i say neatest acause my wife keeps it shes a worker betty is come and see me some time i wont forget to treat you well  thank you mr lin  avast there dont tackle no mister to my name interposed the old sailor whats your name he continued suddenly  richard told him  all right mr dare ill remember it and you too but dont go for to put a figurehead to my name plain doc linyard is good enough for such a tough customer as me  ill remember it mr  avast i say  i mean doc linyard  and shaking hands the two separated  picking up the two valises richard made his way through the crowd looking for mr joyce it seemed rather queer that the gentleman who had left his baggage in the boys care was nowhere to be found  richard made quite a number of inquiries especially among the men who had occupied the smokingcar but to no avail  the smashup was no small affair and it took fully an hour before the railroad officials that were present could get assistance to the spot in the meantime the injured were laid out on the grass and made as comfortable as circumstances would permit luckily several doctors had been passengers on the train and as they were uninjured they took charge of all who needed their aid  finally a train backed down to take the passengers to rockvale the next town of importance  richard hardly knew what to do if mr joyce was hurt it was certainly his duty to remain but perhaps the gentleman had gone off to render assistance or it was possible on a search for his satchel  guess ill take the train and risk it was richards conclusion he is bound to follow to rockvale sooner or later and we will probably meet in the depot  nevertheless as the boy entered the car he felt rather uncomfortable carrying off the property of another who was comparatively a stranger to him     chapter vi  under suspicion   well ive had an adventure on the road just as grace hoped i would was richards mental comment as he lay back in the car seat so ill have something to write home after all but i dont care particularly to have any more such happenings  for though richard had taken the whole affair rather coolly he now found that it had been more the excitement than aught else that had kept him up and he was beginning to feel the full force of a most uncomfortable shaking up  but this feeling bordering upon nervous prostration was not confined to the boy alone every one of the passengers most of whom had escaped without a scratch were decidedly ill at ease  it was not long ere richard thought to take a look through the train for mr joyce  he may have got aboard without my seeing him he said to himself  and leaving his baggage piled up in the seat he made the tour from one end to the other and back  he was unsuccessful it was as if the leather merchant had disappeared for good  hope he turns up thought the boy if he doesnt what am i to do with his baggage i dont know where he lives andhold up  he suddenly thought of mr joyces card which that gentleman had given him but a hasty and then a thorough search convinced him that the bit of pasteboard was no longer in his possession  must have slipped out of my pocket in the smashup he thought well ill have to make the best of it only i dont want to carry off another persons property  richard did not know enough to leave the valise with the baggage master or some of the other railroad officials this was his first journey of importance and everything was new and strange to him the next station was quite a distance and after thinking the matter over the boy concluded to let the matter rest until they reached that point  he still retained the guidebook the merchant had loaned him and presently he took it out and began to study it more carefully than ever  father used to live up in that neighborhood he said to himself as certain familiar names of streets arose in his mind sometime after im settled ill visit that district and learn if there are still any people there who knew him who knows but what i might run across some one who knew him during the war and could witness his application  the idea was a rather pleasant one and gave the boy a wide field for meditation and hope he determined not only to take a run up as he had said but also when the opportunity offered to make a thorough canvass of the locality and get every bit of information obtainable  ahoy there mr dare on board too eh exclaimed a voice and looking up richard saw doc linyards beaming face  sit down returned the boy  the seat in front was vacant and in a trice the old sailor had it turned over and himself ensconced in the soft cushions opposite richard  might i ask where youre bound asked doc linyard after another long string of thanks for the services that had been rendered  i cant say any more than that im going to new york im looking for work and i dont know where ill settle perhaps ill strike nothing and have to go back home  what a strong healthy young fellow like you nonsense not if you care to lend a willing hand  oh im anxious enough to do that  then youll pull through them as is anxious and willing always do i didnt have much to start on when i settled in the city only six months pay at sixteen dollars a month  how came you to leave the sea asked the boy with considerable curiosity for doc linyard was the first regular sailor he had ever known  oh you see i was wrecked a couple of times and lost one leg this he tapped his left knee is only a cork one you know and then the wife grew afeared and said as how she wanted me ashore but a tar used to the rigging and sech dont take kindly to labor on land so instead of working for other people i up and started the watch below  what is ita boardinghouse  not exactly though we do occasionally take a fellow in its a temperance lunchroom for sailors with regular firstclass ship grub lobscouse plumduff and sech most of the fellows know me and hardly a soul comes ashore but what drops in afore he leaves port  it must pay  i dont get fancy prices and only make a living id like to ask you down only maybe it wouldnt be fine enough  doc linyard had noticed richards neat appearance and saw that the boy was accustomed to having everything nice  oh i should like to come very much replied richard that is if i get the chance  on and on rolled the train and finally the town for which it was bound was reached and the passengers alighted and crowded the station  it was announced that owing to the disaster no train would leave for new york for two hours this left a long time on richards hands and he hardly knew what to do  immediately on the arrival doc linyard had gone off to hunt up a friend he fancied lived in the place not far from the station was a little park containing a number of benches and walking over to it richard sat down  the lunch his mother had given him came in handy now and he did full justice to it  he wished the old sailor was with him to share the repast he had taken a fancy to the tar and loved to listen to his hearty voice and open speech  after the lunch was disposed of richard took a short stroll through the town he did not go far for he had the two valises with him and they were heavy  presently he returned to the station and it was not long before the train could be seen approaching in the distance along with a number of others richard started to walk over to the right track  as he did so two men who looked like railroad officials approached him  say young fellow sang out one of the men hold up we want to speak to you  what is it asked richard  whose baggage have you got there  my own and another mans  what man asked the other official  a gentleman i met on the train  where is he now  i dont know im trying to find him  by this time the train had rolled into the station not wishing to miss it richard began to move on  both officials made a dive for him and one of them caught him by the shoulder  not so fast my fine fellow he exclaimed  why whatwhat do you want asked richard with a rising color  we want you to give an account of yourself was the reply where did you get that valise     chapter vii  the end of the journey   despite the knowledge that he was doing no wrong richards heart sank when he heard the railroad official call him back  he did not think how easy it might be to prove himself innocent of all wrongdoing it was bad enough to be suspected besides he had not been the only one to hear the harsh words that had been spoken and in a moment a crowd had collected  i was in the wreck and this valise belongs to a friend of mine replied richard as soon as he could collect his thoughts  what is your name asked the official who still held him by the arm  richard told him  and who was your friend  his name isis  and here being greatly confused richard could not remember the leather merchants name  come answer me continued the man sharply  his name isisive forgotten it stammered the boy in confusion  humph a very plausible excuse i must say sneered the man  its the truth i met the gentleman on the train he introduced himself and we had quite a chat then he asked me to look after his baggage while he went into the smokingcar and while he was gone the accident happened  where is the man now asked the first official  i dont know ive been trying to find him  do you expect me to believe that exclaimed the other there isnt a soul missing from that wreck  i cant help it replied richard stoutly for he was recovering from the shock he had received what im telling you is a fact  whats the matter here broke in a hearty voice and doc linyard elbowed his way through the crowd whats wrong with the young gentleman  what business is that of yours returned the man sharply  not much may be but if theres trouble for him i want to know it he saved my life down in the smashup and i intend to stand by him returned the old tar decidedly  they think im trying to steal this valise explained richard  what roared doc linyard confound you for a pair of landlubbers dont you know an honest figurehead when you see it look at him pears to me he looks more straightforward than those as accuses him  both officials were taken back by the tars aggressive manner  better be careful continued the sailor you dont know who this young gentleman is and before long youll be laying up a heap of trouble for yourselves  we have to be on our guard said the first official in a milder tone  the young man will have to leave the valise here at least added the other  im willing to do that said richard but im no thief he continued as they walked over to the baggageroom  yes but that mans name began one of the men  was joycetimothy joyce cried the boy i knew i would remember it sooner or later  the official took a piece of chalk and scratched the name upon the bottom of the valise  that one is yours  yes here is my name on the bottom and richard showed it  all right you can go if mr joyce calls he can get his property otherwise it will be forwarded to the main baggage office in new york  hold up not so fast put in doc linyard just give him a receipt for that valise  oh thats all right replied the man turning red  maybe so but i dont see as how he ought to trust you any more than you trusted him went on the tar bluntly  thats fair put in an old man who had stood watching the proceedings whats sauce for the goose is the sauce for the gander  with very bad grace the official wrote down something on a pad tore the page off and thrust it at richard  i hope youre satisfied he snapped to doc linyard and taking up mr joyces valise he entered an inner room slamming the door behind him  good riddance to him muttered the old tar a few brass buttons on his coat has turned his head  the train had fortunately been delayed but it was now moving from the station richard and doc linyard made a rush for it and succeeded in boarding the last car  hope were done with adventures remarked the old tar when they were seated id rather have things quiet and easy  i must thank you said richard heartily i dont know what i would have done if you hadnt come up just when you did  shootaint nothing mr dare alongside of what you did for me replied the sailor but ive had a run of bad luck since i left new york two days ago he added meditatively  yes questioned the boy with some curiosity how so  well its this way began doc linyard crossing his good leg over the cork one my wife got a letter from england last week saying as how an uncle had died leaving his property to her and her brother tom clover in the letter she was asked to see her brother and fix the matter up with him they wrote they didnt have his address and so left it to her  i should think that would be all right remarked richard as the old tar paused  it would be only for one thingwe dont know where tom is he used to live in new york but moved away we dont know where a party told me he thought he had got work in a place called fairwood but ive just come from there  and you didnt find him  no he had never been in the place i have an idea he is again somewhere in new york  didnt he used to call on you  sometimes but he was a bit queer and there was times he didnt show up for months and months hes pretty old and couldnt get around very well  is the property valuable  its worth over eight hundred poundsfour thousand dollars  its a fortune exclaimed richard  twould be to betty and me returned the sailor we never had over a hundred dollars in cash in our lives  its a pity you cant find him said the boy what are you going to do get your wifes share and let the other rest  no thats the worst of it by the provisions of the will the property cant be divided very well except by the consent of both heirs  in that case i think id commence a pretty good search for mryour wifes brother its worth spending quite a few dollars to find him  just my reckoning but new york is a big place to find any one in  perhaps your brotherinlaw will drop in on you when you least expect him  hope he does  the two continued the conversation for a long time the more richard saw of doc linyard the better he liked the bluff old tar and to tell the truth the latter was fully as much taken by richards open manner  it was not long before richard poured out his own tale in all its details he found a strong sympathizer in the sailor who expressed a sincere wish that the pension due the dare family might be speedily forthcoming  somewhat of a like claim to mine he remarked we are both looking for other people to help us out  and i trust we both succeed added richard earnestly in fact we must succeed he continued with sudden energy  right you are was the reply were bound to get the proper bearings some time  before they reached their journeys end they were fast friends  jersey city  it was the brakemans cry and an instant later the train rolled into the vast and gloomy depot and every one was scrambling up and making for the door  in a moment they were upon the platform amid a surging pushing mass of people  which way asked richard somewhat confused by the unusual bustle  this way replied the sailor just follow me  west shore this side checks for baggage brooklyn annex to the right and several similar calls filled the boys ears   he kept close to the tar who led the way to the slip where a cortlandt street boat was in waiting and dodging several trucks and express wagons they hurried down the bridge and went on board  the gentlemens cabin was so full of tobacco smoke that it nearly stifled richard and he was not sorry when doc linyard led the way straight through to the forward deck  it was a pleasant day and the lowering sun cast long shadows over the water and lit up the spires and stone piles of the great metropolis that lay beyond tipped with gold typical of richards high hopes  swiftly the ferryboat crossed the north river crowded with boats then it ran into the slipthere was the rattle of the ratchets as the line wheels spun around and finally the gates were opened  richard had reached new york at last     chapter viii  the watch below   gracious what a busy place  this was the thought that ran through richards mind as he stepped from the ferryhouse to west street in new york city  doc linyard had managed to get the boy off the boat as soon as the landing was made but now as they waited for a chance to cross the slippery thoroughfare that runs parallel to the waters edge the crowd surged around them until to richard there seemed to be a perfect jam  hack sir astor house coupe madam this way for a cab  in a moment they were safe upon the other side of the street  made up your mind which way to steer asked doc linyard  not exactly replied richard this is the way to broadway i suppose he went on pointing up cortlandt street  yes but what do you intend to do up there  i thought id take a look around i imagine i cant do much in the way of finding work at this time in the evening  no youd best wait till morning then get a world and a herald and look over the want advertisements i reckon thats the best way of striking a position  thank you ill try that plan goodby and richard held out his hand  wont you come down to my place afore we part interposed doc linyard its only a few steps from here  richard demurred from the description he had been given of the place he knew money was to be spent there and he had no cash to spare  iiguess not he faltered  why not  iwell to tell the truth i havent much to spend  the old tar slapped the boy heartily on the shoulder  dont worry about that he cried im no landshark this trip shant cost you a cent come on  and richard followed to a newcomer west street is certainly a curious sight saloons predominate but between them are located tiny eating houses cheap clothing shops meat stalls bargain counters and lodgingplaces only about one in ten of the latter being fit for occupancy  here we are exclaimed the sailor presently  they stepped up to a small restaurant considerably neater than its neighbors its exterior was painted light blue and over the door in big black letters hung the sign    the watch below doc linyard boatswain  and to the right of the door near a figurehead representing a gorgeous mermaid were added the words    messmates always welcome  the doors were wide open and the two entered  several men sat at various tables eating and drinking and behind a counter that did the double duty of a piestand and a cashiers desk sat a tall old man with grizzled white hair  well pop exclaimed doc linyard as he stepped up  hello my boy back again returned the older man did you find em he added in an anxious tone  no  the old man shook his head ominously  too bad too bad he murmured  but he was evidently too old to take a very strong interest in the matter  never mind it will all come outright in the end was the sons reassuring reply where is betty  in the kitchen  this is my father went on doc linyard to richard pop here is a chum as i picked up on the road his name is mr dare and he saved my life  saved your life queried the old man doubtfully  as he spoke a door in the rear opened and a buxom woman of thirty tripped out she came straight up to the sailor and gave him a hearty kiss  no luck betty said linyard soberly  no  not a bit couldnt locate em nohow  its too bad doc  and he says his life was saved by this chap put in the old man who had been gazing at richard ever since the assertion had been made  yes weve both had strange adventures in the last twelve hours  this bold praise made richard blush  oh i didnt do as much as all that he exclaimed i only helped him out of the car just as i would have helped any one  no sech thing he did lots  and sitting down near the counter doc linyard gave a graphic account of all that had transpired  i thank you very much said mrs linyard when her husband had finished i know doc wont forget what you did and neither will i she gave the boys hand a tight squeeze wont you have some supper with us  richard hesitated he always was backward in accepting favors  come dont say no urged doc linyard by the anchor its little enough  mrs linyard led the way to a cozy nook near the end of the restaurant and gave them two seats at a small table covered with a snowy white clotha table that was generally reserved for officers or upper class patrons  so youve had no luck she said to her husband as she began to bustle around with the tableware its queer what can have become of tom  blessed if i know  we may lose that money all through him sighed mrs linyard  it would be a shame put in richard your husband has told me of the matter i wish i could help you  the sailor laughed goodnaturedly his disposition was too easy to worry much over the situation  reckon as how youll have your hands full on your own account finding work and all that he returned  i suppose i will still i would like to help you  mrs linyard provided a warm and bountiful supper and both enjoyed every dish that was set before them  i mustnt lose too much time went on the boy as he was finishing i must at least find a boardinghouse i dont want to spend the night in the streets  no fear of that said the old tar hastily betty another cup of that good coffee please tell you what ill do if youre willing this place isnt as grand as a hotel but bettys beds are as clean as any of em and if you will youre welcome to stay all night  thank you ill do so gladly replied richard quickly for the proposition took a load from his mind ill pay you whatever  avast there what do you think i am to take money from you for that no thanky im no land shark  i know youre not replied richard quickly for he saw that the sailors feelings had been hurt but i would like to do something in return  no need of that tell you what you can do though continued doc linyard after a moments reflection  well  write me out an advertisement for the newspapers my eddication aint none of the best and my hands more used to a marline spike than it is to a pen  willingly what do you want to advertise  i want to put a notice in for my brotherinlaw ill give you all the particulars  very well have you pen ink and paper  yes betty will you bring em  mrs linyard nodded  a few minutes later the dishes were cleared away and richard prepared to write out the advertisement     chapter ix  locked out   during richards and doc linyards meal the watch below had been gradually filling up principally with sailors the majority of whom were short heavyset men who clapped each other on the back and carried on their conversation in a sea lingo that was nearly unintelligible to richard  one thing however impressed the boy all the patrons seemed of a better class than most sailors are and he was glad to notice that drunkenness and profanity were entirely absent once in a while some one would let fall some coarse remark but he was quickly choked off by the others out of respect for docs betty who hurried around with a shining face waiting on one and exchanging a pleasant word with another  every one was on familar terms with the proprietor they were glad to see him back to the focastle but those who knew were sorry his mission had been unsuccessful  they all know me and wishes me well remarked the sailor to richard its something to be proud ofaround on this here globe fortyfive years and not an enemy in the world  how long were you a sailor  almost thirty years i shipped as cabin boy on a south america brig when i was fifteen id be at it yet if as i told you betty hadnt anchored me ashore  its long time some time id like to hear of some of the places you visited but id better get at that advertisement  no hurrythe newspaper office is only a few blocks from here  but you want this advertisement to go in tomorrow dont you  they take em up to ten oclock and maybe later  presently the crowd began to thin out and by nine oclock only halfa dozen customers remained mrs linyard and the old man waited upon these and doc linyard drew up to the table and motioned richard to go ahead  here is the paper im going to put the notice in he said guess you better follow the style of the other advertisements  i will replied richard what is your brotherinlaws full name  thomas clover he has no middle name  and his address  he came from brighton england and lived here in a number of places on the east side  the east side  yes he lived somewhere on cherry hill last  and what is your wifes name  only betty that stands for elizabeth i suppose but she was never anything else to me or anybody else  better let it go at that then returned richard now what is the name of the estate to be divided  the old sailor told him  and say we want to hear from them at once he added  richard went to work earnestly several attempts to get the advertisement into proper shape were failures finally he produced the following  information wanted immediately of thomas clover or his heirs formerly of brighton england but when last heard of lived in cherry street this city he is an heir of the peleg sabine estate which awaits settlement address doc linyard the watch below west street new york  how will that do asked the boy  firstrate cried linyard only dont put my address on it i want the answer to come through a box in the newspaper office i dont want to be bothered by lawyers and detectives looking for a job on the case  i see said richard and crossing out the address he substituted the words  doc box  this office  guess ill take a walk over to the newspaper office at once said the old tar when the boy had finished reckon as how pop and the mistress can get along for a while i suppose youd like to come along  indeed i would id like to see as much of the city as i can before i get to work  theres lots of strange sights no doubt to new eyes like yours youll find lots thats bright and a heap more thats dark and dismal enough  a moment later they set out passing up liberty street they turned into greenwich and walked along to fulton  the elevated road with its noise was a surprise to the boy but he was not allowed time to notice it long for the sailor hurried him up fulton street to st pauls church and then they stood on broadway what a busyan awfully busystreet was richards comment  its rather dull now said doc linyard just wait till daytime the wagons and people are enough to drive a man wild thats the postoffice over there he continued as he pointed to the stone structure that stands as a wedge separating broadway from park row and the bowery  come ahead here we are on newspaper row as lots call it this was the herald building before that paper moved uptown it used to be barnums museum years ago way down at the head of frankfort street is the world and nearly all the rest of the great dailies are strung along between the two here we are  as doc linyard finished he led the way into the outer office of a newspaper about midway down the row  it was a lively place a constant stream of people coming in and going out and the hum of many voicesthe whole putting richard in mind of some huge machine grinding out its stipulated work  along one side of the counting room was a row of small windows each labeled with its department name  stepping up to that marked advertisements the old sailor handed in the one richard had written out  the clerk examined it then he wrote in the number of a box and put down several private marks in the corner  pay at the next desk he said handing the paper back  how much will it be asked linyard  ninety cents  at the next window the man in charge put the advertisement on file along with numerous others then he took the money the tar handed over and in return filled out a printed order entitling the bearer to receive all letters bearing the address advertised for ten days  it will go in tomorrow asked the tar  certainly  suppose we take a walk up the bowery suggested the sailor when they were once more outside its early yet  richard readily consented he had often heard his father speak of the streethow beautiful it had been years ago and how trade had taken hold of it and the boy was curious to see what it was like  the thoroughfare was a revelation to him just as it is to every one seeing it for the first time the shops huddled together their showwindows littered with articles of every description the secondhand establishments the pawnbrokers the peddlers and streetstand merchants who offered everything from shoelaces to collars books and trick novelties were all decidedly new to him  one stand in particular attracted his attention it was laden with choice books at remarkably low prices there was a wellbound history of the united states for fortyfive cents and a beautiful edition of shakspere with steel engravings for the small price of one dollar  selling em off cheap cried the vender putting several volumes in richards hands take em right along youll miss the opportunity of a lifetime if you dont  they are very nice replied the boy but i guess i wont take any tonight  youd better they may be all gone by tomorrow this is only a job lot and dirt cheap  no i guess not and richard put the books reluctantly back on the stand  give you a special discount of ten per cent persisted the dealer  no i havent the money  oh well come around tomorrow ill lay the books aside for you  no dont do that i may not be back and without waiting for further words richard hurried off  meanwhile doc linyard all unconscious of what was transpiring had gone on ahead and when richard looked around for him the old sailor was nowhere to be seen  rather startled the boy hurried along to catch up but under the elevated railroad and down by the brooklyn bridge all was confusion and jam and in a moment richard realized that he had lost his friend  he hurried along several blocks and then just as rapidly retraced his steps but it was useless doc linyard had disappeared in the crowd and was not to be found  now im in a pretty pickle thought richard i suppose there is nothing to do but get back to the watch below  but that was easier said than done the boy did not like to make too many inquiries and so started off on his own account  he paid dearly for the experiment a wrong turn or two and lo it took richard an hour to get back to west street and to the restaurant  and arrived here an awkward state of affairs confronted the boy the watch below was closed for the night all was dark and not a soul was in sight     chapter x  the first night in new york   for an instant a feeling of intense loneliness swept over richards heart as he stood on the dark and silent pavement he had firmly counted upon spending the night at the watch below and now to find that place closed up caused his heart to sink within him he reproached himself bitterly for having allowed his curiosity and love of books to make him forgetful of his situation  how am i ever to get along in this world unless i watch out he said to himself dismally i suppose it will do no good to knock on the door by the way the place is located the sleepingroom must be upstairs in the rear and i might pound till doomsday without any one hearing me  nevertheless he rapped loudly upon the door not once but several times and so hard that he drew the attention of the policeman on that beat  phat are you trying to do asked the officer as he came up  i want to get in and richard related the particulars of his plight  youll have a job me by was the reply mrs betty slapes like a log  they waited for several minutes in silence but nobody appeared and no sound came from within  phat are you going to do asked the policeman finally  i dont know im sure my valise is inside with my money ive only got twenty cents in change in my pocket  theres a lodginghouse in washington street where you can get a bed for that went on the officer but its not over clean  i dont want to go where its dirty replied the boy shuddering  and for a brief instant a vision of his own neat and tidy cot at home floated through his mind  well oi dunno you cant stay out here  while trying to plan what to do a man turned the corner and came toward them by the walk richard recognized doc linyard and with a cry of joy he ran up to the old tar  ahoy so here you are exclaimed the sailor his face beaming with satisfaction a nice chase youve led me where did you go to  nowhere i stopped to look at some books and then i couldnt find you again replied richard im so glad youve come theyve gone to bed  all below decks eh well its time ive spent an hour looking for you over on the bowery how are you mulligan the last to the policeman who nodded pleasantly  producing a key doc linyard opened the restaurant door then he handed the policeman a cigar as a reward for the trouble the officer had taken and he and richard entered  the old sailor locked the door carefully behind them and lit a hand lamp that his thoughtful wife had placed upon the front counter  i thought such places as this kept lights all night observed richard as they walked back  most of em dothem as has gas but the insurance companies think oil dangerous so we do without  doc linyard preceded the boy up a narrow stairway to a small room on the third floor  here you are he exclaimed as he set the lamp down on a table betty got it all fixed for you theres your valise and the beds waiting for you take my advice and dont get up too early not afore seven oclock any wayand pleasant dreams to you  thank you the same to you replied richard sincerely  it was a cozy apartment and the boy had not been in it over five minutes before he felt perfectly at home before retiring he sat down to write the promised letter home  he had no ink but paper and envelopes had been brought along and in half an hour his lead pencil had filled several sheets with a very creditable account of what had transpired  this done he undressed and retired not however before thanking god for his kind care and asking for his help and guidance during whatever was to follow  despite the varied fortunes of his trip the boys sleep was a sound one and it lacked but a few minutes to seven when he awoke in the morning  a basin of clean water stood on a stand at the foot of the bed and after a plunge into this he dressed combed his hair and went below  of course the restaurant was already comfortably filled and as a matter of fact had been for over an hour  hello my hearty on deck i see called out doc linyard i hope you slept well in your strange bunk first rate was richards reply and longer than i expected too guess ill start right out to look for work  not afore youve had some breakfast sit down and ill fetch you some coffee and biscuits heres the morning papers you can look em overthe male help wanted column reckon youll find something worth trying for  finding remonstrances of no avail richard sat down and allowed himself to be helped to a morning repast  while eating he looked over the paper and found quite a number of places worth hunting up by the aid of the map mr joyce had loaned him he sorted out the addresses in regular order and put them down in his notebook  here is that newspaper office order said the sailor as richard was about to leave if youre around in that neighborhood in the afternoon just see if there are any answers one might have come already  i will replied richard can i leave my valise here  certainly i want you to make yourself at home here until you find a better place  thank you but i must pay you  not a cent you helped me and im going to do my duty by you im no land shark  and the old sailor shook his head in a way that showed he meant every word he said  boy wanted bright and active to help feed norris printing co water st near wall  such was the wording of the first advertisement on richards list  he knew wall street ran from broadway opposite trinity church towards the east river and he was not long in reaching that famous money mart where millions of dollars change hands each day between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm the grand approaches to many of the buildings made him feel timid and he could not help but wonder if the place to which he was going was also so magnificent  but water street crooked ill paved and dirty was a decided contrast to its neighbor storage and warehouses abounded and the numerous trucks backed up to receive or deliver goods necessitated walking more in the street than on the sidewalk  the building occupied by the norris printing co was at length reached the office was on the second floor and climbing up a flight of worn and grimy steps richard knocked at the door  come in said a voice from inside and he entered  i understand you want a boy to help feed he began addressing a man who sat at a desk piled with books and printed sheets  apply to mr nelson in the basement was the brief reply  yes sir  the stairs to the lowest floor were even narrower than the others had been it led to a pressroom that seemed to be one mass of motion and noise  mr nelson proved to be a pleasant man of perhaps fifty  had any experience he asked after richard had announced his errand  no sir but i think i can learn as quickly as anybody  perhaps but we couldnt pay you so much while you were learning  how much would you start me atif i worked real hard  mr nelson hesitated  well give you two dollars a week to begin he said when you can do as much as the rest well raise you to three or four  richards hopes fell even four dollars a week would barely keep him much less allow of money being sent home  im afraid i cant accept it he said i must support myself and i cant do it on two dollars a week  its all we can allow replied mr nelson and he turned away to his work  in a moment richard was on the street again the setback chilled his ardor but only for an instant and then he hurried on to the next place  it was a confectionery store and entering he purchased five cents worth of chewing gum such as he knew his little sister would like  i understand you want a boy he said to the proprietor who happened to be the one to wait on him  i hired one about an hour ago was the reply are you looking for a place  yes sir  the man gave richard a sharp glance  you look like a bright sort of a chap he said suppose you leave me your address the other boy may not suit  so richard put down his name and the address of the watch below  im only stopping there temporarily he explained and may leave but ill drop around again in a day or two if i dont strike anything else  do i dont like the other boy much i only took him because a friend asked me to  what do you pay  four dollars a week and i might make it five if you would be willing to help on the wagon as well as in the store  i certainly would replied richard promptly im willing to work real hard at anything providing its honest  thats the way i like to hear a lad talk said the confectioner approvingly  five dollars a week is certainly better than two was richards mental comment as he hurried along perhaps the next place will offer something better still  but the next place was already filled and so were the three that followed  the seventh was on vesey street the neighborhood that supplies half the metropolis with tea and coffee a boy was wanted to help fill orders and delivera mans workthough richard did not know it  well pay you seven dollars was the merchants reply after the boy had inquired after the place you will have to deliver principally and collect of course  and when can i go to work asked richard overjoyed at an opening that promised so well  anytime right away if you like but youll have to furnish twentyfive dollars security this news put a damper on the boys hopes  twentyfive dollars security he repeated  yes youll have more than that to collectwhich was not trueand of course you will be responsible and must turn in the money for every order taken out  id be sure to do that or else return the goods  we dont take the goods back was the firm reply everything that goes out has been ordered and is charged to the account of the one taking the goods out  who takes the orders  our canvassers  but the orders may not be good suggested the boy people sometimes change their minds especially when theyve been talked into buying  the orders are always good besides if a person refuses to honor his order all youve got to do is to turn round and sell the packages to some one else come what do you say youd better try it its a good offer  i havent got the money was richards reply  and for some reason he was glad of the fact  better get it then and go to work urged the merchant you cant make seven dollars a week easier  ill think it over replied the boy  there was something in the offer that did not strike him favorably and indeed it was a good thing that he was not in a position to accept it  the whole proposition was hardly above a common swindle enough bogus orders being put among the honest ones either to make the one undertaking the job do a lot of peddling on his own account or else cause him to pay away half his salary on the goods left over  walking up vesey street richard found himself directly opposite the postoffice by the clock on st pauls he saw that it was long after noon  rather disheartened at his nonsuccess after spending a whole morning in the search for work he rounded the astor house corner and crossed broadway  newspaper row as doc linyard had appropriately called it was just across the opposite street and the boy made up his mind to visit the office where the advertisement had been left and see if there were any letters as yet for the old sailor  the doors of the postoffice were open on both sides and curious to see how the building looked inside richard started to go through instead of going around  the many departments upon the ground floor were a study to him and the signsdomestic mails foreign mails letters for new york city letters for outgoing mailsall this was in strong contrast to the little three by four box that held all the mail of the village at home  and the many private boxes he guessed there must be ten thousand of them every second a newcomer walked up to open one  presently a familiar figure stepped up to one directly in front of richard and taking out a handful of letters closed the box and turned to go away  it was mr timothy joyce     chapter xi  robbed   richard was highly delighted to see his fellow passenger once again and running up he grasped the gentleman by the shoulder  mr joyce  why hello where did you come from exclaimed the leather merchant thrusting the letters into his pocket and taking hold of the boys extended hand i hope you werent hurt  no sir replied richard only shaken up i trust you were as fortunate  not quite my foot was caught under the seat and was wrenched pretty badly so much so that i had a man take me half a mile in a wheelbarrow to a doctors  i looked all over for you continued the boy i saved your valise and wanted to return it  and richard related the particulars of his adventures  humph those railroad chaps are too particular in some cases and not half enough so in others declared mr joyce what is in the bag doesnt amount to much but im much obliged to you for taking the trouble to save it ill send for it this afternoon  and here is your guidebook went on richard handing out the volume im thankful for the use of it its been a real help to me  better keep it then replied the merchant ill make you a present of it he laughed presumably at the smallness of the gift  thank you  have you had any luck yet in your search for work  no sir i could have had a job at several places but the pay was so small i couldnt afford to accept any of them  yes thats the trouble good openings are scarce and very often one must be known to get a place  and some want security added the boy relating his interview with the teamerchant  dont have anything to do with that class of men exclaimed mr joyce emphatically they wont give you a cent more than they are forced to and advancement in their service is out of the question  it didnt strike me very favorably  i am sorry that you are not better acquainted with city ways you may have to pay dearly for your experience though i hope not  im going to keep my eyes open as widely as i can sir  youll have to mr joyce paused for a moment can you come over to my office this afternoon about three oclock he asked  yes sir  maybe ill be able to place you i wont promise but ill do what i can  richards heart gave a bound he had taken a strong liking to the leather merchant and the hearty manner of the latter somewhat like that of doc linyard was certainly taking  thank you ill be on hand he replied quickly  do but remember i make no promises returned mr joyce im off now i must answer this mail and a pile of other letters that have accumulated during my absence  in a moment the merchant was lost to sight in the crowd  im glad that i met him thought the boy it may be the luckiest thing yet im sure if he finds an opening for me it will be the right thing to take hold of  under the turn of affairs richard decided to get the sailors letters if there were any and return to the watch below at once it was after one oclock leaving him about an hour and a half before going to the merchants place of business  i must be prompt he said to himself it will count im sure  watching his chance among the score of street cars which pass the post office corner every minute the boy dived through the crowd and reached the opposite side of park bow  the newspaper office was but a few steps away and in a second he was inside  quite a number of people were in the countingroom they were mostly of the poorer class and were either looking over the want columns of the papers on file or else waiting for answers to advertisements which they had inserted  richard joined the line of the latter and in due turn found himself at the window slip in hand  the clerk glanced at the slip and then looked over some letters in a certain box  here you are he said and handed back the slip accompanied by two letters  two answers exclaimed richard as he moved away doc linyard is certainly in luck i must hurry back he will be anxious i know  richard put the slip in his vestpocket in doing so he pulled out two one dollar bills which he had taken from his valise in the morning and folded the paper and money together  as he shoved the roll into his pocket he did not notice that a hungry pair of eyes just outside of the swinging glass doors were watching his every action  the hungry pair of eyes belonged to a boy of twelve though he looked oldera street urchindirty ragged with a pinched face and a starved illclad form a look of sheer desperation came into these eyes when their owner saw the money and he trembled with excitement as a certain bold and wicked thought came into his minda thought born not of a bad heart but ofan empty stomach  as richard came out of the door the street boy shoved against him the doors were heavy and for an instant richard found his way blocked he pushed back the opposite door and attempted to pass  say mister deres a big bug on your collar exclaimed the urchin pointing to richards neck  now as im sure every one knows to merely have such a thing mentioned is to feel the insect in question such was the case with richard and still holding the door with one hand he put the other up to his neck  this was the wouldbe thiefs chance with a dexterity worthy of a better cause the urchin transferred the slip money and letters to his own pocket it was done in less than three seconds and then he darted back into the crowd upon the street  of course richard found no bug and he was considerably perplexed by the urchins actions never dreaming of what had really occurred  i suppose that boy was fooling me he thought maybe its one of those silly jokes that become all the rage every now and then  richard walked to the corner of ann street st pauls clock now pointed to ten minutes to two and he had no time to waste  watch protectors gents only ten cents each may some day save you the loss of a valuable timepiece step right up now only a dime regular price fifty cents  it was a street vender who made this announcement he stood upon the curbstone a small tray of his wares suspended from his shoulders  heres just what you want sir he said addressing richard  thank you but i dont carry a watch was the boys polite reply  you will one of these days better have one  if i need one ill call around replied richard briefly  the idea of a safeguard caused him to feel in his pockets to see that his belongings were still in his possession first in oneanotherevery one  then he realized what had happened he had been robbed     chapter xii  on the search   richard was dismayed and disheartened by the discovery which he had just made he went through his clothing a dozen times to convince himself that he was not mistakenthat the slip money and letters were really gone but it was assuredly a fact and groaning in spirit he leaned up against a post utterly overcome  to tell the truth however much as he needed money he did not think of the bills that had been taken his mind ran altogether on doc linyards property  what will he say when i tell him of it was richards mental comment he wont want to trust me any more perhaps those letters were worth hundreds of dollars what a fool ive been i ought to be sent back to mossvale at once im not fit to stay in new york  then came the thought that possibly he had dropped the things and he hastily retraced his steps scrutinizing every inch of the way as he went  but as we know such an effort was fruitless and by the time he had reached the newspaperoffice richard was convinced that it was a plain case of robbery and nothing else  but when did it happen i had the letters when i reached the streethold up that boy im sure hes the one he exclaimed to himself i remember now feeling something at my pocket when i put my hand up to my collar that bug business was only a ruse well i am a fool and after all mr joyce and doc linyard told me too  the thought of how he had been taken in made richard fairly sick and the tears of vexation sprang into his eyes as he stood deliberating upon what to do next  just then a burly policeman came lounging along richard touched him on the arm  i have been robbed he said  robbed where when exclaimed the officer all attention  richard told him all he knew of his case  i think i know the chap said the officer but i can do nothing now he is likely a mile away by this time  will you watch out for him asked richard  i dont care so much for the money as i do for the letters  better come over to the station and make a complaint  is it far ive got an engagement at three oclock that i dont want to miss  wont take ten minutes come on  at the station richard was required to leave his full name and address describe what had been stolen and give a full description of the person he suspected was the thief  i cant give you much hopes of recovery said the officer in charge dollar bills are very much alike and if the thief finds that he cannot put the letters to account he will probably destroy them as to his getting other letters on the strength of the stolen slip you had better go to the office and have the delivery stopped  thank you i will replied richard  he was soon on his way back to park row  do you remember me he asked of the clerk who had previously waited on him  yes what is it anything wrong with your letters  richard told his story  will you hold the letters he added  certainly and if there is a call for them ill send out for an officer and have the party detained  when richard was again on the street he hardly knew what to do he had no appetite for dinner and there seemed now no use of returning to the watch below  he had a fancy that the urchin who had robbed him had run across into the postoffice true it was only a fancy but richard had some time to spare yet before he was due at mr joyces office and he determined to take a walk in that direction  going through the postoffice he walked over to warren street and thence down to college place there was a coffeestand upon the corner and here he bought two doughnuts for a cent each and began munching them noticing at the same time that they were not of the best being dry and that the flavor wasnt to be compared to that of those grace was in the habit of turning out at home  under the elevated road it was not as light as could be wished and richard could not see very well but presently he beheld a figure at the end of the blocka figure that looked familiar  richard quickened his pace and soon reached the spot yet only in time to see the figure turn the next corner but this time his view had been better and richard was tolerably certain that it was the thief he was pursuing  he broke into a run instantly and being light of foot gained rapidly upon the boy  a glance around the next corner and richard just caught a glimpse of the urchins head as it disappeared down a cellar way rushing to the spot he was compelled to pause he was far down on a side street that was little better than an alleyway the building before him was dirty and old evidently a storehouse and the open stone steps led down to a steep cellar from which not a ray of light came up  should he enter for an instant richard paused and then slowly descended  they shall not say that i was a coward he said to himself and i can easily handle that chap if it comes to a hand to hand affair  the moldy smell of the cellar was nearly unbearable and in several spots upon the brick floor the scum lay an inch deep presently the boys eyes became accustomed to the darkness and then he saw it was not so gloomy after all  at the back there appeared to be several windows and though covered with dust and cobwebs they still admitted some light the place was packed with wooden cases and barrels and richard had not a little difficulty in picking his way among them  evidently the street arab had not calculated upon being followed into such a place for richard heard him boldly making his way to the rear  he hurried after the urchin making as little noise as possible but unfortunately his foot at that moment struck against an empty case and made known his presence  instantly the street boy realized the situation and diving behind a pile of barrels remained perfectly quiet  richards blood was now up and he did not intend to be outwitted he hurried to the spot in his eagerness nearly stumbling over the boy  but the latter was alert visions of the tombs probably floated through his mind and tripping richard over he sprang away  richard was on his feet in a second but it was too late in that second the street arab had sprung to the top of a pile of cases that stood directly under an opening in the floor above  the next instant he had disappeared through the hole and was gone  but in mounting the stack of cases he had dislodged several and these now tumbled down making a lively racket the noise was followed by several exclamations and the sound of hasty feet upon a stairway  hey you vat you do here cried a voice and richard felt his arm grasped by a tall and savage looking german workman     chapter xiii  richard calls on mr joyce   as the hand of the german workman grasped richards arm the boy realized that he was in an awkward fix appearances were all against him and as the man glared at him richard knew not what to say  come now vat vas you doing here hey demanded the german  ii was after a boy who stole something from me stammered richard  after a poy  yes he ran down here and i came after him  tont believe it vere ist der poy now  he jumped up there and got through that hole replied richard pointing to the place  the german uttered an exclamation  dats nonsense  its true he stole two dollars and some letters and i chased him in here  the man eyed richard suspiciously  maype dot vas only a makebelieve sthory i dont know he declared come ve go upstairs und see  but as richard surmised the boy had by some means already made his escape but the marks of his muddy feet as he had crawled from the hatchway were still to be seen and these richard pointed out  vell if your sthory is straight dat lafer aint here now so you go about your beesness and with a wave of his arm the stalwart workman motioned for richard to clear out  the boy was not loth to leave the place nothing was to be gained by remaining and the germans company was certainly not desirable  i suppose i might as well give up the search now said richard to himself when outside that fellow will know enough to keep out of my sight for a while and besides it must be time to go to mr joyces gracious how starved that chap did look if he wants that money to get something to eat with im sure hes welcome to it only i want the letters  richard brushed off his clothes as best he could and started off by the use of the guidebook he had no difficulty in finding the swamp as the leather district in new york is called  presently he came to a big warehouse with an office at one side over which hung the sign    timothy joyce   successor to   joyce brothers   leather and hides   established 1837  its certainly an old firm thought richard as he read the words i guess mr joyce is a pretty substantial business man  the boy found the leather merchant at his desk deep in his letters  ah on hand i see said mr joyce im not quite ready yet will be in a quarter of an hour  i wont mind waiting returned richard  suppose you take a look around the place i guess youve never seen anything like this before  no sir and ill look around gladly  richard stepped from the office to the lower floor of the warehouse the quantity of leather and hides on all sides filled him with wonder  the place was several stories high and was filled to overflowing with material soon to be worked up into shoes pocketbooks belting gloves baseball covers and a thousand other articles for which this staple material of trade is needed several heavy trucks were loading and unloading at the doors and the boy heard the workmen speak of a consignment to buffalo and another to boston and of a shipload that had just arrived from south america  its a big business and no mistake was richards conclusion i guess a person would have to be here half a lifetime to learn all the ins and outs of it  when richard returned to the office he found that mr joyce had just cleared his desk and was leaning back in his chair  the leather merchant motioned him to a seat  well what do you think of it he asked abruptly  you seem to be doing a big business returned richard i think you must have enough leather to supply all new york  so i havefor a short time but only a small part stays in the city it comes and goes all the while have you found a place yet  no sir i havent had a chance yet and richard related the particulars of his recent misfortune  humph well after all experience is the only school we all learn in i dont doubt but what youve seen the last of both money and letters keep your eyes open in the future  ill try to i shall not forget this lesson in a hurry  but at the same time dont be too suspicious of everybody with whom you may chance to come in contact  ill remember what you say sir  now about finding you a situation i wish i had an opening here for you id make a business chap of you  i should like to work for you mr joyce  unfortunately there is no room at presentthat is there is nothing i can offer you  ill take anything youll give me exclaimed richard earnestly  yes but you cant do anything you cant drive a truckhere in the cityand you dont know a thing about packing hides besides such work would be altogether too heavy for you and it never pays the wages that lighter but more intelligent labor receives  i suppose you are right sir  i am i dont want to gloss things over for you its the worst thing in the world for a young fellow just starting out to have a rosy view of the business world which is composed of steady work and hard knocks about equally mixed youve got too much brains to work altogether with your hands and one must find out what he is best suited to how would you like to get into the book and stationery line  very much indeed  do you think you could make anything out of it make it the business of your life so that you would stand some show of advancement on the strength of the interest you took in it  i think i could replied richard slowly somehow deeply moved by mr joyces earnestness i always liked booksnot only to read them but to handle and to arrange them as well at home i was the librarian of our sundayschool and i got out the catalogue and all that of course it was not a great work but i enjoyed it and often wished i might have charge of a big library or something like that  mr joyce eyed the boy thoughtfully  reckon i was right thought youd take to books persons with your kind of a forehead always do well come along ill see what i can do toward getting you a place with a friend of mine  locking up his desk mr joyce put on his hat and led the way out on the street  well have to hurry he said or well find my friend has gone home  richard needed no urging with a strangely light heart he kept close behind the leather merchant  they passed along several blocks and at length turned into beekman street  here we are said mr joyce finally this is my friends place of business     chapter xiv  work obtained   the establishment to which the leather merchant had brought richard was an imposing one situated in a massive stone building and having large and heavy plate glass doors and windows a formidable array of blankbooks and sets of wellknown authors works were piled up in the window which bore the firms name    williams  mann  directly to the left of the entrance inside stood a great safe and further on appeared an almost interminable row of shelves and drawers all apparently crammed with articles pertaining to the stationery and book trade  stepping up to a salesman mr joyce inquired  is mr williams in  mr williams has gone to chicago was the polite reply  chicago eh when will he be back  we expect him back day after tomorrow possibly tomorrow afternoon  humph mr joyce rubbed his chin is mr mann about  yes sir just gone up to the stockroom  tell him id like to see him for a few minutes  yes sir mr joyce i believe  thats the name  ill send word at once wont you sit down  thanks  mr joyce sank into an office chair  going to a speaking tube behind one of the broad counters the salesman sent his message up to one of the floors above  mr mann will be down directly he said after a moment  in five minutes a stout baldheaded gentleman of fifty came down by the elevator at one side and stepped forward  how are you tim he exclaimed thrusting out a chubby hand  first rate mel returned mr joyce this is a young friend of mine richard dare he continued  mr mann shook hands cordially  he has come to the city to try his luck went on the leather merchant he has a taste for your line so i brought him around to see if you hadnt an opening for him  now an application made in this way and coming from an ordinary source would have met with a courteous negative but the firm of williams  mann were under obligations to mr joyce who had on several occasions indorsed their notes for many thousands of dollars besides all three men were old friends so mr mann gave the request every attention  we are rather full of hands he said slowly but still i might find room for him have you had any business training he continued turning to richard  very little sir replied the boy promptly though it came hard to make such a confession  he hasnt had a bit interposed mr joyce hes as jolly green as we were when we came here he added in a whisper but hes bright honest and levelheaded and ive taken a fancy to him and want you to give him a chance  do you like to handle books asked mr mann  yes sir very much  yes its just what he does like put in the leather merchant place him among the books if you can  perhaps i can do that but i wont be able to pay you much until you are experienced  i must earn my living sir said richard respectfully but in a firm manner  of course he must added mr joyce he has just lost his father he continued in a low tone and i suppose its hard times at home  have you known him long asked mr mann as the two walked to one side  only two days  two days  yes  is hethat is suppose i put him in a place of trust it will be a risk that  ill go security for him  and you have only known him two days tim seems to me youre not as cautious as you used to be  never mind i know some honest faces when i see them and his is one let me tell you how we became acquainted  the two men continued their conversation for several minutes  ill take you on at once said mr mann presently to richard i suppose you would like that best  yes sir  you can have the hour remaining today to get broken in i will give you six dollars a week at the start and if you learn as rapidly as mr joyce thinks you will ill raise you in a few weeks to seven or eight  thank you sir ill try to make myself worth it  its hard work and you will have to pitch right in mr mann went on we have no use for laggards  well im going broke in mr joyce now ive placed you i hope you will make something of yourself he added  ill try to replied the boy many thanks to you for your kindness  if you come down in my neighborhood drop in and see me  thank you i will with pleasure was richards reply  we will go right upstairs to the stockroom said mr mann after mr joyce had departed we have a large pile of pamphlets and books which the clerk we discharged left all mixed up i was just assisting the stockclerk in making out a new division of the department  entering the elevator they were soon taken to a floor three stories above the stockroom was in the rear the large windows overlooking an alley  the place was piled high with books of all descriptions some in sets and others separate from cheap reprints to costly volumes filled with etchings and engravings  here mr massanet ive brought a young man to help you said mr mann addressing the clerk in charge a pleasantlooking fellow apparently not many years older than richard  he came forward and gave the boy a kindly look of welcome  we need help here he said there is plenty to do  his name is darerichard dare continued mr mann i do not know him but a friend recommended him  well soon see what he can do replied frank massanet with a smile are you going to work now he asked of richard  yes break him in at once said mr mann ill leave him in your charge mr massanet will tell you anything you want to know he went on to the boy he is the head here  left alone with frank massanet it did not take long for richard to become well acquainted with the stockclerk who gave him a few brief directions and then set him to work filling up broken sets of books dusting them and placing them in a case for shipment  we must get this whole batch away by next tuesday said massanet because on wednesday another large consignment will arrive and we must have room to handle it  the work delighted richard and he pitched in with a will it was new and novel as well as agreeable and besides doing it for pay made it no task at all  talking did not interfere with the progress of either of the workers and attracted by frank massanets cordial manner richard gradually revealed to the stockclerk why he had come to the city and what his ambitions were  in return frank related much concerning himself his father who had been a frenchman was dead and his mother sister martha and himself kept house uptown on the east side it was apparent that the young man was the main support of the family for he said that just previous to his death his father had been unfortunate in business and had lost nearly every dollar he possessed his mother did the work at home while his sister earned six dollars a week at typewriting  it is pleasant to have a home to go to said richard after a bit you dont know how queer i felt to be away from the others  homesick asked frank kindly and then impelled by a sudden warm feeling he placed his hand on richards shoulder the action small as it was brought a little lump to the boys throat  nonot exactly he replied only  i know what you mean before i got this place i went to boston for two months to try my luck and i was among strangers  some day when i can afford it i intend to bring my folks to the city richard went on  where are you stopping now asked frank  with a sailor friend of mine down on west street  west street it is not a very nice locality  no but he is very kind and so is his wife they keep a restaurant he was in a railroad accident with me and thats the reason he takes to me  yes accidents often make strange people friends  but i must hunt up a regular boardinghouse went on richard i suppose a good one that is cheap is hard to find  you are right how much do you expect to pay if i may ask  not over four dollars im to get six here and i cant afford any more when my salary is raised ill be willing to go a little more but not much because i want to send home all the money i can  frank massanet was silent for a moment richards way pleased him and he felt drawn towards the newcomer  my mother has been thinking of taking a boarder he said slowly we have a spare hall bedroom it is not very large but it has good ventilation and is neatly furnished i used it whenwhen my father was alive  would your mother take me asked richard that is could she afford to at four dollars a week  i cant say  when i get an increase in wages ill pay four and a half went on the boy i would like to live with you he continued openheartedly  frank smiled  ill speak to my mother tonight said he and ill let you know tomorrow morning     chapter xv  new quarters   at six oclock frank massanet announced the days work ended and bidding his friend goodnight richard hurried off to west street his heart was light over his own good fortune but heavy when he thought of the losses he had sustained earlier in the day  the watch below was crowded and doc linyard presided at the piestand and the desk he noticed richards grave face and surmised that all was not right  youre late he exclaimed come sit down to supper ill bet you havent eaten a mouthful  ive had bad luck replied richard bad luck for you and good luck for myself  and sitting down beside the desk he made a clean breast of what had transpired earlier in the day  i know i have been careless he added and i dont deserve to be trusted any more  never mind returned the old sailor cheerily its too bad but as betty often says its no use crying over spilt milk so well make the best of it  ill have the advertisement put in tomorrow said the boy and ill add that former letters have been lost  thats a good idea and dont tell betty it would only worry her who knows but what those letters didnt amount to much after all  at all events im going to get them back if i can  and your two dollars too the little rascal but you said you had good news  so i have mr joyce got me a place  and richard told of the meeting in the postoffice and his subsequent engagement by williams  mann  well im downright glad to hear that cried doc linyard heartily reckon you are on the right tack at last  the walking and working had made richard hungry and he was not backward about sitting down and eating a hearty supper but he insisted upon paying for all he had and seeing that the boy really meant it doc linyard took the money though not without reluctance  as soon as he had finished eating richard went to park row and handed in the advertisement the clerk informed him that no other letters had been received nor had any applications for them been made  returning to the watch below richard sat down and wrote a second letter home which he shortly after posted along with the precious packet of chewing gum for madge the old sailor offered him a ticket to the theater which had been left in the restaurant for the privilege of hanging a lithograph in the window but this the boy declined with thanks and retired early so as to be on hand promptly in the morning  seven oclock was the hour for opening at williams  manns and five minutes before that time richard presented himself and was let in by the sleepy porter the elevator was not running at this time in the day so richard took the narrow iron stairs and was soon in the stockroom where he went to work at what he had been doing the previous day until frank massanet arrived  my mother would like you to take dinner with us said frank when he had given directions concerning how the work should go on she would like to know you before she takes you as a regular boarder  can she take me at four dollars asked richard  she thinks she can you can talk it over together when you see herthat is if you will come  certainly i will  its the best way perhaps our board might not suit you  ill risk it laughed richard  they were allowed an hour at noon and at exactly twelve oclock the two hurried off frank led the way up to the third avenue elevated station and a five minutes ride brought them to their destination  i generally bring my lunch with me explained the stockclerk on the way and i have dinner when i get home in the evening by that means i save my car fare and have plenty of time to eat the best meal of the day  its the better way said richard do you ride morning and night  only when the weather is bad when it is clear i save the ten cents  so would i besides its healthy exercise returned the boy  the massanets occupied the second floor of a modest little flat of six rooms it was a cheerful home and mrs massanet a pleasant middleaged frenchwoman greeted richard cordially  you are indeed welcome mistair dare she said with a beaming face francois have tole me everything of you and i feel as eef i know you long  mrs massanet had the peculiar french accent of the province of lorraine and richard frequently experienced difficulty in understanding her but her motherly way soon put him at ease and in a few minutes he felt perfectly at home  this is my sister said frank as a tall darkeyed girl of sixteen entered mattie this is richard dare  frank has been telling us of you said mattie massanet as she took richards hand we talked you all over last night she added with a merry twinkle of her eye  im sure it couldnt have been a very bad talk if you had a hand in it said richard gallantly  they were soon at the table and having by a lucky chance or was it the girls natural tact struck the right vein the conversation became quite animated and soon all were on very good terms  i like you verra mouch said mrs massanet when richard had finished and i shall be pleased to have you as a boardereef you like ze diner  thank you mrs massanet i shall be thankful to have you take me i know it will feel quite like a home  ve make zat so ve keep no hotel garni evenonly for one  thank you returned richard he did not understand the french which means a lodginghouse can i come tonight  oh yees  so it was arranged that he should become a boarder at the massanets and having this settled took quite a load from his mind now if he could only do his work well for williams  mann he would be all right and have every chance of eventually attaining the object of his metropolitan venture  of one thing he was surefrank massanets friendship and help and in his present place he knew these would count for a good deal  little did he dream that the position kindhearted timothy joyce had procured for him would lead him to the hardest trials of his youthful life and place him in the bitterest situation he had ever yet experienced     chapter xvi  pep   in a week richard felt quite at home both in the stockroom at williams  manns and at the massanets  during that time mr williams had returned from chicago and both of the members of the firm seemed to be well satisfied by the way in which their new clerk discharged the duties assigned to him  a warm friendship sprang up between frank massanet and richarda friendship that was destined to bear important results the stockclerk though richards superior in the business acted more like a chum and in the evenings the two accompanied by mattie massanet walked talked played games or listened to mrs massanets music on the flutina and were all but inseparable  richard received several letters from homeone from his mother congratulating him on the position he had secured and another from grace and nancy full of village gossip and what people had said about his going away  both frank and richard loved their work and by the second week the books in the stockroom were in a neater and handier condition than they had ever been before and frank expressed his pleasure at having some one who could really help and not hinder as the discharged clerk had done  on tuesday morning of the second week richard was hurrying to the store a little earlier than usual the big consignment of books was soon to arrive and they must have even more room for it than had at first been anticipated  as he came down the bowery at a rapid gait a small figure crossed the street directly before him and stopped to gaze into the wellfilled window of a german bakery it was the street arab who had robbed richard in park row  for an instant richard could hardly believe his eyes but stepping up he took a closer view and then grasped the urchin by the arm  instinctively the street arab shrank away then he turned his pinched and startled face around and seeing who it was that held him gave a loud cry of alarm  oh please mister please lemme go he pleaded i wont do it again please sir no i wont oh dont lock me up mister  that piteous appeal went straight to richards heart if he had felt any indignation it melted away at the sight of that haggard famished desperate look  what have you done with the stuff you took from my pockets he asked but his tones were not very harsh  the boy began to whimper  ii aint got de money no more he sobbed its all gone mister i spent every cent of it but two nickels fer medicine and de doctor please dont lock me up mister  medicine and the doctor repeated richard rather astonished by this unexpected statement who is sick  me dad mister  your dad your father  yes mister been sick going on two months now and aint no better  richard looked at the boy sharply he had been deceived so many times that he was half inclined to discredit the urchins story  its the truth mister went on the boy seeing the look of distrust i aint tellin no lies so help  whats your name  pep sir  pep what  the urchin held down his head  i aint got no other name he answered hesitatingly  oh you must have exclaimed richard come out with it  but the little ragged figure only began to cry again harder than ever  come tell me i wont have you arrested urged richard  oh thank you mister it would kill dad to know id been stealin i told him i made the money sellin papers  that was a lie said richard sternly  i know it mister but i couldnt help it it was better than tellin him id been stealin i wouldnt have taken yer money only i was afraid hed die if he didnt have de doctor and de medicine so help  there dont swear interrupted richard if you were so hard up you should have asked me for help i would have given you something  i would have asked only most of de people laughs at me and tells me to clear out and they think im lyin when i say dads sick and say they guess he must drink de money up which is a lie itself cause dad dont drink a drop hes got pneumony so de doctor says and hes coughin all de time  is your mother home  aint got no mother she died when i was a kid  well pep im sorry for you said richard kindly and i wont do anything to you for having taken that money but those lettersthey were valuable what have you done with them  ive got em home sir ill bring em to you right away sir  i havent got time to wait now returned richard highly elated to find that doc linyards property was safe will you meet me here at six oclock tonight  yes sir  sure remember i must have those letters  ill bring em ive got em hid in de garret i didnt open em or noddin i cant read only a little newspaper printnough to find out whats in de paper ter sell it  well i shall expect you sure replied richard ill give you ten cents for bringing them he added to make certain that pep would not change him mind have you had any breakfast  i havent had no eatin since yesterday mornin  what would you do if i gave you ten cents  peps eyes opened in wonder in his knockabout life he had met all sorts of people yet here was certainly a new kind  yer jokin he gasped  no im not  then if i had ten cents id go and buy some morning papersi could sell em yetand take de money home  all of it  yes sir every cent  richard felt in his pocket he had just sixteen cents in change  here is the ten cents he said handing it out and here is six cents i want you to buy something to eat for that  slowly pep took the money he did not know but he might be dreaming  thank you mister youyoure good to me he said in a low tone  im in a hurry now went on richard otherwise id talk to you some more i want to find out how you get along and how your father makes out you can trust me  i know i cannow replied pep and ill be on hand at six oclock with those letters sure im very very thankful fer what youve done indeed i am and ill try to make it up to you some day see if i dont  anyway dont steal any more said richard it isnt right and it will land you in jail sooner or later  i never took noddin before replied pep and i wont agin  i hope so pep  will yer please tell me yer name  richard dare  ill remember it mr dare yere the first gentleman ever noticed me and im much obliged even if you hadnt given me a cent  i shall expect to see you at six oclock or a few minutes later was richards reply and fearful of being late at the store he hurried off  the street urchin stood still gazing after him there were tears in the light blue eyes and a choking sensation in the thin little throat  he must be one of them missionaries i once heard tell of was peps thought they said they went around doing good and thats what hes doing six cents for something to eat and a dime to buy papers with thats the best luck ive had in five years if i dont make a quarter by nine oclock im no good and ill never steal againi wontas sure as my name is pep clover     chapter xvii  getting acquainted   when richard reached williams  manns he found frank massanet already hard at work he had told the stockclerk of the robbery in park row and now he related its sequel in the shape of the incident of the morning  well maybe you did right said frank although the majority of the street boys are not to be trusted beyond sight you will find out by this evening if the boys word is worth anything  i think i can trust that boy replied richard i believe he was truly penitent my treating him as i did may be the making of him  williams  mann employed in their various departments between fifteen and twenty clerks they were mostly young fellows and outside of a tendency to play practical jokes because he was a newcomer they treated richard very well and the boy was with one exception on good terms all round  this one exception was a young man of twenty  his name was earle norris and he was head of the shipping department richards duties brought him into daily contact with the shippingclerk but though the latter treated him fairly well there was something in the others manner that he did not like and consequently he did not associate as freely with norris as that young man seemed to desire  norris was something of a dandy in his way and rarely appeared at the store otherwise than faultlessly dressed of course when at work he changed his coat cravat collar and so forth so as not to soil them but he never left without looking as much fixed up as when he had arrived  youre a new fellow here he said to richard when the latter came down to see if a certain box of books had as yet been sent away  yes new here and new in new york richard replied smiling  i thought you werent a new yorker norris went on how do you like things in the city  firstrate i havent seen much of the place yet though  where do you live  i board with the massanets  oh a relative  oh no i never knew them until i got acquainted with frank here  rather slow at their house i imagine  oh i like it very well  my folks live in yonkers said norris but i couldnt stand it there though i had a good position i like new york life you ought to be over at our boardinghouse there are six of us young fellows and were out every night and have lots of sport  thank you i am very well content where i am said richard coldly he did not like the manner in which the shippingclerk had spoken of frank and his family  i did not think the massanets kept boarders continued norris i thought they were too retired for that  i am the only one and am treated like one of the family  frank has got a sister hasnt he  yes  maybe thats the attraction suggested norris my landlady has a pretty daughter too  it is not the attraction said richard flushing though she like her mother treats me nicely he added stoutly and with a certain amount of loyalty  oh well its all right put in the shippingclerk hastily i dont want you to change if youre satisfied only if you get tired of being quiet let me know i tell you theres lots of fun to be had if you only know how to get it  i guess i wont change at least for the present replied the boy  when he returned to the stockroom he related to frank what norris had said about keeping too quiet  i dont agree with him said the stockclerk i dont know what he means by having lots of sport and all that but i never believed in being out late nights it isnt right and besides it doesnt pay havent you noticed the deep circles around norriss eyes they come from a want of sleep and how long do you suppose he can stand that sort of thing and his work here without breaking down why i remember when he came here a year ago he looked twice as healthy as he does now  then he is foolish said richard i wouldnt want to run the risk of ruining my health especially needlessly  of course if our way of living is too quiet for youi suppose it would be for most young fellowsyou are at liberty to leave at any time  thank you frank i know i can but i reckon ill stay just as long as you care to keep me or at least until i can afford to bring the family here  norris has approached me several times on the subject of joining him in some of his frolics went on frank but i have never gone out with him  does he get a very large salary  no more than iten dollars a week  i should think it would take every cent he had after his board was paid to dress him his clothing is more fashionable than mr manns  he certainly isnt saving any money replied frank  frank massanet had his own idea about earle norris and his peculiar ways he was almost certain that there would some day be a startling development at williams  manns but having as yet no proofs he kept quiet concerning his suspicions  during the afternoon richard had occasion again to visit the packingroom and once more norris who was the only one present approached him  how would you like to go to niblos garden with me tonight he asked i have two tickets and i would be pleased to have your company  i am much obliged im sure but i have an errand tonight replied richard i must deliver two letters  well that ought not to take you all the evening come along i dont want to have the extra ticket and not use it a friend of mine from brooklyn was going with me but he has just dropped me a postal card saying he is sick  cant you sell the extra ticket  oh i suppose i might but i dont care to go alone explained norris come youll enjoy it i know  richard was sorely tempted the play at the theater was a standard one and the leading actor one of renown surely there wouldnt be much harm in going  if any other person than norris had asked him he would probably have accepted  yet his reasoning on the point was remarkably clear he was sure that there had been nothing in his own manner to draw him to norris and this being so why did the latter take such an interest in one who was but a step removed from a stranger to him  no i guess not he replied after a pause i dont care to go  oh well dont then replied norris coldly i only asked you out of kindness being as you were a stranger  and he turned his back on the boy and walked away  richard told frank where he was to meet pep and added that if the stolen letters were forthcoming he would take them to doc linyards before returning to the massanets  at six oclock the two quitted the store together and walked over to the bowery pep was already waiting for richard he had a big bundle of evening papers under his arm and seemed to have improved both his capital and his time  heres de letters mister he said holding out the two envelopes and the slip im sorry i got em dirty  for his unwashed hands had left many marks upon the white paper  richard took the letters eagerly and put them in an inside pocket  how have you done today he asked  firstrate had luck ever since yer started me im worth sixty cents now say he went on in a whisper im going to pay yer back that two dollars soon as i kin  and how is your father  he is a bit better todayhe was awful yesterday can i see yer here in a few days  why  about that money i want yer to have it back its the first time i took anything  yes you can see me replied richard somehow pleased at the idea of becoming better acquainted with the urchin in whom he found himself taking a strong interest you can generally meet me at the same time youve met me today  all right ill have der chink in a few days see if i dont have an evening telegram or mail and express i havent any change replied richard  ho what yer take me for  and thrusting a copy of each paper in richards hand pep darted across to the elevated station crying his wares as he went  not such a bad chap i guess said frank i have seen worse fellows than him reform i must see if we cant get him in our mission  ill go right down to west street with these letters returned richard they may be very important  im sorry i cant go with you said frank but im going out with mother will you be long  i guess not of course i cant tell doc linyard may want me to do something for himwrite a letter or so and that all takes time ill be back by nine i guess  and with these words the two separated frank hurrying up town and richard to carry his news to the old sailor     chapter xviii  a strange situation   the road to west street was no longer a strange one to richard and it took him but a short quarter of an hour to reach the watch below  as usual the restaurant was crowded and the merry jests of the sailors mingled with the rattle of dishes and clatter of knives  doc linyard was glad to see the boy and immediately asked how he was progressing and how he liked his position  i have good news for you said richard  and he handed over the two letters  are they the ones as were lost asked the old sailor  yes i caught the boy and made him return them  did you get your money too went on linyard as he cut the envelopes open  not yet but im pretty sure of getting it in the near future  hope you do two dollars aint much but its something and nowadays everything counts will you read these letters for me my eyesight aint none of the best any more and besides writing is kinder stiff reading for me at the best  certainly i will mr  avast there on that figurehead interrupted the old tar  doc linyard ill do it with pleasure  but it was no pleasure after all for richard to read the two communications for each was a disappointment  the first was from a firm of lawyers who wished to take the case in hand at astonishingly low terms which must however be paid in advance the other had been sent by a private detective who was willing to institute a search for the missing party for the modest sum of three dollars per day also payable in advance  just what i thought they might be observed doc linyard when the reading was finished you can tear them up we dont want such outside help  richard did as directed  its a pity that such letters should cause you so much trouble went on the old sailor but thats the way of the world  have you had any other letters asked richard for he had not seen doc linyard for several days and thought it possible that something might have turned up in the meantime  nary a word ive put the advertisement in the papersthree of emtwice now and not a single answer  its too bad have you heard anything from the property in england  yes i got a letter today asking me to hurry as they wanted to settle affairs up there  did you answer  not yet you know its hard lines for me to write  if you wish ill write for you  thank you ill wait a day or two yet and see if something doesnt turn up  it was not yet eight oclock when richard after having a bit of lunch left the restaurant to return to the massanets feeling that it was early yet and having a desire to do some window gazing he did not go up the bowery but strolled up broadway instead  the magnificent windows and their rare and costly exhibits were to him an enjoyment of the keenest sort and as he approached the neighborhood of astor place where the book stores seem to have congregated he walked slower and slower taking in all there was to be seen of each establishment how the windows were dressed and the stock arranged and wondering away down in his heart if he would ever own or have an interest in any similar establishment  while deeply engaged in reading the titles of a number of volumes in a certain window he felt a light tap on his shoulder and turning found himself face to face with earle norris  the shippingclerk was dressed in the height of style including low cut shoes and carried a heavy goldheaded cane  hello dare he exclaimed pleasantly what brings you up here  for an instant richard was taken aback not only at meeting norris but at being greeted so familiarly after what had occurred during the day  i have just finished my errand and thought id take a walk to see the sights he returned how is it you are not at the theater  as i said i didnt care to go alone so took your advice and sold the extra ticket and also my own ill take a walk along with you if you dont mind  richard was not overpleased at the proposition yet he could not very well object except by seeming rude and from this he shrank so he gave a mild assent  you see i like to get on good terms with all the boys explained norris as they walked leisurely along im on the best of terms with every one in the establishment but massanet and id like to be with him only hes so awfully slow  frank massanet is a very nice fellow said richard stoutly  oh yestoo nice for me though but let that pass everybody has his peculiarities have a smoke  and norris pulled two stronglooking cigars from his vest pocket  im much obliged replied the boy i dont smoke  try one they are fine went on the shippingclerk stopping to get a light no time like the present for making a beginning im quite sure it wont make you sick  i dont think i care to try was all richard could say and he heartily wished earle norris would go his own way  oh well its all right if you dont care to i find it just the thing to settle my nerves after a big days work  they walked on in silence for nearly a block and the boy was wondering how best to leave norris without offending him when the latter spoke up  here are the rooms of the laurel club he said pointing up to the narrow but brilliantly lighted stairways of a handsome building just around the corner of a side street  the laurel club repeated richard  yes it is a club of about twenty young fellows i am a member we have a readingroom and another for all kinds of games  norris did not take the trouble to add that all kinds of games had narrowed down to simply card playing and that for money too  just come up for a moment he went on i wish to get a book i left there a few nights ago  ill wait for you here replied richard  no no i want to show you the rooms we have some fine pictures and all that up there  somewhat against his will richard consented norris led the way up three flights of stairs and then down a side hall  stopping at a certain door he gave two distinct knocks followed by a single one  there was a hurried movement within and then the door which had been securely locked was cautiously opened  hello springer exclaimed norris to the tall young man who had admitted them youre locked up as if this was a subtreasury this is a friend of mine mr dare mr springer our worthy secretary  glad to know you mr dare said the other and he gave richards hand a tight grip but at the same time cast a sidelong inquiring glance at norris  hes a green one murmured norris as he brushed past dont you think we have it cozy up here he continued turning to richard  richard was not prepared to answer in the affirmative his introduction into the place even though his curiosity has been small was a disappointment the room had been nicely furnished once but the carpet and the furniture showed signs of much wear and the pictures of which norris had spoken proved to be several of a remarkably loud sort but of no real artistic value or excellence  many of the boys here tonight springer asked norris  foley nichols and two or three others will you take a hand in  maybe ill see in a little while  my night at the door growled springer i hate it  never mind as long as we cant pay a porter some one has got to do it among us ill get my book added the shippingclerk glancing at richard  he entered the next room closing the door carefully behind him richard thought he heard the clinking of glasses within but he was not sure  in a few moments norris reappeared  come in he said the boys would like to know you  not dreaming of what was to come richard accepted the invitation  he found himself in a small room well lighted the air was heavy with tobacco smoke and the fumes of liquor were not wanting but what astonished him most was a group of five fellows seated at the center table playing cards with several piles of money in front of them  they are gambling he thought with something like horror i wish i was out of it  gentlemen my friend mr dare said earle norris come sit down and make yourself at home he added slapping richard on the shoulder     chapter xix  the laurel club   richard felt decidedly uncomfortable over the situation in which he now found himself it was so unexpectedit had been so forced upon him that he did not know what to do  come take a hand in repeated earle norris offering him a chair at the table and at the same time removing his hat  thank you but i do not play cards replied richard coldly  oh youll soon learn returned the shippingclerk come sit down and ill give you a few points  i dont care to learn was richards firm reply i never gambled in my life and i dont intend to begin now  say norris what do you want to bring such a fellow up here for asked one of the players with a scowl we were just having a jolly good game and dont care to have it spoilt  oh thats all right im aware of that but mr dare is a newcomer to new york and im only showing him around a bit  we dont want any one here who is going to give us away put in another player harrison your cut  im quite sure mr dare wont be so mean said norris come make yourself at home  but during the last few minutes richard had been doing some heavy thinking and the conclusion of it all was that he had better get out as soon as possible he had nothing in common with such a crowd and to remain might place him in an awkward if not dangerous position  i thought you only wanted to get a book he said to norris  so i did but now we are up here we might as well stay awhile and have some fun its early yet  its not early for me responded richard i promised to be back by nine oclock and it must be near that now just give me my hat  for norris had taken his guests hat and placed it on a hook beside his own  for reply the shippingclerk pulled richard down into a seat  dont be a fool he whispered we wont hurt you all the fellows here are gentlemen no use of offending them  richard sprang to his feet  i dont want to stay and thats all there is to it he exclaimed if your friends are offended by my going away why i cant help it i didnt come up here of my own choosing in the first place and i claim the right to leave whenever i please  oh you do do you sneered norris well well see about that  and he placed himself between richard and the door  richard grew pale  perhaps ill have to fight my way out he thought i suppose this is nothing but a gambling den well ill fight if it comes to that he finished and his eyes flashed with determination  come norris none of that said a tall young man who sat at the head of the table no one shall be forced to stay here against his will you should have found out if your friend cared for this sort of thing before you brought him  it was seldom that don wimler said so much either at the clubrooms or outside and every one knew he meant every word  earle norriss face fell  of course if dare wont stay he neednt he said slowly i only thought i was doing him a favor by bringing him  i hope mr dare that you will not speak of what you have seen here tonight went on don wimler it might place us in an unpleasant predicament  richard hesitated if i do it will only be so far as it concerns mr norris and myself he replied i have no desire to hurt you or the others  and going to the door richard passed swiftly through it to the outer room norris was after him on the instant  what do you mean by saying you may tell on me he demanded with an evil look in his eyes  i meant just what i said retorted richard i may be green but im not so green as you take me to be let me go  norris had taken a tight hold of his shoulder  you shant go till you promise to keep the thing quiet he replied grimly  for reply richard gathered himself together and gave the shippingclerk a shove that sent that individual sprawling to the floor  before norris could regain his feet richard had unlocked the outer door and was speeding down the stairs  i made a failure of it that time muttered the shippingclerk as he slowly arose to his feet but well get even yet and more than even too  richard breathed a sigh of relief when he emerged once more upon the street  im glad i found norris out any way he said to himself as he hurried along i think i can safely put him down as a bad egg  retracing his way down broadway the boy at length crossed over to grand street and directed his steps towards the east side  when he reached the massanets it was quarter past nine mattie let him in stating that her mother and her brother had not yet returned  frank had told her of the street urchin and the letters and she was anxious to hear about the result of richards visit to doc linyards trusting it had been good  richard related the particulars he did not mention norris and finally the talk drifted around to pep the street urchin  i feel sorry for him said mattie massanet we must find out where he lives and see if we cant do something for him and his sick father  ive been thinking of it returned richard he is very shy and wouldnt even tell me his last name but perhaps when he sees that i mean him no harm hell grow more communicative  we might go down and see his father on a sunday went on mattie i suppose the neighborhood in which he lives isnt a very nice one to visit at night  ill ask him if we can come  there was something about mattie massanet that richard liked very much she was gentle as well as lively and sympathetic as well as full of fun she reminded him strongly of his sister nancy in one way and his sister grace in another indeed it was mattie who made the massanet flat a real home for him  presently there were footsteps on the stairs and in a moment mrs massanet and her son entered they had been shopping over in the french district and carried several bundles  it was now drawing towards ten oclock and only a few words were spoken before the goodnights were said  in the upper hall richard asked frank to come to his room and giving his friend a chair and seating himself upon the edge of the bed he told of his adventure with norris  i have suspected norris of something like that for several months said frank i was tolerable sure that he was spending more money than he was making now he must be an expert player or else an unfair one i suppose he thought as long as he got you there the rest would follow easy enough im glad you didnt give in if you had he or his companions would have won every cent you had and perhaps have placed you in debt to them  what would you do tell on him  williams  mann ought to know what kind of a fellow their shippingclerk is replied frank yet one word about it may cost norris his position suppose you wait a day or two watch how he acts and think it over  richard thought this was good advice and told frank he guessed it was just what he would do and on this conclusion the two separated  far better would it have been for both however if they had taken their information to the firm at once later happenings will explain why     chapter xx  trouble brewing   in the morning richard went to work as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened it was not until after dinner that business called him down to the packingroom and then there were several others besides norris present  yet the shippingclerk evinced a strong desire to talk to richard privately and finally accosted him just as he was going up the stairs  say i hope youll let what happened last night pass he said in an undertone i only wanted to show you a little of life here and didnt dream youd resent it as you did  well next time you will understand that i mean what i say returned richard sharply  i know i was to blame went on norris humbly but to tell the truth id had a glass of champagne at supper time and my head wasnt as clear as it should have been if you say anything of it here though i may be discharged  well i wont say anything unless something more happens richard replied i dont want to get any one into trouble but ill tell you mr norris he went on i think youre on the wrong track take my advice even if i am younger than you and steer clear of the laurel club  ill think of it replied the shippingclerk turning away  i guess ive shut the young fool up he muttered to himself he might have placed me in a decided fix if he had told all he knew  of course richard reported the interview to frank indeed the two were now deep in each others confidence and no such thought as keeping the matter to himself would have crossed richards mind  perhaps it will teach him a lesson said frank but i doubt it better keep an eye on him  later in the day mr mann came up to the stockroom looking very black he asked a number of questions about some books that had been sent to troy four days before the party that received them says there were five or six sets of irvings works badly damaged do you know anything about it  no sir replied frank promptly those we packed up were all in firstclass order  well there was some damaged stock here  yes sir quite a good deal that was soaked by that waterpipe bursting three weeks ago but mr williams ordered us to sort it out and it was all sent to the secondhand dealers last week  are you sure  positive sir dare here helped me ship it off  mr mann turned to richard  thats so mr mann put in the latter and i remember well that before the last box went down we hunted high and low to see that nothing that was damaged in the least should be left behind  well its mighty queer how those people in troy should get twenty odd volumes of damaged stock well have to make a reduction in their bill i suppose be careful of the goods shipped in the future  and with this retort mr mann took the elevator and went below  i cant see how those people could have got a single damaged volume said richard when the head of the firm had departed i remember that box well and every volume in it was perfect  on returning to the massanets that evening frank heard bad news an aunt had died over in port richmond on staten island his mother had gone to the place at once and wished her son to come to the funeral on the following afternoon  of course ill have to go said frank to richard ill stop at the store on my way down and let the firm know and also help you enough to get along while i am gone  this frank did he readily obtained permission from mr williams to be absent and at ten oclock richard found himself in sole charge of the stockroom  there were a number of important orders to fill and the boy worked like a beaver to get them done in time  im so glad for the chance to do something for frank he has been so kind said richard to himself besides some day i may wish him to do me a like favor  richard was careful that there should be no mistakes and it is perhaps needless to state that he had both eyes wide open for damaged books  while hard at work with his coat off and his sleeves rolled up mr williams appeared he was quite an old man and in many respects much pleasanter than his partner  i came up to see how you were making out he said you will have your hands full trying to do two mens work  oh i guess i can manage it replied richard pleasantly i wouldnt want to do it very long though he added  ill give you a hand said mr williams this used to be my work years ago and i still like it  here is an order from pittsburgh i cant read very well said richard id be much obliged if you will help me on that  all right give it to me  in a few minutes employer and employee were hard at work together mr williams had not intended to stay very long but he became interested both in the work and in richard and it was only when two hours later a message came for him that he went below  he is a nice man thought richard when mr williams had gone i am sure he would not have treated mr mann with more consideration than he did me no wonder mr joyce called for him first the day he brought me here  a little later earle norris came up  hello alone he exclaimed  yes  hows that thought massanet was as steady as clockwork  richard told him why frank was absent  oh thats all right said norris  what brought you up asked richard  i came up to see if martins order from pittsburgh was filled yet its got to go first thing in the morning  there it is been done half an hour ago replied richard  he did not think it necessary to add that mr williams had filled it  all right send it down at once replied norris rather tough making you do all the work he added id strike for higher pay  i am very well satisfied with the way i am treated returned richard  norris disappeared and a moment later richard sent the crate containing the goods down on the elevator to be packed up below after that he worked steadily until six oclock at which time he had the satisfaction of knowing that every order sent up had been promptly and correctly filled  richard found frank and his mother already at home when he reached there in the evening the funeral of mrs massanets sister had been a quiet but sad affair and richard saw that no one was in humor for much talking and all retired early  frank was not a little astonished in the morning to find that richard had done all the work so well and also that mr williams had helped  i declare between you youll soon be cutting me out of a job he laughed  oh i hope not returned richard if id thought that i surely would not have worked so hard  oh its all right replied frank  if i ever go into business for myself he thought richard dare is just the clerk i want to help me he is bright and not afraid of work and those are the fellows who get along  frank massanets one idea was to some day own a bookstore of his own he understood the trade thoroughly and with the proper location and a fair amount of cash he was tolerably certain that he could make such a place pay his savings amounted to several hundred dollars now he was only waiting for the time to come when they would be at least a thousand then he intended to strike out for himself  the two worked on steadily through most of the day late in the afternoon a boy came up from below  mr mann would like to see you in his private office he said to richard  the latter was surprised at the announcement since he had gone to work he had not been called for once before  what does he want of me  i dont know replied the boy he is awful mad about something and has sent for several of the others  i cant understand it said richard to frank as he put on his coat i dont know of anything that has gone wrong  and considerably worried richard descended to the ground floor and knocked on the door of the private office     chapter xxi  richard in trouble   richard found mr mann alone the gentleman was seated at his desk and greeted the boy coldly  you sent for me i believe began richard  yes replied mr mann i want to have a little talk with you he gazed at richard sharply how long have you lived in new york he asked  two weeks sir i was only here two days before i came to work for you  but you are pretty well acquainted with the place  not very well sir i was never here before but i think i can find my way anywhere quick enough if you wish to send me on an errand he added thinking mr mann might possibly have some commission for him to execute  no doubt you could replied the gentleman dryly but i dont wish to send you anywhere you are an orphan i believe where do you live  i board with the massanets  does norris board with them too  no sir  where does he live  i dont know  you dont know  no sir  mr mann gazed at richard severely  i thought you two were good friends he said  i hardly know norris replied richard he is certainly no friend of mine  richard felt that the present would have been a good time to tell what he knew about the shippingclerk but remembering his half promise to the latter he remained silent  you may go said mr mann briefly but stop have you any keys belonging to this place in your possession  keys no sir  oh all right  butwhat made you ask that began richard considerably perplexed  i wanted to know that was all  we have no keys of anything up in the stockroom continued the boy  i know that you can go to work mr mann snapped  and richard passed out  either that boy is perfectly honest or else he is the most accomplished actor i ever saw thought the merchant when left alone  well whats the trouble asked frank when richard reached the stockroom i hope you havent been discharged  no its not as bad as that but ii dont know what to make of it and thats a fact  the stockclerk listened carefully to the story richard had to tell  depend upon it there is something in the wind you had better watch norris he may be getting you into trouble  i half wish i had told the firm of norriss actions said richard  perhaps it would have been best replied frank  on the way home that night the two met pep the urchin had evidently been waiting for richard for he ran up at once  ive got something for you mr dare he exclaimed and shifting his bundle of papers he drew out a silver dollar from his ragged clothes here is one of de dollars i owes yer ill have de odder one in a few days i guess  did you earn it asked richard without taking the proffered coin  yes sir honestly too sellin papers  and how is your father any better  not much sir that pneumony hangs on so  perhaps you had better keep this money you may need it for medicine  no sir im earning enough to buy that now i want you to take this id feel better if yer did if it wasnt fer dad i agiven it to yer long ago  all right then richard slipped the coin in his pocket id like to see your father once and see how you live maybe i and my friend here mr massanet can help you a bit can i come  pep hung his head  we live in a garret and youd find it mighty dirty nobody with good clothes has got any right there  we wont mind the dirt put in frank eagerly only let us come im sure we can help you some  where can we meet you pep asked richard seeing that the little arab wavered i suppose we cant find your home alone very well  guess you cant were in a heap down our way i dunno the last in reference to the meeting just wherever you two gentlemen says you was so kind i guess dad wont mind my bringin you  suppose you come up to our house suggested frank will you do that  yes sir if yer want me  i do come to dinner at one oclock and well take something along for your father frank described the location and the house in which he lived do you think you can find it he concluded  walk right in de front door wid me eyes shet laughed pep youre mighty kind he added soberly  will you come  yes sir  sure put in richard  i will ceptin dads so sick i cant replied pep  in the evening richard and frank took a walk first up town and then down broadway on the way the boy pointed out to his friend the building in which the meetings of the laurel club were held  i wonder if norris is up there tonight observed frank suppose we stand here in the shadow for a while and watch who goes in and comes out  richard agreed to this and crossing the street they took a stand directly opposite the entrance to the place  here they waited for perhaps fifteen minutes  at the end of that time along came norris arm in arm with another member of the club  there he goes exclaimed richard as the two went up the stairs  there is a man watching them added frank as another individual who had come close behind the others stopped at the corner wonder who it is  hes coming over here said richard well get in this hallway and see him as he passes i suppose hes a stranger to us  near by was a dark hallway partly open both of the boys stepped into it and an instant later the stranger went by  when he was gone frank uttered an exclamation  i saw that fellow talking to mr mann in the postoffice only a few days ago i think he is a private detective  richard gave a start  then i see it all he groaned that man knows of norriss doings and as he has seen me in his company he thinks im in with that crowd and has probably told mr mann so  very likely thats the case admitted frank after a moments thought  its an awful fix to be in continued richard i dont know how i can ever clear my name even if i tell what i know about norris i have no proofs to show that i didnt go to that place willingly  thats true youre in a bad light at the best its a shame ill tell you what you do  what  there is no reason why you should suffer on norriss account he is no friend of yours and has been trying to lead you astray who knows but what if he is left alone he may not try some day to get you in even deeper id go to mr williams and tell him the whole truth  at first richard demurred he did not wish to tattle on anybody and besides not having a forward nature he shrank from the exposure  but frank soon talked him out of this and by the time they reached the massanets home richard decided to have it out the first thing in the morning  but upon reaching the store the following day a disappointment awaited him mr williams had gone to boston and would not be back for several days  i hate to tell mr mann said richard i guess ill wait till mr williams returns  i wouldnt replied frank id have it off my mind at once but the thought of facing mr mann was not a pleasant one and the boy hesitated while deliberating upon what to do the office boy appeared  mr mann wants you down in his office right away he said to richard  what again  yes sir told me to tell you to come right down  oh frank im sure something is wrong cried richard when the boy was gone  it looks so replied the stockclerk never mind remember you are in the right and keep a stiff upper lip  much troubled in mind richard slowly descended the steps and entered mr manns office as before the gentleman was alone  you wish to see me sir began richard and somehow his voice trembled in spite of himself  yes i do replied mr mann coldly i wish to tell you that your services are no longer required here is your salary for this week you can leave at once  had richard been struck in the face he would not have been more taken aback than he was by this short and cold speech  butmr manni he began  i want no words with you interrupted the merchant you understand why you are discharged as well as i do  yes but im sure  no words sir dont you understand me i wish you to leave instantly cried mr mann irascibly  richard colored  ill go he said but let me say that i consider you are treating me very unfairly  and with tears of indignation in his eyes richard left the office     chapter xxii  richard visits mr joyce again   im discharged frank  frank massanet dropped the books he held in his hands discharged he cried surely dick you dont mean it  i do replied richard mr mann has given me my wages for this week and says he wants me to leave at once  but howwhat did he have to say what did he accuse you of  he had very little to say he said i knew quite as well as he did why i was discharged  but didnt he give you a chance to explain  no he wouldnt let me say a word i tried to but he shut me right up  its a shame exclaimed the stockclerk indignantly i never thought mr mann could be so unfair he hesitated a moment ill do it yes i will he went on half to himself  do what asked richard  go down and have a talk with him hes in the wrong and ought to be told so  no no dont go down cried richard in alarm i could plainly see that he was in a bad temper and youll only get yourself into trouble  i dont care its began the stockclerk with flashing eyes that showed up well the force of character within  no no repeated richard he would not have his friend get into trouble on his account for the world i am much obliged to you for wanting to help me indeed i am but id rather leave the thing as it is  what will you do  i hardly know yet im completely upset and want time to think  youre not going to sit down and calmly submit to it i hope  indeed im not mr mann has cast a slur on my character and im going to remove that no matter what happens afterwards  richard washed his hands and put on his coat in silence frank massanet sat on the edge of a packing case and watched the boy thoughtfully  i wonder if earle norris has been discharged he remarked if any one was to go he should have been the person  i dont know replied richard ill try to find out as i go down  where are you going  i dont know that either i must think it over  never mind remember what i said before youre in the right so keep a stiff upper lip returned frank  when richard went down he passed through the shippingroom earle norris was hard at work sending off orders he looked surprised or pretended to as the boy entered  hello he exclaimed off early  yes i am returned richard briefly  hows that got a vacation  yes  the boy did not care to be further questioned and so quickly left the building  reckon hes discharged muttered norris under his breath so far harrisons scheme works well now i must use my wits to clear myself  norris does not act as if he had received bad news thought richard with a shake of his head i cant make it out there is something behind it all but what it is still remains to be seen  richard walked down beekman street and then turned the corners of several other streets he had no definite plan in mind and time seemed at that particular moment of no great value  finally he found himself in the neighborhood of the leather district and determined to call upon mr joyce  he was not long in reaching the latters warehouse and a moment later found himself in the merchants office as usual mr joyce was hard at work at his desk he looked surprised at richards entrance but finished the letter he was writing before he turned around and spoke  well dare dropped in to see me he said pleasantly have a chair  thank you mr joyce yes ii have come to see you said richard hardly knowing how to begin i want your advice he added  yes well you can have that im sure how are you making out at williams  manns  i was discharged this morning  what  mr joyces face betrayed resentment anger pity and curiosity all in one  but believe me sir i am not to blame went on richard hastily i have done my work and more faithfully and mr mann would give no reason for discharging me  but there must have been some reason exclaimed the leather merchant flatly no one sends away an efficient clerk without cause  well i cant make it out replied the boy thats the reason i came to you im sure i havent done anything wrong and i havent been negligent  richards earnest manner had its full effect upon mr joyce  well tell me your story he said tell me every word of the plain truth unless you do that i cant help you a bit  so richard told of everything that had happened since he had gone to workof his intimacy with the massanets his acquaintanceship with earle norris the adventure at the laurel club and all mr joyce listened in silence until the boys story was concluded  then he put a number of questions to make sure that nothing had been left out or covered up  i cant see how you are to blame he said at the last you did wrong not to let some one know how this norris had treated you but you have done nothing as far as i can make out to warrant dismissal i will go up and see mr mann in a little whilejust as soon as i finish my mornings work will you go along  if you think i ought to mr mann wanted me to get out though and talked as if he didnt want to see me again  never mind everybody is entitled to a hearing and mr mann is probably laboring under a false impression  in half an hour the two were on the way richards heart beat quickly as they walked along for in some manner mr joyces presence inspired him with confidence  when they reached the store mr mann had gone out for lunch in a few minutes however he returned he greeted mr joyce with cold politeness and then frowned openly upon richard  say mel whats the trouble here began mr joyce diving right into the subject at hand my young friend says he has been discharged without warning  we have paid him his weeks wages replied mr mann stiffly  so he says but he wants to know why you discharged him he says you acted as if something was wrong  well something is wrong admitted the bookmerchant and then he added in an undertone i meant to send you word about it i dont care to have the boy aware how much or how little i do know send him out and ill tell you the whole affair the boy is not so innocent as he looks  bosh i told you before i knew an honest face when i saw it and ill wager hes as honest as the day is long dare continued mr joyce turning to richard just go outside in the store and wait for me  yes sir  richard went out as directed in the short time that he had been with williams  mann he had come but little in contact with the clerks downstairs and they hardly knew him and now allowed him to stand around as though he was a stranger  the dismissal made him feel strange too he wished he could go upstairs to frank but he did not know how soon mr joyce might want him he wondered how frank was getting along and who the firm would get to help him  a short half hour passed it seemed like an age to richard  then the private office door opened and mr joyce called for him to come in  hardly knowing what to expect the boy entered mr joyce closed the door carefully behind him  well dare began mr mann we have talked your case over pretty thoroughly and while there are some things in your conduct that i dont like yet i admit that perhaps i was hasty in judging you i did not care to explain all i know for reasons you may learn later you may go to work again if you wish  thank you sir replied the boy nearly as much surprised at this sudden turn as he had been at the first but i  never mind now i know there are many things you would like to know and which perhaps i ought to explain but for the present you will have to let that pass  im willing to as long as it comes out right in the end replied the boy thank you mr joyce for your kindness he added turning to the leather merchant and then withdrew     chapter xxiii  strange discoveries   frank massanet was surprised and delighted to have richard come to work again  you have indeed a good friend in mr joyce he remarked when the boy had told him what the leather merchant had done one such is worth a thousand of the common sort  during the afternoon earle norris had occasion to come up to the stock room he started back upon seeing richard at work  why i thought you had taken a vacation he exclaimed  so i didfor an hour replied richard and without further words went on with his work  why i thought began the shippingclerk  what did you think demanded frank coming forward  why ii stammered norris what business is it of yours he added rudely  you thought he was discharged went on frank youve been trying your best to get him discharged  who says so demanded norris but he turned slightly pale as he uttered the words i say so i dont understand your scheme but thats what you are trying to do and i warn you that you had better quit it  it was seldom that frank massanet spoke in such an arbitrary way yet it was plain to see that he meant every word he said  youre mistaken returned norris hardly knowing how to reply but its only natural that you should stick up for your mothers boarders they help support the family i suppose  and with this parting shot the shippingclerk hurried below  in the middle of the afternoon mr mann sent for richard and asked the boy to accompany him to an office on lower broadway  i wish you to keep our visit to the place a secret he said i might as well tell you something is going wrong at our place goods are missing from several departments and we cannot trace them they are taken by some one in our employ but there must be a confederate outside  did mr joyce tell you about  norris yes but i knew that i thought you were in collusion with him because you were seen in his company  by that detective i suppose  do you know him asked the book merchant in much surprise  not much frank massanet told me of him  and richard related the particulars  but did not norris try to get me out of a position he added  yesnoi dont know mr mann contracted his brow and then a light seemed to break in upon him he did cast suspicion upon you but i thought that was only done for effecti couldnt exactly understand it  perhaps he wished to get some one in my placesome one who would aid himthat is if he is the guilty party who had my place before  a tall young man named springer he was discharged for incompetency  springer exclaimed richard that was the name of the doorkeeper at the laurel club he and norris are great friends  ah then i see it hold up we received two applications for your position only last week  what were the names asked the boy deeply interested  i have them here in my notebook replied mr mann feeling in his pocket do you remember the names of those you met at that club  richard thought a moment  harrison foley nichols and springer i think im pretty good at remembering names he returned  mr mann got out his notebook  here they are he cried andrew s foley is one and henry nichols the other he jammed the volume back into his pocket its as clear as day there is no necessity for your going with me now you can return to the store but remember not a word of this even to massanet  ill remember sir  when richard returned to the stockroom his friend of course wanted to know what was up but the boy only replied that it was all right and that mr mann had requested him to keep silent  throughout the entire establishment there appeared to be the feeling that something was about to happenwhat no one knew  as the two boys were returning home that evening they met the street urchin pep who greeted them politely he had a bigger bundle of papers than ever and seemed to be prospering in his street trade  nevertheless he had a sober earnest look upon his countenance that caught richards eye immediately  whats up pep he asked kindly  dads worse sir replied the boy i dont think i can come up sunday ceptin he gets better  wouldnt you like us to come down any way asked frank  i would yes but he wouldnt his head aint right and he dont want no one around ceptin me  well will you come up to the house and get some nice stuff i will give you some eating and the like continued frank  yes sir thank you  ill expect you goodby  goodby sir goodby mr dare cried pep oh say he added running back i reckon i can give you that other dollar by monday  on saturday afternoon as they were starting home early frank unfolded his scheme of one day going into business for himself  i would like to see you do it cried richard and make a big success of it too you deserve it franksuch a good fellow as you are  a few minutes later a funeral of some old soldier passed there were several coaches and then a post of grand army men the sight was a sad one to richard  my father was a soldier he said to his companion he was shot too he added with a sigh  yes said frank then your mother gets a pension he added after a pause  no she does not she ought to have one but we cannot get our claim passed my father let it rest so long that when he did try he could find no witness  and richard related the full particulars of the case frank massanet listened attentively  i think as your sister grace says id turn the whole country upside down before id give up the hope of finding a witness he said why it would amount to several thousand dollars a small fortune  im going to try as soon as i get settled replied richard i havent any money to do anything with yet  id advertise as soon as i could afford it suggested frank and id write to the secretaries of all these old soldiers organizations too giving your fathers full name and what he belonged to  thats a good idea exclaimed richard ill do that this week i have plenty of time in the evening and can get the addresses from the directory     chapter xxiv  peps home   sunday morning dawned clear and bright richard was naturally an early riser but the unaccustomed sounds in the streets awoke him at an even earlier hour than he usually arose and when seven oclock came and the massanets assembled for breakfast they found that their boarder had had quite a delightful walk  by ten oclock the massanets were all ready and bound for church  when the congregation was dismissed richard and frank hurried home ahead wishing to see if pep had come  they found the street urchin waiting for them at the door he was very pale and nearly out of breath  i was thinkin youd never come he gasped i run all de way and went upstairs but couldnt find nobody  whats the matter cried richard is your father worse  yes indeed a heap worse i was thinkin he was goin to croak last night  ill go right down with you  shall i go too put in frank hesitatingly ill go willingly if you want me  i dunno replied pep slowly dad dont want no visitors i was only going to get mr dare but i reckon you can come dad wont know de difference he aint right here  and the street urchin tapped his forehead significantly  rushing upstairs frank got out a basket and filled it with a number of things that mrs massanet and mattie had prepared he was down again in a moment and then the three guided by pep hurried off  it was far down on the east side through streets that are narrow dirty and notorious for crimes of all kinds that the boy led them  taint no nice walk to take he said and youre dressed too good to go through here after dark if you come agin put on yer old cloes da wont notice you so much  im glad that your sister isnt along said richard to frank with a shudder i never dreamed of a place as wretched as this  mattie knows how bad it is returned frank in her mission class she has several children from the italian quarter and thats every bit as bad as this  here we are remarked pep as they came to a narrow court dis is my street da calls it de fryin pan cause one of de houses took fire last year and ten people were burnt up  on this sunday morning the frying pan was alive with people jewish tailors and cloakmakers who were enjoying a bit of needed rest they filled the doorways and the steps and down on the pavement the children ran around shouting and playing games  picking their way among the latter and the heaps of dirt and streams of filthy water on all sides the two boys followed pep to the end of the court curious eyes gazed after them and open remarks concerning their presence in that locality were not wanting  but to these the two paid no attention though both were glad enough to escape into the hallway of the tenement to which the street boy led them  look out for de stairway cautioned pep as they ascended the first flight its mighty rotten and you kin break a leg widout half tryin  up and up they went until finally they stopped at the door of a room on the top floor and in the rear  here we are whispered pep let me go in alone first and see how he is  the street urchin opened the door and went inside in a moment he reappeared  hes asleep he said you can come in  the room was part of a garret with a sloping side and a dormer window opposite was a large brick chimney with an open fireplace near it lay a mattress on the floor and upon this rested a man  he was apparently nearly fifty years of age his face and form were terribly shrunken and his untrimmed hair and beard and generally untidy appearance made him a repulsive object indeed  thats him whispered pep glad hes asleep hope he dont raise no row when he wakes up  just then the man turned and moaned to himself  water water he cried  have you any asked richard  yes but taint fresh replied pep ill get some  and catching up a pail he ran out of the room and down the stairs  that man has a raging fever declared frank after a careful look at the sufferer  there ought to be more ventilation here said richard im going to open that window  for the dormer window the only one in the place was tightly closed  it was no easy job the window had probably not been opened for some time and stuck obstinately finally it went up with a bang and a draught of fresh air swept into the place  its a pretty stiff breeze remarked frank but too much is certainly better than too little  the noise had aroused the sick man and opening his eyes he stared at the two boys  ah ive caught you he cried pep pep bind themdont let em get away wheres the water    water water everywhere   upon the deep blue sea   water water here and there   but not a drop for me  that used to be docs favorite song why dont you give poor tom a drink wheres betty shell give her brother what he wants oh pep pep dont leave your dad to die of thirst  richard uttered an exclamation and grasped franks arm  that man is tom clover he gasped he is doc linyards lost brotherinlaw     chapter xxv  tom clover   for a moment richard could not realize the discovery that he had made could this weak delirious man be doc linyards brotherinlaw the one for whom the old sailor had been searching so diligently and so unsuccessfully  if such was the fact then his visit to frying pan court would undoubtedly be productive of more than one good result  what makes you think he is the man asked frank massanet with considerable astonishment  because he mentioned his own name as tom and i know betty is the sailors wifes name replied richard  he doesnt look very respectable went on frank he isnt a relative for even a man like mr linyard to be proud of  he may look better after hes shaved and washed and fixed up a bit returned richard that is if he gets well he added in sudden alarm  pep pep went on the sufferer wheres the water  here you are dad nice and fresh and pep entered with his pail full whew but he does drink a pile he added to the two as he held a cup to his fathers lips  ive brought something you can give him said frank going to his basket and depositing the articles upon a rickety table that stood in a corner  and well send a doctor around here too he added you havent had one lately i guess  not this week he charged too much and he wouldnt come if i didnt pay aforehand replied the street urchin  pep what is your full name asked richard abruptly  the boy was silent  why wont you tell me i dont want to hurt you  dad said afore he got sick he didnt want people to know it thats why exclaimed pep finally  why not hes honest im sure  honest bet yer he is but he dont want his old friends to know how hes come down  oh exclaimed richard a new light breaking in upon him  then you were better off once  deed we were when marm was alive and sister mary when they died dad went on a spreethe first and last oneand spent what money was left after the bills was paid then he sold our stuff and we came here and i got into the streets  how long ago is that  most three years its been tough times since then  and pep suddenly raised his coat sleeve to wipe away two big tears that had started to come down his cheeks  did you ever know anything of an uncle doc asked richard suddenly  pep gave a cry  what do you know of my uncle doc he exclaimed trembling oh mr dare did hedid he  what send me here no but he is looking all over for your father then your name is pep clover  yes sir but how did you find it out  your fathers talking led me to think so im glad i found you for there is money coming to your father how much i dont know but quite some  money coming to him peps eyes opened widely then suddenly his face fell yer foolin me  no im not its money from an uncle in england left to your father and your aunt betty  pep gave a whoop hooray he cried with a wild fling of his arms how much is it as much as twentyas fifty dollars  yes a good many fifty dollars replied richard with a smile  and kin dad have a nuss and medicine maybe theyll let him in the hospital if he pays hey and ill get some new cloes and then theyll let me come and see him  pep rattled on as if the idea of sudden wealth had turned his head  ill go and tell your uncle said richard at length i know it will be a big surprise to him  kin you find the way from here and back asked pep anxiously  i dont know replied richard doubtfully i wish you could come along  i would only and the urchin pointed to the mattress go ahead put in frank ill tend to him while you are gone i dont think ill have any trouble  dad gets mighty cranky sometimes returned pep with a doubtful shake of his head  never mind ill manage it you wont be gone over an hour i guess added the stockclerk to richard  i think not that is if we can find doc linyard his place is no doubt shut up and he may be away  a moment later richard accompanied by pep went down into the court and made their way to the street beyond the urchin was all eager expectation and if it had not been for richard for whom it was hard work to keep up as it was he would have run the entire way  in a few minutes they were down on the bowery and passing park row the only lively spot in lower new york on sunday they crossed fulton street and so on down to west  as richard had anticipated the watch below was closed doc linyard did not keep his place open on sunday excepting for an hour or two early in the morning  ill have to see if i can knock him up he said to pep  and raising his foot he kicked several times on the lower portion of the door  something like the first night when i got lost he thought to himself what changes have occurred since then  richard repeated his kicking and presently there were sounds of footsteps within the turning of a key in the lock and then the door opened cautiously revealing mrs linyard  oh its you she exclaimed come in i was afraid it might be some drunken man theres so many here of a sunday trying to get in  aunt betty dont you know me piped up peps voice all in a tremble  mrs linyard turned and surveyed the street urchin eagerly  mercy me if it haint toms boy she ejaculated where in the world did you come from  mr dare brought me replied pep  mrs linyard caught him up in her arms  whod a believed it she cried mr dare a doing of it why youre as dirty as a pig wheres your dad and your marm and sister mary  dads sick we just left him marm and mary are dead mr dare says youve got money for dad im so glad cause hes sick  mother and mary dead the sad news brought the tears to the womans eyes poor dear poor tom  mr clover is very sick said richard he has no one to care for him but pep is mr linyard at home  yes taking his nap on the sofa ill call himor no come up my what a surprise twill be for him hed about given up  taking pep by the hand mrs linyard led the way up to her best room where her husband lay sound asleep on a lounge  get up doc she cried shaking him vigorously get up heres your nevvy and mr dare has found tom just think of ithes found tom wake up doc was ever there such a man to keep on sleeping with such good news to hear     chapter xxvi  a scene in the stockroom   but doc linyard did not sleep for any great length of time after his good wife began to shake him a moment later he sprang up rubbing his eyes  ship ahoy he cried heartily whats up whats the trouble then catching sight of richard and pep hello visitors how are you dare  heres toms son repeated mrs linyard mr dare has found tom  what the old sailor looked at the street urchin bless my heart if it haint toms son well well dare this is better than getting them letters back and he took hold of pep with both hands  richard had it on his tongues end to say that pep was the one who had taken the letters in the first place but a second thought made him keep silent it would do no good to tell and he would be willing to vouch for the boys honesty in the future  richards story as well as peps was soon told and then doc linyard and his wife prepared to accompany the two back to frying pan court  im glad ive got a little money saved said the old sailor to richard as they hurried across town poor tom shant want for anything while theres a shot left in the locker its funny he wouldnt let us know his condition  he was allers sensitive put in mrs linyard and i suppose coming down made him more so  it was not long before the little party reached the dingy garret room where the sufferer lay frank received them with a warning for silence he said he had had quite a turn with the sick man but now mr clover had dropped back exhausted and was dozing  mrs linyard wept bitterly as she knelt beside the form of her sick brother yet she was thankful that he had been found and her gratitude to richard was outspoken and genuine  it was decided that the sick man should be at once removed to one of the private wards of a neighboring hospital where mrs linyard might see him daily and then have him taken to her own home as soon as it was deemed safe to do so  frank who was somewhat acquainted with the methods of procedure accompanied the old sailor to the institution and helped him to make the necessary arrangements  half an hour later an ambulance drove into frying pan court tom clover was removed with the greatest of care the garret room was locked up and pep like one in a dream went off with his newlyfound uncle  it was nearly sundown when the two boys reached the massanets again  how long youve been exclaimed mattie who let them in  and weve had quite an adventure replied her brother  ees zat so put in mrs massanet you must tell ett francois  i will mother replied frank but richard will have to help its really his story  then both go ahead cried mattie only do go ahead i am dying to hear  of course mrs massanet as well as mattie was highly interested in the boys story and both were deeply touched at the account of frying pan court and the scene in the little garret room  i want to know little pep said mattie he is too bright a chap to run the streets i guess doc lanyard wont let him do that any more returned richard especially if he gets that money hes expecting from england  that sailor didnt lose anything by being kind to you remarked frank i declare you deserve a reward  if only some old soldier would turn up so that you could get your fathers pension went on mattie that would be better than a reward  youre right replied richard even if we only got a thousand dollars it would help along wonderfully at home  monday morning found the two hard at work in the stockroom about ten oclock mr mann came up and beckoned to richard to come to one corner  i want to find out about an order that was shipped on the tenth to pittsburgh he said when they were alone there is something wrong about it you were here by yourself on that day do you remember it  to pittsburgh repeated richard slowly yes i do mr williams filled that order  mr williams mr mann looked surprised i dont understand  mr williams came up here while i was alone and offered to help me i said that the pittsburgh order i couldnt read very well so he took it and filled it he will probably remember it  probably he will replied mr mann and in that case the trouble is certainly all downstairs you need not mention this occurrence to any one  mr mann went below and there were no more interruptions for that day but trouble was in the air and on the following day the climax came  richard was alone in the stockroom frank having just gone below on business there was a clatter on the stairs and turning to see what was the matter richard confronted earle norris  the shippingclerk was pale but his manner showed that he was also angry whether reasonably or not remained to be seen  you little greenhorn you he cried what do you mean by getting me into trouble  i dont know as i have replied richard as coolly as he could and not wishing to engage in a personal encounter he very wisely placed several cases between himself and his angry accuser  yes you have roared norris you told mr mann that that order from pittsburgh was sent down all right and that if any of the goods were changed they were changed downstairs  i told no one anything of the kind replied richard briefly though he could readily understand the mistake under which norris was laboring  yes you did  no i did not  oh come i know better if you didnt who did massanet wasnt here  thats true too but nevertheless i didnt tell mr mann  youre a began the shippingclerk passionately  here here stop that norris came a voice from the elevator and the next instant mr williams stepped into the room what do you mean by creating such a disturbance  dare is trying to put up a job on me began the shippingclerk he told mr mann that that order for pittsburgh was sent down 0k and  and so it was replied mr williams calmly  no sir it was  hold up norris there is no use of further words said mr williams sharply you were discharged half an hour ago and you had better leave it was i that told mr mann that the order had gone down all right because i filled it myself i suspected you for a long time and i wanted to find out the truth dare and massanet are entirely innocent in the matter i have much more information against youand also a bookdealer who has sold you old books and bought your new onesbut we will let that drop i have learned that your family is quite a respectable one for their sake as well as your own i advise you to turn over a new leaf you can go  for an instant norris hesitated then he turned and without a word of reply hurried down the stairs  richard breathed a sigh of relief when he was gone  i am sorry he placed you two up here in such a false position said mr williams to richard please tell massanet of it too neither of you shall lose anything by it     chapter xxvii  a fire and its result   as one proof of williams  manns good intentions towards richard the boy found his salary on the following week increased to eight dollars and frank received a proportionate addition to his pay  in the middle of the week a new shippingclerk a german by the name of bretzwartz was engaged and though everybody in the establishment found it hard at first to understand the young mans broken english yet he was such a jolly fellowas well as an honest and capable onethat he was soon on good terms all around  during the evenings of this week richard wrote a great number of letters to the grand army and other military organizations in the hope of finding some one who had known his father during the war or immediately after it  on thursday evening frank accompanied him to the neighborhood in which mr dare had once resided but though the two spent nearly three hours in the search no trace of any former acquaintance was found  you see its different here from what it is in the country said frank when they were returning here you often find that people dont know who lives next door or even in the same house with them it sounds queer but its true no one is introduced no one is sociable and the majority are continually moving in the hope of finding a better dwelling or cheaper rent  yes i noticed that replied richard with something like a sigh out in the country everybody knows everybody else and outside of a few prim people all are as sociable as can be but i suppose if one wants to make money one must expect to give up some comforts  youre right there replied frank  during the week pep met them twice on the bowery he was cleanly washed had his curly hair brushed and wore a brandnew suit in his altered appearance richard hardly knew him  dads better was the urchins reply to the boys question uncle doc is going to take him out of de hospital next week so as aunt betty can nurse him herself shes awful kind she is  and how do you like the change asked frank  i feel like i was dreamin was peps answer it dont seem natural these cloes and that nice home its like de times long ago  are you selling papers yet asked richard  no sir uncle doc says im to go to school in a week or so he says i must have an eddication and hes going to help dad get his money and invest it so its safe and all that heres yer dollar  as pep concluded he suddenly dived into one of the pockets of his new trousers and after considerable difficulty extricated a silver dollar  never mind pep you can keep it said richard yet well pleased to see the urchins evident desire to right the wrong he had done  no no its yours exclaimed pep earnestly i wont keep it nohow and say he added in a whisper im awful glad you didnt say nothin to me uncle of it its de first time i stole anything and its the last too and i wouldnt have uncle doc or aunt betty know it for de world  you can make sure they shall never hear of it returned richard as after more urging he took the coin i can understand how desperate you felt that morning we met at the newspaper office and well let the whole matter drop  thank you sir  and pep felt much relieved  you must come up sunday put in frank come up to dinner same as you were going to  thank you mr massanet i will replied pep my uncle expects both of you down soon too  and they separated pep being on his way to frying pan court to get a few treasured belongings that still remained there  early the following morning richard and frank started for the store together it was a clear but windy day thick clouds of dust flying in all directions as they passed the entrance to the brooklyn bridge a fire engine dashed past on its way down the street  hello theres a fire somewhere exclaimed frank  can we go to it cried richard he had not yet seen a conflagration in the city and was anxious to see how such a thing would be handled frank looked at his watch  weve got twentyfive minutes he replied come on if its in the neighborhood we can take a look at it  both boys started off on a run they reached spruce street and followed the engine around the corner  a dense volume of black smoke greeted them  the crowd was thick and the two had hard work making their way forward  its our place cried out frank suddenly and the whole store is afire too  our place ejaculated richard oh i hope not  but it was only too true and in a moment they stood opposite the establishment of williams  mann now all blaze from top to bottom  stand back there exclaimed a burly policeman waving his club at both boys stand back  we work in the place explained frank  cant help it was the reply the insurance patrol has charge of the goods youll have to get out of the way lively there added the officer as a hook and ladder truck came dashing up the street  so richard and frank fell back into the crowd and were immediately joined by bretzwartz the german shippingclerk  i guess the place is a goner remarked frank as the flames shot out of the upper windows  wonder how it caught said richard  der poiler in der pasement busted put in bretzwartz i chust come and vos putting on mine odder coat ven i heard an explosion vich knock me mine feets off and i rund out like i vos killed and der whole place was on fire in two seconds already  was larry killed asked frank  larry was the engineer and porter around the place  no he vos out getting a pite to eat replied the shippingclerk  despite the efforts of the firemen the flames made rapid progress and in an hour the fireproof building was known to be doomed both of the heads of the firm had been sent for and mr williams soon put in an appearance  he was pale and excited and shook his head sadly when his many employees offered their services in any way they could be used  we can do nothing at present he said the insurance companies have entire charge  i hope you are covered mr williams said richard earnestly  very nearly so was the reply the stop to business will be our worst loss there is no telling when we will be able to resume i only trust the accounts in the safes are all right  by noon the fire was under control it had burnt itself out and all that remained of the establishment was its four scorched walls and the mass of half burned stock and fixtures within part of the stock had been saved and this was transferred to an empty store near by  the boys assisted in this work until late in the evening and also all day saturday  in the middle of saturday afternoon mr mann came to them and paid them their weeks wages  you had both better find other places he said we have got into difficulty with the insurance companies and it may be some time before our claim is adjusted besides mr williams speaks of retiring and in that case i will probably join some other firm  this was dismaying news yet neither could blame mr mann though it threw them both out of employment without notice  you may help us here next week went on mr mann but next saturday will finish the job i will give both of you firstclass recommendations and if i hear of any openings will let you know  and mr mann went away to carry his news to the other clerks  its too bad said frank when he was gone it wont be an easy job to find another place  no indeed replied richard still we cant complain of the way they have treated us  both of the boys wore sober faces that night to richard came the ever recurring thought what next     chapter xxviii  a lucky resolve   well richard we are gentlemen of leisure now  it was frank who spoke and the occasion was the monday morning following their final week with williams  mann  yes but it doesnt suit me in the least returned richard to be idle is the hardest work i can do have you anything in view  not a thing i put in twelve applications last week to as many different houses but as yet i havent heard from a single one  what do you intend to do  i hardly know i dont think it will pay to make any personal applications  im going to try it returned richard resolutely they cant say any more than no and each no will save just two cents in postage if nothing else  when do you intend to start out asked frank who could not help admiring richards pluck  in about an hour it is too early yet to catch the heads of the firms  going to start at any particular place  yes  whereor perhaps you dont care to tell added frank hastily  yes i do replied richard smiling quietly i am going to try the stationer on the corner  who martin why he has such a small store im sure he doesnt need help he and his son and a boy do all the business  never mind i made up my mind to stop at every place and his is the first on the route so ill call if only for the principle of the thing  thats an idea cried frank you are bound to have a place if there is a single one vacant well dick i trust with all my heart that youll succeed he added warmly  you had better start out too frank  ohii dont think its much use said the other hesitatingly  oh yes it is and you know it now confess that it is only your lack of nerve that keeps you from it  frank colored slightly  well i guess it is he admitted i never was a good hand at approaching people  then you ought to break yourself in at once just break the ice and youll have no further trouble i remember just how bad i felt when i first came to new york to look for work but im over it now thank goodness  and truth to tell in the past few weeks richard had lost much of his former shyness  frank massanet was silent for a moment  i guess i will he said finally ill start out and have the thing over at once which way do you intend to goup or down  i thought i would try down town first  then ill go up we can compare notes at suppertime  so we can i hope we both have luck said richard  but he did not feel particularly elated over the prospects his former search for employment had convinced him that desirable situations were rarely to be hadthere was always some one on hand to fill a vacancy as soon as it occurred  he felt however that he must obtain employment of some kind and that quickly the small amount of money he had in hand would not last him long and though kindhearted mrs massanet might be willing to let him remain awhile without paying board he knew that now with her son idle the good woman could not afford so generous a course  richard had not gone to see mr joyce as yet he hesitated for several reasons in the first place the leather merchant had been so kind to him that the boy felt it would be encroaching upon good nature to solicit further aid and in the second place mr joyce must know he was out of a place and would help him if he could without being bothered about it  i wont go to him until after ive done all i can for myself had been richards conclusion i would rather show him that i can help myself  richard had written home about the fire and had added that he would probably lose his place in consequence but he had not sent word home that he was now idle thinking it would be time enough to do so when he found himself unable to obtain another situation  the store to which richard had referred was a small but neat one situated upon the corner of the street in which the massanets lived and second avenue it was kept by jonas martin an elderly man and his son james the stock consisted principally of books and stationery although the proprietors also kept papers and magazines for which there was a steady daily demand  i suppose there is hardly any use in striking him thought richard as he entered the store but i said every place so here goes  he found the elderly mr martin behind a desk writing a letter the storekeepers face wore a troubled look  goodmorning began richard is this mr martin  thats my name was the reply what can i do for you  i am looking for a place sir i worked for williams  mann but they burned out as no doubt you know and that threw me out of work have you anything open i can furnish good recommendations  richard had carefully rehearsed this little speech and now delivered it so that his hearer might understand every word that was uttered  mr martin looked at him sharply and then rubbed his chin reflectively  what made you think i needed help he asked  oh i dont know sir every proprietor needs help at one time or another and ive made up my mind to find a place if there is any open  you have recommendations you say  yes sir  and richard handed over those he had received from williams  mann  mr martin read them carefully  it seems to be all right he said as he handed back the paper if i thought you would answer my purpose i would look you up  then you need help asked richard quickly glad to think he had struck an opening with so little trouble  yes i do my son james who helps me is sick in philadelphia and consequently i have only the errand boy to relieve me it is too much for me and i must get a clerk  i would like you to try me said richard eagerly i would do my best to suit even if the place was only a temporary one  it might be permanent the business is growing but of course when my son came back i could not pay a clerk so much  how much would you pay now  how much do you expect asked mr martin cautiously  i was getting eight dollars a week at my last place  i would be willing to pay that but i want some one who is trustworthy and willing to learn have you other recommendations  i can refer you to mr timothy joyce replied richard and he wrote down the leather merchants name and address on a bit of wrapping paper  mr martin looked at the neat handwriting  come round tomorrow morning this time he said i will look up the references this afternoon and if i find them satisfactory you can come to work at once  thank you sir goodmorning  by this time there were two customers waiting so not wishing to detain the storekeeper longer richard nodded pleasantly and left the place     chapter xxix  franks idea   thats what i call luck thought richard as he hurried back to the massanets home im mighty glad i called on mr martin he seems to be a gentleman and will no doubt do what is right i hope frank has been equally fortunate  mrs massanet was surprised to see him returning so soon  what ees eet she asked anxiously i hope you no deesheartened aready  no indeed returned the boy and he told her of his good fortune  zat ees nice exclaimed the frenchwoman i hope you gits zee place widout trouble  and then she gave a little sigh as she thought of her sons uncertain search  maybe frank will be as lucky said richard who fancied he could read her thoughts  i sincerely hope so returned mrs massanet  not having anything special to do for the rest of the day richard sat down and wrote a long letter home he intended not to send it until the following day when he could add a postscript that the new place was positively his  five weeks in the great metropolis had worked wonders in the boy he no longer looked or felt green and he was fast acquiring a business way that was bound sooner or later to be highly beneficial to him  in these five weeks he had received several letters from friends and not a few from home the most important news in all of them being the announcement of his sister graces engagement to charley wood and baby madges first efforts to master her a b cs  i wish i could afford to bring them all to new york had been richards thought or else near enough so that i could go home to them every night it would be so pleasant to have them around me perhaps some day i can afford to get a little cottage right near the city which would be nicest of all for i am sure mother would like to have a garden even if it was a small one  his letter for home finished richard spent an hour or more in the preparation of an advertisement which he intended to insert in one of the army journals on the following week the advertisement gave his fathers full name company regiment and so forth and asked for the address of any one who had known him during the war with promise of reward for information  by the above it is easy to see that richard was now in earnest about getting his fathers pension money not only was he satisfied that they were entitled to it but just now when his mother and sisters were struggling in mossvale to make both ends meet it was actually needed  during the time that he had been working richard had sent home every cent that he could spare to be sure the total amount had not been largeonly a few dollarsbut in the country this went a long way and for it as well as for the fact that it showed the son and brothers willingness to help those at home were extremely grateful  it was dinnertime when richard had finished writing out the advertisement mrs massanet had prepared only a lunch reserving a regular meal for the evening  after he had eaten the time hung heavy upon richards hands he put on his hat and sauntered down the street and finally concluded to pay a visit to his friends at the watch below he had not seen doc linyard since that visit to frying pan court and he was curious to know how tom clover was and if the property in england had been heard from further  it being the middle of the afternoon trade at the small restaurant was slack and richard found both the old sailor and his wife glad to see him  toms mendin fast was the old sailors reply to richards question concerning the sick man we are goin to bring him down here tomorrow or the day after hes in his bearings againright mind you knowand i think as how the worst is over  and where is pep  peps to school i sent him last week hes got to have an eddication no two ways on it bettys goin to manage it with tom when he is well  i am glad to hear that and how about your property  oh its safe last week i run afoul of an old lawyer friend of mine saved his life onct in a blow off cape hatterasand hes taken it in tow hes written to the lawyers on the tudder side and were to fix it up just as soon as toms strong enough to sign articles good enough said richard heartily  during the course of the conversation which followed he told doc linyard of his hopes of finding some one who had known his father during the war  tom is an old soldier exclaimed doc he took to the army and i took to the navy  is that so what regiment was he in  i dont know he was in boston at the time and was drafted from there  my father went from here but he might he able to put me on some sort of a track added richard who was unwilling to let even the smallest chance escape him  ill ask him about it when hes strong enough how much would the pension money amount to  not less than a thousand dollarsperhaps twice that  phew its worth workin for  yes indeed put in mrs linyard i hope you get it mr dare you deserve it  when richard returned to his boardingplace he met frank massanet at the door he could see by his friends face that he had not met with success  i tried twentysix places reported frank every one had all the help needed one man offered to put me on the road selling goods on commission but i was to pay my own expenses the offer didnt appear good and i declined it how did you make out  richard told him of course frank was surprised  it wasnt luck though he said it was sticking to the principle you started out on i trust it is a sure thing it will give you an insight into the retail trade so that you may start for yourself some day i would start in for myself tomorrow if i had the capital  do you understand the retail business asked richard with much interest  pretty well last year and around the holidays i tended during the evenings for a firm on fourteenth street and i had a good chance to learn all the ins and outs besides i was in the business when i went to schoolcarrying papers and parcels between schoolhours  how much would you need to start  ive got six hundred dollars saved if i had twice that i wouldnt be afraid to hire a store and try it  cant you raise the other  i havent tried yet i would rather use my own moneyor take a partner if i could find the right fellow  id like to go in with you said richard i think we would get along firstrate together  i know we would cried frank enthusiastically cant you raise the money  i dont think i can ill think of it though     chapter xxx  mr martins clerks   the idea of some day going into partnership with frank massanet was an attractive one to richard he felt that the stockclerk would not venture into business on his own account unless he was moderately certain of success and that would mean more money and a certain feeling of independence  richard was up early on the following morning and on hand at mr martins store long before that gentleman put in an appearance he found the place in charge of the boy who was busy sorting out the morning papers and folding them  im waiting for mr martin said richard by way of an explanation for standing around  are you the new clerk asked philip borne for such was the boys name  i expect to be replied richard did mr martin say anything about me  said he expected to see you this morning hell be here in about half an hour hes terribly worried over his son jim whos sick in philadelphia the doctors telegraphed last evening that they were afraid he couldnt live  its too bad i trust for mr martins sake they are mistaken  in less than half an hour the proprietor put in an appearance he looked even more worried than the day previous  i am glad you are here dare he said i saw mr williams last night and he gave you a good recommendation but he was almost afraid you had not had enough experience in the retail trade to take charge which just at present you would have to do because i must go to philadelphia by the first afternoon train by the latest  richards hopes fell  i will do the best i can mr martin he said earnestly although ill admit i thought to come here only to help and  yes yes i understand and that is all right interrupted the storekeeper hastily i expected to stay up to last night but now i must go if i could only get some one here besides you some one who understood customers phil can help some but he is too young  i know the very person exclaimed richard he has had just the experience you desire and i can get him at once too  and richard told mr martin about frank massanet  ah yes mr williams mentioned him to me do you think he can come today  yes sir ill go at once and find out  do so ill promise that you shall lose nothing by it returned mr martin  in a moment richard was on his way back to the house he found frank just finishing breakfast  why whats up asked the stockclerk what brings you back  nothing onlyive got a situation for you replied richard as coolly as he could although he could not suppress a hearty smile  a situation for me ejaculated frank in undisguised wonder surely you dont mean it  dont i though just come along and see  where  at martins  but i thought you had accepted  one position so i have but there is another for you come along ill tell you all about it on the way  and richard got franks hat and put it on his friends head and had him out on the street almost before he could realize it  at mr martins store a general explanation followed and richard and frank were hired at a joint salary of sixteen dollars per week they were to have entire charge of the business and with the aid of phil were to do the best they could until they heard from mr martin again which the storekeeper hoped would be in a few days the proprietor spent an hour in giving all the instructions he could in that limited time and then half distracted hurried off to catch an early train for philadelphia  well this is a queer go to say the least exclaimed richard after mr martin had gone its more like a dream than anything else  he would never do as he hasleave two entire strangers in charge of his placeif he was not distracted by this bad news about his son returned frank and he hit the exact truth  well now we are here we must make the most of the opportunity said richard let us consider ourselves partners and push our business for all it is worth  both boys started in with a will the first customer was a little girl and both richard and frank desired the honor of waiting upon her  but the girl wanted a cents worth of red chalk and as neither could find the article in demand the wouldbe purchaser was turned over to phil who in turn handed the cash to frank while richard gravely made the entry upon the daily salesbook  but the two set diligently at work and by evening had the stock fairly well located in mind and also the prices during the day trade had been fairly brisk and when closing up time came they found they had taken in twentyeight dollars  i dont know if thats good or bad said richard we certainly sold goods to all who wished them  the thing is to sell to those who dont know whether they want to buy or not observed frank still i guess twentyeight dollars is fair enough for tuesday  both were on hand early next morning according to mr martins instructions the showwindows were emptied and after they had been cleaned frank assisted by richard dressed them again  now mr martins window dressing had always been of the plain old fashioned kind not altogether suited to the present times he only put in a few staple articles and left them unchanged for a long time  but frank massanet proceeded on different lines and when he and richard had finished the improvement was apparent nearly every class of goods in the store was represented and anything new or special was given a prominent place  that looks hot said phil who was given to slang never saw it so showy before  and the many people who stopped to gaze at the display seemed to justify his statement  how often should a window like that be cleaned asked richard  at least once a week replied frank and twice a week is not too much if you have the time to spare  both richard and frank worked diligently all day of course many things were strange to them and they made some laughable blunders but they invariably took things so pleasantly that none of the customers seemed to mind  when night came they found that they had taken in five dollars more than the day previous  its on account of fixing up the window said richard  partly that and partly getting used to customers and the run of stock replied frank  they were soon on the way home richard had sent his letter to his mother the day previous and was now expecting one in return  here is your usual letter said mattie massanet appearing at the door  thank you replied richard excuse me if i look at it at once i want to see if it contains anything important  richard tore the letter open and began to read his eyes had glanced over scarcely a dozen lines when he uttered a cry of dismay  and no wonder for the communication contained the startling intelligence that fire had visited mossvale the dare cottage was burned to the ground and his mother and sisters were left without a home     chapter xxxi  tom clovers statement   the news from mossvale was certainly a cruel blow to richard and as he read the letter written by his sister nancy his cheeks paled  what is it asked frank seeing that something was wrong no one dead i hope  no not as bad as that replied richard faintly but bad enough read it  frank took the letter and glanced at it hastily the important passages ran as follows  it is awful news our home is burned to the ground and i am writing this at mrs woods where we are all staying the fire started in the barn we think a tramp must have done it and the wind carried the sparks over to the house and in ten minutes it was all ablaze it was one oclock at night and no one was around to help us mother grace and i saved all we could but that was not much because we did not have time and it got so awfully hot when the fire was out charlie made us all go over to his house and sent a team over for what stuff we had saved  mother is awfully excited and grace is sick over it madge is all right and so am i but i think its awful and i dont know what we are going to do mrs wood and charley are very kind but we cant stay here very long even if grace is engaged to charley  mother says there is an insurance on the house and furniture for nine hundred dollars but she hasnt been able to find the papers yet and maybe they have been burned too if you can come down right away i suppose they dont like to let clerks off in new york but they ought to make an exception in a case like this  frank handed the letter over to his sister mattie  im sorry for you and your folks dick he said earnestly of course youll go at once  how can i replied richard helplessly mr martin will  never mind mr martin interrupted frank your first duty is to your family ill get along as best i can and ill explain to mr martin if he gets back before you do  but what will you do for meals you must have time to get them went on richard anxious lest his friend should be assuming too much  he can take lunch along and ill bring him his dinner put in mattie you go dick your mother and your sisters need you  richard needed no further urging whatever mattie said must certainly be right he glanced at the clock  quarter to ten i wonder when i can get a train he cried  a consultation of a timetable showed that no train for mossvale could be had until ninethirty the next morning  its too bad he groaned i could have taken one just an hour ago if i had known  there was nothing to do however but wait and so richard retired with the rest  he passed a sleepless night thinking over what had happened and trying to form some plan for the future but he could arrive at no conclusion and found that he must wait until he had talked the matter over with the others  he was the first one up in the morning and having over three hours yet to wait took a walk around to the store to see what phil was doing  there is a telegram for you just came said the boy and he handed it over  more news from home thought richard but we have no telegraph office wonder what it means  and he tore the telegram open  it ran as follows  philadelphia june 28  richard dare  my son is dead close store until further orders  jonas martin  richard had just finished reading the dispatch when frank came up  you are ahead of me said frank what have you there  word from mr martin his son is dead and we are to close the store until further notice  here was more sad news phil who had known young mr martin well and liked him felt it the most  it will break old mr martin all up he said sadly he thought a heap of his son the two were alone in the world  i can get away easily enough now said richard with a sorry little laugh i wont hurry back as soon as i intended you must write me if anything turns up  in less than an hour the store was closed up a death notice pasted on the door and then frank accompanied richard down to the ferry  on the corner of liberty street they met pep who started back in surprise  i was just comin up to see you he exclaimed to richard my uncle wants you to come right down  wants me to come down queried richard what for  dont know exactly dads there and they both want to see you youd better go right away but maybe you was going added pep suddenly  no i wasnt i was going to take a train home replied richard perhaps its nothing in particular  he had an hour before train time and accompanied by frank walked down to the watch below  doc linyard greeted him cordially he was surprised to see richard dressed up and grieved to learn of the cause  well im glad as how i aint got no bad news to tell you said the old sailor with a grin tom clover is upstairs in his right mind and wants to see you  what about never mind just go up replied doc  on a comfortable bed in an upper chamber lay tom clover good care and nursing had done wonders for the man and when richard looked at him he could hardly realize that this was the miserable wretch he had visited in the garret at frying pan court  heres mr dare come to see you said doc linyard by way of an introduction  tom clover grasped richards hand tightly  betty and doc have told me all about you he said in a somewhat feeble voice i thank you more than i can put in words sit down i want to talk to you  i would like to mr clover but ive got to catch a train for home in three quarters of an hour replied richard ill call as soon as i get back  just stay a little while urged doc linyard toms got something to say to you  doc tells me your father was a soldier in the late war went on tom clover  yes sir  did he once live in brooklyn  yes sir but and richard paused while his heart beat rapidly  and was his first name john  yes sirjohn cartwell dare but why do you ask mr clover is it possible that you knew him  tom clover raised himself up to a sitting position  know him he cried we were bosom companions for eighteen months why i caught him in my arms the day he was shot     chapter xxxii  the firm of massanet and dare   tom clovers unexpected statement was a revelation to richard and subsequent questioning convinced the boy that all that doc linyards brotherinlaw had said concerning the acquaintance with his father was perfectly true  it was a fact that clover had been drafted in boston but during the second year of his service his time had expired and then he had enlisted in a brooklyn regiment and become a member of the same company to which mr dare belonged  it seems too good to be true cried richard finally perhaps doc has already told you of the pension we are trying to get  yes and i can witness the papers easily enough and get several others to too if its necessary have you got them here in the city  no they are home but i can soon get them and either bring them or send them on  this was agreed to and it was with a much lighter heart that richard a quarter of an hour later bade frank goodby at the ferry  send the papers to me said frank at parting i havent anything to do at present and will attend to the affair with pleasure  thank you frank i will was richards reply  the journey to mossvale was an uneventful one when richard reached the wood cottage all the family ran out to meet him and in a second his mothers arms were about his neck  im so glad you have come richard she cried we need you sadly  presently he was seated in the doorway with little madge on his knee and the others gathered around and there he listened to all they had to tell  the insurance papers had been found but mrs dare was undecided whether to rebuild or accept the cash  we could not get back such a nice home as we had for nine hundred dollars she said and besides sandy stone has offered me two hundred dollars for the land and thats a good price mr wood says  did you save fathers pension papers  yes but why do you ask inquired mrs dare her curiosity aroused  for reply richard told the little party all about his strange meeting with tom clover  he tells the truth cried mrs dare i have heard your father mention his name thank heaven for having brought you two together  and that night even with all their troubles the whole dare family rested without much worry beneath their kind neighbors roof  in the morning richard sent the pension papers to frank by the first mail then he helped get what was left of their furniture into shape and took a walk over to what had been the old homestead  nothing remained but a heap of charred timbers and fallen stones  its the ending of our life here in the country he whispered to himself god grant it may be the beginning of a more prosperous one in the city  at the close of the week came visitorsfrank doc linyard and a strange gentleman who was introduced as mr styles the old sailors lawyer friend  mr styles says your claim is all right said doc linyard when introductions all round were over he says as how youll get twentyfive hundred dollars afore three months are up  it was glorious news  sure asked mrs dare with tears in her eyes  positive madam replied mr styles i will buy the claim for two thousand dollars if you need the money he whispered  no thank you i can wait she replied but i will pay you well for what you have done for us she added hastily  avast there cried the old sailor tom and i are going to settle his claim were going to get our money in one monthtwo thousand dollars each  a little while later frank drew richard to one side  ive heard from mr martin he said since his son died he has lost all interest in his business and he wants to sell out and go back to his family in england  sell out repeated richard in surprise it would be a good chance for us  so i thought a chance that may not happen again in a lifetime he has been established twelve years and has a good run of trade last year his sales amounted to twelve thousand dollars the rent is only seven hundred dollars a year and he has a three years lease  how much does he ask  if he can sell out before the first he will do so at the cost of the stockfifteen hundred dollars now by hard scraping i can raise half of that and if you can raise the other half and a little extra besides i believe it will prove a good venture  richard thought a moment  if my mother will advance the money ill do it he replied                                         two years have passed  as mr styles had predicted at the end of three months mr dares pension money was in the widows possession long before this however mrs dare sold her land in mossvale and removed with her family to new york having apartments adjacent to mrs massanet with whom she was soon on intimate terms she advanced the necessary money to richard and he and frank massanet immediately bought out mr martins store and set up business on their own account  doc linyard and tom clover now run a prosperous hotel and restaurant in the lower part of the city where their old friends are always welcome pep attends school regularly and thoroughly appreciates his improved condition in life  grace dare has gone back to the country and in her charley wood has found an affectionate wife and a good housekeeper next month nancy is to become mrs massanet as for mattie massanet she is often seen to blush when richards name is mentioned and rumor has it that she will some day give her heart into the keeping of her brothers partner  and mr timothy joyce only last week i met him at a third avenue elevated station looking as stout and hearty as ever  just come down on the train he replied in answer to my question been making a call on massanet  dare the stationers and booksellers they are young friends of mine dare especially and i take a great interest in them since they fixed up this spring theyve got a fine store and i know theyre doing firstrate they deserve it tooworking as hard as they do theyve got
