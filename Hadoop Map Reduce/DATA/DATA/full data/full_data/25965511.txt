25965511	a short history of scotland   chapter i  scotland and the romans   if we could see in a magic mirror the country now called scotland as it was when the romans under agricola 81 ad crossed the border we should recognise little but the familiar hills and mountains  the rivers in the plains overflowed their present banks dense forests of oak and pine haunted by great red deer elks and boars covered land that has long been arable  there were lakes and lagoons where for centuries there have been fields of corn  on the oldest sites of our towns were groups of huts made of clay and wattle and dominated perhaps by the large stockaded house of the tribal prince  in the lochs natural islands or artificial islets made of piles crannogs afforded standingground and protection to villages if indeed these lake dwellings are earlier in scotland than the age of war that followed the withdrawal of the romans  the natives were far beyond the savage stage of culture  they lived in an age of iron tools and weapons and of wheeled vehicles and were in what is called the late celtic condition of art and culture familiar to us from beautiful objects in bronze work more commonly found in ireland than in scotland and from the oldest irish romances and poems  in these epics the manners much resemble those described by homer  like his heroes the men in the cuchullain sagas fight from light chariots drawn by two ponies and we know that so fought the tribes in scotland encountered by agricola the roman general 8185 ad  it is even said in the irish epics that cuchullain learned his chariotry in albathat is in our scotland 2  the warriors had mighty limbs and flaming hair says tacitus  their weapons were heavy iron swords in bronze sheaths beautifully decorated and ironheaded spears they had large round bronzestudded shields and battleaxes  the dress consisted of two upper garments first the smock of linen or other fabricin battle often of tanned hides of animalsand the mantle or plaid with its brooch  golden torques and heavy gold bracelets were worn by the chiefs the women had bronze ornaments with brightly coloured enamelled decoration  agriculture was practised and corn was ground in the circular querns of stone of which the use so long survived  the women span and wove the gay smocks and darker cloaks of the warriors  of the religion we only know that it was a form of polytheism that sacrifices were made and that druids existed they were soothsayers magicians perhaps priests and were attendant on kings  such were the people in alba whom we can dimly descry around agricolas fortified frontier between the firths of forth and clyde about 8182 ad  when agricola pushed north of the forth and tay he still met men who had considerable knowledge of the art of war  in his battle at mons graupius perhaps at the junction of isla and tay his cavalry had the better of the native chariotry in the plain and the native infantry descending from their position on the heights were attacked by his horsemen in their attempt to assail his rear  but they were swift of foot the woods sheltered and the hills defended them  he made no more effectual pursuit than cumberland did at culloden  agricola was recalled by domitian after seven years warfare and his garrisons did not long hold their forts on his lines or frontier which stretched across the country from forth to clyde roughly speaking from grahams dyke east of borrowstounnis on the firth of forth to old kilpatrick on clyde  the region is now full of coalmines foundries and villages but excavations at bar hill castlecary and roughcastle disclose traces of agricolas works with their earthen ramparts  the roman station at camelon northwest of falkirk was connected with the southern passes of the highland hills by a road with a chain of forts the remains of roman pottery at camelon are of the first century  two generations after agricola about 140145 the roman governor lollius urbicus refortified the line of forth to clyde with a wall of sods and a ditch and forts much larger than those constructed by agricola  his line the antonine vallum had its works on commanding ridges and firesignals in case of attack by the natives flashed the news from one sea to the other sea while the troops of occupation could be provisioned from the roman fleet  judging by the coins found by the excavators the line was abandoned about 190 and the forts were wrecked and dismantled perhaps by the retreating romans  after the retreat from the antonine vallum about 190 we hear of the vigorous unrest of the meatae and caledonians the latter people are said on very poor authority to have been little better than savages against them severus 208 made an expedition indefinitely far to the north but the enemy shunned a general engagement cut off small detachments and caused the romans terrible losses in this march to a non existent moscow  not till 306 do we hear of the picts about whom there is infinite learning but little knowledge  they must have spoken gaelic by severuss time 208 whatever their original language and were long recognised in galloway where the hill and river names are gaelic  the later years of the romans who abandoned britain in 410 were perturbed by attacks of the scoti scots from ireland and it is to a settlement in argyll of dalriadic scots from ireland about 500 ad that our country owes the name of scotland  rome has left traces of her presence on scottish soilvestiges of the forts and vallum wall between the firths a station rich in antiquities under the eildons at newstead another ardoch near sheriffmuir a third near solway moss birrenswark and others less extensive with some roads extending towards the moray firth and a villa at musselburgh found in the reign of james vi 4     chapter ii  christianitythe rival kingdoms   to the scots through st columba who about 563 settled in iona and converted the picts as far north as inverness we owe the introduction of christianity for though the roman church of st ninian 397 at whithern in galloway left embers of the faith not extinct near glasgow st kentigerns country till columbas time the rites of christian scotland were partly of the celtic irish type even after st wilfrids victory at the synod of whitby 664  st columba himself was of the royal line in ulster was learned as learning was then reckoned and if he had previously been turbulent he now desired to spread the gospel  with twelve companions he settled in iona established his cloister of cells and journeyed to inverness the capital of pictland  here his miracles overcame the magic of the kings druids and his majesty brude came into the fold his people following him  columba was no less of a diplomatist than of an evangelist  in a crystal he saw revealed the name of the rightful king of the dalriad scots in argyllnamely aidanand in 575 at drumceat in north ireland he procured the recognition of aidan and brought the king of the picts also to confess aidans independent royalty  in the life of columba by adamnan we get a clear and complete view of everyday existence in the highlands during that age  we are among the red deer and the salmon and the cattle in the hills among the second sighted men too of whom columba was far the foremost  we see the saints inkpot upset by a clumsy but enthusiastic convert we even make acquaintance with the old white pony of the monastery who mourned when st columba was dying while among secular men we observe the differences in rank measured by degrees of wealth in cattle  many centuries elapse before in froissart we find a picture of scotland so distinct as that painted by adamnan  the discipline of st columba was of the monastic model  there were settlements of clerics in fortified villages the clerics were a kind of monks with more regard for abbots than for their many bishops and with peculiar tonsures and a peculiar way of reckoning the date of easter each missionary was popularly called a saint and the kil or cell of many a celtic missionary survives in hundreds of placenames  the saltwater loch leven in argyll was on the west the south frontier of pictland which on the east included all the country north of the firth of forth  from loch leven south to kintyre a large cantle including the isles was the land of the scots from ireland the dalriadic kingdom  the southwest from dumbarton including our modern cumberland and westmorland was named strathclyde and was peopled by british folk speaking an ancient form of welsh  on the east from ettrick forest into lothian the land was part of the early english kingdom of bernicia here the invading angles were already settledthough rivernames here remain gaelic and hillnames are often either gaelic or welsh  the great northern pictland was divided into seven provinces or subkingdoms while there was an overking or ardrigh with his capital at inverness and later in angus or forfarshire  the country about edinburgh was partly english partly cymric or welsh  the southwest corner galloway was called pictish and was peopled by gaelicspeaking tribes  in the course of time and events the dynasty of the argyll scoti from ireland gave its name to scotland while the english element gave its language to the lowlands it was adopted by the celtic kings of the whole country and became dominant while the celtic speech withdrew into the hills of the north and northwest  the nation was thus evolved out of alien and hostile elements irish pictish gaelic cymric english and on the northern and western shores scandinavian     chapter iii  early wars of races   in a work of this scope it is impossible to describe all the wars between the petty kingdoms peopled by races of various languages which occupied scotland  in 603 in the wild moors at degsastane between the liddel burn and the passes of the upper tyne the english aethelfrith of deira with an army of the still pagan ancestors of the borderers utterly defeated aidan king of argyll with the christian converted scots  henceforth for more than a century the english between forth and humber feared neither scot of the west nor pict of the north  on the death of aethelfrith 617 the christian west and north exercised their influences one of aethelfriths exiled sons married a pictish princess and became father of a pictish king another oswald was baptised at iona and the new king of the northern english of lothian edwin was converted by paullinus 627 and held edinburgh as his capital  later after an age of war and ruin oswald the convert of iona restored christianity in northern england and after his fall his brother oswiu consolidated the north english  in 685 oswius son egfrith crossed the forth and invaded pictland with a northumbrian army but was routed with great loss and was slain at nectans mere in forfarshire  thenceforth till 761 the picts were dominant as against scots and north english angus macfergus being then their leader 731 761  now the invaders and settlers from scandinavia the northmen on the west coast ravaged the christian scots of the west and burned iona finally in 844860 kenneth macalpine of kintyre a scot of dalriada on the paternal a pict on the mothers side defeated the picts and obtained their throne  by pictish law the crown descended in the maternal line which probably facilitated the coronation of kenneth  to the scots and to all europe he was a scot to the picts as son of a royal pictish mother he was a pict  with him at all events scots and picts were interfused and there began the scottish dynasty supplanting the pictish though it is only in popular tales that the picts were exterminated  owing to pressure from the northmen searovers in the west the capital and the seat of the chief bishop under kenneth macalpine 844860 were moved eastwards from iona to scone near perth and after an interval at dunkeld to st andrews in fife  the line of kenneth macalpine though disturbed by quarrels over the succession and by northmen in the west north and east none the less in some way held a good grip o the gear against vikings english of lothian and welsh of strathclyde  in consequence of a marriage with a welsh princess of strathclyde or cumberland a scottish prince donald brother of constantine ii became king of that realm 908 and his branch of the family of macalpin held cumbria for a century    english claims over scotland   in 924 the first claim by an english king edward to the overlordship of scotland appears in the anglosaxon chronicle  the entry contains a manifest error and the topic causes war between modern historians english and scottish  in fact there are several such entries of scottish acceptance of english suzerainty under constantine ii and later but they all end in the statement this held not long  the submission of malcolm i to edmund 945 is not a submission but an alliance the old english word for fellowworker or ally designates malcolm as fellowworker with edward of england  this word midwyrhta was translated fidelis one who gives fealty in the latin of english chroniclers two centuries later but malcolm i held cumberland as an ally not as a subject prince of england  in 1092 an english chronicle represents malcolm iii as holding cumberland by conquest  the main fact is that out of these and similar dim transactions arose the claims of edward i to the overlordship of scotlandclaims that were urged by queen elizabeths minister cecil in 1568 and were boldly denied by maitland of lethington  from these misty pretensions came the centuries of war that made the hardy character of the folk of scotland 10    the scottish acquisition of lothian   we cannot pretend within our scope to follow chronologically the fightings and flockings of kites and crows in a wolfage a warage when the northmen from all scandinavian lands and the danes who had acquired much of ireland were flying at the throat of england and hanging on the flanks of scotland while the britons of strathclyde struck in and the scottish kings again and again raided or sought to occupy the fertile region of lothian between forth and tweed  if the dynasty of macalpin could win rich lothian with its englishspeaking folk they were made men they held the granary of the north  by degrees and by methods not clearly defined they did win the castle of the maidens the acropolis of dunedin edinburgh and fifty years later in some way apparently by the sword at the battle of carham 1018 in which a scottish king of cumberland fought by his side malcolm ii took possession of lothian the whole southeast region by this time entirely anglified and this was the greatest step in the making of scotland  the celtic dynasty now held the most fertile district between forth and tweed a district already english in blood and speech the centre and focus of the english civilisation accepted by the celtic kings  under this malcolm too his grandson duncan became ruler of strathclydethat is practically of cumberland  malcolm is said to have been murdered at haunted glamis in forfarshire in 1034 the room where he died is pointed out by legend in the ancient castle  his rightful heir by the strange system of the scots should have been not his own grandson duncan but the grandson of kenneth iii the rule was that the crown went alternately to a descendant of the house of constantine 863877 son of kenneth macalpine and to a descendant of constantines brother aodh 877888  these alternations went on till the crowning of malcolm ii 10051034 and then ceased for malcolm ii had slain the unnamed male heir of the house of aodh a son of boedhe in order to open the succession to his own grandson the gracious duncan  boedhe had left a daughter gruach she had by the mormaor or underking of the province of murray a son lulach  on the death of the mormaor she married macbeth and when macbeth slew duncan 1040 he was removing a usurperas he understood itand he ruled in the name of his stepson lulach  the power of duncan had been weakened by repeated defeats at the hands of the northmen under thorfinn  in 1057 macbeth was slain in battle at lumphanan in aberdeenshire and malcolm canmore son of duncan after returning from england whither he had fled from macbeth succeeded to the throne  but he and his descendants for long were opposed by the house of murray descendants of lulach who himself had died in 1058  the world will always believe shakespeares version of these events and suppose the gracious duncan to have been a venerable old man and macbeth an ambitious thane with a bloodthirsty wife he himself being urged on by the predictions of witches  he was in fact mormaor of murray and upheld the claims of his stepson lulach who was son of a daughter of the wrongfully extruded house of aodh  malcolm canmore duncans grandson on the other hand represented the european custom of direct lineal succession against the ancient scots mode     chapter iv  malcolm canmorenorman conquest   the reign of malcolm canmore 10571093 brought scotland into closer connection with western europe and western christianity  the norman conquest 1066 increased the tendency of the englishspeaking people of lothian to acquiesce in the rule of a celtic king rather than in that of the adventurers who followed william of normandy  norman operations did not at first reach cumberland which malcolm held and on the death of his norse wife the widow of duncans foe thorfinn she left a son duncan malcolm allied himself with the english royal house by marrying margaret sister of eadgar aetheling then engaged in the hopeless effort to rescue northern england from the normans  the dates are confused malcolm may have won the beautiful sister of edgar rightful king of england in 1068 or at the time 1070 of his raid said to have been of savage ferocity into northumberland and his yet more cruel reprisals for gospatrics harrying of cumberland  in either case st margarets biographer who had lived at her court whether or not he was her confessor turgot represents the saint as subduing the savagery of malcolm who passed wakeful nights in weeping for his sins  a lover of books which malcolm could not read an expert in the delicate and gracious and bright works of women margaret brought her own gentleness and courtesy among a rude people built the abbey church of dunfermline and presented the churches with many beautiful golden reliquaries and fine sacramental plate  in 1072 to avenge a raid of malcolm 1070 the conqueror with an army and a fleet came to abernethy on tay where malcolm in exchange for english manors became his man for them and handed over his son duncan as a hostage for peace  the english view is that malcolm became williams man for all that he hador for all south of tay  after various raidings of northern england and after the death of the conqueror malcolm renewed in lothian the treaty of abernethy being secured in his twelve english manors 1091  william rufus then took and fortified carlisle seized part of malcolms lands in cumberland and summoned him to gloucester where the two kings after all quarrelled and did not meet  no sooner had malcolm returned home than he led an army into northumberland where he was defeated and slain near alnwick nov 13 1093  his son edward fell with him and his wife st margaret died in edinburgh castle her body under cloud of night was carried through the host of rebel celts and buried at dunfermline  margaret a beautiful and saintly englishwoman had been the ruling spirit of the reign in domestic and ecclesiastical affairs  she had civilised the court in matters of costume at least she had read books to the devoted malcolm who could not read and he had been her interpreter in her discussions with the celticspeaking clergy whose ideas of ritual differed from her own  the famous culdees originally ascetic hermits had before this day united in groups living under canonical rules and according to english observers had ceased to be bachelors  masses are said to have been celebrated by them in some barbarous rite saturday was sabbath on sunday men worked  lent began not on ash wednesday but on the monday following  we have no clearer account of the culdee peculiarities that st margaret reformed the hereditary tenure of benefices by lay protectors she did not reform but she restored the ruined cells of iona and established hospitia for pilgrims  she was decidedly unpopular with her celtic subjects who now made a struggle against english influences  in the year of her death died fothadh the last celtic bishop of st andrews and the celtic clergy were gradually superseded and replaced by monks of english name english speech and english ideasor rather the ideas of western europe  scotland under margarets influence became more catholic the celibacy of the clergy was more strictly enforced it had almost lapsed but it will be observed throughout that of all western europe scotland was least overawed by rome  yet for centuries the scottish church was in a peculiar degree the daughter of rome for not till about 1470 had she a metropolitan the archbishop of st andrews  on the deaths in one year of malcolm margaret and fothadh the last celtic bishop of st andrews the see for many years was vacant or merely filled by transient bishops  york and canterbury were at feud for their superiority over the scottish church and the other sees were not constituted and provided with bishops till the years 1115 glasgow 1150argyll not having a bishop till 1200  in the absence of a metropolitan episcopal elections had to be confirmed at rome which would grant no metropolitan but forbade the archbishop of york to claim a superiority which would have implied or prepared the way for english superiority over scotland  meanwhile the expenses and delays of appeals from bishops direct to rome did not stimulate the affection of the scottish daughter of rome  the rights of the chapters of the cathedrals to elect their bishops and other appointments to ecclesiastical offices in course of time were transferred to the pope who negotiated with the king and thus all manner of jobbery increased the nobles influencing the king in favour of their own needy younger sons and the pope being amenable to various secular persuasions so that in every way the relations of scotland with the holy father were anomalous and irksome  scotland was indeed a country predestined to much ill fortune to tribulations against which human foresight could erect no defence  but the marriage of the celtic malcolm with the english margaret and the friendly arrival of great nobles from the south enabled scotland to receive the new ideas of feudal law in pacific fashion  they were not violently forced upon the englishspeaking people of lothian    dynasty of malcolm   on the death of malcolm the contest for the crown lay between his brother donald ban supported by the celts his son duncan by his first wife a norse woman duncan being then a hostage at the english court who was backed by william rufus and thirdly malcolms eldest son by margaret eadmund the favourite with the anglicised south of the country  donald ban after a brief period of power was driven out by duncan 1094 duncan was then slain by the celts 1094  donald was next restored north of forth eadmund ruling in the south but was dispossessed and blinded by malcolms son eadgar who reigned for ten years 10971107 while eadmund died in an english cloister  eadgar had trouble enough on all sides but the process of anglicising continued under himself and later under his brother alexander i who ruled north of forth and clyde while the youngest brother david held lothian and cumberland with the title of earl  the sister of those sons of malcolm eadgyth matilda married henry i of england in 1100  there seemed a chance that north of clyde and forth there would be a celtic kingdom while lothian and cumbria would be merged in england  alexander was mainly engaged in fighting the moray claimants of his crown in the north and in planting his religious houses notably st andrews with english augustinian canons from york  canterbury and york contended for ecclesiastical superiority over scotland after various adventures robert the prior of the augustinians at scone was made bishop of st andrews being consecrated by canterbury in 1124 while york consecrated davids bishop in glasgow  thanks to the quarrels of the sees of york and canterbury the scottish clergy managed to secure their ecclesiastical independence from either english see and became finally the most useful combatants in the long struggle for the independence of the nation  rome on the whole backed that cause  the scottish catholic churchmen in fact pursued the old patriotic policy of resistance to england till the years just preceding the reformation when the people leaned to the reformed doctrines and when scottish national freedom was endangered more by france than by england     chapter v  david i and his times   with the death of alexander i april 25 1124 and the accession of his brother david i the deliberate royal policy of introducing into scotland english law and english institutions as modified by the norman rulers was fulfilled  david before alexanders death was earl of the most english part of lothian the country held by scottish kings and cumbria and resided much at the court of his brotherinlaw henry i  he associated when earl with nobles of anglonorman race and language such as moreville umfraville somerville gospatric bruce balliol and others men with a stake in both countries england and scotland  on coming to the throne david endowed these men with charters of lands in scotland  with him came a cadet of the great anglobreton house of fitzalan who obtained the hereditary office of seneschal or steward of scotland  his patronymic fitzalan merged in stewart later stuart and the family cognizance the fesse chequy in azure and argent represents the board of exchequer  the earliest stewart holdings of land were mainly in renfrewshire those of the bruces were in annandale  these two anglonorman houses between them were to found the stewart dynasty  the wife of david matilda widow of simon de st liz was heiress of waltheof sometime the conquerors earl in northumberland and to gain through that connection northumberland for himself was the chief aim of davids foreign policyan aim fertile in contentions  we have not space to disentangle the intricacies of davids first great domestic struggles briefly there was eternal dispeace caused by the celts headed by claimants to the throne the macheths representing the rights of lulach the ward of macbeth 20  in 1130 the celts were defeated and their leader angus earl of moray fell in fight near the north esk in forfarshire  his brother malcolm by aid of davids anglo norman friends was taken and imprisoned in roxburgh castle  the result of this rising was that david declared the great and ancient celtic earldom of moraythe home of his dynastic celtic rivalsforfeit to the crown  he planted the region with english anglonorman and lowland landholders a great step in the anglicisation of his kingdom thereafter for several centuries the strength of the celts lay in the west in moidart knoydart morar mamore lochaber and kintyre and in the western islands which fell into the hands of the sons of somerled the macdonalds  in 11351136 on the death of henry i david backing his own niece matilda as queen of england in opposition to stephen crossed the border in arms but was bought off  his son henry received the honour of huntingdom with the castle of carlisle and a vague promise of consideration of his claim to northumberland  in 1138 after a disturbed interval david led the whole force of his realm from orkney to galloway into yorkshire  his anglonorman friends the balliols and bruces with the archbishop of york now opposed him and his son prince henry  on august 22 1138 at cowton moor near northallerton was fought the great battle named from the huge english sacred banner the battle of the standard  in a military sense the fact that here the menatarms and knights of england fought as dismounted infantry their horses being held apart in reserve is notable as preluding to the similar english tactics in their french wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  thus arrayed the english received the impetuous charge of the wild galloway men not in armour who claimed the right to form the van and broke through the first line only to die beneath the spears of the second  but prince david with his heavy cavalry scattered the force opposed to him and stampeded the horses of the english that were held in reserve  this should have been fatal to the english but henry like rupert at marston moor pursued too far and the discipline of the scots was broken by the cry that their king had fallen and they fled  david fought his way to carlisle in a series of rearguard actions and at carlisle was joined by prince henry with the remnant of his menatarms it was no decisive victory for england  in the following year 1139 david got what he wanted  his son henry by peaceful arrangement received the earldom of northumberland without the two strong places bamborough and newcastle  through the anarchic weakness of stephens reign scotland advanced in strength and civilisation despite a celtic rising headed by a strange pretender to the rights of the macheths a brother wimund but all went with the death of davids son prince henry in 1152  of the princes three sons the eldest malcolm was but ten years old next came his brothers william the lion and little david earl of huntingdon  from this davids daughters descended the chief claimants to the scottish throne in 1292namely balliol bruce and comyn the last also was descended in the female line from king donald ban son of malcolm canmore  david had done all that man might do to settle the crown on his grandson malcolm his success meant that standing curse of scotland woe to the kingdom whose king is a childwhen in a year david died at carlisle may 24 1153    scotland becomes feudal   the result of the domestic policy of david was to bring all accessible territory under the social and political system of western europe the feudal system  its principles had been perfectly familiar to celtic scotland but had rested on a body of traditional customs as in homeric greece rather than on written laws and charters signed and sealed among the celts the local tribe had been theoretically the sole source of property in land  in proportion as they were near of kin to the recognised tribal chief families held lands by a tenure of three generations but if they managed to acquire abundance of oxen which they let out to poorer men for rents in kind and labour they were apt to turn the lands which they held only temporarily in possession into real permanent property  the poorer tribesmen paid rent in labour or services also in supplies of food and manure  the celtic tenants also paid military service to their superiors  the remotest kinsmen of each lord of land poor as they might be were valued for their swords and were billeted on the unfree or servile tenants who gave them free quarters  in the feudal system of western europe these old traditional customs had long been modified and stereotyped by written charters  the king gave gifts of land to his kinsmen or officers who were bound to be faithful fideles in return the inferior did homage while he received protection  from grade to grade of rank and wealth each inferior did homage to and received protection from his superior who was also his judge  in this process what had been the celtic tribe became the new thanage the celtic king righ of the tribe became the thane the province or group of tribes say moray became the earldom the celtic mormaer of the province became the earl and the crown appointed vice comites subearls that is sheriffs who administered the kings justice in the earldom  but there were regions notably the west highlands and isles where the new system penetrated slowly and with difficulty through a mountainous and almost townless land  the law and written leases came slowly up that way  under david where his rule extended society was divided broadly into three classesnobles free unfree  all holders of a knights fee or part of one holding by free service hereditarily and by charter constituted the communitas of the realm we are to hear of the communitas later and were free noble or gentlemen of coat armour  the ignoble not noble men with no charter from the crown or earl thane or church were if leaseholders though not noble still free  beneath them were the unfree nativi sold or given with the soil  the old celtic landholders were not expropriated as a rule except where celtic risings in galloway and moray were put down and the lands were left in the kings hands  often when we find territorial surnames of families de of this place or thatthe lords are really of celtic blood with celtic names disguised under territorial titles and finally disused  but in galloway and ayrshire the ruling celtic name kennedy remains celtic while the true highlands of the west and northwest retained their native magnates  thus the anglicisation except in very rebellious regions was gradual  there was much less expropriation of the celt than disguising of the celt under new family names and regulation of the celt under written charters and leases    church lands   david i was according to james vi nearly five centuries later a sair saint for the crown  he gave crownlands in the southern lowlands to the religious orders with their priories and abbeys for example holyrood melrose jedburgh kelso and dryburghcentres of learning and art and of skilled agriculture  probably the best service of the regular clergy to the state was its orderliness and attention to agriculture for the monasteries did not as in england produce many careful chroniclers and historians  each abbey had its lands divided into baronies captained by a lay church baron to lead its levies in war  the civil centre of the barony was the great farm or grange with its mill for in the thirteenth century the lowlands had watermills which to the west highlands were scarcely known in 1745 when the highland husbandmen were still using the primitive handquern of two circular stones  near the mill was a hamlet of some forty cottages each head of a family had a holding of eight or nine acres and pasturage for two cows and paid a small money rent and many arduous services to the abbey  the tenure of these cottars was and under lay landlords long remained extremely precarious but the tenure of the bonnet laird hosbernus was hereditary  below even the free cottars were the unfree serfs or nativi who were handed over with the lands they tilled to the abbeys by benefactors the church was forward in emancipating these serfs nor were lay landlords backward for the freed man was useful as a spearman in war  we have only to look at the many now ruined abbeys of the border to see the extent of civilisation under david i and the relatively peaceful condition then of that region which later became the cockpit of the english wars and the home of the raiding clans scotts elliots and armstrongs bells nixons robsons and croziers    the burghs   david and his son and successor william the lion introduced a stable middle and urban class by fostering confirming and regulating the rights privileges and duties of the already existing free towns  these became burghs royal seignorial or ecclesiastical  in origin the towns may have been settlements that grew up under the shelter of a military castle  their fairs markets rights of trading internal organisation and primitive police were now mainly under william the lion davids successor regulated by charters the burghers obtained the right to elect their own magistrates and held their own burghcourts all was done after the english model  as the state had its good men probi homines who formed its recognised community so had the borough  not by any means all dwellers in a burgh were free burghers these free burghers had to do service in guarding the royal castlelater this was commuted for a payment in money  though with power to elect their own chief magistrate the burghers commonly took as provost the head of some friendly local noble family in which the office was apt to become practically hereditary  the noble was the leader and protector of the town  as to police the burghers each in his turn provided men to keep watch and ward from curfew bell to cockcrow  each ward in the town had its own elected bailie  each burgh had exclusive rights of trading in its area and of taking toll on merchants coming within its octroi an association of four burghs berwick roxburgh edinburgh and stirling was the root of the existing convention of burghs    justice   in early societies justice is in many respects an affair to be settled between the kindreds of the plaintiff so to speak and the defendant  a man is wounded killed robbed wronged in any way his kin retaliate on the offender and his kindred  the bloodfeud the taking of blood for blood endured for centuries in scotland after the peace of the whole realm became under david i the kings peace  homicides for example were very frequently pardoned by royal grace but the pardon was of no avail unless it had been issued with the full knowledge of the kin of the slaughtered man who otherwise retained their legal right of vengeance on the homicide  they might accept pecuniary compensation the bloodfine or they might not as in homers time 27  at all events under david offences became offences against the king not merely against this or that kindred  david introduced the judgment of the country or visnet del pais for the settlement of pleas  every free man in his degree was tried by his peers but the old ordeal by fire and trial by combat or duel were not abolished  nor did compurgation cease wholly till queen marys reign  a powerful man when accused was then attended at his trial by hosts of armed backers men so unlike each other as knox bothwell and lethington took advantage of this usage  all lords had their own courts but murder rape arson and robbery could now only be tried in the royal courts these were the four pleas of the crown    the courts   as there was no fixed capital the kings court in davids time followed the king in his annual circuits through his realm between dumfries and inverness  later the regions of scotia north of forth lothian and the lawless realm of galloway had their grand justiciaries who held the four pleas  the other pleas were heard in courts of royalty and by earls bishops abbots down to the baron with his right of pit and gallows  at such courts by a law of 1180 the sheriff of the shire or an agent of his ought to be present so that royal and central justice was extending itself over the minor local courts  but if the sheriff or his sergeant did not attend when summoned local justice took its course  the process initiated by davids son william the lion was very slowly substituting the royal authority the royal sheriffs of shires juries and witnesses for the wild justice of revenge and trial by ordeal and trial by combat  but hereditary jurisdictions of nobles and gentry were not wholly abolished till after the battle of culloden  where abbots held courts their procedure in civil cases was based on laws sanctioned by popes and general councils  but alas the abbot might give just judgment to execute it we know from a curious instance was not within his power if the offender laughed at a sentence of excommunication  david and his successors till the end of the thirteenth century made scotland a more civilised and kept it a much less disturbed country than it was to remain during the long war of independence while the beautiful abbeys with their churches and schools attested a high stage of art and education     chapter vi  malcolm the maiden   the prominent facts in the brief reign of davids son malcolm the maiden crowned 1153 at the age of eleven were first a celtic rising by donald a son of malcolm macheth now a prisoner in roxburgh castle and a nephew of the famous somerled macgillebride of argyll  somerled won from the norse the isle of man and the southern hebrides from his sons descend the great macdonald lords of the isles always the leaders of the long celtic resistance to the central authority in scotland  again malcolm resigned to henry ii of england the northern counties held by david i and died after subduing galloway and on the death of somerled said to have been assassinated the tribes of the isles in 1165    william the lion   ambition to recover the northern english counties revealed itself in the overtures of william the lionmalcolms brother and successorfor an alliance between scotland and france  the auld alliance now dawned with rich promise of good and evil  in hopes of french aid william invaded northumberland later laid siege to carlisle and on july 13 1174 was surprised in a morning mist and captured at alnwick  scotland was now kingless galloway rebelled and william taken a captive to falaise in normandy surrendered absolutely the independence of his country which for fifteen years really was a fief of england  when william was allowed to go home it was to fight the celts of galloway and subdue the pretensions in moray of the macwilliams descendants of william son of duncan son of malcolm canmore  during williams reign 1188 pope clement iii decided that the scottish church was subject not to york or canterbury but to rome  seven years earlier defending his own candidate for the see of st andrews against the chosen of the pope william had been excommunicated and his country and he had unconcernedly taken the issue of an interdict  the pope was too far away and william feared him no more than robert bruce was to do  by 1188 william refused to pay to henry ii a saladin tithe for a crusade and in 1189 he bought from richard i who needed money for a crusade the abrogation of the treaty of falaise  he was still disturbed by celts in galloway and the north he still hankered after northumberland but after preparations for war he paid a fine and drifted into friendship with king john who entertained his little daughters royally and knighted his son alexander  william died on december 4 1214  he was buried at the abbey of arbroath founded by him in honour of st thomas of canterbury who had worked a strange posthumous miracle in scotland  william was succeeded by his son alexander ii 12141249    alexander ii   under this prince who successfully put down the usual northern risings the old suit about the claims to northumberland was finally abandoned for a trifling compensation 1237  alexander had married joanna daughter of king john and his brotherinlaw henry iii did not press his demand for homage for scotland  the usual celtic pretenders to the throne were for ever crushed  argyll became a sheriffdom galloway was brought into order and alexander who died in the isle of kerrera in the bay of oban 1249 well deserved his title of a king of peace  he was buried in melrose abbey  in his reign the clergy were allowed to hold provincial or synodal councils without the presence of a papal legate 1225 and the dominicans and franciscans appeared in scotland    alexander iii   the term king of peace was also applied to alexander iii son of the second wife of alexander ii marie de coucy  alexander came to the throne 1249 at the age of eight  as a child he was taken and held like james ii james iii james v and james vi by contending factions of the nobles henry of england intervening  in 1251 he wedded another child margaret daughter of henry iii of england but henry neither forced a claim to hold scotland during the boys minority his right if scotland were his fief nor in other respects pressed his advantage  in february 12611262 a girl was born to alexander at windsor she was margaret later wife of eric of norway  her daughter on the death of alexander iii march 19 1286 was the sole direct descendant in the male line  after the birth of this heiress alexander won from norway the isles of the western coast of scotland in which norse chieftains had long held sway  they complained to hakon of norway concerning raids made on them by the earl of ross a celtic potentate  alexanders envoys to hakon were detained and in 1263 hakon with a great fleet sailed through the islands  a storm blew most of his armada to shore near largs where his men were defeated by the scots  hakon collected his ships sailed north and december 15 died at kirkwall  alexander now brought the island princes including the lord of man into subjection and by treaty in 1266 placed them under the crown  in 1275 benemund de vicci called bagimont at a council in perth compelled the clergy to pay a tithe for a crusade the pope insisting that the money should be assessed on the true value of beneficesthat is on bagimonts rollthenceforth recognised as the basis of clerical taxation  in 1278 edward i laboured to extract from alexander an acknowledgment that he was englands vassal edward signally failed but a palpably false account of alexanders homage was fabricated and dated september 29 1278  this was not the only forgery by which england was wont to back her claims  a series of bereavements 12811283 deprived alexander of all his children save his little grandchild the maid of norway  she was recognised by a great national assembly at scone as heiress of the throne and alexander had no issue by his second wife a daughter of the comte de dreux  on the night of march 19 1285 while alexander was riding from edinburgh to visit his bride at kinghorn his horse slipped over a cliff and the rider was slain     chapter vii  encroachments of edward iwallace   the estates of scotland met at scone april 11 1286 and swore loyalty to their child queen the maid of norway granddaughter of alexander iii  six guardians of the kingdom were appointed on april 11 1286  they were the bishops of st andrews and glasgow two comyns buchan and badenoch the earl of fife and lord james the steward of scotland  no bruce or baliol was among the custodians  instantly a band or covenant was made by the bruces earls of annandale and carrick to support their claims failing the maid to the throne and there were acts of war on their part against another probable candidate john balliol  edward like henry viii in the case of mary stuart moved for the marriage of the infant queen to his son  a treaty safeguarding all scottish liberties as against england was made by clerical influences at birgham july 18 1290 but by october 7 news of the death of the young queen reached scotland she had perished during her voyage from norway private war now broke out between the bruces and balliols and the party of balliol appealed to edward through fraser bishop of st andrews asking the english king to prevent civil war and recommending balliol as a person to be carefully treated  next the seven earls alleging some dim elective right recommended bruce and appealed to edward as their legal superior  edward came to norhamontweed in may 1291 proclaimed himself lord paramount and was accepted as such by the twelve candidates for the crown june 3  the great nobles thus to serve their ambitions betrayed their country the communitas whatever that term may here mean made a futile protest  as lord among his vassals edward heard the pleadings and evidence in autumn 1292 and out of the descendants in the female line of david earl of huntingdon youngest son of david i he finally november 17 1292 preferred john balliol greatgrandson of the earl through his eldest daughter to bruce the old grandfather of the famous robert bruce and grandson of earl davids second daughter  the decision according to our ideas was just no modern court could set it aside  but balliol was an unpopular weaklingan empty tabard the people saidand edward at once subjected him king as he was to all the humiliations of a petty vassal  he was summoned into his lords court on the score of the bills of tradesmen  if edwards deliberate policy was to goad balliol into resistance and then conquer scotland absolutely in the first of these aims he succeeded  in 1294 balliol was summoned with his peers to attend edward in gascony  balliol by advice of a council 1295 sought a french alliance and a french marriage for his son named edward he gave the annandale lands of his enemy robert bruce father of the king to be to comyn earl of buchan  he besieged carlisle while edward took berwick massacred the people and captured sir william douglas father of the good lord james  in the war which followed edward broke down resistance by a sanguinary victory at dunbar captured john comyn of badenoch the red comyn received from balliol july 7 1296 the surrender of his royal claims and took the oaths of the steward of scotland and the bruces father and son  he carried to westminster the black rood of st margaret and the famous stone of scone a relic of the early irish dynasty of the scots as far north as elgin he rode receiving the oaths of all persons of note and influenceexcept william wallace  his name does not appear in the list of submissions called the ragmans roll  between april and october 1296 the country was subjugated the castles were garrisoned by englishmen  but by january 1297 edwards governor warenne earl of surrey and ormsby his chief justice found the country in an uproar and at midsummer 1297 the levies of the northern counties of england were ordered to put down the disorders    the year of wallace   in may the commune of scotland whatever the term may here mean had chosen wallace as their leader probably this younger son of sir malcolm wallace of elderslie in renfrewshire had already been distinguished for his success in skirmishes against the english as well as for strength and courage 36  the popular account of his early adventures given in the poem by blind harry 1490 is of no historical value  his men destroyed the english at lanark may 1297 he was abetted by wishart bishop of glasgow and the steward but by july 7 percy and clifford leading the english army admitted the steward robert bruce the future king and wishart to the english peace at irvine in ayrshire  but the north was up under sir andrew murray and that thief wallace to quote an english contemporary left the siege of dundee castle which he was conducting to face warenne on the north bank of the forth  on september 11 the english under warenne manoeuvred vaguely at stirling bridge and were caught on the flank by wallaces army before they could deploy on the northern side of the river  they were cut to pieces cressingham was slain and warenne galloped to berwick while the scots harried northumberland with great ferocity which wallace seems to have been willing but not often able to control  by the end of march 1298 he appears with andrew murray as guardian of the kingdom for the exiled balliol  this attitude must have aroused the jealousy of the nobles and especially of robert bruce who aimed at securing the crown and who after several changes of side by june 1298 was busy in edwards service in galloway  edward then crossed the border with a great army of perhaps 40000 men met the spearmen of wallace in their serried phalanxes at falkirk broke the schiltrom or clump of spears by the arrows of his archers slaughtered the archers of ettrick forest scattered the mounted nobles and avenged the rout of stirling july 22 1298  the country remained unsubdued but its leaders were at odds among themselves and wallace had retired to france probably to ask for aid he may also conceivably have visited rome  the bishop of st andrews lamberton with bruce and the red comyndeadly rivalswere guardians of the kingdom in 1299  but in june 1300 edward undeterred by remonstrances from the pope entered scotland an armistice however was accorded to the holy father and the war in which the scots scored a victory at roslin in february 1293 dragged on from summer to summer till july 1304  in these years bruce alternately served edward and conspired against him the intricacies of his perfidy are deplorable  bruce served edward during the siege of stirling then the central key of the country  on its surrender edward admitted all men to his peace on condition of oaths of fealty except messire williame le waleys  men of the noblest scottish names stooped to pursue the hero he was taken near glasgow and handed over to sir john menteith a stewart and son of the earl of menteith  as sheriff of dumbartonshire menteith had no choice but to send the hero in bonds to england  but if menteith desired to escape the disgrace with which tradition brands his name he ought to have refused the english bloodprice for the capture of wallace he made no such refusal  as an outlaw wallace was hanged at london his limbs like those of the great montrose were impaled on the gates of various towns  what we really know about the chief popular hero of his country from documents and chronicles is fragmentary and it is hard to find anything trustworthy in blind harrys rhyming wallace 1490 plagiarised as it is from barbours earlier poem 1370 on bruce 38  but wallace was truly brave disinterested and indomitable  alone among the leaders he never turned his coat never swore and broke oaths to edward  he arises from obscurity like jeanne darc like her he is greatly victorious like her he awakens a whole people like her he is deserted and is unlawfully put to death while his limbs like her ashes are scattered by the english  the ravens had not pyked his bones bare before the scots were up again for freedom     chapter viii  bruce and the war of independence   the position towards france of edward i made it really more desirable for him that scotland should be independent and friendly than half subdued and hostile to his rule  while she was hostile england in attacking france always left an enemy in her rear  but edward supposed that by clemency to all the scottish leaders except wallace by giving them great appointments and trusting them fully and by calling them to his parliament in london he could combine england and scotland in affectionate union  he repaired the ruins of war in scotland he began to study her laws and customs he hastily ran up for her a new constitution and appointed his nephew john of brittany as governor but he had overlooked two facts the scottish clergy from the highest to the lowest were irreconcilably opposed to union with england and the greatest and most warlike of the scottish nobles if not patriotic were fickle and insatiably ambitious  it is hard to reckon how often robert bruce had turned his coat and how often the bishop of st andrews had taken the oath to edward  both men were in edwards favour in june 1304 but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant through 1305 bruce prospered in edwards service on february 10 1306 edward was conferring on him a new favour little guessing that bruce after some negotiation with his old rival the red comyn had slain him an uncle of his was also butchered before the high altar of the church of the franciscans in dumfries  apparently bruce had tried to enlist comyn in his conspiracy and had found him recalcitrant or feared that he would be treacherous february 10 1306  the sacrilegious homicide made it impossible for bruce again to waver  he could not hope for pardon he must be victorious or share the fate of wallace  he summoned his adherents including young james douglas received the support of the bishops of st andrews and glasgow hurried to scone and there was hastily crowned with a slight coronet in the presence of but two earls and three bishops  edward made vast warlike preparations and forswore leniency while bruce under papal excommunication which he slighted collected a few nobles such as lennox atholl errol and a brother of the chief of the frazers other chiefs kinsmen of the slain comyn among them macdowal of argyll banded to avenge the victim bruces little force was defeated at methven wood near perth by aymer de valence and prisoners of all ranks were hanged as traitors while two bishops were placed in irons  bruce took to the heather pursued by the macdowals no less than by the english his queen was captured his brother nigel was executed he cut his way to the wild west coast aided only by sir nial campbell of loch awe who thus founded the fortune of his house and by the macdonalds under angus og of islay  he wintered in the isle of rathlin some think he even went to norway and in spring after surprising the english garrison in his own castle of turnberry he roamed now lonely now with a mobile little force in galloway always evading and sometimes defeating his english pursuers  at loch trool and at london hill drumclog he dealt them heavy blows while on june 7 1307 his great enemy edward died at boroughonsands leaving the crown and the war to the weakling edward ii  fortune had turned  we cannot follow bruce through his campaign in the north where he ruined the country of the comyns 1308 and through the victories in galloway of his hardfighting brother edward  with enemies on every side bruce took them in detail early in march 1309 he routed the macdowals at the west end of the pass of brander  edward ii was involved in disputes with his own barons and bruce was recognised by his countrys church in 1310 and aided by his great lieutenants sir james douglas and thomas randolph earl of murray  by august 1311 bruce was carrying the war into england sacking durham and chester failing at carlisle but in january 1313 capturing perth  in summer edward bruce in the spirit of chivalry gave to stirling castle randolph had taken edinburgh castle a set day midsummer day 1314 to be relieved or to surrender and bruce kept tryst with edward ii and his english and irish levies and all his adventurous chivalry from france hainault bretagne gascony and aquitaine  all the world knows the story of the first battle the scottish quatre bras the success of randolph on the right the slaying of bohun when bruce broke his battleaxe  next day bruces position was strong beneath the towers of stirling the bannockburn protected his front morasses only to be crossed by narrow paths impeded the english advance  edward bruce commanded the right wing randolph the centre douglas and the steward the left bruce the reserve the islesmen  his strength lay in his spearmens dark impenetrable wood his archers were illtrained of horse he had but a handful under keith the marischal  but the heavy english cavalry could not break the squares of spears keith cut up the archers of england the main body could not deploy and the slow relentless advance of the whole scottish line covered the plain with the dying and the flying  a panic arose caused by the sight of an approaching cloud of campfollowers on the gillies hill edward fled and hundreds of noble prisoners with all the waggons and supplies of england fell into the hands of the scots  in eight strenuous years the generalship of bruce and his warleaders the resolution of the people hardened by the cruelties of edward the sermons of the clergy and the utter incompetence of edward ii had redeemed a desperate chance  from a fief of england scotland had become an indomitable nation    later days of bruce   bruce continued to prosper despite an illadvised attempt to win ireland in which edward bruce fell 1318  this left the succession if bruce had no male issue to the children of his daughter marjory and her husband the steward  in 1318 scotland recovered berwick in 1319 routed the english at myttononswale  in a parliament at aberbrothock april 6 1320 the scots announced to the pope who had been interfering that while a hundred of them survive they will never yield to england  in october 1322 bruce utterly routed the english at byland abbey in the heart of yorkshire and chased edward ii into york  in march 1324 a son was born to bruce named david on may 4 1328 by the treaty of northampton the independence of scotland was recognised  in july the infant david married joanna daughter of edward ii  on june 7 1329 bruce died and was buried at dunfermline his heart by his order was carried by douglas towards the holy land and when douglas fell in a battle with the moors in spain the heart was brought back by sir simon lockhart of the lee  the later career of bruce after he had been excommunicated is that of the foremost knight and most sagacious man of action who ever wore the crown of scotland  the staunchness with which the clergy and estates disregarded papal fulminations indeed under william the lion they had treated an interdict as wastepaper indicated a kind of protestant tendency to independence of the holy see  bruces inclusion of representatives of the burghs in the first regular scottish parliament at cambuskenneth in 1326 was a great step forward in the constitutional existence of the country  the king in scotland was expected to live of his own but in 1326 the expenses of the war with england compelled bruce to seek permission for taxation     chapter ix  decadence and disastersreign of david ii   the heroic generation of scotland was passing off the stage  the king was a child  the forfeiture by bruce of the lands of hostile or treacherous lords and his bestowal of the estates on his partisans had made the disinherited nobles the enemies of scotland and had fed too full the house of douglas  as the star of scotland was thus cloudedshe had no strong man for a king during the next ninety yearsthe sun of england rose red and glorious under a warrior like edward iii  the scottish nobles in many cases ceased to be true to their proud boast that they would never submit to england  a very brief summary of the wretched reign of david ii must here suffice  first the son of john balliol edward went to the english court and thither thronged the disinherited and forfeited lords arranging a raid to recover their lands  edward iii of course connived at their preparations  after randolphs death july 20 1332 when mara sisters son of brucewas regent the disinherited lords under balliol invaded scotland and mar with young randolph menteith and a bastard of bruce robert of carrick leading a very great host fell under the shafts of the english archers of umfraville wake the english earl of atholl talbot ferrers and zouche at dupplin on the earn august 12 1332 rolled up by arrows loosed on the flanks of their charging columns they fell and their dead bodies lay in heaps as tall as a lance  on september 24 edward balliol was crowned king at scone  later andrew murray perhaps a son of the murray who had been wallaces companionin arms was taken and balliol acknowledged edward iii as his liegelord at roxburgh  in december the second son of randolph with archibald the new regent brother of the great black douglas drove balliol flying in his shirt from annan across the border  he returned and was opposed by this archibald douglas called tineman the unlucky and on july 19 1333 tineman suffered at halidon hill near berwick a defeat as terrible as flodden berwick too was lost practically for ever tineman fell and sir william douglas the knight of liddesdale was a prisoner  these scots defeats were always due to rash frontal attacks on strong positions the assailants passing between lines of english bowmen who loosed into their flanks  the boy king david was carried to france 1334 for safety while balliol delivered to edward berwick and the chief southern counties including that of edinburgh with their castles  there followed internal wars between balliols partisans while the patriots were led by young randolph by the young steward by sir andrew murray and the wavering and cruel douglas called the knight of liddesdale now returned from captivity  in the desperate state of things with balliol and edward ravaging scotland at will none showed more resolution than bruces sister who held kildrummie castle and randolphs daughter black agnes who commanded that of dunbar  by vast gifts balliol won over john lord of the isles  the celts turned to the english party edward iii harried the province of moray but in 1337 he began to undo his successes by formally claiming the crown of france france and scotland together could always throw off the english yoke  thus diverted from scotland edward lost strength there while he warred with scotlands ally in 1341 the douglas knight of liddesdale recovered edinburgh castle by a romantic surprise  but david returned home in 1341 a boy of eighteen full of the foibles of chivalry rash sensual extravagant who at once gave deadly offence to the knight of liddesdale by preferring to him as sheriff of teviotdale the brave sir alexander ramsay who had driven the english from the siege of dunbar castle  douglas threw ramsay into hermitage castle in liddesdale and starved him to death  in 1343 the knight began to intrigue traitorously with edward iii after a truce david led his whole force into england where his rash chivalry caused his utter defeat at nevilles cross near durham october 17 1346  he was taken as was the bishop of st andrews his ransom became the central question between england and scotland  in 1353 douglas knight of liddesdale was slain at williamshope on yarrow by his godson william lord douglas the fact is commemorated in a fragment of perhaps our oldest narrative border ballad  french menatarms now helped the scots to recover berwick merely to lose it again in 1356 in 1357 david was set free his ransom 100000 merks was to be paid by instalment the country was heavily taxed but the full sum was never paid  meanwhile the steward had been regent between him the heir of the crown failing issue to david and the king jealousies arose  david was suspected of betraying the kingdom to england in october 1363 he and the earl of douglas visited london and made a treaty adopting a son of edward as king on davids demise and on his ransom being remitted but in march 1364 his estates rejected the proposal to which douglas had assented  till 1369 all was poverty and internal disunion the feud to be so often renewed of the douglas and the steward raged  david was made contemptible by a second marriage with margaret logie but the war with france drove edward iii to accept a fourteen years truce with scotland on february 22 1371 david died in edinburgh castle being succeeded without opposition by the steward robert ii son of walter and of marjorie daughter of robert bruce  this robert ii somewhat outworn by many years of honourable war in his countrys cause and the father of a family by elizabeth mure of rowallan which could hardly be rendered legitimate by any number of papal dispensations was the first of the royal stewart line  in him a cadet branch of the english fitzalans themselves of a very ancient breton stock blossomed into royalty    parliament and the crown   with the coming of a dynasty which endured for three centuries we must sketch the relations in scotland of crown and parliament till the days of the covenant and the revolution of 1688  scotland had but little of the constitutional evolution so conspicuous in the history of england the reason is that while the english kings with their fiefs and wars in france had constantly to be asking their parliaments for money and while parliament first exacted the redress of grievances in scotland the king was expected to live of his own on the revenue of crownlands rents feudal aids fines exacted in courts of law and duties on merchandise  no tenths or fifteenths were exacted from clergy and people  there could be no constitutional resistance when the crown made no unconstitutional demands  in scotland the germ of parliament is the kings court of vassals of the crown  to the assemblies held now in one place now in another would usually come the vassals of the district with such officers of state as the chancellor the chamberlain the steward the constable or commander inchief the justiciar and the marischal and such bishops abbots priors earls barons and tenantsinchief as chose to attend  at these meetings public business was done charters were granted and statutes were passed assent was made to such feudal aids as money for the kings ransom in the case of william the lion  in 1295 the seals of six royal burghs are appended to the record of a negotiation in 1326 burgesses as we saw were consulted by bruce on questions of finance  the misfortunes and extravagance of david ii had to be paid for and parliament interfered with the royal prerogative in coinage and currency directed the administration of justice dictated terms of peace with england called to account even hereditary officers of the crown such as the steward constable and marischal controlled the kings expenditure or tried to do so and denounced the execution of royal warrants against the statutes and common form of law  they summarily rejected davids attempt to alter the succession of the crown  at the same time as attendance of multitudes during protracted parliaments was irksome and expensive arose the habit of intrusting business to a mere committee of articles later the lords of the articles selected in varying ways from the three estatesspiritual noble and commons  these committees saved the members of parliament from the trouble and expense of attendance but obviously tended to become an abuse being selected and packed to carry out the designs of the crown or of the party of nobles in power  all members of whatever estate sat together in the same chamber  there were no elected knights of the shires no representative system  the reign of david ii saw two scottish authors or three whose works are extant  barbour wrote the chivalrous rhymed epicchronicle the brus wyntoun an unpoetic rhymed cronykil and hucheoun of the awle ryal produced works of more genius if all that he is credited with be his own     chapter x  early stewart kings robert ii  13711390   robert ii was crowned at scone on march 26 1371  he was elderly jovial pacific and had little to fear from england when the deaths of edward iii and the black prince left the crown to the infant richard ii there was fighting against isolated english castles within the scottish border to amuse the warlike douglases and percies and there were truces irregular and ill kept  in 1384 great english and scottish raids were made and gentlemen of france who came over for sport were scurvily entertained and 1385 saw more plundering than honest fighting under james earl of douglas who merely showed them an army that under richard ii burned melrose abbey and fired edinburgh perth and dundee edinburgh was a town of 400 houses  richard insisted that not more than a third of his huge force should be english borderers who had no idea of hitting their scottish neighbours fathersinlaw and brothersinlaw too hard  the one famous fight that of otterburn august 15 1388 was a great and joyous passage of arms by moonlight  the douglas fell the percy was led captive away the survivors gained advancement in renown and the hearty applause of the chivalrous chronicler froissart  the oldest ballads extant on this affair were current in 1550 and show traces of the reading of froissart and the english chroniclers  in 1390 died robert ii  only his youth was glorious  the reign of his son robert iii crowned august 14 1390 was that of a weakling who let power fall into the hands of his brother the duke of albany or his son david duke of rothesay who held the reins after the parliament a parliament that bitterly blamed the government of january 1399  with these two princes the title of duke first appears in scotland  the follies of young david alienated all he broke his betrothal to the daughter of the earl of march march retired to england becoming the man of henry iv and though rothesay wedded the daughter of the earl of douglas he was arrested by albany and douglas and was starved to death or died of dysentery in falkland castle 1402  the highlanders had been in anarchy throughout the reign their blood was let in the great clan duel of thirty against thirty on the inch of perth in 1396 probably clans cameron and chattan were the combatants  on rothesays death albany was governor while douglas was taken prisoner in the great border defeat of homildon hill not far from flodden  but then 1403 came the alliance of douglas with percy percys quarrel with henry iv and their defeat and hotspurs death douglass capture at shrewsbury  between shakespeare in henry iv and scott in the fair maid of perth the most notable events in the reign of robert iii are immortalised  the kings last misfortune was the capture by the english at sea on the way to france of his son james in februarymarch 1406 52  on april 4 1406 robert went to his rest one of the most unhappy of the fated princes of his line    the regency of albany   the regency of albany uncle of the captured james lasted for fourteen years ending with his death in 1420  he occasionally negotiated for his kings release but more successfully for that of his son murdoch  that james suspected albanys ambition and was irritated by his conduct appears in his letters written in scots to albany and to douglas released in 1408 and now free in scotland  the letters are of 1416  the most important points to note during jamess english captivity are the lawlessness and oppression which prevailed in scotland and the beginning of lollard heresies nascent protestantism nascent socialism even free love  the parliament of 1399 which had inveighed against the laxity of government under robert ii also demanded the extirpation of heresies in accordance with the coronation oath  one resby a heretical english priest was arraigned and burned at perth in 1407 under laurence of lindores the dominican inquisitor into heresies who himself was active in promoting scotlands oldest university st andrews the foundation was by henry wardlaw bishop of st andrews by virtue of a bull from the antipope benedict xiii of february 1414  lollard ideas were not suppressed the chronicler bower speaks of their existence in 1445 they sprang from envy of the wealth and indignation against the corruptions of the clergy and the embers of lollardism in kyle were not cold when under james v the flame of the reformation was rekindled  the celtic north never quiet made its last united effort in 1411 when donald lord of the isles who was in touch with the english government claimed the earldom of ross in right of his wife as against the earl of buchan a son of albany mustered all the wild clans of the west and the isles at ardtornish castle on the sound of mull marched through ross to dingwall defeated the great northern clan of mackay and was hurrying to sack aberdeen when he was met by alexander stewart earl of mar the gentry of the northern lowlands mounted knights and the burgesses of the towns some eighteen miles from aberdeen at harlaw  there was a pitched battle with great slaughter but the celts had no cavalry and the end was that donald withdrew to his fastnesses  the event is commemorated by an old literary ballad and in elspeths ballad in scotts novel the antiquary  in the year of albanys death at a great age 1420 in compliance with the prayer of charles vii of france the earl of buchan archibald douglass eldest son and sir john stewart of derneley led a force of some 7000 to 10000 men to war for france  henry v then compelled the captive james i to join him and 1421 at bauge bridge the scots with the famed la hire routed the army of henrys brother the duke of clarence who with 2000 of the english fell in the action  the victory was fruitless at crevant 1423 the scots were defeated at verneuil 1424 they were almost exterminated  none the less the remnant with fresh levies continued to war for their old ally and under sir hugh kennedy and others suffered at rouvray february 1429 and were with the victorious french at orleans may 1429 under the leadership of jeanne darc  the combination of scots and french at the last push always saved the independence of both kingdoms  the character of albany who under his father robert iii and during the captivity of james i ruled scotland so long is enigmatic  he is well spoken of by the contemporary wyntoun author of a chronicle in rhyme and in the latin of wyntouns continuator bower  he kept on friendly terms with the douglases he was popular in so far as he was averse to imposing taxation and perhaps the anarchy and oppression which preceded the return of james i to scotland were due not to the weakness of albany but to that of his son and successor murdoch and to the iniquities of murdochs sons  the death of henry v 1422 and the ambition of cardinal beaufort determined to wed his niece jane beaufort to a crowned king may have been among the motives which led the english government their own king henry vi being a child to set free the royal captive 1424     chapter xi  james i   on march 28 1424 james i was released on a ransom of 40000 pounds and after his marriage with jane beaufort granddaughter of john of gaunt son of edward iii  the story of their wooing of course in the allegorical manner of the age and with poetical conventions in place of actual details is told in jamess poem the kings quair a beautiful composition in the school of chaucer of which literary scepticism has vainly tried to rob the royal author  james was the ablest and not the most scrupulous of the stuarts  his captivity had given him an english education a belief in order and in english parliamentary methods and a fiery determination to put down the oppression of the nobles  if god gives me but a dogs life he said i will make the key keep the castle and the bracken bush keep the cow  before his first parliament in may 1424 james arrested murdochs eldest son sir walter fleming of cumbernauld and the younger boyd of kilmarnock  the parliament left a committee of the estates the lords of the articles to carry out the royal policy  taxes for the payment of jamess ransom were imposed to impose them was easy passive resistance was easier the money was never paid and jamess noble hostages languished in england  he next arrested the old earl of lennox and sir robert graham of the kincardine family later his murderer  these were causes of unpopularity  during a new parliament 1425 james imprisoned the new duke of albany murdoch and his son alexander and seized their castles 57  the albanys and lennox were executed their estates were forfeited but resentment dogged a king who was too fierce and too hurried a reformer perhaps too cruel an avenger of his own wrongs  our knowledge of the events of his reign is vague but a king of scotland could never with safety treat any of his nobles as criminals the whole order was concerned to prevent or avenge severity of justice  at a parliament in inverness 1427 he seized the greatest of the highland magnates whom he had summoned they were hanged or imprisoned and after resistance alastair the new lord of the isles did penance at holyrood before being immured in tantallon castle  his cousin donald balloch defeated mar at inverlochy where montrose later routed argyll 1431  not long afterwards donald fled to ireland whence a head said to be his was sent to james but donald lived to fight another day  without a standing army to garrison the inaccessible highlands the crown could neither preserve peace in those regions nor promote justice  the system of violent and perfidious punishments merely threw the celts into the arms of england  execution itself was less terrible to the nobles than the forfeiting of their lands and the disinheriting of their families  none the less james 14251427 seized the lands of the late earl of lennox made malise graham surrender the earldom of strathearn in exchange for the barren title of earl of menteith and sent the sufferer as a hostage into england  the earl of march son of the earl who under robert iii had gone over to the english cause was imprisoned and stripped of his ancient domains on the eastern border and james disinheriting lord erskine annexed the earldom of mar to the crown  in a parliament at perth march 1428 james permitted the minor barons and freeholders to abstain from these costly assemblies on the condition of sending two wise men to represent each sheriffdom a speaker was to be elected and the shires were to pay the expenses of the wise men  but the measure was unpopular and in practice lapsed  excellent laws were passed but were not enforced  in julynovember 1428 a marriage was arranged between margaret the infant daughter of james and the son later louis xi of the still uncrowned dauphin charles viii of france  charles announced to his subjects early in 1429 that an army of 6000 scots was to land in france that james himself if necessary would follow but jeanne darc declared that there was no help from scotland none save from god and herself  she was right no sooner had she won her victories at orleans jargeau pathay and elsewhere mayjune 1429 than james made a truce with england which enabled cardinal beaufort to throw his large force of antihussite crusaders into france where they secured normandy  the scots in france nevertheless fought under the maid in her last successful action at lagny april 1430  an heir to the crown james was born in october 1430 while the king was at strife with the pope and asserting for king and parliament power over the provincial councils of the church  an interdict was threatened james menaced the rich and lax religious orders with secular reformation settled the carthusians at perth to show an example of holy living and pursued his severities against many of his nobles  his treatment of the earl of strathearn despoiled and sent as a hostage to england aroused the wrath of the earls uncle robert graham who bearded james in parliament was confiscated fled across the highland line and on february 20 1437 aided it is said by the old earl of atholl a grandson of robert ii by his second marriage led a force against the king in the monastery of the black friars at perth surprised him and butchered him  the energy of his queen brought the murderers and atholl himself to die under unspeakable torments  jamess reforms were hurried violent and as a rule incapable of surviving the anarchy of his sons minority his new court of session sitting in judgment thrice ayear was his most fortunate innovation     chapter xii  james ii   scone with its sacred stone being so near perth and the highlands was perilous and the coronation of james ii was therefore held at holyrood march 25 1437  the child who was but seven years of age was bandied to and fro like a shuttlecock between rival adventurers  the earl of douglas archibald fifth earl died 1439 took no leading part in the strife of factions one of them led by sir william crichton who held the important post of commander of edinburgh castle the other by sir alexander livingstone of callendar  the great old houses had been shaken by the severities of james i at least for the time  in a government of factions influenced by private greed there was no important difference in policy and we need not follow the transference of the royal person from crichton in edinburgh to livingstone in stirling castle the coalitions between these worthies the battles between the boyds of kilmarnock and the stewarts who had to avenge stewart of derneley constable of the scottish contingent in france who was slain by sir thomas boyd  the queenmother married sir james stewart the black knight of lorne and august 3 1439 she was captured by livingstone while her husband in the mysterious words of the chronicler was put in a pitt and bollit  in a month jane beaufort gave livingstone an amnesty he not the stewart family not the queen mother now held james  to all this the new young earl of douglas a boy of eighteen tacitly assented  he was the most powerful and wealthiest subject in scotland in france he was duc de touraine he was descended in lawful wedlock from robert ii he micht hae been the king as the ballad says of the bonny earl of moray  but he held proudly aloof from both livingstone and crichton who were stealing the king alternately they then combined invited douglas to edinburgh castle with his brother david and served up the ominous bulls head at that black dinner recorded in a ballad fragment 61  they decapitated the two douglas boys the earldom fell to their granduncle james the fat and presently on his death 1443 to young william douglas after which bands or illegal covenants between the various leaders of factions led to private wars of shifting fortune  kennedy bishop of st andrews opposed the douglas party now strong both in lands newly acquired till july 3 1449 james married mary of gueldres imprisoned the livingstones and relied on the bishop of st andrews and the clergy  while douglas was visiting rome in 1450 the livingstones had been forfeited and crichton became chancellor    fall of the black douglases   the douglases through a royal marriage of an ancestor to a daughter of the more legitimate marriage of robert ii had a kind of claim to the throne which they never put forward  the country was thus spared dynastic wars like those of the white and red roses in england but none the less the douglases were too rich and powerful for subjects  the earl at the moment held galloway and annandale two of his brothers were earls of moray and ormond in october 1448 ormond had distinguished himself by defeating and taking percy urging a raid into scotland at a bloody battle on the water of sark near gretna  during the earl of douglass absence in rome james had put down some of his unruly retainers and even after his return 1451 had persevered in this course  later in the year douglas resigned and received back his lands a not uncommon formula showing submission on the vassals favour on the lords part as when charles vii at the request of jeanne darc made this resignation to god  douglas however was suspected of intriguing with england and with the lord of the isles while he had a secret covenant or band with the earls of crawford and ross  if all this were true he was planning a most dangerous enterprise  he was invited to stirling to meet the king under a safeconduct and there february 22 1452 was dirked by his king at the sacred table of hospitality  whether this crime was premeditated or merely passionate is unknown as in the case of bruces murder of the red comyn before the high altar parliament absolved james on slender grounds  james the brother of the slain earl publicly defied his king gave his allegiance to henry vi of england withdrew it intrigued and after his brothers had been routed at arkinholm near langholm may 18 1455 fled to england  his house was proclaimed traitorous their wide lands in southern and southwestern scotland were forfeited and redistributed the scotts of buccleuch profiting largely in the longrun  the leader of the royal forces at arkinholm near langholm was another douglas one of the red douglases the earl of angus and till the execution of the earl of morton under james vi the red douglases were as powerful turbulent and treacherous as the black douglases had been in their day  when attacked and defeated these douglases red or black always allied themselves with england and with the lords of the isles the hereditary foes of the royal authority  meanwhile edward iv wrote of the scots as his rebels of scotland and in the alternations of fortune between the houses of york and lancaster james held with henry vi  when henry was defeated and taken at northampton july 10 1460 james besieged roxburgh castle an english hold on the border and august 3 1460 was slain by the explosion of a great bombard  james was but thirty years of age at his death  by the dagger by the law and by the aid of the red douglases he had ruined his most powerful noblesand his own reputation  his early training like that of james vi was received while he was in the hands of the most treacherous bloody and unscrupulous of mankind later he met them with their own weapons  the foundation of the university of glasgow 1451 and the building and endowment of st salvators college in st andrews by bishop kennedy are the most permanent proofs of advancing culture in the reign of james  many laws of excellent tendency including sumptuary laws which suggest the existence of unexpected wealth and luxury were passed but such laws were never firmly and regularly enforced  by one rule which does seem to have been carried out no poisons were to be imported scottish chemical science was incapable of manufacturing them  much later under james vi we find a parcel of arsenic to be used for political purposes successfully stopped at leith     chapter xiii  james iii   james ii left three sons the eldest james iii aged nine was crowned at kelso august 10 1460 his brothers bearing the titles of albany and mar were not to be his supports  his mother mary of gueldres had the charge of the boys and as she was won over by her uncle philip of burgundy to the cause of the house of york while kennedy and the earl of angus stood for the house of lancaster there was strife between them and the queenmother and nobles  kennedy relied on france louis xl and his opponents on england  the battle of towton march 30 1461 drove henry vi and his queen across the border where kennedy entertained the melancholy exile in the castle of st andrews  the grateful henry restored berwick to the scots who could not hold it long  in june 1461 while the scots were failing to take carlisle edward iv was crowned and sent his adherent the exiled earl of douglas to treat for an alliance with the celts under john lord of the isles and that donald balloch who was falsely believed to have long before been slain in ireland  it is curious to think of the lord of the isles dealing as an independent prince through a renegade douglas with the english king  a treaty was made at johns castle of ardtornishnow a shell of crumbling stone on the seashore of the morvern side of the sound of mullwith the english monarch at westminster  the highland chiefs promise allegiance to edward and if successful the celts are to recover the ancient kingdom from caithness to the forth while douglas is to be allpowerful from the forth to the border  but other intrigues prevailed  the queenmother and her son in the most friendly manner met the kingmaker warwick at dumfries and again at carlisle and douglas was disgraced by edward though restored to favour when bishop kennedy declined to treat with edwards commissioners  the treaty of england with douglas and the celts was then ratified but douglas advancing in front of edwards army to the border met old bishop kennedy in helmet and corslet and was defeated  louis xi however now deserted the red for the white rose  kennedy followed his example and peace was made between england and scotland in october 1464 kennedy died in the summer of 1465  there followed the usual struggles between confederations of the nobles and in july 1466 james was seized being then aged fourteen by the party of the boyds flemings and kennedys aided by hepburn of hailes ancestor of the turbulent earl of bothwell and by the head of the border house of cessford andrew ker  it was a repetition of the struggles of livingstone and crichton and now the great border lairds begin to take their place in history  boyd made himself governor to the king his son married the kings eldest sister mary and became earl of arran  but brief was the triumph of the boyds in 1469 james married margaret of norway orkney and shetland were her dower but while arran negotiated the affair abroad at home the fall of his house was arranged  boyd fled the country the kings sister divorced from young arran married the lord hamilton and his family who were lords of cadzow under robert bruce and had been allies of the black douglases till their fall became the nearest heirs of the royal stewarts if that family were extinct  the hamiltons the wealthiest house in scotland never produced a man of great ability but their nearness to the throne and their ambition were stormcentres in the time of mary stuart and james vi and even as late as the union in 1707  the fortunes of a nephew of bishop kennedy patrick graham kennedys successor as bishop of st andrews now perplex the historian  graham dealt for himself with the pope obtained the rank of archbishop for the bishop of st andrews 1472 and thus offended the king and country always jealous of interference from rome  but he was reported on as more or less insane by a papal nuncio and was deposed  had he been defending as used to be said the right of election of bishop for the canons against the greed of the nobles the nuncio might not have taken an unfavourable view of his intellect  in any case whether the clergy backed by rome elected their bishops or whether the king and nobles made their profit out of the church appointments jobbery was the universal rule  ecclesiastical corruption and as a rule ignorance were attaining their lowest level 67  by 1476 the lord of the isles the celtic ally of edward iv was reduced by argyll huntly and crawford and lost the sheriffdom of inverness and the earldom of ross which was attached to the crown 1476  his treaty of ardtornish had come to light  but his bastard angus og filled the north and west with fire and tumult from ross to tobermory 14801490 while jamess devotion to the artsa thing intolerableand to the society of lowborn favourites especially thomas cockburn a stonecutter prepared the sorrows and the end of his reign  the intrigues which follow and the truth about the character of james are exceedingly obscure  we have no scottish chronicle written at the time the later histories by ferrerius an italian and much later by queen marys bishop lesley and by george buchanan are full of rumours and contradictions while the state papers and treaties of england merely prove the extreme treachery of jamess brother albany and no evidence tells us how james contrived to get the better of the traitor  jamess brothers albany and mar were popular were good horsemen men of their hands and cochrane is accused of persuading james to arrest mar on a charge of treason and black magic  many witches are said to have been burned perhaps the only such case before the reformation  however it fell outall is obscuremar died in prison while albany also a prisoner on charges of treasonable intrigues with the inveterate earl of douglas in the english interest escaped to france  douglas 1482 brought him to england where he swore allegiance to edward iv under whom like edward balliol he would hold scotland if crowned  he was advancing on the border with edwards support and with the duke of gloucester richard iii and james had gone to lauder to encounter him when the earl of angus headed a conspiracy of nobles such as huntly lennox and buchan seized cochrane and other favourites of james and hanged them over lauder bridge  the most tangible grievance was the increasing debasement of the coinage  james was immured at edinburgh but by a compromise albany was restored to rank and estates meanwhile gloucester captured berwick never to be recovered by scotland in 1483 albany renewed with many of the nobles his intrigues with edward for the betrayal of scotland  in some unknown way james separated albany from his confederates atholl buchan and angus albany went to england betrayed the castle of dunbar to england and was only checked in his treasons by the death of edward iv april 9 1483 after which a full parliament july 7 1483 condemned him and forfeited him in his absence  on july 22 1484 he invaded scotland with his ally douglas they were routed at lochmaben douglas was taken and by singular clemency was merely placed in seclusion in the monastery of lindores while albany escaping to france perished in a tournament leaving a descendant who later in the minority of james v makes a figure in history  the death of richard iii august 18 1485 and the accession of the prudent henry vii gave james a moment of safety  he turned his attention to the church and determined to prosecute for treason such scottish clerics as purchased benefices through rome  he negotiated for three english marriages including that of his son james duke of rothesay to a daughter of edward iv he also negotiated for the recovery of berwick taken by gloucester during albanys invasion of 1482  after his death and before it james was accused for these reasons of disloyal dealings with england and such nobles as angus up to the neck as they were in treason and rebellion raised a party against him on the score that he was acting as they did  the almost aimless treachery of the douglases red or black endured for centuries from the reign of david ii to that of james vi  many nobles had received no amnesty for the outrage of lauder bridge their hopes turned to the heir of the crown james duke of rothesay  we see them offering peace for an indemnity in a parliament of october 1487 the estates refused all such pardons for a space of seven years the kings party was manifestly the stronger  he was not to be intimidated he offended home and the humes by annexing the priory of coldingham which they regarded as their own to the royal chapel at stirling  the inveterate angus with others induced prince james to join them under arms  james took the chancellorship from argyll and sent envoys to england  the rebels proclaiming the prince as king intrigued with henry vii james was driven across the forth and was supported in the north by his uncle atholl and by huntly crawford and lord lindsay of the byres errol glamis forbes and tullibardine and the chivalry of angus and strathtay  attempts at pacification failed stirling castle was betrayed to the rebels and jamess host swollen by the loyal burgesses of the towns met the border spears of home and hepburn the galloway men and the levies of angus at sauchie burn near bannockburn  in some way not understood james riding without a single knight or squire fell from his horse which had apparently run away with him at beatons mill and was slain in bed it was rumoured by a priest feigned or false who heard his confession  the obscurity of his reign hangs darkest over his death and the virulent buchanan slandered him in his grave  under his reign henryson the greatest of the chaucerian school in scotland produced his admirable poems  many other poets whose works are lost were flourishing and the wallace that elaborate plagiarism from barbours the brus was composed and attributed to blind harry a paid minstrel about the court 71     chapter xiv  james iv   the new king with angus for his governor argyll for his chancellor and with the kers and hepburns in office was crowned at scone about june 25 1488  he was nearly seventeen no child but energetic in business as in pleasure though lifelong remorse for his rebellion gnawed at his heart he promptly put down a rebellion of the late kings friends and of the late kings foe lennox then strong in the possession of dumbarton castle which as it commands the seaentrance by clyde is of great importance in the reign of mary and james vi  james iii must have paid attention to the navy which under sir andrew wood already faced english pirates triumphantly  james iv spent much money on his fleet buying timber from france for he was determined to make scotland a power of weight in europe  but at the pinch his navy vanished like a mist  spanish envoys and envoys from the duchess of burgundy visited james in 14881489 he was in close relations with france and denmark and caused anxieties to the first tudor king henry vii who kept up the douglas alliance with angus and bought over scottish politicians  while james as his accountbooks show was playing cards with angus that traitor was also negotiating the sale of hermitage castle the main hold of the middle border to england  he was detected and the castle was intrusted to a hepburn earl of bothwell it was still held by queen marys bothwell in 1567  the hepburns rose to the earldom of bothwell on the death of ramsay a favourite of james iii who 1491 had arranged to kidnap james iv with his brother and hand them over to henry vii for 277 pounds 13s 4d  nothing came of this and a truce with england was arranged in 1491  through four reigns till james vi came to the english throne the tudor policy was to buy scottish traitors and attempt to secure the person of the scottish monarch  meanwhile the church was rent by jealousies between the holder of the newlycreated archbishop of glasgow 1491 and the archbishop of st andrews and disturbed by the lollards in the region which was later the centre of the fiercest covenanterskyle in ayrshire  but james laughed away the charges against the heretics 1494 whose views were on many points those of john knox  in 14931495 james dealt in the usual way with the highlanders and the wicked blood of the isles some were hanged some imprisoned some became sureties for the peacefulness of their clans  in 1495 by way of titfortat against english schemes james began to back the claims of perkin warbeck pretending to be richard duke of york escaped from the assassins employed by richard iii  perkin whoever he was had probably been intriguing between ireland and burgundy since 1488  he was welcomed by james at stirling in november 1495 and was wedded to the kings cousin catherine gordon daughter of the earl of huntly now supreme in the north  rejecting a daughter of england and spanish efforts at pacification james prepared to invade england in perkins cause the scheme was sold by ramsay the wouldbe kidnapper and came to no more than a useless raid of september 1496 followed by a futile attempt and a retreat in july 1497  the spanish envoy de ayala negotiated a sevenyears truce in september after perkin had failed and been taken at taunton  the celts had again risen while james was busy in the border he put them down and made argyll lieutenant of the isles  between the campbells and the huntly gordons as custodians of the peace the fighting clans were expected to be more orderly  on the other hand a son of angus og himself usually reckoned a bastard of the lord of the isles gave much trouble  angus had married a daughter of the argyll of his day their son donald dubh was kidnapped or rather his mother was kidnapped before his birth for argyll he now escaped and in 1503 found allies among the chiefs did much scathe was taken in 1506 but was as active as ever forty years later  the central source of these endless highland feuds was the family of the macdonalds lords of the isles claiming the earldom of ross resisting the lowland influences and those of the gordons and campbells huntly and argyll and seeking aid from england  with the capture of donald dubh 1506 the highlanders became for the while comparatively quiescent under lennox and argyll they suffered in the defeat of flodden  from 1497 to 1503 henry vii was negotiating for the marriage of james to his daughter margaret tudor the marriage was celebrated on august 8 1503 and a century later the great grandson of margaret james vi came to the english throne  but marriage does not make friendship  there had existed since 1491 a secret alliance by which scotland was bound to defend france if attacked by england  henrys negotiations for the kidnapping of james were of april of the same year  margaret the young queen after her marriage was soon involved in bitter quarrels over her dowry with her own family the slaying of a sir robert ker warden of the marches by a heron in a border fray 1508 left an unhealed sore as england would not give up heron and his accomplice  henry vii had been pacific but his death in 1509 left james to face his hostile brother inlaw the fiery young henry viii  in 1511 the holy league under the pope against france imperilled jamess french ally  he began to build great ships of war his seacaptain barton pirating about was defeated and slain by ships under two of the howards sons of the earl of surrey august 1511  james remonstrated henry was firm and the border feud of ker and heron was festering moreover henry was a party to the league against france and france was urging james to attack england  he saw and wrote to the king of denmark that if france were down the turn of scotland to fall would follow  in march 1513 an english diplomatist west found james in a wild mood distraught like a fey man  chivalry and even national safety called him to war while his old remorse drove him into a religious retreat and he was on hostile terms with the pope  on may 24th in a letter to henry he made a last attempt to obtain a truce but on june 30th henry invaded france  the french queen despatched to james as to her true knight a letter and a ring  he sent his fleet to sea it vanished like a dream  he challenged henry through a herald on july 26th and in face of strange and evil omens summoned the whole force of his kingdom crossed the border on august 22nd took norham castle on tweed with the holds of eital chillingham and ford which he made his headquarters and awaited the approach of surrey and the levies of the stanleys  on september 5th he demolished ford castle and took position on the crest of flodden edge with the deep and sluggish water of till at its feet  surrey commanding an army all but destitute of supplies outmanoeuvred james led his men unseen behind a range of hills to a position where if he could maintain himself he was upon jamess line of communications and thence marched against him to branxton ridge under flodden edge  james was ignorant of surreys movement till he saw the approach of his standards  in place of retaining his position he hurled his force down to branxton his gunners could not manage their new french ordnance and though home with the border spears and huntly had a success on the right the borderers made no more efforts and on the left the celts fled swiftly after the fall of lennox and argyll  in the centre crawford and rothes were slain and james with the steady spearmen of his command drove straight at surrey  james as the spaniard ayala said was no general he was a fighting man  he was outflanked by the admiral howard and dacre his force was surrounded by charging horse and foot and rained on by arrows  but     the stubborn spearmen still made good    their dark impenetrable wood  when james rushed from the ranks hewed his way to within a lances length of surrey so surrey writes and died riddled with arrows his neck gashed by a billstroke his left hand almost sundered from his body  night fell on the unbroken scottish phalanx but when dawn arrived only a force of border prickers was hovering on the fringes of the field thirteen dead earls lay in a ring about their master there too lay his natural son the young archbishop of st andrews and the bishops of caithness and the isles  scarce a noble or gentle house of the lowlands but reckons an ancestor slain at flodden  surrey did not pursue his victory which was won despite sore lack of supplies by his clever tactics by the superior discipline of his men by their marching powers and by the glorious rashness of the scottish king  it is easy and it is customary to blame jamess adherence to the french alliance as if it were born of a foolish chivalry  but he had passed through long stress of mind concerning this matter  if he rejected the allurements of france if france were overwhelmed he knew well that the turn of scotland would come soon  the ambitions and the claims of henry viii were those of the first edwards  england was bent on the conquest of scotland at the earliest opportunity and through the entire tudor period england was the home and her monarch the ally of every domestic foe and traitor to the scottish crown  scotland under james had much prospered in wealth and even in comfort ayala might flatter in some degree but he attests the great increase in comfort and in wealth  in 1495 bishop elphinstone founded the university of aberdeen while 1496 parliament decreed a course of school and college for the sons of barons and freeholders of competent estate  prior hepburn founded the college of st leonards in the university of st andrews and in 1507 chepman received a royal patent as a printer  meanwhile dunbar reckoned by some the chief poet of scotland before burns was already denouncing the luxury and vice of the clergy though his own life set them a bad example  but with dunbar henryson and others scotland had a school of poets much superior to any that england had reared since the death of chaucer  scotland now enjoyed her brief glimpse of the revival of learning and james like charles ii fostered the early movements of chemistry and physical science  but flodden ruined all and the country under the long minority of james v was robbed and distracted by english intrigues by the follies and loves of margaret tudor by actual warfare between rival candidates for ecclesiastical place by the ambitions and treasons of the douglases and other nobles and by the arrival from france of the son of albany that rebel brother of james iii  the truth of the saying woe to the kingdom whose king is a child was never more bitterly proved than in scotland between the day of flodden and the day of the return of mary stuart from france 15131561  james v was not only a child and fatherless he had a mother whose passions and passionate changes in love resembled those of her brother henry viii consequently when the inevitable problem arose was scotland during the minority to side with england or with france the queenmother wavered ceaselessly between the party of her brother the english king and the party of france while henry viii could not be trusted and the policy of france in regard to england did not permit her to offer any stable support to the cause of scottish independence  the great nobles changed sides constantly each fighting for his own hand and for the spoils of a church in which benefices were struggled for and sold like stocks in the exchange  the question was scotland to ally herself with england or with france later came to mean was scotland to break with rome or to cling to rome owing mainly to the selfish and unscrupulous perfidy of henry viii james v was condemned as the least of two evils to adopt the catholic side in the great religious revolution while the statesmanship of the beatons archbishops of st andrews preserved scotland from english domination thereby preventing the country from adopting henrys church the anglican and giving calvinism and presbyterianism the opportunity which was resolutely taken and held  the real issue of the complex faction fight during jamess minority was thus of the most essential importance but the constant shiftings of parties and persons cannot be dealt with fully in our space  jamess mother had a natural claim to the guardianship of her son and was left regent by the will of james iv but she was the sister of scotlands enemy henry viii  beaton archbishop of glasgow later of st andrews with the earl of arran now the title of the hamiltons huntly and angus were to advise the queen till the arrival of albany son of the brother of james iii who was summoned from france  albany of course stood for the french alliance but when the queenmother august 6 1514 married the new young earl of angus the grandson and successor of the aged traitor bell the cat the earl began to carry on the usual unpatriotic policy of his house  the appointment to the see of st andrews was competed for by the poet gawain douglas uncle of the new earl of angus and himself of the english party by hepburn prior of st andrews who fortified the abbey and by forman bishop of moray a partisan of france and a man accused of having induced james iv to declare war against england  after long and scandalous intrigues forman obtained the see  albany was regent for a while and at intervals he repaired to france he was in the favour of the queenmother when later she quarrelled with her husband angus  at one moment margaret and angus fled to england where was born her daughter margaret later lady lennox and mother of henry darnley  angus with home now recrossed the border 1516 and was reconciled to albany against all unity in scotland henry intrigued bribing with a free hand his main object being to get albany sent out of the country in early autumn 1516 home the leader of the borderers at flodden and his brother were executed for treason in june 1517 albany went to seek aid and counsel in france when the queenmother returned from england to scotland where if she retained any influence she might be useful to her brothers schemes  but contrary to henrys interests in this year albany renewed the old alliance with france while in 1518 the queen mother desired to divorce angus  but angus was a serviceable tool of henry who prevented his sister from having her way and now the heads of the parties in the distracted country were arran chief of the hamiltons and beaton archbishop of glasgow standing for france and angus representing the english party  their forces met at edinburgh in the street battle of cleanse the causeway wherein the archbishop of glasgow wore armour and the douglases beat the hamiltons out of the town april 30 1520  albany returned 1521 but the nobles would not join with him in an english war 1522  again he went to france while surrey devastated the scottish border 1523  albany returned while surrey was burning jedburgh was once more deserted by the scottish forces on the tweed and left the country for ever in 1524  angus now returned from england but the queen mother cast her affections on young henry stewart lord methven while angus got possession of the boy king june 1526 and held him a reluctant ward in the english interest  lennox was now the chief foe of arran and angus with whom arran had coalesced and lennox desired to deliver james out of anguss hands  on july 26 1526 not far from melrose walter scott of buccleuch attacked the forces guarding the prince among them was ker of cessford who was slain by an elliot when buccleuchs men rallied at the rock called turn again  hence sprang a longenduring bloodfeud of scotts and kers but angus retained the prince and in a later fight in the cause of jamess delivery lennox was slain by the hamiltons near linlithgow  the spring of 1528 was marked by the burning of a hamilton patrick abbot of ferne at st andrews for his lutheran opinions  angus had been making futile attacks on the border thieves mainly the armstrongs who now became very prominent and picturesque robbers  he meant to carry james with him on one of these expeditions but in june 1528 the young king escaped from edinburgh castle and rode to stirling where he was welcomed by his mother and her partisans  among them were arran argyll moray bothwell and other nobles with maxwell and the laird of buccleuch sir walter scott  angus and his kin were forfeited he was driven across the border in november to work what mischief he might against his country he did not return till the death of james v  meanwhile james was at peace with his uncle henry viii  he 15291530 attempted to bring the border into his peace and hanged johnnie armstrong of gilnockie with circumstances of treachery says the balladas a balladmaker was certain to say  campbells macleans and macdonalds had all this while been burning each others lands and cutting each others throats  james visited them and partly quieted them incarcerating the earl of argyll  bothwell and angus now conspired together to crown henry viii in edinburgh but in may 1534 a treaty of peace was made to last till the death of either monarch and a year longer     chapter xv  james v and the reformation   the new times were at the door  in 1425 the scottish parliament had forbidden lutheran books to be imported  but they were of course smuggled in and the seed of religious revolution fell on minds disgusted by the greed and anarchy of the clerical fighters and jobbers of benefices  james v after he had shaken off the douglases and become a free king had to deal with a political and religious situation out of which we may say in the scots phrase there was no outgait  his was the dilemma of his father before flodden  how against the perfidious ambition the force in war and the purchasing powers of henry viii was james to preserve the national independence of scotland  his problem was even harder than that of his father because when henry broke with rome and robbed the religious houses a large minority at least of the scottish nobles gentry and middle classes were so far heartily on the anti roman side  they were tired of rome tired of the profligacy ignorance and insatiable greed of the ecclesiastical dignitaries who too often were reckless cadets of the noble families  many scots had read the lutheran books and disbelieved in transubstantiation thought that money paid for prayers to the dead was money wasted preferred a married and preaching to a celibate and licentious clergy who celebrated mass were convinced that saintly images were idols that saintly miracles were impostures  above all the nobles coveted the lands of the church the spoils of the religious houses  in scotland as elsewhere the causes of the religious revolution were many  the wealth and luxury of the higher clergy and of the dwellers in the abbeys had long been the butt of satire and of the fiercer indignation of the people  benefices great and small were jobbed on every side between the popes the kings and the great nobles  ignorant and profligate cadets of the great houses were appointed to high ecclesiastical offices while the minor clergy were inconceivably ignorant just at the moment when the new critical learning with knowledge of hebrew and greek was revolutionising the study of the sacred books  the celibacy of the clergy had become a mere farce and they got dispensations enabling them to obtain ecclesiastical livings for their bastards  the kings set the worst example both james iv and james v secured the richest abbeys and in the case of james iv the primacy for their bastard sons  all these abuses were of old standing early in the thirteenth century certain of the abbots of jedburgh supported by their chapters had granted certain of their appropriate churches to priests with a right of succession to their sons see the mediaeval church in scotland by the late bishop dowden chap xix  mac lehose 1910  oppressive customs by which the upmost claith or a pecuniary equivalent was extorted as a kind of deathduty by the clergy were sanctioned by excommunication no grievance was more bitterly felt by the poor  the oncedreaded curses on evildoers became a popular jest purgatory was a mere excuse for getting money for masses  in short the whole mediaeval system was morally rotten the statements drawn up by councils which made vain attempts to check the stereotyped abuses are as candid and copious concerning all these things as the satires of sir david lyndsay  then came disbelief in mediaeval dogmas the lutheran and other heretical books were secretly purchased and their contents assimilated intercession of saints images pilgrimages the doctrine of the eucharist all fell into contempt  as early as february 1428 as we have seen the first scottish martyr for evangelical religion patrick hamilton was burned at st andrews  this sufferer was the son of a bastard of that lord hamilton who married the sister of james iii  as was usual he obtained when a little boy an abbey that of ferne in rossshire  he drew the revenues but did not wear the costume of his place in fact he was an example of the ordinary abuses  educated at paris and louvain he came in contact with the criticism of erasmus and the lutheran controversy  he next read at st andrews and he married  suspected of heresy in 1427 he retired to germany he wrote theses called patricks places which were reckoned heretical he was arrested was offered by archbishop beaton a chance to escape disdained it and was burned with unusual crueltyas a rule heretics in scotland were strangled before burning  there were other similar cases nor could james interferehe was bound by his coronation oath again he found in the bishops his best diplomatists and they of course were all for the french alliance in the cause of the independence of their country and church as against henry viii  thus james in justifiable dread of the unscrupulous ambition of henry viii could not run the english course could not accept the varying creeds which henry who was his own pope put forward as his spirit moved him  james was thus inevitably committed to the losing causethe cause of catholicism and of francewhile the intelligence no less than the avarice of his nobles and gentry ran the english course  james had practically no choice  in 1536 henry proposed a meeting with james as far within england as possible  knowing as we do that henry was making repeated attempts to have james kidnapped and archbishop beaton also we are surprised that james was apparently delighted at the hope of an interview with his unclein england  henry declined to explain why he desired a meeting when james put the question to his envoy  james said in effect that he must act by advice of his council which so far as it was clerical opposed the scheme  henry justified the views of the council later when james returning from a visit to france asked permission to pass through england  it is the kings honour not to receive the king of scots in his realm except as a vassal for there never came king of scots into england in peaceful manner otherwise  certain it is that however james might enter england he would leave it only as a vassal  nevertheless his council especially his clergy are blamed for embroiling james with henry by dissuading him from meeting his uncle in england  manifestly they had no choice  henry had shown his hand too often  at this time james by margaret erskine became the father of james later the regent moray  strange tragedies would never have occurred had the king first married margaret erskine who by 1536 was the wife of douglas of loch leven  he is said to have wished for her a divorce that he might marry her this could not be he visited france and on new years day 1537 wedded madeline daughter of francis i  six months later she died in scotland  marriage for the king was necessary and david beaton later cardinal beaton and archbishop of st andrews obtained for his lord a lady coveted by henry viii mary of the great catholic house of lorraine widow of the duc de longueville and sister of the popular and ambitious guises the pair were wedded on june 10 1538 there was fresh offence to henry and a closer tie to the catholic cause  the appointment of cardinal beaton 1539 to the see of st andrews in succession to his uncle gave james a servant of high ecclesiastical rank great subtlety and indomitable resolution but remote from chastity of life and from clemency to heretics  martyrdoms became more frequent and george buchanan who had been tutor of jamess son by margaret erskine thought well to open a window in a house where he was confined walk out and depart to the continent  meanwhile henry no less than beaton was busily burning his own martyrs  in 1539 henry renewed his intercourse with james attempting to shake his faith in david beaton and to make him rob his church  james replied that he preferred to try to reform it and he enjoyed in 1540 sir david lyndsays satirical play on the vices of the clergy and indeed of all orders of men  in 1540 james ratified the college of justice the fifteen lords of session sitting as judges in edinburgh  in 1541 the idea of a meeting between james and henry was again mooted and henry actually went to york where james did not appear  henry who had expected him was furious  in august 1542 on a futile pretext he sent norfolk with a great force to harry the border  the english had the worse at the battle of hadden rig negotiations followed henry proclaimed that scottish kings had always been vassals of england and horrified his council by openly proposing to kidnap james  henrys forces were now wrecking an abbey and killing women on the border  james tried to retaliate but his levies october 31 at fala moor declined to follow him across the border they remembered flodden moreover they could not risk the person of a childless king  james prepared however for a raid on a great scale on the western border but the fact had been divulged by sir george douglas anguss brother and had also been sold to dacre cheap by another scot  the english despatches prove that wharton had full time for preparation and led a competent force of horse which near arthuret charged on the right flank of the scots who slowly retreated till they were entangled between the esk and a morass and lost their formation and their artillery with 1200 men a few were slain most were drowned or were taken prisoners  the raid was no secret of the king and the priests as knox absurdly states nobles of the reforming no less than of the catholic party were engaged the english had full warning and a force of 3000 men not of 400 farmers the scots were beaten through their own ignorance of the ground in which they had been burning and plundering  as to confusion caused by the claim of oliver sinclair to be commander it is not corroborated by contemporary despatches though sir george douglas reports jamess lament for the conduct of his favourite fled oliver fled oliver  the misfortune broke the heart of james  he went to edinburgh did some business retired for a week to linlithgow 89 where his queen was awaiting her delivery and thence went to falkland and died of nothing more specific than shame grief and despair  he lived to hear of the birth of his daughter mary december 8 1542  it came with a lass and it will go with a lass he is said to have muttered  on december 14th james passed away broken by his impossible task lost in the bewildering paths from which there was no outgait  james was personally popular for his gaiety and his adventures while he wandered in disguise  humorous poems are attributed to him  a man of greater genius than his might have failed when confronted by a tyrant so wealthy ambitious cruel and destitute of honour as henry viii constantly engaged with jamess traitors in efforts to seize or slay him and his advisers  it is an easy thing to attack james because he would not trust henry a man who ruined all that did trust to his seeming favour     chapter xvi  the minority of mary stuart   when james died henry viii seemed to hold in his hand all the winning cards in the game of which scotland was the stake  he held angus and his brother george douglas when he slipped them they would again wield the whole force of their house in the interests of england and of henrys religion  moreover he held many noble prisoners taken at solwayglencairn maxwell cassilis fleming grey and othersand all of these save sir george douglas have not sticked says henry himself to take upon them to set the crown of scotland on our head henrys object was to get the child the person of the cardinal and of such as be chief hindrances to our purpose and also the chief holds and fortresses into our hands  by sheer brigandage the reformer king hoped to succeed where the edwards had failed  he took the oaths of his prisoners making them swear to secure for him the child beaton and the castles and later released them to do his bidding  henrys failure was due to the genius and resolution of cardinal beaton heading the catholic party  what occurred in scotland on jamess death is obscure  later beaton was said to have made the dying kings hand subscribe a blank paper filled up by appointment of beaton himself as one of a regency council of four or five  there is no evidence for the tale  what actually occurred was the proclamation of the earls of arran argyll huntly moray and of beaton as regents december 19 1542  arran the chief of the hamiltons was we know unless ousted by henry viii the next heir to the throne after the newborn mary  he was a goodhearted man but the weakest of mortals and his constant veerings from the catholic and national to the english and reforming side were probably caused by his knowledge of his very doubtful legitimacy  either party could bring up the doubt beaton having the ear of the pope could be specially dangerous but so could the opposite party if once firmly seated in office  arran in any case presently ousted the archbishop of glasgow from the chancellorship and gave the seals to beatonthe man whom he presently accused of a shameless forgery of jamess will 91  the regency soon came into arrans own hands the solway moss prisoners learning this as they journeyed north began to repent of their oaths of treachery especially as their oaths were known or suspected in scotland george douglas prevailed on arran to seize and imprison beaton till he answered certain charges but no charges were ever made public none were produced  the clergy refused to christen or bury during his captivity parliament met march 12 1543 and still there was silence as to the nature of the accusations against beaton and by march 22 george douglas himself released the cardinal of course for a consideration and carried him to his own strong castle of st andrews  parliament permitted the reading but forbade the discussion of the bible in english  arran was posing as a kind of protestant  ambassadors were sent to henry to negotiate a marriage between his son edward and the baby queen but scotland would not give up a fortress would never resign her independence would not place mary in henrys hands would never submit to any but a native ruler  the airy castle of henrys hopes fell into dust built as it was on the oaths of traitors  love of such a religion as henry professed retaining the mass and making free use of the stake and the gibbet was not even to protestants so attractive as to make them run the english course and submit to the english lord paramount  some time was needed to make scots whatever their religious opinions lick the english rod  but the scale was soon to turn for every reforming sermon was apt to produce the harrying of religious houses and every punishment of the robbers was persecution intolerable against which men sought english protection  henry viii now turned to arran for support  to arran he offered the hand of his daughter the princess elizabeth who should later marry the heir of the hamiltons  but by midapril arran was under the influence of his bastard brother the abbot of paisley later archbishop hamilton the earl of lennox a stuart and keeper of dumbarton castle arrived from france  he was hostile to arran for if arran were illegitimate lennox was next heir to the crown after mary he was thus for the moment the ally of beaton against arran  george douglas visited henry and returned with his termsmary to be handed over to england at the age of ten and to marry prince edward at twelve arran by a prior arrangement was to receive scotland north of forth an auxiliary english army and the hand of elizabeth for his son  to the english contingent arran preferred 5000 pounds in ready moneythat was his price  sadleyr henrys envoy saw mary of guise and saw her little daughter unclothed he admired the child but could not disentangle the crosswebs of intrigue  the national partythe catholic partywas strongest because least disunited  when the scottish ambassadors who went to henry in spring returned july 21 the national party seized mary and carried her to stirling where they offered arran a meeting and he said the child queens hand for his son  but arrans own partisans glencairn and cassilis told sadleyr that he fabled freely  representatives of both parties accepted henrys terms but delayed the ratification  henry insisted that it should be ratified by august 24 but on august 16 he seized six scottish merchant ships  though the treaty was ratified on august 25 arran was compelled to insist on compensation for the ships but on august 28 he proclaimed beaton a traitor  in the beginning of september arran favoured the wrecking of the franciscan monastery in edinburgh and at dundee the mob moved by sermons from the celebrated martyr george wishart did sack the houses of the franciscans and the dominicans beatons abbey of arbroath and the abbey of lindores were also plundered  clearly it was believed that beaton was down and that churchpillage was authorised by arran  yet on september 3 arran joined hands with beaton  the cardinal by threatening to disprove arrans legitimacy and ruin his hopes of the crown or in some other way had dominated the waverer while henry august 29 was mobilising an army of 20000 men for the invasion of scotland  on september 9 mary was crowned at stirling  but beaton could not hold both arran and his rival lennox who committed an act of disgraceful treachery  with glencairn he seized large supplies of money and stores sent by france to dumbarton castle  in 1544 he fled to england and to the protection of henry and married margaret daughter of angus and margaret tudor widow of james iv  he became the father of darnley marys husband in later years and the fortunes of scotland were fatally involved in the feud between the lennox stewarts and the house of hamilton  meanwhile november 1543 arran and beaton together broke and persecuted the abbey robbers of perthshire and angus making martyrs and incurring on beatons part fatal feuds with leslies greys learmonths and kirkcaldys  parliament december 11 declared the treaty with england void the party of the douglases equally suspected by henry and by beaton was crushed and george douglas was held a hostage still betraying his country in letters to england  martyrs were burned in perth and dundee which merely infuriated the populace  in april 1544 while henry was giving the most cruel orders to his army of invasion one wishart visited him with offers which were accepted for the murder of the cardinal 94  early in may the english army under hertford took leith raised a jolly fire says hertford in edinburgh he burned the towns on his line of march and retired  on may 17 lennox and glencairn sold themselves to henry for ample rewards they were to secure the teaching of gods word as the mere and only foundation whence proceeds all truth and honour  arran defeated glencairn when he attempted his godly task and lennox was driven back into england  in june mary of guise fell into the hands of nobles led by angus while the fife perthshire and angus lairds lately beatons deadly foes came into the cardinals party  with him and arran in november were banded the protestants who were to be his murderers while the douglases in december were cleared by parliament of all their offences and henry offered 3000 crowns for their trapping  angus in february 1545 protested that he loved henry best of all men and would make lennox governor of scotland while wharton for henry was trying to kidnap angus  enraged by the english desecration of his ancestors graves at melrose abbey angus united with arran norman leslie and buccleuch to annihilate an english force at ancrum moor where henrys men lost 800 slain and 2000 prisoners  the loyalty of angus to his country was now by innocents like arran thought assured  the plot for beatons murder was in 1545 negotiated between henry and cassilis backed by george douglas and crichton of brunston as before was engaged a godly laird in lothian  in august the douglases boast that as henrys friends they have frustrated an invasion of england with a large french contingent which they pretended to lead while they secured its failure  meanwhile after forty years donald dubh and all the great western chiefs none of whom could write renewed the alliance of 1463 with england calling themselves auld enemies of scotland  their religious predilections however were not protestant  they promised to destroy or reduce half of scotland and hailed lennox as governor as in anguss offer to henry in spring 1545  lennox did make an attempt against dumbarton in november with donald dubh  they failed and donald died without legitimate issue at drogheda  the macleans macleods and macneils then came into the national party  in september 1545 hertford with an english force destroyed the religious houses at melrose kelso dryburgh and jedburgh 96 meanwhile the two douglases skulked with the murderous traitor cassilis in ayrshire and henry tried to induce french deserters from the scottish flag to murder beaton and arran  beaton could scarcely escape for ever from so many plots  his capture in january 1546 of george wishart an eminently learned and virtuous protestant preacher and an intimate associate of the murderous double dyed traitor brunston and of other lothian pietists of the english party and his burning of wishart at st andrews on march 1 1546 sealed the cardinals doom  on may 29th he was surprised in his castle of st andrews and slain by his former ally norman leslie master of rothes with kirkcaldy of grange and james melville who seems to have dealt the final stab after preaching at his powerless victim  they insulted the corpse and held st andrews castle against all comers  how gallant a fight beaton had waged against adversaries how many and multifarious how murderous selfseeking treacherous and hypocritical we have seen  he maintained the independence of scotland against the most recklessly unscrupulous of assailants though probably he was rather bent on defending the lost cause of a church entirely and intolerably corrupt  the two causes were at the moment inseparable and whatever we may think of the church of rome it was not more bloodily inclined than the church of which henry was pope while it was less illogical not being the creature of a secular tyrant  if henry and his party had won their game the church of scotland would have been henrys churchwould have been anglican  thus it was beaton who by defeating henry made presbyterian calvinism possible in scotland     chapter xvii  regency of arran   the death of cardinal beaton left scotland and the church without a skilled and resolute defender  his successor in the see archbishop hamilton a halfbrother of the regent was more licentious than the cardinal who seems to have been constant to mariotte ogilvy and had little of his political genius  the murderers with others of their party held st andrews castle strong in its new fortifications which the queenmother and arran the regent were unable to reduce  receiving supplies from england by sea and abetted by henry viii the murderers were in treaty with him to work all his will while some nobles like argyll and huntly wavered though the douglases now renounced their compact with england and their promise to give the child queen in marriage to henrys son  at the end of november despairing of success in the siege arran asked france to send men and ships to take st andrews castle from the assassins who in december obtained an armistice  they would surrender they said when they got a pardon for their guilt from the pope but they begged henry viii to move the emperor to move the pope to give no pardon  the remission none the less arrived early in april 1547 but was mocked at by the garrison of the castle 99  the garrison and inmates of the castle presently welcomed the arrival of john knox and some of his pupils  knox born in haddington 15131515 a priest and notary had borne a twohanded sword and been of the body guard of wishart  he was now invited by john rough the chaplain to take on him the office of preacher which he did weeping so strong was his sense of the solemnity of his duties  he also preached and disputed with feeble clerical opponents in the town  the congregation in the castle though devout were ruffianly in their lives nor did he spare rebukes to his flock  before knox arrived henry viii and francis ii had died the successor of francis henri ii sent to scotland monsieur doysel who became the righthand man of mary of guise in the government  meanwhile the advance of an english force against the border where they occupied langholm caused arran to lead thither the national levies  but this gave no great relief to the besieged in the castle of st andrews  in midjuly a well equipped french fleet swept up the east coast men were landed with guns french artillery was planted on the cathedral roof and the steeple of st salvators college and poured a plunging fire into the castle  in a day or two on the last of july the garrison surrendered  knox with many of his associates was placed in the galleys and carried captive to france  on one occasion the galleys were within sight of st andrews and the reformer predicted so he says that he would again preach thereas he did to some purpose  but the castle had not fallen before the english party among the nobles had arranged to betray scottish fortresses to england and to lead 2000 scottish favourers of the word of god to fight under the flag of st george against their country  an english host of 15000 was assembled and marched north accompanied by a fleet  on the 9th of september 1547 the leader somerset found the scottish army occupying a wellchosen position near musselburgh on their left lay the firth on their front a marsh and the river esk  but next day the scots as when cromwell defeated them at dunbar left an impregnable position in their eagerness to cut somerset off from his ships and were routed with great slaughter in the battle of pinkie  somerset made no great use of his victory he took and held broughty castle on tay fortified inchcolme in the firth of forth and devastated holyrood  mischief he did to little purpose  the child queen was conveyed to an isle in the loch of menteith where she was safe and her marriage with the dauphin was negotiated  in june 1548 a large french force under the sieur desse arrived and later captured haddington held by the english while despite some francoscottish successes in the field mary was sent with her four maries to france where she landed in august the only passenger who had not been seasick  by april 1550 the english made peace abandoning all their holds in scotland  the great essential prize the child queen had escaped them  the clergy burned a martyr in 1550 in 1549 they had passed measures for their own reformation too late and futile was the scheme  early in 1549 knox returned from france to england where he was minister at berwick and at newcastle a chaplain of the child edward vi and a successful opponent of cranmer as regards kneeling at the celebration of the holy communion  he refused a bishopric foreseeing trouble under mary tudor from whom he fled to the continent  in 155051 mary of guise visiting france procured for arran the duchy of chatelherault and for his eldest son the command of the scottish archer guard and by way of exchange in 1554 took from him the regency surrounding herself with french advisers notably de roubay and doysel     chapter xviii  regency of mary of guise   in england on the death of edward vi catholicism rejoiced in the accession of mary tudor which by driving scottish protestant refugees back into their own country strengthened there the party of revolt against the church while the queenmothers preference of french over scottish advisers and her small force of trained french soldiers in garrisons caused even the scottish catholics to hold france in fear and suspicion  the french counsellors 1556 urged increased taxation for purposes of national defence against england but the nobles would rather be invaded every year than tolerate a standing army in place of their old irregular feudal levies  their own independence of the crown was dearer to the nobles and gentry than safety from their old enemy  they might have reflected that a standing army of scots officered by themselves would be a check on the french soldiers in garrison  perplexed and opposed by the great clan of hamilton whose chief arran was nearest heir to the crown mary of guise was now anxious to conciliate the protestants and there was a blink as the covenanters later saida lull in persecution  after knoxs release from the french galleys in 1549 he had played as we saw a considerable part in the affairs of the english church and in the making of the second prayerbook of edward vi but had fled abroad on the accession of mary tudor  from dieppe he had sent a tract to england praying god to stir up some phineas or jehu to shed the blood of abominable idolatersobviously of mary of england and philip of spain  on earlier occasions he had followed calvin in deprecating such sanguinary measures  the scot after a stormy period of quarrels with anglican refugees in frankfort moved to geneva where the city was under a despotism of preachers and of calvin  here knox found the model of church government which in a form if possible more extreme he later planted in scotland  there in 154952 the church under archbishop hamilton beatons successor had been confessing her iniquities in provincial councils and attempting to purify herself on the lines of the tolerant and charitable catechism issued by the archbishop in 1552  apparently a modus vivendi was being sought and protestants were inclined to think that they might be occasional conformists and attend mass without being false to their convictions  but in this brief lull knox came over to scotland at the end of harvest in 1555  on this point of occasional conformity he was fixed  the mass was idolatry and idolatry by the law of god was a capital offence  idolaters must be converted or exterminated they were no better than amalekites  this was the central rock of knoxs position tolerance was impossible he remained in scotland preaching and administering the sacrament in the genevan way till june 1556  he associated with the future leaders of the religious revolution erskine of dun lord lorne in 1558 fifth earl of argyll james stewart bastard of james v and lay prior of st andrews and of macon in france and the earl of glencairn  william maitland of lethington the flower of the wits of scotland was to knox a less congenial acquaintance  not till may 1556 was knox summoned to trial in edinburgh but he had a strong backing of the laity as was the custom in scotland where justice was overawed by armed gatherings and no trial was held  by july 1556 he was in france on his way to geneva  the fruits of knoxs labours followed him in march 1557 in the shape of a letter signed by glencairn lorne lord erskine and james stewart marys bastard brother  they prayed knox to return  they were ready to jeopardy lives and goods in the forward setting of the glory of god this has all the air of risking civil war  knox was not eager  it was october before he reached dieppe on his homeward way  meanwhile there had been hostilities between england and scotland as ally of france then at odds with philip of spain consort king of england and there were protestant tumults in edinburgh  knox had scruples as to raising civil war by preaching at home  the scottish nobles had no zeal for the english war but knox who received at dieppe discouraging letters from unknown correspondents did not cross the sea  he remained at dieppe preaching till the spring of 1558  in knoxs absence even james stewart and erskine of dun agreed to hurry on the marriage between mary queen of scots and francis dauphin of france a feeble boy younger than herself  their faces are pitiably young as represented in their coronation medal  while negotiations for the marriage were begun in october on december 3 1557 a godly band or covenant for mutual aid was signed by argyll then near his death in 1558 his son lorne the earl of morton son of the traitor sir george douglas glencairn and erskine of dun one of the commissioners who were to visit france for the royal marriage they vow to risk their lives against the congregation of satan the church and in defence of faithful protestant preachers  they will establish the blessed word of god and his congregation and henceforth the protestant party was commonly styled the congregation  parliament november 29 1557 had accepted the french marriage all the ancient liberties of scotland being secured and the right to the throne if mary died without issue being confirmed to the house of hamilton not to the dauphin  the marriagecontract april 19 1558 did ratify these just demands but on april 4 mary had been induced to sign them all away to france leaving scotland and her own claims to the english crown to the french king  the marriage was celebrated on april 24 1558  in that week the last protestant martyr walter milne an aged priest and a married man was burned for heresy at st andrews  this only increased the zeal of the congregation  among the protestant preachers then in scotland of whom willock an englishman seems to have been the most reasonable a certain paul methuen a baker was prominent  he had been summoned july 28 to stand his trial for heresy but his backing of friends was considerable and they came before mary of guise in armour and with a bullying demeanour she tried to temporise and on september 3 a great riot broke out in edinburgh the image of st giles was broken and the mob violently assaulted a procession of priests  the country was seething with discontent and the death of mary tudor november 17 1558 with the accession of the protestant elizabeth encouraged the congregation  mary of guise made large concessions only she desired that there should be no public meetings in the capital  on january 1 1559 church doors were placarded with the beggars warning  the beggars really the brethren in their name claimed the wealth of the religious orders  threats were pronounced revolution was menaced at a given date whitsunday and the threats were fulfilled  all this was the result of a plan not of accident  mary of guise was intending to visit france not longing to burn heretics  but she fell into the worst of health and her recovery was doubted in april 1559 willock and methuen had been summoned to trial february 2 1559 for their preachings were always apt to lead to violence on the part of their hearers  the summons was again postponed in deference to renewed menaces a convention had met at edinburgh to seek for some remedy and the last provincial council of the scottish church march 1559 had considered vainly some proposals by moderate catholics for internal reform 106  again the preachers were summoned to stirling for may 10 but just a week earlier knox arrived in scotland  the leader of the french protestant preachers morel expressed to calvin his fear that knox may fill scotland with his madness  now was his opportunity the regent was weak and ill the congregation was in great force england was at least not unfavourable to its cause  from dundee knox marched with many gentlemenunarmed he saysaccompanying the preachers to perth erskine of dun went as an envoy to the regent at stirling she is accused by knox of treacherous dealing other contemporary protestant evidence says nothing of treachery at all events on may 10 the preachers were outlawed for nonappearance to stand their trial  the brethren the whole multitude with their preachers says knox who were in perth were infuriated and after a sermon from the reformer wrecked the church sacked the monasteries and says knox denounced death against any priest who celebrated mass a circumstance usually ignored by our historians at the same time protesting we require nothing but liberty of conscience  on may 31 a composition was made between the regent and the insurgents whom argyll and james stewart promised to join if the regent broke the conditions  henceforth the pretext that she had broken faith was made whenever it seemed convenient while the congregation permitted itself a godly liberty in construing the terms of treaties  a band was signed for the destruction of idolatry by argyll james stewart glencairn and others and the brethren scattered from perth breaking down altars and idols on their way home  mary of guise had promised not to leave a french garrison in perth  she did leave some scots in french pay and on this slim pretext of her treachery argyll and james stewart proclaimed the regent perfidious deserted her cause and joined the crusade against idolatry    note   it is far from my purpose to represent mary of guise as a kind of stainless una with a milkwhite lamb  i am apt to believe that she caused to be forged a letter which she attributed to arran  see my john knox and the reformation pp 280 281 where the evidence is discussed  but the critical student of knoxs chapters on these events generally accepted as historical evidence cannot but perceive his personal hatred of mary of guise whether shown in thinly veiled hints that cardinal beaton was her paramour or in charges of treacherous breach of promise which rest primarily on his word  again that the brethren wrecked the religious houses of perth is what he reports to a lady mrs locke that the rascal multitude was guilty is the tale he tells to all europe in his history  i have done my best to compare knoxs stories with contemporary documents including his own letters these documents throw a lurid light on his versions of events as given in this part of his history which is merely a partisan pamphlet of autumn 1559  the evidence is criticised in my john knox and the reformation pp 107157 1905  unhappily the letter of mary of guise to henri ii after the outbreak at perth is missing from the archives of france     chapter xix  the great pillage   the revolution was now under weigh and as it had begun so it continued there was practically no resistance by the catholic nobility and gentry in the lowlands apparently almost all were of the new persuasion  the duc de chatelherault might hesitate while his son the protestant earl of arran who had been in france as captain of the scots guard was escaping into switzerland and thence to england but on arrans arrival there the hamiltons saw their chance of succeeding to the crown in place of the catholic mary  the regent had but a small body of professional french soldiers  but the other side could not keep their feudal levies in the field and they could not coin the supplies of church plate which must have fallen into their hands until they had seized the mint at edinburgh so money was scarce with them  it was plain to knox and kirkcaldy of grange and it soon became obvious to maitland of lethington who of course forsook the regent that aid from england must be soughtaid in money and if possible in men and ships  meanwhile the reformers dealt with the ecclesiastical buildings of st andrews as they had done at perth knox urging them on by his sermons  we may presume that the boys broke the windows and images with a sanctified joy  a mutilated head of the redeemer has been found in a latrine of the monastic buildings  as commendator or lay prior james stewart may have secured the golden sheath of the armbone of the apostle presented by edward i and the other precious things the sacred plate of the church in a fane which had been the delphi of scotland  lethington appears to have obtained most of the portable property of st salvators college except that beautiful monument of idolatry the great silver mace presented by kennedy the founder work of a parisian silversmith in 1461 this with maces of rude native work escaped the spoilers  the monastery of the franciscans is now levelled with the earth of the dominicans chapel a small fragment remains  of the residential part of the abbey a house was left when the lead had been stripped from the roof of the church it became a quarry  all churchmens goods were spoiled and reft from them    for every man for the most part that could get anything pertaining to any churchmen thought the same wellwon gear says a contemporary diary  arran himself when he arrived in scotland robbed a priest of all that he had for which chatelherault made compensation  by the middle of june the regent was compelled to remove almost all her french soldiers out of fife  perth was evacuated  the abbey of scone and the palace were sacked  the congregation entered edinburgh they seem to have found the monasteries already swept bare but they seized holyrood and the stamps at the mint  the regent proclaimed that this was flat rebellion and that the rebels were intriguing with england  knox denied it in the first part of his history in origin a contemporary tract written in the autumn but the charge was true and knox and kirkcaldy were since june the negotiators  already his party were offering arran the heir of the crown after mary as a husband for elizabeth who saw him but rejected his suit  arrans father chatelherault later openly deserted the regent july 1  the death of henri ii wounded in a tournament did not accelerate the arrival of french reinforcements for the regent  the weaker brethren however waxed weary money was scarce and on july 24 the congregation evacuated edinburgh and leith after a treaty which they misrepresented broke and accused the regent of breaking 111a  knox visited england about august 1 but felt dissatisfied with his qualification for diplomacy  nothing so far was gained from elizabeth save a secret supply of 3000 pounds  on the other hand fresh french forces arrived at leith the place was fortified the regent was again accused of perfidy by the perfidious and on october 21 the congregation proclaimed her deposition on the alleged authority of her daughter now queen of france whose seal they forged and used in their documents  one cokky was the forger he saw arran use the seal on public papers 111b cokky had made a die for the coins of the congregationa crown of thorns with the words verbum dei  leith manned by french soldiers was till in the summer of 1560 it surrendered to the congregation and their english allies the centre of catholic resistance  in november the congregation after a severe defeat fled in grief from edinburgh to stirling where knox reanimated them and they sent lethington to england to crave assistance  lethington who had been in the service of the regent is henceforth the central figure of every intrigue  witty eloquent subtle he was indispensable and he had one great ruling motive to unite the crowns and peoples of england and scotland  unfortunately he loved the crafty exercise of his dominion over mens minds for its own sake and when in some inscrutable way he entered the clumsy plot to murder darnley and knew that mary could prove his guilt his shiftings and changes puzzle historians  in scotland he was called michael wily that is macchiavelli and the necessary evil  in his mission to england lethington was successful  by december 21 the english diplomatist sadleyr informed arran that a fleet was on its way to aid the congregation who were sacking paisley abbey and issuing proclamations in the names of francis and mary  the fleet arrived while the french were about to seize st andrews january 23 1560 and the french plans were ruined  the regent who was dying found shelter in edinburgh castle which stood neutral  on february 27 1560 at berwick the congregation entered into a regular league with england elizabeth appearing as protectress of scotland while the marriage of mary and francis endured  meanwhile owing to the huguenot disturbances in france such as the tumult of amboise directed against the lives of marys uncles the cardinal and duc de guise mary and francis could not help the regent and huntly a catholic presently as if in fear of the western clans joined the congregation  mary of guise had found the great northern chief treacherous and had disgraced him and untrustworthy he continued to be  on may 7 the garrison of leith defeated with heavy loss an anglo scottish attack on the walls but on june 16 the regent made a good end in peace with all men  she saw chatelherault james stewart and the earl marischal she listened patiently to the preacher willock she bade farewell to all and died a notable woman crushed by an impossible task  the garrison of leith meanwhile was starving on rats and horseflesh negotiations began and ended in the treaty of edinburgh july 6 1560  this treaty as between mary queen of france and scotland on one hand and england on the other was never ratified by mary stuart she appears to have thought that one clause implied her abandonment of all her claims to the english succession typified by her quartering of the royal english arms on her own shield  thus there never was nor could be amity between her and her sister and her foe elizabeth who was justly aggrieved by her assumption of the english arms while elizabeth quartered the arms of france  again the ratification of the treaty as regarded marys rebels depended on their fulfilling certain clauses which in fact they instantly violated  preachers were planted in the larger town some of which had already secured their services knox took edinburgh  superintendentsby no means bishopswere appointed an order which soon ceased to exist in the kirk their duties were to wander about in their provinces superintending and preaching  by request of the convention which was crowded by persons not used to attend some preachers drew up in four days a confession of faith on the lines of calvins rule at geneva this was approved and passed on august 17  the makers of the document profess their readiness to satisfy any critic of any point from the mouth of god out of the bible but the pace was so good that either no criticism was offered or it was very rapidly satisfied  on august 24 four acts were passed in which the authority of the bishop of rome was repudiated  all previous legislation not consistent with the new confession was rescinded  against celebrants and attendants of the mass were threatened 1 confiscation and corporal punishment 2 exile and 3 for the third offence death  the death sentence is not known to have been carried out in more than one or two cases  prof humebrown writes that the penalties attached to the breach of these enactments namely the abjuration of papal jurisdiction the condemnation of all practices and doctrines contrary to the new creed and of the celebration of mass in scotland were those approved and sanctioned by the example of every country in christendom  but not surely for the same offences such as the saying or hearing of mass history of scotland ii 71 72 1902  suits in ecclesiastical were removed into secular courts august 29  in the confession the theology was that of calvin  civil rulers were admitted to be of divine institution their duty is to suppress idolatry and they are not to be resisted when doing that which pertains to their charge  but a catholic ruler like mary or a tolerant ruler as james vi would fain have been apparently may be resisted for his tolerance  resisted james was as we shall see whenever he attempted to be lenient to catholics  the book of discipline by knox and other preachers never was ratified by the estates as the confession of faith had been  it made admirable provisions for the payment of preachers and teachers for the universities and for the poor but somebody probably lethington spoke of the proposals as devout imaginations  the book of discipline approved of what was later accepted by the general assembly the book of common order in public worship  this book was not a stereotyped liturgy but it was a kind of guide to the ministers in public prayers the minister may repeat the prayers or say something like in effect  on the whole he prayed as the spirit moved him and he really seems to have been regarded as inspired his prayers were frequently political addresses  to silence these the infatuated policy of charles i thrust the laudian liturgy on the nation  the preachers were to be chosen by popular election after examination in knowledge and as to morals  there was to be no ordination by laying on of hands  seeing the miracle is ceased the using of the ceremony we deem not necessary but if the preachers were inspired the miracle had not ceased and the ceremony was soon reinstated  contrary to genevan practice such festivals as christmas and easter were abolished  the scottish sabbath was established in great majesty  one rag of rome was retained clerical excommunicationthe sword of church discipline  it was the cutting off from christ of the excommunicated who were handed over to the devil and it was attended by civil penalties equivalent to universal boycotting practical outlawry and followed by hell fire which sentence lawfully pronounced on earth is ratified in heaven the strength of the preachers lay in this terrible weapon borrowed from the armoury of rome  private morals were watched by the elders and offenders were judged in kirksessions  witchcraft sabbath desecration and sexual laxities were the most prominent and popular sins  the mainstay of the system is the idea that the bible is literally inspired that the preachers are the perhaps inspired interpreters of the bible and that the country must imitate the old hebrew persecution of idolaters that is mainly catholics  all this meant a theocracy of preachers elected by the populace and governing the nation by their general assembly in which nobles and other laymen sat as elders  these peculiar institutions came hot from geneva and the country could never have been blessed with them as we have observed but for that instrument of providence cardinal beaton  had he disposed of himself and scotland to henry viii who would not have tolerated presbyterian claims for an hour scotland would not have received the genevan discipline and the kirk would have groaned under bishops  the reformation supplied scotland with a class of preachers who were pure in their lives who were not accessible to bribes a virtue in which they stood almost alone who were firm in their faith and soon had learning enough to defend it who were constant in their parish work and of whom many were credited with prophetic and healing powers  they could exorcise ghosts from houses devils from men possessed  the baldness of the services the stern nature of the creed were congenial to the people  the drawbacks were the intolerance the spiritual pretensions of the preachers to interference in secular affairs and the superstition which credited men like knox and later bruce with the gifts of prophecy and other miraculous workings and insisted on the burning of witches and warlocks whereof the writer knows scarcely an instance in scotland before the reformation  the pulpit may be said to have discharged the functions of the press a press which was all on one side  when in 1562 ninian winzet a catholic priest and exschoolmaster was printing a controversial tractate addressed to knox the magistrates seized the manuscript at the printers house and the author was fortunate in making his escape  the nature of the confession of faith and of the claims of the ministers to interfere in secular affairs with divine authority was certain to cause war between the crown and the kirk  that war whether open and armed or a conflict in words endured till in 1690 the weapon of excommunication with civil penalties was quietly removed from the ecclesiastical armoury such were the results of a religious revolution hurriedly effected  the lords now sent an embassy to elizabeth about the time of the death of amy robsart and while amys husband robert dudley was very dear to the english queen to urge vainly her marriage with arran  on december 5 1560 francis ii died leaving mary stuart a mere dowager while her kinsmen the guises lost power which fell into the unfriendly hands of catherine de medici  at once arran who made knox his confidant began to woo mary with a letter and a ring  her reply perhaps increased his tendency to madness which soon became open and incurable by the science of the day  here we must try to sketch mary la reine blanche in her white royal mourning  her education had been that of the learned ladies of her age she had some knowledge of latin and knew french and italian  french was to her almost a mothertongue but not quite she had retained her scots and her attempts to write english are at first curiously imperfect  she had lived in a profligate court but she was not the wanton of hostile slanders  she had all the guile of statesmanship said the english envoy randolph and she long exercised great patience under daily insults to her religion and provocations from elizabeth  she was generous pitiful naturally honourable and most loyal to all who served her  but her passions whether of love or hate once roused were tyrannical  in person she was tall like her mother and graceful with beautiful hands  her face was somewhat long the nose long and straight the lips and chin beautifully moulded the eyebrows very slender the eyes of a reddish brown long and narrow  her hair was russet drawn back from a lofty brow her smile was captivating she was rather fascinating than beautiful her courage and her love of courage in others were universally confessed 118  in january 1561 the estates of scotland ordered james stuart marys natural brother to visit her in france  in spring she met him and an envoy from huntly lesley later bishop of ross who represented the catholic party and asked mary to land in aberdeen and march south at the head of the gordons and certain northern clans  the proposal came from noblemen of perthshire angus and the north whose forces could not have faced a lowland army  mary who had learned from her mother that huntly was treacherous preferred to take her chance with her brother who returning by way of england moved elizabeth to recognise the scottish queen as her heir  but elizabeth would never settle the succession and as mary refused to ratify the treaty of edinburgh forbade her to travel home through england     chapter xx  mary in scotland   on august 19 1561 in a dense fog and almost unexpected and unwelcomed mary landed in leith  she had told the english ambassador to france that she would constrain none of her subjects in religion and hoped to be unconstrained  her first act was to pardon some artisans under censure for a robin hood frolic her motive says knox was her knowledge that they had acted in despite of religion  the lord james had stipulated that she might have her mass in her private chapel  her priest was mobbed by the godly on the following sunday knox denounced her mass and had his first interview with her later  in vain she spoke of her conscience knox said that it was unenlightened lethington wished that he would deal more gently with a young princess unpersuaded  there were three or four later interviews but knox strengthened by a marriage with a girl of sixteen daughter of lord ochiltree a stewart was proof against the queens fascination  in spite of insults to her faith offered even at pageants of welcome mary kept her temper and for long cast in her lot with lethington and her brother whose hope was to reconcile her with elizabeth  the court was gay with riotous young french nobles well mated with bothwell who though a protestant had sided with mary of guise during the brawls of 1559  he was now a man of twentyseven profligate reckless a conqueror of hearts a speaker of french a ruffian and well educated  in december it was arranged that the old bishops and other high clerics should keep twothirds of their revenues the other third to be divided between the preachers and the queen between god and the devil says knox  thenceforth there was a rift between the preachers and the politicians lethington and lord james now earl of mar on whom mary leaned  the new earl of mar was furtively created earl of murray and enjoyed the gift after the overthrow of huntly  in january 1562 mary asked for an interview with elizabeth  certainly lethington hoped that elizabeth would be able to do much with mary in religion meaning that if marys claims to succeed elizabeth were granted she might turn anglican  the request for a meeting dallied with but never granted occupied diplomatists while at home arran march 31 accused bothwell of training him into a plot to seize marys person  arran probably told truth but he now went mad bothwell was imprisoned in the castle till his escape to england in august 1562 lethington in june was negotiating for marys interview with elizabeth knox bitterly opposed it the preachers feared that the queen would turn anglican and bishops might be let loose in scotland  the masques for marys reception were actually being organised when in july elizabeth on the pretext of persecutions by the guises in france broke off the negotiations  the rest of the year was occupied by an affair of which the origins are obscure  mary with her brother and lethington made a progress into the north were affronted by and attacked huntly who died suddenly october 28 at the fight of corrichie seized a son of his who was executed november 2 and spoiled his castle which contained much of the property of the church of aberdeen  marys motives for destroying her chief catholic subject are not certainly known  her brother lord james in february made earl of mar now received the lands and title of earl of murray  at some date in this year knox preached against mary because she gave a dance  he chose to connect her dance with some attack on the huguenots in france  according to the book of discipline he should have remonstrated privately as mary told him  the dates are inextricable  see my john knox and the reformation pp 215218 till the spring of 1565 the main business was the question of the queens marriage  this continued to divide the ruling protestant nobles from the preachers  knox dreaded an alliance with spain a marriage with don carlos  but elizabeth to waste time offered mary the hand of lord robert dudley leicester and strange as it appears mary would probably have accepted him as late as 1565 for elizabeth let it be understood that to marry a catholic prince would be the signal for war while mary hoped that if she accepted elizabeths favourite dudley she would be acknowledged as elizabeths heiress  mary was young and showed little knowledge of the nature of woman  in 1563 came the affair of chatelard a french minor poet a huguenot apparently who whether in mere fatuity or to discredit mary hid himself under her bed at holyrood and again at burntisland  mary had listened to his rhymes had danced with him and smiled on him but chatelard went too far  he was decapitated in the market street of st andrews feb 22 1563  it is clear if we may trust knoxs account singularly unlike brantomes that chatelard was a huguenot  about easter priests were locked up in ayrshire the centre of presbyterian fanaticism for celebrating mass  this was in accordance with law and to soften knox the girl queen tried her personal influence he resisted the devil mary yielded and allowed archbishop hamilton and some fifty other clerics to be placed in prison courteous  the estates which met on may 27 for the first time since the queen landed were mollified but were as far as ever from passing the book of discipline  they did pass a law condemning witches to death a source of unspeakable cruelties  knox and murray now ceased to be on terms till their common interests brought them together in 1565  in june 1563 elizabeth requested mary to permit the return to scotland of lennox the traitor to the national cause and to cardinal beaton and the rival of the hamiltons for the succession to the thrones apparently for the very purpose of entangling mary in a marriage with lennoxs son darnley and then thwarting it  it was not mary who asked elizabeth to send lennox  knoxs favourite candidate was lord robert dudley despite his notorious character he sometimes favoured the english puritans  when holyrood had been invaded by a mob who in marys absence in autumn 1563 broke up the catholic attendants on mass such attendance in marys absence was illegal and when both parties were summoned to trial knox called together the godly  the council cleared him of the charge of making an unlawful convocation they might want to make one any day themselves and he was supported by the general assembly  similar conduct of the preachers thirty years later gave james vi the opportunity to triumph over the kirk  in june 1564 there was still discord between the kirk and the lords and in a long argument with lethington knox maintained the right of the godly to imitate the slayings of idolaters by phineas and jehu the doctrine bore bloodred fruits among the later covenanters  elizabeth in may 1564 in vain asked mary to withdraw the permission previously asked for by her to allow lennox to visit scotland and plead for the restitution of his lands  the objection to lennoxs appearance had come through randolph from knox  you may cause us to take the lord darnley wrote kirkcaldy to cecil to stop elizabeths systems of delays and sir james melville after going on a mission to elizabeth warned mary that she would never part with her minion now earl of leicester  lennox in autumn 1564 arrived and was restored to his estates while leicester and cecil worked for the sending of his son darnley to scotland  leicester had no desire to desert elizabeths court and his chance of touching her maiden heart  the intrigues of cecil leicester and elizabeth resemble rather a chapter in a novel than a page in history  elizabeth notoriously hated and when she could thwarted all marriages  she desired that mary should never marry a union with a catholic prince she vetoed threatening war and leicester she offered merely to drive time  but mary evasively tempted by hints later withdrawn of her recognition as elizabeths successor was till the end of march 1565 encouraged by randolph the english ambassador at her court to remain in hope of wedding leicester  randolph himself was not in the secret of the english intrigue which was to slip darnley at mary  he came february 1565 cecil and leicester had used earnest means to ensure his coming  on march 17 mary was informed that she would never be recognised as elizabeths successor till events should occur which never could occur  on receiving this news mary wept she also was indignant at the long and humiliating series of elizabeths treacheries  her patience broke down she turned to darnley thereby as the english intriguers designed breaking up the concord of her nobles  to marry darnley involved the feud of the hamiltons and the return of murray whom darnley had offended of chatelherault argyll and many other nobles to the party of knox and the preachers  leicester would have been welcome to knox darnley was a catholic if anything and a weak passionate young fool  mary in the clash of interests was a lost woman as randolph truly said with sincere pity  her long endurance her attempts to run the english course were wasted  david riccio who came to scotland as a musician in 1561 was now high in her and in darnleys favour  murray was accused of a conspiracy to seize darnley and lennox the godly began to organise an armed force june 1565 mary summoned from exile bothwell a man of the sword  on july 29th she married darnley and on august 6th murray who had refused to appear to answer the charges of treason brought against him though a safeconduct was offered was outlawed and proclaimed a rebel while huntlys son lord george was to be restored to his estates  thus everything seemed to indicate that mary had been exasperated into breaking with the party of moderation the party of murray and lethington and been driven into courses where her support if any must come from france and rome  yet she married without waiting for the necessary dispensation from the pope  her policy was henceforth influenced by her favour to riccio and by the jealous and arrogant temper of her husband  mary well knew that elizabeth had sent money to her rebels whom she now pursued all through the south of scotland they fled from edinburgh where the valiant brethren brave enough in throwing stones at pilloried priests refused to join them and despite the feuds in her own camp where bothwell and darnley were already on the worst terms mary drove the rebel lords across the border at carlisle on october 8  mary seemed triumphant but the men with herlethington and morton the chancellorwere disaffected darnley was mutinous he thought himself neglected he and his father resented marys leniency to chatelherault who had submitted and been sent to france all parties hated riccio there was to be a parliament early in march 1566  in february mary sent the bishop of dunblane to rome to ask for a subsidy she intended to reintroduce the spiritual estate into the house as electors of the lords of the articles tending to have done some good anent the restoring of the old religion  the nuncio who was to have brought the popes money later insisted that mary should take the heads of murray argyle morton and lethington  whether she aimed at securing more than tolerance for catholics is uncertain but the parliament in which the exiled lords were to be forfeited was never held  the other nobles would never permit such a measure  george douglas a stirring cadet of the great house was exciting darnleys jealousy of riccio but already randolph february 5 1566 had written to cecil that the wisest were aiming at putting all in hazard to restore the exiled lords  the nobles in the last resort would all stand by each other there was now a douglas plot of the old sort to bring back the exiles and darnley with his jealous desire to murder riccio was but the catspaw to light the train and explode mary and her government  ruthven whom mary had always distrusted came into the conspiracy  through randolph all was known in england  bands were drawn up signed by argyll safe in his own hills murray glencairn rothes boyd ochiltree the father of knoxs young wife and darnley his name was put forward his rights and succession were secured against the hamiltons protestantism too was to be defended  many douglases many of the lothian gentry were in the plot  murray was to arrive from england as soon as riccio had been slain and mary had been seized  randolph knew all and reported to elizabeths ministers  the plan worked with mechanical precision  on march 9 morton and his company occupied holyrood going up the great staircase about eight at night while darnley and ruthven a dying man entered the queens supper room by a privy stair  mortons men burst in riccio was dragged forth and died under forty daggers  bothwell atholl and huntly partisans of mary escaped from the palace with them mary managed to communicate on the morrow when she also held talk with murray who had returned with the other exiles  she had worked on the fears and passions of darnley by promises of amnesty the lords were induced to withdraw their guards next day and in the following night by a secret passage and through the tombs of kings mary and darnley reached the horses brought by arthur erskine  it was a long dark ride to dunbar but there mary was safe  she pardoned and won over glencairn whom she liked and rothes bothwell and huntly joined her with a sufficient force ruthven and morton fled to berwick ruthven was to die in england and knox hastened into kyle in ayrshire darnley who declared his own innocence and betrayed his accomplices was now equally hated and despised by his late allies and by the queen and murrayindeed by all men chiefly by morton and argyll  lethington was in hiding but he was indispensable and in september was reconciled to mary  on june 19 in edinburgh castle she bore her child later james vi on her recovery darnley was insolent and was the more detested while bothwell was high in favour  in october most of the lords signed with murray a band for setting darnley asidenot for his murder  he is said to have denounced mary to spain france and rome for neglecting catholic interests  in midoctober mary was seriously ill at jedburgh where bothwell wounded in an encounter with a border reiver was welcomed while darnley coldly received went to his fathers house on the forth  on her recovery mary resided in the last days of november at craigmillar castle near edinburgh  here murray argyll bothwell huntly and lethington held counsel with her as to darnley  lethington said that a way would be found a way that parliament would approve while murray would look through his fingers  lennox believed that the plan was to arrest darnley on some charge and slay him if he resisted  at stirling december 17 when the young prince was baptised with catholic rites darnley did not appear he sulked in his own rooms  a week later the exiles guilty of riccios murder were recalled among them morton and darnley finding all his enemies about to be united went to glasgow where he fell ill of smallpox  mary offered a visit she had had the malady as a child and was rudely rebuffed january 1 13 1567 but she was with him by january 21  from glasgow at this time was written the long and fatal letter to bothwell which places marys guilt in luring darnley to his death beyond doubt if we accept the letters as authentic 129  darnley was carried in a litter to the lonely house of kirk o field on the south wall of edinburgh  here mary attended him in his sickness  on sunday morning february 9 murray left edinburgh for fife  in the night of sunday 9monday 10 the house where darnley lay was blown up by gunpowder and he with an attendant was found dead in the garden how he was slain is not known  that bothwell in accordance with a band signed by himself huntly argyll and lethington and aided by some border ruffians laid and exploded the powder is certain  morton was apprised by lethington and bothwell of the plot but refused to join it without marys written commission which he did not obtain  against the queen there is no trustworthy direct evidence if we distrust her alleged letters to bothwell but her conduct in protecting and marrying bothwell who was really in love with his wife shows that she did not disapprove  the trial of bothwell was a farce marys abduction by him april 24 and retreat with him to dunbar was collusive  she married bothwell on may 15  her nobles many of whom had signed a document urging her to marry bothwell rose against her on june 15 1567 she surrendered to them at carberry hill while they several of them deep in the murder plot were not sorry to let bothwell escape to dunbar  after some piratical adventures being pursued by kirkcaldy he made his way to denmark where he died a prisoner  mary first carried to edinburgh and there insulted by the populace was next hurried to lochleven castle  her alleged letters to bothwell were betrayed to the lords june 21 probably through sir james balfour who commanded in edinburgh castle  perhaps murray who had left for france before the marriage to bothwell perhaps fear of elizabeth or human pity induced her captors contrary to the counsel of lethington to spare her life when she had signed her abdication while they crowned her infant son  murray accepted the regency a parliament in december established the kirk acquitted themselves of rebellion and announced that they had proof of marys guilt in her own writing  her romantic escape from lochleven may 2 1568 gave her but an hour of freedom defeated on her march to dumbarton castle in the battle of langside hill she lost heart and fled to the coast of galloway on may 16 crossed the solway to workington in cumberland and in a few days was elizabeths prisoner in carlisle castle  mary had hitherto been a convinced but not a very obedient daughter of the church for example it appears that she married darnley before the arrival of the popes dispensation  at this moment philip of spain the french envoy to scotland and the french court had no faith in her innocence of darnleys death and the pope said he knew not which of these ladies were the bettermary or elizabeth  but from this time while a captive in england mary was the centre of the hopes of english catholics in miniatures she appears as queen quartering the english arms she might further the ends of spain of france of rome of english rebels while her existence was a nightmare to the protestants of scotland and a peril to elizabeth  after marys flight murray was as has been said regent for the crowned baby james  in his council were the sensual brutal but vigorous morton with mar later himself regent a man of milder nature glencairn ruthven whom mary detestedhe had tried to make unwelcome love to her at lochleven and the necessary evil lethington  how a man so wily became a party to the murder of darnley cannot be known now he began to perceive that if mary were restored as he believed that she would be his only safety lay in securing her gratitude by secret services  on the other side were the hamiltons with their ablest man the archbishop the border spears who were loyal to bothwell and two of the conspirators in the murder of darnley argyll and huntly with fleming and herries who were much attached to mary  the two parties influenced by elizabeth did not now come to blows but awaited the results of english inquiries into marys guilt and of elizabeths consequent action     chapter xxi  minority of james vi   let none of them escape was elizabeths message to the gaolers of mary and her companions at carlisle  the unhappy queen prayed to see her in whose hospitality she had confided or to be allowed to depart free elizabeths policy was to lead her into consenting to reply to her subjects accusations and mary drifted into the shuffling english inquiries at york in october while she was lodged at bolton castle murray george buchanan lethington now distrusted by murray and morton produced for norfolk and other english commissioners at york copies at least of the incriminating letters which horrified the duke of norfolk  yet probably through the guile of lethington he changed his mind and became a suitor for marys hand  he bade her refuse compromise whereas compromise was lethingtons hope a full and free inquiry would reveal his own guilt in darnleys murder  the inquiry was shifted to london in december mary always being refused permission to appear and speak for herself nay she was not allowed even to see the letters which she was accused of having written  her own commissioners lord herries and bishop lesley who as mary knew in herriess case had no faith in her innocence showed their want of confidence by proposing a compromise this was not admitted  morton explained how he got the silver casket with the fatal letters poems to bothwell and other papers they were read in translations english and scots handwritings were compared with no known result evidence was heard and elizabeth at last merely decidedthat she could not admit mary to her presence the english lords agreed as the case does now stand and presently many of them were supporting norfolk in his desire to marry the accused murray was told january 10 1669 that he had proved nothing which could make elizabeth take any evil opinion of the queen her good sister nevertheless elizabeth would support him in his government of scotland while declining to recognise james vi as king  all compromises mary now utterly refused she would live and die a queen henceforth the tangled intrigues cannot be disengaged in a work of this scope  elizabeth made various proposals to mary all involving her resignation as queen or at least the suspension of her rights  mary refused to listen her party in scotland led by chatelherault herries huntly and argyll did not venture to meet murray and his party in war and was counselled by lethington who still in semblance was of murrays faction  lethington was convinced that sooner or later mary would return and he did not wish to incur her particular illwill he knew that mary as she said had that in black and white which would hang him for the murder of darnley  now lethington huntly and argyll were daunted without stroke of sword by murray and a convention to discuss messages from elizabeth and mary met at perth july 2528 1569 and refused to allow the annulment of her marriage with bothwell though previously they had insisted on its annulment  presently lethington was publicly accused of darnleys murder by crawford a retainer of lennox was imprisoned but was released by kirkcaldy commander in edinburgh castle which henceforth became the fortress of marys cause  the secret of norfolks plan to marry the scottish queen now reached elizabeth making her more hostile to mary an insurrection in the north broke out the earl of northumberland was driven into scotland was betrayed by hecky armstrong and imprisoned at loch leven  murray offered to hand over northumberland to elizabeth in exchange for mary her life to be guaranteed by hostages but on january 23 1570 murray was shot by hamilton of bothwellhaugh from a window of a house in linlithgow belonging to archbishop hamilton  the murderer escaped and joined his clan  during his brief regency murray had practically detached huntly and argyll from armed support of marys cause he had reduced the border to temporary quiet by the free use of the gibbet but he had not ventured to face lethingtons friends and bring him to trial if he had many others would have been compromised  murray was sly and avaricious but had he been legitimate scotland would have been well governed under his vigour and caution    regencies of lennox mar and morton   randolph was now sent to edinburgh to make peace between marys party and her foes impossible  he succeeded the parties took up arms and sussex ravaged the border in revenge of a raid by buccleuch  on may 14 lennox with an english force was sent north he devastated the hamilton country was made regent in july and in april 1571 had his revenge on archbishop hamilton who was taken at the capture by crawford of dumbarton castle held by lord fleming a post of vital moment to the marians and was hanged at stirling for complicity in the slaying of murray  george buchanan marys old tutor took advantage of these facts to publish quite a fresh account of darnleys murder the guilt of the hamiltons now made that of bothwell almost invisible  edinburgh castle under kirkcaldy with lethington held out knox reluctantly retired from edinburgh to st andrews where he was unpopular but many of marys lords deserted her and though lennox was shot september 4 in an attack by buccleuch and ker of ferniehirst on stirling castle where he was holding a parliament he was succeeded by mar who was inspired by morton a far stronger man  presently the discovery of a plot between mary norfolk the english catholics and spain caused the dukes execution and more severe incarceration for mary  in scotland there was no chance of peace  morton and his associates would not resign the lands of the hamiltons lethington and kirkcaldy lethington knew that no amnesty would cover his guilt though he had been nominally cleared in the slaying of darnley  one after the other of marys adherents made their peace but kirkcaldy and lethington in edinburgh castle seemed safe while money and supplies held out  knox had prophesied that kirkcaldy would be hanged but did not live to see his desire on his enemy or on mary whom elizabeth was about to hand over to mar for instant execution  knox died on november 24 1572 mar the regent had predeceased him by a month leaving morton in power  on may 28 1573 the castle attacked by guns and engineers from england and cut off from water struck its flag  the brave kirkcaldy was hanged lethington who had long been moribund escaped by an opportune death the best soldier in scotland and the most modern of her wits thus perished together  concerning knox the opinions of his contemporaries differed  by his own account the leaders of his party deemed him too extreme and david hume finds his ferocious delight in chronicling the murders of his foes rather amusing though sad  quarrels of religion apart knox was a very goodhearted man but where religion was concerned his temper was remote from the christian  he was a perfect agitator he knew no tolerance he spared no violence of language and in diplomacy when he diplomatised he was no more scrupulous than another admirably vigorous and personal as literature his history needs constant correction from documents  while to his secretary bannatyne knox seemed a man of god the light of scotland the mirror of godliness many silent douce folk among whom he laboured probably agreed in the allegation quoted by a diarist of the day that knox had as was alleged the most part of the blame of all the sorrows of scotland since the slaughter of the late cardinal  in these years of violence of the douglas wars as they were called two new tendencies may be observed  in january 1572 morton induced an assembly of preachers at leith to accept one of his clan john douglas as archbishop of st andrews other bishops were appointed called tulchan bishops from the tulchan or effigy of a calf employed to induce cows to yield their milk  the church revenues were drawn through these unapostolic prelates and came into the hands of the state or at least of morton  with these bishops superintendents coexisted but not for long  the horns of the mitre already began to peer above presbyterian parity and morton is said to have remarked that there would never be peace in scotland till some preachers were hanged  in fact there never was peace between kirk and state till a deplorable number of preachers were hanged by the governments of charles ii and james ii  a meeting of preachers in edinburgh after the bartholomew massacre in the autumn of 1572 demanded that it shall be lawful to all the subjects in this realm to invade them and every one of them to the death  the persons to be invaded to the death are recalcitrant catholics grit or small persisting in remaining in scotland 137  the alarmed demands of the preachers were merely disregarded by the privy council  the ruling nobles as bishop lesley says would never gratify the preachers by carrying out the bloody penal acts to their full extent against catholics  there was no expulsion of all catholics who dared to stay no popular massacre of all who declined to go  while morton was in power he kept the preachers well in hand  he did worse he starved the ministers and thrust into the best livings wanton young gentlemen of whom his kinsman archibald douglas an accomplice in darnleys death and a treblydyed traitor was the worst  but in 1575 the great andrew melville an erudite scholar and a most determined person began to protest against the very name of bishop in the kirk and in adamson made by morton successor of john douglas at st andrews melville found a mark and a victim  in economics as an english diplomatist wrote to cecil in november 1572 the country despite the civil war was thriving the noblemens great credit decaying    the ministry and religion increaseth and the desire in them to prevent the practice of the papists  the englishman in november may refer to the petition for persecution of october 20 1572  the death of old chatelherault now left the headship of the hamiltons in more resolute hands morton was confronted by opposition from argyll atholl buchan and mar and morton in 15761577 made approaches to mary  when the young james vi came to his majority mortons enemies would charge him with his guilty foreknowledge through both well of darnleys murder so he made advances to mary in hope of an amnesty  she suspected a trap and held aloof     chapter xxii  reign of james vi   on march 4 1578 a strong band of nobles led by argyll presented so firm a front that morton resigned the regency but in april 1578 a douglas plot backed by angus and morton secured for the earl of mar the command of stirling castle and custody of the king in june 1578 after an appearance of civil war morton was as strong as ever  after dining with him in april 1579 atholl the main hope of mary in scotland died suddenly and suspicion of poison fell on his host  but mortons ensuing success in expelling from scotland the hamilton leaders lord claude and arbroath brought down his own doom  with them sir james balfour deep in the secrets of darnleys death was exiled he opened a correspondence with mary and presently procured for her a contented revenge on morton  two new characters in the long intrigue of vengeance now come on the scene  both were stewarts and as such were concerned in the feud against the hamiltons  the first was a cousin of darnley brought up in france namely esme stuart daubigny son of john a brother of lennox he had all the accomplishments likely to charm the boy king now in his fourteenth year  james had hitherto been sternly educated by george buchanan more mildly by peter young  buchanan and others had not quite succeeded in bringing him to scorn and hate his mother lady mar who was very kind to him had exercised a gentler influence  the boy had read much had hunted yet more eagerly and had learned dissimulation and distrust so natural to a child weak and ungainly in body and the conscious centre of the intrigues of violent men  a favourite of his was james stewart son of lord ochiltree and brotherinlaw of john knox  stewart was captain of the guard a man of learning who had been in foreign service he was skilled in all bodily feats was ambitious reckless and resolute and no friend of the preachers  the two stewarts daubigny and the captain became allies  in a parliament at edinburgh november 1579 their foes the chiefs of the hamiltons were forfeited they had been driven to seek shelter with elizabeth while daubigny got their lands and the key of scotland dumbarton castle on the estuary of clyde  the kirk regarding daubigny now earl of lennox despite his protestant professions as a papist or an atheist had little joy in morton who was denounced in a printed placard as guilty in darnleys murder sir james balfour could show his signature to the band to slay darnley signed by huntly bothwell argyll and lethington  this was not true  balfour knew much was himself involved but had not the band to show or did not dare to produce it  to strengthen himself lennox was reconciled to the kirk to help the hamiltons elizabeth sent bowes to intrigue against lennox who was conspiring in marys interest or in that of the guises or in his own when lennox succeeded in getting dumbarton castle an open door for france into his power bowes was urged by elizabeth to join with morton and lay violent hands on lennox august 31 1580 but in a month elizabeth cancelled her orders  bowes was recalled morton to whom english aid had been promised was left to take his chances  morton had warning from lord robert stewart marys halfbrother to fly the country for sir james balfour with his information had landed  on december 31 1580 captain stewart accused morton in presence of the council of complicity in darnleys murder  he was put in ward elizabeth threatened war the preachers stormed against lennox a plot to murder him a douglas plot and to seize james was discovered randolph who now represented elizabeth was fired at and fled to berwick james stewart was created earl of arran  in march 1581 the king and lennox tried to propitiate the preachers by signing a negative covenant against rome later made into a precedent for the famous covenant of 1638  on june 1 morton was tried for guilty foreknowledge of darnleys death  he was executed deservedly and his head was stuck on a spike of the tolbooth  the death of this avaricious licentious and resolute though unamiable protestant was a heavy blow to the preachers and their party and a crook in the lot of elizabeth    the war of kirk and king   the next twenty years were occupied with the strife of kirk and king whence arose all the cumber of scotland till 1689  the preachers led by the learned and turbulent andrew melville had an everpresent terror of a restoration of catholicism the creed of a number of the nobles and of an unknown proportion of the people  the reformation of 15591560 had been met by no catholic resistance we might suppose that the enormous majority of the people were protestants though the reverse has been asserted  but whatever the theological preferences of the country may have been the justifiable fear of practical annexation by france had overpowered all other considerations  by 1580 it does not seem that there was any good reason for the protestant nervousness even if some northern counties and northern and border peers preferred catholicism the king himself a firm believer in his own theological learning and acuteness was thoroughly protestant  but the preachers would scarcely allow him to remain a protestant  their claims as formulated by andrew melville were inconsistent with the right of the state to be mistress in her own house  in a general assembly at glasgow 1581 presbyteries were established episcopacy was condemned the kirk claimed for herself a separate jurisdiction uninvadable by the state  elizabeth though for state reasons she usually backed the presbyterians against james also warned him of a sect of dangerous consequence which would have no king but a presbytery  the kirk with her sword of excommunication and with the inspired violence of the political sermons and prayers invaded the secular authority whenever and wherever she pleased and supported the preachers in their claims to be tried first when accused of treasonable libels in their own ecclesiastical courts  these were certain to acquit them  james if not pressed in this fashion had no particular reason for desiring episcopal government of the kirk but being so pressed he saw no refuge save in bishops  meanwhile his chief advisersdaubigny now duke of lennox and james stewart the destroyer of morton now to the prejudice of the hamiltons earl of arranwere men whose private life at least in arrans case was scandalous  if arran were a protestant he was impatient of the rule of the pulpiteers and lennox was working if not sincerely in marys interests certainly in his own and for those of the catholic house of guise  at the same time he favoured the kings episcopal schemes and late in 1581 appointed a preacher named montgomery to the recently vacant archbishopric of glasgow while he himself like morton drew most of the revenues  hence arose tumults and late in 1581 and in 1582 priestly and jesuit emissaries went and came intriguing for a catholic rising to be supported by a large foreign force which they had not the slightest chance of obtaining from any quarter  archbishop montgomery was excommunicated by the kirk and james as we saw had signed a negative confession 1581  in 1582 elizabeth was backing the exiled presbyterian earl of angus and the earl of gowrie ruthven while lennox was contemplating a coup detat in edinburgh august 27  gowrie with the connivance of england struck the first blow  he mar and their accomplices captured james at ruthven castle near perth august 23 the raid of ruthven with the approval of the general assembly of the kirk  it was a douglas plot managed by angus and elizabeth  james stewart of the guard now earl of arran was made prisoner lennox fled the country  in october 1582 in a parliament at holyrood the conspirators passed acts indemnifying themselves and the general assembly approved them  these acts were rescinded later and james had learned for life his hatred of the presbyterians who had treacherously seized and insulted their king 144  in may 1583 lennox died in paris leaving an heir  on june 27 james made his escape a free king to the castle of st andrews he proclaimed an amnesty and feigned reconciliation with his captor the earl of gowrie chief of the house so hateful to marythe ruthvens  at the same time james placed himself in friendly relations with his kinsfolk the guises the terror of protestants  he had already been suspected on account of lennox as inclined to rome in fact he was always a protestant but baited on every sideby england by the kirk by a faction of his nobles he intrigued for allies in every direction  the secret history of his intrigues has never been written  we find the persecuted and astute lad either in communication with rome or represented by shady adventurers as employing them to establish such communications  at one time as has been recently discovered a young man giving himself out as jamess bastard brother a son of darnley begotten in england was professing to bear letters from james to the pope  he was arrested on the continent and james could not be brought either to avow or disclaim his kinsman  a new lennox son of the last was created a duke a new bothwell francis stewart nephew of marys bothwell began to rival his uncle in turbulence  knowing that angloscottish plots to capture him again were being woven daily by angus and others james in february 1584 wrote a friendly and compromising letter to the pope  in april arran james stewart crushed a conspiracy by seizing gowrie at dundee and then routing a force with which mar and angus had entered scotland  gowrie confessing his guilt as a conspirator was executed at stirling may 2 1584 leaving of course his feud to his widow and son  the chief preachers fled andrew melville was already in exile with several others in england  melville in february had been charged with preaching seditious sermons had brandished a hebrew bible at the privy council had refused secular jurisdiction and appealed to a spiritual court by which he was certain to be acquitted  henceforward when charged with uttering treasonable libels from the pulpit the preachers were wont to appeal in the first instance to a court of their own cloth and on this point james in the longrun triumphed over the kirk  in a parliament of may 18 1584 such declinature of royal jurisdiction was by the black acts made treason episcopacy was established the heirs of gowrie were disinherited angus mar and other rebels were forfeited  but such forfeitures never held long in scotland  in august 1584 a new turn was given to jamess policy by arran who was protestant if anything in belief and hoped to win over elizabeth the harbourer of all enemies of james  arrans instrument was the beautiful young master of gray in france a catholic a partisan of mary and leagued with the guises  he was sent to persuade elizabeth to banish jamess exiled rebels but like a lethington on a smaller scale he set himself to obtain the restoration of these lords as against arran while he gratified elizabeth by betraying to her the secrets of mary  this man was the adoring friend of the flower of chivalry sir philip sidney  as against arran the plot succeeded  making berwick on english soil their base in november 1585 the exiles lay and secular backed by england returned captured james at stirling and drove arran to lurk about the country till many years after douglas of parkhead met and slew him avenging morton and when opportunity offered douglas was himself slain by an avenging stewart at the cross of edinburgh  the age reeked with such blood feuds of which the preachers could not cure their fiery flocks  in december 1585 parliament restored gowries forfeited family to their own henceforth they were constantly conspiring against james and the exiled preachers returned to their manses and pulpits  but bishops were not abolished though the kirk through the synod of fife excommunicated the archbishop of st andrews adamson who replied in kind  he was charged with witchcraft and in the longrun was dragged down and reduced to poverty being accused of dealings with witchesand hares  in july 1586 england and scotland formed an alliance and elizabeth promised to make james an allowance of 4000 pounds ayear  this it may be feared was the bloodprice of jamess mother from her son and any hope of aid from her son mary was now cut off  walsingham laid the snares into which she fell deliberately providing for her means of communication with babington and his company and deciphering and copying the letters which passed through the channel which he had contrived  a trifle of forgery was also done by his agent phelipps  mary knowing herself deserted by her son was determined as james knew to disinherit him  for this reason and for the 4000 pounds he made no strong protest against her trial  one of his agents in londonthe wretched accomplice in his fathers murder archibald douglaswas consenting to her execution  james himself thought that strict imprisonment was the best course but the presbyterian angus declared that mary could not be blamed if she had caused the queen of englands throat to be cut for detaining her so unjustly imprisoned  the natural man within us entirely agrees with angus  a mission was sent from holyrood including jamess handsome new favourite the master of gray with his cousin logan of restalrig who sold the master to walsingham  the envoys were to beg for marys life the master had previously betrayed her but he was not wholly lost and in london he did his best contrary to what is commonly stated to secure her life  he thus incurred the enmity of his former allies in the english court and as he had foreseen he was ruined in scotlandhis previous letters hostile to mary being betrayed by his aforesaid cousin logan of restalrig  on february 8 1567 ended the lifelong tragedy of mary stuart  the woman whom elizabeth vainly moved amyas paulet to murder was publicly decapitated at fotheringay  james vowed that he would not accept from elizabeth the price of his mothers blood  but despite the fury of his nobles james sat still and took the money at most some 4000 pounds annuallywhen he could get it  during the next fifteen years the reign of james and his struggle for freedom from the kirk was perturbed by a long series of intrigues of which the details are too obscure and complex for presentation here  his chief minister was now john maitland a brother of lethington and as versatile unscrupulous and intelligent as the rest of that house maitland had actually been present as lethingtons representative at the tragedy of the kirkofield  he was protestant and favoured the party of england  in the state the chief parties were the presbyterian nobles the majority of the gentry or lairds and the preachers on one side and the great catholic families of huntly morton the title being now held by a maxwell errol and crawford on the other  bothwell a sisters son of marys bothwell flitted meteorlike more catholic than anything else but always plotting to seize jamess person and in this he was backed by the widow of gowrie and the preachers and encouraged by elizabeth  in her fear that james would join the catholic nobles whom the preachers eternally urged him to persecute elizabeth smiled on the protestant plotsthereby of course fostering any inclination which james may have felt to seek catholic aid at home and abroad  the plots of mary were perpetually confused by intrigues of priestly emissaries who interfered with the schemes of spain and mixed in the interests of the guises  a fact which proved to be of the highest importance was the passing in july 1587 of an act by which much of the ecclesiastical property of the ancient church was attached to the crown to be employed in providing for the maintenance of the clergy  but james used much of it in making temporal lordships for example at the time of the mysterious gowrie conspiracy august 1600 we find that the earl of gowrie had obtained the church lands of the abbey of scone which his brother the master of ruthven desired  with the large revenues now at his disposal james could buy the support of the baronage who after the execution in 1584 of the earl of gowrie the father of the gowrie of the conspiracy of 1600 are not found leading and siding with the ministers in a resolute way  by 1600 young gowrie was the only hope of the preachers and probably jamess ability to enrich the nobles helped to make them stand aloof  meanwhile fears and hopes of the success of the spanish armada held the minds of the protestants and of the catholic earls  in this worldwolter as james said no scot moved for spain except that lord maxwell who had first received and then been deprived of the earldom of morton  james advanced against him in dumfriesshire and caused his flight  as for the armada many ships drifted north round scotland and one great vessel blown up in tobermory bay by lachlan maclean of duart still invites the attention of treasurehunters 1911    the catholic earls   early in 1589 elizabeth became mistress of some letters which proved that the catholic earls huntly and errol were intriguing with spain  the offence was lightly passed over but when the earls with crawford and montrose drew to a head in the north james with much more than his usual spirit headed the army which advanced against them they fled from him near aberdeen surrendered and were for a brief time imprisoned  as nobody knows how fortunes wheel may turn and as james hard pressed by the preachers could neglect no chance of support he would never gratify the kirk by crushing the catholic earls by temperament he was no persecutor  his calculated leniency caused him years of trouble  meanwhile james after issuing a grotesque proclamation about the causes of his spirited resolve sailed in october to woo a seakings daughter over the foam the princess anne of denmark  after happy months passed he wrote in drinking and driving ower he returned with his bride in may 1590  the general assembly then ordered prayers for the puritans oppressed in england none the less elizabeth the oppressor continued to patronise the plots of the puritans of scotland  they now lent their approval to the foe of jamess minister maitland namely the wild francis stewart earl of bothwell a sisters son of marys bothwell  this young man had the engaging quality of gay and absolute recklessness he was dear to ladies and the wild young gentry of lothian and the borders he broke prisons released friends dealt with wizards aided by lady gowrie stole into holyrood his ruling ambition being to capture the king  the preachers prayed for sanctified plagues against james and regarded bothwell favourably as a sanctified plague  a strange conspiracy within clan campbell in which huntly and maitland were implicated now led to the murder among others of the bonny earl of murray by huntly in partnership with maitland february 1592  james was accused of having instigated this crime from suspicion of murray as a partner in the wild enterprises of bothwell and was so hard pressed by sermons that in the early summer of 1592 he allowed the black acts to be abrogated and the charter of the liberties of the kirk to be passed  one of these liberties was to persecute catholics in accordance with the penal acts of 1560  the kirk was almost an imperium in imperio but was still prohibited from appointing the time and place of its own general assemblies without royal assent  this weak point in their defences enabled james to vanquish them but in june bothwell attacked him in the palace of falkland and put him in considerable peril  the end of 1592 and the opening of 1593 were remarkable for the discovery of the spanish blanks papers addressed to philip of spain signed by huntly the new earl of angus and errol to be filled up with an oral message requesting military aid for scottish catholics  such proceedings make our historians hold up obtesting hands against the perfidy of idolaters  but clearly if knox and the congregation were acting rightly when they besought the aid of england against mary of guise then errol and huntly are not to blame for inviting spain to free them from persecution  some inkling of the scheme had reached james and a paper in which he weighed the pros and cons is in existence  his suspected understanding with the catholic earls whom he merely did not wish to estrange hopelessly was punished by a sanctified plague  on july 24 1593 by aid of the late earl gowries daughter bothwell entered holyrood seized the king extorted his own terms went and amazed the dean of durham by his narrative of the adventure and seemed to have the connivance of elizabeth  but in september james found himself in a position to repudiate his forced engagement  bothwell now allied himself with the catholic earls and as a catholic had no longer the prayers of the preachers  james ordered levies to attack the earls while argyll led his clan and the macleans against huntly only to be defeated by the gordon horse at the battle of glenrinnes october 3  huntly and his allies however dared not encounter king james and andrew melville who marched together against them and they were obliged to fly to the continent  bothwell with his retainer colville continued with cecils connivance to make desperate plots for seizing james indeed cecil was intriguing with them and other desperadoes even after 1600 throughout all the tudor period from henry vii to 1601 england was engaged in a series of conspiracies against the persons of the princes of scotland  the catholics of the south of scotland now lost lord maxwell slain by a lockerby lick in a great clan battle with the johnstones at dryfe sands  in 1595 jamess minister john maitland brother of lethington died and early in 1596 an organisation called the octavians was made to regulate the distracted finance of the country  on april 13 1596 walter scott of buccleuch made himself an everlasting name by the bloodless rescue of kinmont willie an armstrong reiver from the castle of carlisle where he was illegally held by lord scrope  the period was notable for the endless raids by the clans on both sides of the border celebrated in ballads  james had determined to recall the exiled catholic earls undeterred by the eloquence of the last of all our sincere assemblies held with deep emotion in march 1596  the earls came home in september at falkland palace andrew melville seized james by the sleeve called him gods silly vassal and warned him that christ and his kirk were the kings overlords  soon afterwards mr david black of st andrews spoke against elizabeth in a sermon which caused diplomatic remonstrances  black would be tried in the first instance only by a spiritual court of his brethren  there was a long struggle the ministers appointed a kind of standing committee of safety james issued a proclamation dissolving it and on december 17 inflammatory sermons led a deputation to try to visit james who was with the lords of session in the tolbooth  whether under an alarm of a popish plot or not the crowd became so fierce and menacing that the great lachlan maclean of duart rode to stirling to bring up argyll in the kings defence with such forces as he could muster  the king retired to linlithgow the rev mr bruce a famous preacher credited with powers of prophecy in vain appealed to the duke of hamilton to lead the godly  by threatening to withdraw the court and courts of justice from edinburgh james brought the citizens to their knees and was able to take order with the preachers     chapter xxiii  the gowrie conspiracy   james in reducing the kirk relied as much on his cunning and kingcraft as on his prerogative  he summoned a convention of preachers and of the estates to perth at the end of february 1597 and thither he brought many ministers from the north men unlike the zealots of lothian and the lowlands  he persuaded them to vote themselves a general assembly and they admitted his right to propose modifications in church government to forbid unusual convocations as in edinburgh during the autumn of 1596 they were not to preach against acts of parliament or of council nor appoint preachers in the great towns without the royal assent and were not to attack individuals from the pulpit  an attempt was to be made to convert the catholic lords  a general assembly at dundee in may ratified these decisions to the wrath of andrew melville and the catholic earls were more or less reconciled to the kirk which at this period had not one supporter among the nobility  james had made large grants of church lands among the noblesse and they abstained from their wonted conspiracies for a while  the king occupied himself much in encouraging the persecution of witches but even that did not endear him to the preachers  in the assembly of march 1598 certain ministers were allowed to sit and vote in parliament  in 15981599 a privately printed book by james the basilicon doron came to the knowledge of the clergy it revealed his opinions on the right of kings to rule the church and on the tendency of the preachers to introduce a democracy with themselves as tribunes of the people a very fair definition of their policy  it was to stop them that he gradually introduced a bastard kind of bishops police to keep the pulpiteers in order  they were refusing in face of the kings licence to permit a company of english players to act in edinburgh for they took various powers into their hands  meanwhile jamess relations with england where elizabeth saw with dismay his victory over her allies his clergy were unfriendly  plots were encouraged against him but it is not probable that england was aware of the famous and mysterious conspiracy of the young earl of gowrie who was warmly welcomed by elizabeth on his return from padua by way of paris he had been summoned by bruce jamess chief clerical adversary and the kirk had high hopes of the son of the man of the raid of ruthven  he led the opposition to taxation for national defence in a convention of june july 1600  on august 5 in his own house at perth where james summoned thither by gowries younger brother had dined with him gowrie and his brother were slain by john ramsay a page to the king  this affair was mysterious  the preachers and especially bruce refused to accept jamess own account of the events at first and this was not surprising  gowrie was their one hope among the peers and the story which james told is so strange that nothing could be stranger or less credible except the various and manifestly mendacious versions of the gowrie party 156  jamess version of the occurrences must be as much as possible condensed and there is no room for the corroborating evidence of lennox and others as the king was leaving falkland to hunt a buck early on august 5 the master of ruthven who had ridden over from his brothers house in perth accosted him  the master declared that he had on the previous evening arrested a man carrying a pot of gold had said nothing to gowrie had locked up the man and his gold in a room and now wished james to come instantly and examine the fellow  the kings curiosity and cupidity were less powerful than his love of sport he would first kill his buck during the chase james told the story to lennox who corroborated ruthven sent a companion to inform his brother none the less when the king with a considerable following did appear at gowries house no preparation for his reception had been made  the master was now in a quandary he had no prisoner and no pot of gold during dinner gowrie was very nervous after it james and the master slipped upstairs together while gowrie took the gentlemen into the garden to eat cherries  ruthven finally led james into a turret off the long gallery he locked the door and pointing to a man in armour with a dagger said that he had the king at his will  the man however fell atrembling james made a speech and the master went to seek gowrie locking the door behind him  at or about this moment as was fully attested cranstoun a retainer of gowrie reported to him and the gentlemen that the king had ridden away  they all rushed to the gate where the porter to whom gowrie gave the lie swore that the king had not left the place  the gentlemen going to the stables passed under the turretwindow whence appeared the king red in the face bellowing treason  the gentlemen with lennox rushed upstairs and through the gallery but could not force open the door giving on the turret  but young ramsay had run up a narrow stair in the tower burst open the turretdoor opening on the stair found james struggling with the master wounded the master and pushed him downstairs  in the confusion while the kings falcon flew wildly about the turret till james set his foot on its chain the man with the dagger vanished  the master was slain by two of jamess attendants the earl rushing with four or five men up the turretstair fell in fight by ramsays rapier  lennox and his company now broke through the door between the gallery and the turret and all was over except a riotous assemblage of the towns folk  the man with the dagger had fled he later came in and gave himself up he was gowries steward his name was henderson it was he who rode with the master to falkland and back to perth to warn gowrie of jamess approach  he confessed that gowrie had then bidden him put on armour on a false pretence and the master had stationed him in the turret  the fact that henderson had arrived from falkland at gowries house by halfpast ten was amply proved yet gowrie had made no preparations for the royal visit  if henderson was not the man in the turret his sudden and secret flight from perth is unexplained  moreover robert oliphant ma said in private talk that the part of the man in the turret had some time earlier been offered to him by gowrie he refused and left the earls service  it is manifest that james could not have arranged this set of circumstances the thing is impossible therefore the two ruthvens plotted to get him into their hands early in the day and when he arrived late with a considerable train they endeavoured to send these gentlemen after the king by averring that he had ridden homewards  the dead ruthvens with their house were forfeited  among the preachers who refused publicly to accept jamess account of the events in gowries house on august 5 mr bruce was the most eminent and the most obstinate  he had on the day after the famous riot of december 1596 written to hamilton asking him to countenance as a chief nobleman the godly barons and others who had convened themselves at that time in the cause of the kirk  bruce admitted that he knew hamilton to be ambitious but hamiltons ambition did not induce him to appear as captain of a new congregation  the chief need of the ministers party was a leader among the great nobles  now in 1593 the young earl of gowrie had leagued himself with the madcap bothwell  in april 1594 gowrie bothwell and atholl had addressed the kirk asking her to favour and direct their enterprise  bothwell made an armed demonstration and failed gowrie then went abroad to padua and rome and apparently in 1600 mr bruce sailed to france for the calling he says of the master of gowriehe clearly means the earl of gowrie  the earl came wove his plot and perished  mr bruce therefore was averse to accepting jamess account of the affair at gowrie house  after a long series of negotiations bruce was exiled north of tay    union of the crowns   in 1600 james imposed three bishops on the kirk  early in 1601 broke out essexs rebellion of one day against elizabeth a futile attempt to imitate scottish methods as exhibited in the many raids against james essex had been intriguing with the scottish king but to what extent james knew of and encouraged his enterprise is unknown  he was on ill terms with cecil who in 1601 was dealing with several men that intended no good to james  cecil is said to have received a sufficient warning as to how james on ascending the english throne would treat him and he came to terms secretly with mar and kinloss the kings envoys to elizabeth  their correspondence is extant and proves that cecil at last was running the scottish course and making smooth the way for jamess accession  the correspondence begins in june 1601  very early on thursday march 24 1603 elizabeth went to her account and james received the news from sir robert carey who reached holyrood on the saturday night march 26  james entered london on may 6 and england was free from the fear of many years concerning a war for the succession  the catholics hoped for lenient usage disappointment led some desperate men to engage in the gunpowder plot  james was not more satisfactory to the puritans  encouraged by the fulsome adulation which grew up under the tudor dynasty and free from dread of personal danger james henceforth governed scotland with the pen as he said through the privy council this method of ruling the ancient kingdom endured till the union of 1707 and was fraught with many dangers  the king was no longer in touch with his subjects  his best action was the establishment of a small force of mounted constabulary which did more to put down the eternal homicides robberies and family feuds than all the sermons could achieve  the persons most notable in the privy council were seton later lord dunfermline hume created earl of dunbar and the kings advocate thomas hamilton later earl of haddington  bishops with spottiswoode the historian archbishop of glasgow sat in the privy council and their progressive elevation as hateful to the nobles as to the kirk was among the causes of the civil war under charles i  by craft and by illegal measures james continued to depress the kirk  a general assembly proclaimed by james for july 1604 in aberdeen was prorogued again unconstitutionally it was prorogued in july 1605  nineteen ministers disobeying a royal order appeared and constituted the assembly  joined by ten others they kept open the right of way  james insisted that the council should prosecute them they by fixing a new date for an assembly without royal consent and james by letting years pass without an assembly broke the charter of the kirk of 1592  the preachers when summoned to the trial declined the jurisdiction this was violently construed as treason and a jury threatened by the legal officers with secular and by the preachers with future spiritual punishment by a small majority condemned some of the ministers january 1606  this roused the wrath of all classes  james wished for more prosecutions the council in terror prevailed on him to desist  he continued to grant no assemblies till 1608 and would not allow caveats limiting the powers of bishops to be enforced  he summoned 1606 the two melvilles andrew and his nephew james to london where andrew bullied in his own violent style and was quite illegally first imprisoned and then banished to france  in december 1606 a convention of preachers was persuaded to allow the appointment of constant moderators to keep the presbyteries in order and then james recognised the convention as a general assembly  suspected ministers were confined to their parishes or locked up in blackness castle  in 1608 a general assembly was permitted the pleasure of excommunicating huntly  in 1610 an assembly established episcopacy and no excommunications not ratified by the bishop were allowed the only comfort of the godly was the violent persecution of catholics who were nosed out by the constant moderators excommunicated if they refused to conform confiscated and banished  james could succeed in these measures but his plan for uniting the two kingdoms into one great britain though supported by the wisdom and eloquence of bacon was frustrated by the jealousies of both peoples persons born after jamess accession the post nati were however admitted to equal privileges in either kingdom 1608  in 1610 james had two of his bishops and spottiswoode consecrated by three english bishops but he did not yet venture to interfere with the forms of presbyterian public worship  in 1610 james established two courts of high commission in 1615 united in one court to try offences in morals and religion  the archbishops presided laity and clergy formed the body of the court and it was regarded as vexatious and tyrannical  the same terms to be sure would now be applied to the interference of preachers and presbyteries with private life and opinion  by 1612 the king had established episcopacy which for one reason or another became equally hateful to the nobles the gentry and the populace  jamess motives were motives of police long experience had taught him the inconveniences of presbyterial government as it then existed in scotland  to a church organised in the presbyterian manner as it has been practised since 1689 james had originally at least no objection  but the combination of presbyterian hildebrandism with factions of the turbulent noblesse the alliance of the power of the keys with the sword and lance was inconsistent with the freedom of the state and of the individual  the absolutism of james says professor hume brown was forced upon him in large degree by the excessive claims of the presbyterian clergy  meanwhile the thievish border clans especially the armstrongs were assailed by hangings and banishments and ulster was planted by scottish settlers willing or reluctant attracted by promise of lands or planted out that they might not give trouble on the border  persecution of catholics was violent and in spring 1615 father ogilvie was hanged after very cruel treatment directed by archbishop spottiswoode  in this year the two ecclesiastical courts of high commission were fused into one and an assembly was coerced into passing what james called hotchpotch resolutions about changes in public worship  james wanted greater changes but deferred them till he visited scotland in 1617 when he was attended by the luckless figure of laud who went to a funeralin a surplice  james had many personal bickerings with preachers but his five main points the articles of perth of these the most detested were 1 communicants must kneel not sit at the communion 4 christmas easter and pentecost must be observed and 5 confirmation must be introduced were accepted by an assembly in 1618  they could not be enforced but were sanctioned by parliament in 1621  the day was called black saturday and omens were drawn by both parties from a thunderstorm which occurred at the time of the ratification of the articles of perth by parliament in edinburgh august 4 1621  by enforcing these articles james passed the limit of his subjects endurance  in their opinion as in knoxs to kneel at the celebration of the holy communion was an act of idolatry was baal worship and no pressure could compel them to kneel  the three great festivals of the christian church whether roman genevan or lutheran had no certain warrant in holy scripture but were rather repugnant to the word of god the king did not live to see the bloodshed and misery caused by his reckless assault on the liberties and consciences of his subjects he died on march 27 1625 just before the easter season in which it was intended to enforce his decrees  the ungainliness of jamess person his lack of courage on certain occasions he was by no means a constant coward and the feebleness of his limbs might be attributed to prenatal influences he was injured before he was born by the sufferings of his mother at the time of riccios murder  his deep dissimulation he learnt in his bitter childhood and harassed youth  his ingenious mind was trained to pedantry he did nothing worse and nothing more congenial to the cruel superstitions of his age than in his encouragement of witch trials and witch burnings promoted by the scottish clergy down to the early part of the eighteenth century  his plantation of ulster by scottish settlers has greatly affected history down to our own times while the most permanent result of the awards by which he stimulated the colonisation of nova scotia has been the creation of hereditary knighthoods or baronetcies  his encouragement of learning left its mark in the foundation of the towns college of edinburgh on the site of kirkofield the scene of his fathers murder  the southwestern highlands from lochaber to islay and cantyre were in his reign the scene of constant clan feuds and repressions resulting in the fall of the macdonalds and the rise of the campbell chief argyll to the perilous power later wielded by the marquis against charles i many of the sons of the dispossessed macdonalds driven into ireland were to constitute the nucleus of the army of montrose  in the orkneys and shetlands the constant turbulence of earl patrick and his family ended in the annexation of the islands to the crown 1612 and the earls execution 1615     chapter xxiv  charles i   the reign of charles i opened with every sign of the tempests which were to follow  england and scotland were both seething with religious fears and hatreds  both parties in england puritans and anglicans could be satisfied with nothing less than complete domination  in england the extreme puritans with their yearning after the genevan presbyterian discipline had been threatening civil war even under elizabeth  james had treated them with a high hand and a proud heart  under charles wedded to a jezebel a catholic wife henrietta maria the puritan hatred of such prelates as laud expressed itself in threats of murder while heavy fines and cruel mutilations were inflicted by the party in power  the protestant panic the fear of a violent restoration of catholicism in scotland never slumbered  in scotland catholics were at this time bitterly persecuted and believed that a presbyterian general massacre of them all was being organised  by the people the anglican bishops and the prayerbook were as much detested as priests and the mass  when charles placed six prelates on his privy council and recognised the archbishop of st andrews spottiswoode as first in precedence among his subjects the nobles were angry and jealous  charles would not do away with the infatuated articles of perth  james as he used to say had governed scotland by the pen through his privy council  charles knew much less than james of the temper of the scots among whom he had never come since his infancy and his privy council with six bishops was apt to be even more than commonly subservient  in scotland as in england the expenses of national defence were a cause of anger and the mismanagement of military affairs by the kings favourite buckingham increased the irritation  it was brought to a head in scotland by the act of revocation under which all church lands and crown lands bestowed since 1542 were to be restored to the crown this act once more united in opposition the nobles and the preachers since 1596 they had not been in harmony  in 1587 as we saw james vi had annexed much of the old ecclesiastical property to the crown but he had granted most of it to nobles and barons as temporal lordships  now by charles the temporal lords who held such lands were menaced the judges lords of session who would have defended their interests were removed from the privy council march 1626 and in august the temporal lords remonstrated with the king through deputations  in fact they took little harmredeeming their holdings at the rate of ten years purchase  the main result was that landowners were empowered to buy the tithes on their own lands from the multitude of titulars of tithes 1629 who had rapaciously and oppressively extorted these tenths of the harvest every year  the ministers had a safe provision at last secured on the tithes in scotland styled teinds but this did not reconcile most of them to bishops and to the articles of perth  several of the bishops were in fact latitudinarian or arminian in doctrine wanderers from the severity of knox and calvin  with them began perhaps the moderatism which later invaded the kirk though their ideal slumbered during the civil war to awaken again with the teaching of archbishop leighton under the restoration  meanwhile the nobles and gentry had been alarmed and mulcted and were ready to join hands with the kirk in its day of resistance  in june 1633 charles at last visited his ancient kingdom accompanied by laud  his subjects were alarmed and horrified by the sight of prelates in lawn sleeves candles in chapel and even a tapestry showing the crucifixion  to this the bishops are said to have bowedplain idolatry  in the parliament of june 18 the eight representatives of each estate who were practically allpowerful as lords of the articles were chosen not from each estate by its own members but on a method instituted or rather revived by james vi in 1609  the nobles made the choice from the bishops the bishops from the nobles and the elected sixteen from the barons and burghers  the twentyfour were all thus episcopally minded they drew up the bills and the bills were voted on without debate  the grant of supply made in these circumstances was liberal and jamess ecclesiastical legislation including the sanction of the rags of rome worn by the bishops was ratified  remonstrances from the ministers of the old kirk party were disregarded andthe thin end of the wedgethe english liturgy was introduced in the royal chapel of holyrood and in that of st salvators college st andrews where it has been read once on a funeral occasion in recent years  in 163435 on the information of archbishop spottiswoode lord balmerino was tried for treason because he possessed a supplication or petition which the lords of the minority in the late parliament had drawn up but had not presented  he was found guilty but spared the proceeding showed of what nature the bishops were and alienated and alarmed the populace and the nobles and gentry  a remonstrance in a manly spirit by drummond of hawthornden the poet was disregarded  in 1635 charles authorised a book of canons heralding the imposition of a liturgy which scarcely varied and when it varied was thought to differ for the worse from that of the church of england  by these canons the most nakedly despotic of innovations the preachers could not use their sword of excommunication without the assent of the bishops james vi had ever regarded with horror and dread the licence of conceived prayers spoken by the minister and believed to be extemporary or directly inspired  there is an old story that one minister prayed that james might break his leg certainly prayers for sanctified plagues on that prince were publicly offered at the will of the minister  even a very firm presbyterian the laird of brodie when he had once heard the anglican service in london confided to his journal that he had suffered much from the nonsense of conceived prayers  they were a dangerous weapon in charless opinion he was determined to abolish them rather that he might be free from the agitation of the pulpit than for reasons of ritual and to proclaim his own headship of the kirk of king christ  this in the opinion of the great majority of the preachers and populace was flat blasphemy an assumption of the crown honours of christ  the liturgy was an illmumbled mass the mass was idolatry and idolatry was a capital offence  however strange these convictions may appear they were essential parts of the national belief  yet with the most extreme folly charles acting like henry viii as his own pope thrust the canons and this liturgy upon the kirk and country  no sentimental arguments can palliate such open tyranny  the liturgy was to be used in st giles church the town kirk of edinburgh cleansed and restored by charles himself on july 23 1637 the result was a furious brawl begun by the women of all presbyterians the fiercest and it was said by men disguised as women  a gentleman was struck on the ear by a woman for the offence of saying amen and the famous jenny geddes is traditionally reported to have thrown her stool at the deans head  the service was interrupted the bishop was the mark of stones and the bishops war the civil war began in this brawl  james vi being on the spot had thoroughly quieted edinburgh after a more serious riot on december 17 1596  but charles was far away the city had not to fear the loss of the court and its custom as on the earlier occasion the removal of the council to linlithgow in october 1637 was a trifle and the council had to face a storm of petitions from all classes of the community  their prayer was that the liturgy should be withdrawn  from the country multitudes of all classes flocked into edinburgh and formed themselves into a committee of public safety the four tables containing sixteen persons  the tables now demanded the removal of the bishops from the privy council december 21 1637  the question was who were to govern the country the council or the tables  the logic of the presbyterians was not always consistent  the king must not force the liturgy on them but later their quarrel with him was that he would not at their desire force the absence of the liturgy on england  if the king had the right to inflict presbyterianism on england he had the right to thrust the liturgy on scotland of course he had neither one right nor the other  on february 19 1638 charless proclamation refusing the prayers of the supplication of december was read at stirling  nobles and people replied with protestations to every royal proclamation  foremost on the popular side was the young earl of montrose you will not rest said rothes a more sober leader till you be lifted up above the lave in three fathoms of rope  rothes was a true prophet but montrose did not die for the cause that did his green unknowing youth engage  the presbyterians now desired yearly general assemblies of which james vi had unlawfully robbed the kirk the enforcement of an old brieflived system of restrictions caveats on the bishops the abolition of the articles of perth and as always of the liturgy  if he granted all this charles might have had trouble with the preachers as james vi had of old  yet the demands were constitutional and in charless position he would have done well to assent  he was obstinate in refusal  the scots now fell upon the consideration of a band of union to be made legally says rothes their leader the chief of the house of leslie the family of norman leslie the slayer of cardinal beaton  now a band of this kind could not by old scots law be legally made such bands like those for the murder of riccio and of darnley and for many other enterprises were not smiled upon by the law  but in 1581 as we saw james vi had signed a covenant against popery its tenor was imitated in that of 1638 and there was added a general band for the maintenance of true religion presbyterianism and of the kings person  that part of the band was scarcely kept when the covenanting army surrendered charles to the english  they had vowed in their band to stand to the defence of our dread sovereign the kings majesty his person and authority  they kept this vow by hanging men who held the kings commission  the words as to defending the kings authority were followed by in the defence and preservation of the aforesaid true religion  this appears to mean that only a presbyterian king is to be defended  in any case the preachers assumed the right to interpret the covenant which finally led to the conquest of scotland by cromwell  as the covenant was made between god and the covenanters on ancient hebrew precedent it was declared to be binding on all succeeding generations had scotland resisted tyranny without this wouldbe biblical pettifogging covenant her condition would have been the more gracious  the signing of the band began at edinburgh in greyfriars churchyard on february 28 1638  this covenant was a most potent instrument for the day but the fruits thereof were blood and tears and desolation for fiftyone years common sense did not come to her own again  in 1689 the covenant was silently dropped when the kirk was restored  this twoedged insatiable sword was drawn great multitudes signed with enthusiasm and they who would not sign were of course persecuted  as they said it looked not like a thing approved of god which was begun and carried on with fury and madness and obtruded on people with threatenings tearing of clothes and drawing of blood  resistance to the kingif need were armed resistancewas necessary was laudable but the terms of the covenant were in the highest degree impolitic and unstatesmanlike  the country was handed over to the preachers the scots as their great leader argyll was to discover were distracted men in distracted times  charles wavered and sent down the marquis of hamilton to represent his waverings  the marquis was as unsettled as his predecessor arran in the minority of queen mary  he dared not promulgate the proclamations he dared not risk civil war he knew that charles who said he was ready was unprepared in his mutinous english kingdom  he granted at last a general assembly and a free parliament and produced another covenant the kings covenant which of course failed to thwart that of the country  the assembly at glasgow november 21 1638 including noblemen and gentlemen as elders was necessarily revolutionary and needlessly riotous and profane  it arraigned and condemned the bishops in their absence  hamilton as royal commissioner dissolved the assembly which continued to sit  the meeting was in the cathedral where says a sincere covenanter baillie whose letters are a valuable source our rascals without shame in great numbers made din and clamour  all the unconstitutional ecclesiastical legislation of the last forty years was rescindedas all the new presbyterian legislation was to be rescinded at the restoration  some bishops were excommunicated the rest were deposed  the press was put under the censorship of the fanatical lawyer johnston of waristoun clerk of the assembly  on december 20 the assembly which sat on after hamilton dissolved it broke up  among the covenanters were to be reckoned the earl of argyll later the only marquis of his house and the earl later marquis of montrose  they did not stand long together  the scottish revolution produced no man at once great and successful but in montrose it had one man of genius who gave his life for honours sake in argyll an astute man not physically courageous whose timidity in the field was equalled by his timidity in the council says mr gardiner  in spring 1639 war began  charles was to move in force on the border the fleet was to watch the coasts hamilton with some 5000 men was to join hands with huntly both men were wavering and incompetent antrim from north ireland was to attack and contain argyll ruthven was to hold edinburgh castle  but alexander leslie took that castle for the covenanters they took dumbarton they fortified leith argyll ravaged huntlys lands montrose and leslie occupied aberdeen and their party in circumstances supposed to be discreditable to montrose carried huntly to edinburgh  the evidence is confused  was huntly unwilling to go charles york april 23 1639 calls him feeble and false  mr gardiner says that in this case and in this alone montrose stooped to a mean action  hamilton merely dawdled and did nothing montrose had entered aberdeen june 19 and then came news of negotiations between the king and the covenanters  as charles approached from the south alexander leslie a continental veteran very many of the covenants officers were dugald dalgettys from the foreign wars occupied dunse law with a numerous army in great difficulties as to supplies  a natural mind might despair wrote waristoun who was brought low before god indeed  leslie was in a strait but on the other side so was charles for a reconnaissance of leslies position was repulsed the king lacked money and supplies neither side was of a high fighting heart and offers to negotiate came from the king informally  the scots sent in a supplication and on june 18 signed a treaty which was a mere futile truce  there were to be a new assembly and a new parliament in august and september  charles should have fought if he fell he would fall with honour and if he survived defeat all england behoved to have risen in revenge says the covenanting letterwriter baillie later principal of glasgow university  the covenanters at this time could not have invaded england could not have supported themselves if they did and were far from being harmonious among themselves  the defeat of charles at this moment would have aroused english pride and united the country  charles set out from berwick for london on july 29 leaving many fresh causes of quarrel behind him  charles supposed that he was merely giving way for the present when he accepted the ratification by the new assembly of all the acts of that of 1638  he never had a later chance to recover his ground  the new assembly made the privy council pass an act rendering signature of the covenant compulsory on all men the new freedom is worse than the old slavery a lookeron remarked  the parliament discussed the method of electing the lords of the articlesa method which in fact though of prime importance had varied and continued to vary in practice  argyll protested that the constitutional course was for each estate to elect its own members  montrose was already suspected of being influenced by charles  charles refused to call episcopacy unlawful or to rescind the old acts establishing it  traquair as commissioner dissolved the parliament later charles refused to meet envoys sent from scotland who were actually trying as their party also tried to gain french mediation or assistancehelp from idolaters  in spring 1640 the scots by an instrument called the blind band imposed taxation for military purposes while charles in england called the short parliament to provide supply  the parliament refused and was prorogued words used by strafford about the use of the army in ireland to suppress scotland were hoarded up against him  the scots parliament though the king had prorogued it met in june despite the opposition of montrose  the parliament when it ceased to meet appointed a standing committee of some forty members of all ranks including montrose and his friends lord napier and stirling of keir  argyll refused to be a member but acted on a commission of fire and sword to root out of the country the northern recusants against the covenant  it was now that argyll burned lord ogilvys bonny house of airlie and forthes the cattle were driven into his own country all this against and perhaps in consequence of the intercession of ogilvys friend and neighbour montrose  meanwhile the scots were intriguing with discontented english peers who could only give sympathy saville however forged a letter from six of them inviting a scottish invasion  there was a movement for making argyll practically dictator in the north montrose thwarted it and in august while charles with a reluctant and disorderly force was marching on york montrose at cumbernauld the house of the earl of wigtoun made a secret band with the earls marischal wigtoun home atholl mar perth boyd galloway and others for their mutual defence against the scheme of dictatorship for argyll  on august 20 montrose the foremost forded tweed and led his regiment into england  on august 30 almost unopposed the scots entered newcastle having routed a force which met them at newburnontyne  they again pressed their demands on the king simultaneously twelve english peers petitioned for a parliament and the trial of the kings ministers  charles gave way  at ripon scottish and english commissioners met the scots received brotherly assistance in money and supplies a daily 850 pounds and stayed where they were while the long parliament met in november and in april 1641 condemned the great strafford laud soon shared his doom  on august 10 the demands of the scots were granted as a sympathetic historian writes they had lived for a year at free quarters and recrossed the border with the handsome sum of 200000 pounds to their credit  during the absence of the army the kirk exhibited symptoms not favourable to its own peace  amateur theologians held private religious gatherings which it was feared tended towards the heresy of the english independents and to the break up of the whole kirk some of whose representatives forbade these conventicles while the rigid sort asserted that the conventiclers were esteemed the godly of the land  an act of the general assembly was passed against the meetings we observe that here are the beginnings of strife between the most godly and the rather moderately pious  the secret of montroses cumbernauld band had come to light after november 1640 nothing worse at the moment befell than the burning of the band by the committee of estates to whom argyll referred the matter on may 21 1641 the committee was disturbed for montrose was collecting evidence as to the words and deeds of argyll when he used his commission of fire and sword at the bonny house of airlie and in other places montrose had spoken of the matter to a preacher he to another and the news reached the committee  montrose had learned from a prisoner of argyll stewart the younger of ladywell that argyll had held counsels to discuss the deposition of the king  ladywell produced to the committee his written statement that argyll had spoken before him of these consultations of lawyers and divines  he was placed in the castle and was so worked on that he cleared argyll and confessed that advised by montrose he had reported argylls remarks to the king  papers with hints and names in cypher were found in possession of the messenger  the whole affair is enigmatic in any case ladywell was hanged for leasingmaking spreading false reports an offence not previously capital and montrose with his friends was imprisoned in the castle doubtless he had meant to accuse argyll before parliament of treason  on july 27 1641 being arraigned before parliament he said my resolution is to carry with me fidelity and honour to the grave  he lay in prison when the king vainly hoping for support against the english parliament visited edinburgh august 14november 17 1641  charles was now servile to his scottish parliament accepting an act by which it must consent to his nominations of officers of state  hamilton with his brother lanark had courted the alliance and lived in the intimacy of argyll  on october 12 charles told the house a very strange story  on the previous day hamilton had asked leave to retire from court in fear of his enemies  on the day of the kings speaking hamilton argyll and lanark had actually retired  on october 22 from their retreat the brothers said that they had heard of a conspiracy by nobles and others in the kings favour to cut their throats  the evidence is very confused and contradictory hamilton and argyll were said to have collected a force of 5000 men in the town and on october 5 such a gathering was denounced in a proclamation  charles in vain asked for a public inquiry into the affair before the whole house  he now raised some of his opponents a step in the peerage argyll became a marquis and montrose was released from prison  on october 28 charles announced the untoward news of an irish rising and massacre  he was of course accused of having caused it and the massacre was in turn the cause of or pretext for the shooting and hanging of irish prisonersmen and womenin scotland during the civil war  on november 18 he left scotland for ever  the events in england of the spring in 1642 the attempted arrest of the five members january 4 the retreat of the queen to france charless retiral to york indicated civil war and the king set up his standard at nottingham on august 22  the covenanters had received from charles all that they asked they had no quarrel with him but they argued that if he were victorious in england he would use his strength and withdraw his concessions to scotland  sir walter scott leaves it to casuists to decide whether one contracting party is justified in breaking a solemn treaty upon the suspicion that in future contingencies it might be infringed by the other  he suggests that to the needy nobles and dugald dalgettys of the covenant the good pay and free quarters and handsome sums of england were an irresistible temptation while the preachers thought they would be allowed to set up the golden candlestick of presbytery in england legend of montrose chapter i  of the two the preachers were the more grievously disappointed  a general assembly of julyaugust 1642 was as usual concerned with politics for politics and religion were inextricably intermixed  the assembly appointed a standing commission to represent it and the powers of the commission were of so high a strain that to some it is terrible already says the covenanting letterwriter baillie  a letter from the kirk was carried to the english parliament which acquiesced in the abolition of episcopacy  in november 1642 the english parliament unsuccessful in war appealed to scotland for armed aid in december charles took the same course  the commission of the general assembly and the body of administrators called conservators of the peace overpowered the privy council put down a petition of montroses party who declared that they were bound by the covenant to defend the king and would obviously arm on the side of the english parliament if england would adopt presbyterian government  they held a convention of the estates june 22 1643 they discovered a popish plot for an attack on argylls country by the macdonalds in ireland once driven from kintyre by the campbells and now to be led by young colkitto  while thus excited they received in the general assembly august 7 a deputation from the english parliament and now was framed a new band between the english parliament and scotland  it was an alliance the solemn league and covenant by which episcopacy was to be abolished and religion established according to the word of god  to the covenanters this phrase meant that england would establish presbyterianism but they were disappointed  the ideas of the independents such as cromwell were almost as much opposed to presbytery as to episcopacy and though the covenanters took the pay and fought the battles of the parliament against their king they never received what they had meant to stipulate forthe establishment of presbytery in england  far from that cromwell like james vi was to deprive them of their ecclesiastical palladium the general assembly  foreseeing nothing the scots were delighted when the english accepted the new band  their army under alexander leslie earl of leven now too old for his post crossed tweed in january 1644  they might never have crossed had charles in the autumn of 1643 listened to montrose and allowed him to attack the covenanters in scotland  in december 1643 hamilton and lanark who had opposed montroses views and confirmed the king in his waverings came to him at oxford  montrose refused to serve with them rather he would go abroad and hamilton was imprisoned on charges of treason in fact he had been doubleminded inconstant and incompetent  montroses scheme implied clan warfare the use of exiled macdonalds who were catholics against the campbells  the obvious objections were very strong but needs must when the devil drives the hanoverian kings employed foreign soldiers against their subjects in 1715 and 1745 but the macdonalds were subjects of king charles  hamiltons brother lanark escaped and now frankly joined the covenanters  montrose was promoted to a marquisate and received the royal commission as lieutenantgeneral february 1644 which alienated old huntly chief of the gordons who now and again divided and paralysed that gallant clan  montrose rode north where in february 1644 old leslie with twenty regiments of foot three thousand horse and many guns was besieging newcastle  with him was the prototype of scotts dugald dalgetty sir james turner who records examples of leslies senile incompetency  leslie at least forced the marquis of newcastle to a retreat and a movement of montrose on dumfries was paralysed by the cowardice or imbecility of the scottish magnates on the western border he returned took morpeth was summoned by prince rupert and reached him the day after the disaster of marston moor july 2 1644 from which buccleuchs covenanting regiment ran without stroke of sword while alexander leslie also fled carrying news of his own defeat  it appears that the scottish horse under david leslie were at marston moor as always the pick of their army  rupert took over montroses men and the great marquis disguised as a groom rode hard to the house of a kinsman near tay between perth and dunkeld  alone and comfortless in a little wood montrose met a man who was carrying the fiery cross and summoning the country to resist the irish scots of alastair macdonald colkitto who had landed with a force of 1500 musketeers in argyll and was believed to be descending on atholl pursued by seaforth and argyll and faced by the men of badenoch the two armies 181 were confronting each other when montrose in plaid and kilt approached colkitto and showed him his commission  instantly the two opposed forces combined into one and with 2500 men some armed with bows and arrows and others having only one charge for each musket montrose began his year of victories  the temptation to describe in detail his extraordinary series of successes and of unexampled marches over snowclad and pathless mountains must be resisted  the mobility and daring of montroses irregular and capricious levies with his own versatile military genius and the heroic valour of colkitto enabled him to defeat a large covenanting force at tippermuir near perth here he had but his 2500 men september 1 to repeat his victory at aberdeen 182 september 13 to evade and discourage argyll who retired to inveraray to winter in and ravage argylls country and to turn on his tracks from a northern retreat and destroy the campbells at inverlochy where argyll looked on from his galley february 2 1645  general baillie a trained soldier took the command of the covenanting levies and regular troops red coats and nearly surprised montrose in dundee  by a retreat showing even more genius than his victories he escaped appeared on the northeast coast and scattered a covenanting force under hurry at auldearn near inverness may 9 1645  such victories as montroses were more than counterbalanced by cromwells defeat of rupert and charles at naseby june 14 1645 while presbytery suffered a blow from cromwells demand that the english parliament should grant freedom of conscience not for anglican or catholic of course but for religions nonpresbyterian  the bloody sectaries as the presbyterians called cromwells independents were now masters of the field never would the blue banner of the covenant be set up south of tweed  meanwhile general baillie marched against montrose who outmanoeuvred him all over the eastern highlands and finally gave him battle at alford on the don  montrose had not here colkitto and the western clans but his gordon horse his irish the farquharsons and the badenoch men were triumphantly successful  unfortunately lord gordon was slain he alone could bring out and lead the clan of huntly  only by joining hands with charles could montrose do anything decisive  the king hoping for no more than a death in the field with honour and a good conscience pushed as far north as doncaster where he was between poyntzs army and a great cavalry force led by david leslie from hereford to launch against montrose  the hero snatched a final victory  he had but a hundred horse but he had colkitto and the flower of the fighting clans including the invincible macleans  baillie in command of new levies of some 10000 men was thwarted by a committee of argyll and other noble amateurs  he met the enemy south of forth at kilsyth between stirling and glasgow  the fiery argyll made baillie desert an admirable positionmontrose was on the plain baillie was on the heightsand expose his flank by a march across montroses front  the macleans and macdonalds on the lower slope of the hill without orders saw their chance and racing up a difficult glen plunged into the covenanting flank  meanwhile the more advanced part of the covenanting force were driving back some gordons from a hill on montroses left who were rescued by a desperate charge of aboynes handful of horse among the red coats airlie charged with the ogilvies the advanced force of the covenant was routed and the macleans and macdonalds completed the work they had begun august 15  few of the unmounted covenanters escaped from kilsyth and argyll taking boat in the forth hurried to newcastle where david leslie coming north obtained infantry regiments to back his 4000 cavalry  in a year montrose with forces so irregular and so apt to go home after every battle had actually cleared militant covenanters out of scotland but the end had come  he would not permit the sack of glasgow  three thousand clansmen left him colkitto went away to harry kintyre  aboyne and the gordons rode home on some private pique and montrose relied on men whom he had already proved to be broken reeds the homes and kers roxburgh of the border and the futile and timid traquair  when he came among them they forsook him and fled on september 10 at kelso sir robert spottiswoode recognised the desertion and the danger  meanwhile leslie with an overpowering force of seasoned soldiers horse and foot marched with argyll not to edinburgh but down gala to tweed while montrose had withdrawn from kelso up ettrick to philiphaugh on the left of ettrick within a mile of selkirk  he had but 500 irish who entrenched themselves and an uncertain number of mounted border lairds with their servants and tenants  charteris of hempsfield who had been scouting reported that leslie was but two or three miles distant at sunderland hall where tweed and ettrick meet but the news was not carried to montrose who lay at selkirk  at breakfast on september 13 montrose learned that leslie was attacking  what followed is uncertain in its details  a socalled contemporary ballad is incredibly impossible in its anachronisms and is modern  in this egregious doggerel we are told that a veteran who had fought at solway moss a century earlier and at cursed dunbar a few years later or under edward i advised leslie to make a turning movement behind linglie hill  this is not evidence  though leslie may have made such a movement he describes his victory as very easy and so it should have been as montrose had only the remnant of his antrim men and a rabble of reluctant border recruits  a news letter from haddington of september 16 represents the cavaliers as making a good fight  the mounted border lairds galloped away  most of the irish fell fighting the rest were massacred whether after promise of quarter or not is disputed  their captured women were hanged in cold blood some months later  montrose the napiers and some forty horse either cut their way through or evaded leslies overpowering cavalry and galloped across the hills of yarrow to the tweed  he had lost only the remnant of his scotoirish but the gordons when montrose was presently menacing glasgow were held back by huntly and colkitto pursued his private adventures  montrose had been deserted by the clans and lured to ruin by the perfidious promises of the border lords and lairds  the aim of his strategy had been to relieve the royalists of england by a diversion that would deprive the parliamentarians of their paid scottish allies and what man might do montrose had done  after his first victory montrose an excommunicated man fought under an offer of 1500 pounds for his murder and the covenanters welcomed the assassin of his friend lord kilpont  the result of montroses victories was hostility between the covenanting army in england and the english who regarded them as expensive and inefficient  indeed they seldom save for the command of david leslie displayed military qualities and later were invariably defeated when they encountered the english under cromwell and lambert  montrose never slew a prisoner but the convention at st andrews in november 1645 sentenced to death their cavalier prisoners lord ogilvy escaped disguised in his sisters dress and they ordered the hanging of captives and of the women who had accompanied the irish  it was certain of the clergy who pressed for the extremest measures 186a   they had revived the barbarous belief retained in the law of ancient greece that the land had been polluted by and must be cleansed by blood under penalty of divine wrath  as even the covenanting baillie wrote to this day no man in england has been executed for bearing arms against the parliament  the preachers argued that to keep the promises of quarter which had been given to the prisoners was to violate the oath of the covenant 186b  the prime object of the english opponents of the king was now to hustle the scots out of england 187  meanwhile charles not captured but hopeless was negotiating with all the parties and ready to yield on every point except that of forcing presbytery on englanda matter which said montereuil the french ambassador did not concern them but their neighbours  charles finally trusted the scots with his person and the question is had he or had he not assurance that he would be well received  if he had any assurance it was merely verbal a shadow of a security wrote montereuil  charles was valuable to the scots only as a pledge for the payment of their arrears of wages  there was much chicanery and shuffling on both sides and probably there were misconceptions on both sides  a letter of montereuil april 26 1646 convinced charles that he might trust the scots they verbally promised safety honour and conscience but refused to sign a copy of their words  charles trusted them rode out of oxford joined them at southwell and says sir james turner who was present was commanded by lothian to sign the covenant and barbarously used  they took charles to newcastle denying their assurance to him  with unblushing falsehood says mr gardiner they in other respects lied to the english parliament  on may 19 charles bade montrose leave the country which he succeeded in doing despite the treacherous endeavours of his enemies to detain him till his day of safety august 31 was passed  the scots of the army were in a quandary  the preachers their masters would not permit them to bring to scotland an uncovenanted king  they could not stay penniless in england  for 200000 pounds down and a promise never kept of a similar sum later they left charles in english hands with some assurances for his safety and early in february 1647 crossed tweed with their thirtysix cartloads of money  the act was hateful to very many scots but the estates under the command of the preachers had refused to let the king while uncovenanted cross into his native kingdom and to bring him meant war with england  but that must ensue in any case  the hope of making england presbyterian as under the solemn league and covenant had already perished  leslie with the part of the army still kept up chased colkitto and at dunavertie under the influence of nevoy a preacher put 300 irish prisoners to the sword  the parties in scotland were now 1 the kirk argyll the two leslies and most of the commons 2 hamilton lanark and lauderdale who had no longer anything to fear as regards their estates from charles or from bishops and who were ashamed of his surrender to the english 3 royalists in general  with charles december 27 1647 in his prison at carisbrooke lauderdale loudoun and lanark made a secret treaty the engagement which they buried in the garden for if it were discovered the independents of the army would have attacked scotland  an assembly of the scots estates on march 3 1648 had a large majority of nobles gentry and many burgesses in favour of aiding the captive king on the other side argyll was backed by the omnipotent commission of the general assembly and by the full force of prayers and sermons  the letterwriter baillie now deemed that it were for the good of the world that churchmen did meddle with ecclesiastical affairs only  the engagers insisted on establishing presbytery in england which neither satisfied the kirk nor the cavaliers and independents  nothing more futile could have been devised  the estates in may began to raise an army the preachers denounced them there was a battle between armed communicants of the preachers party and the soldiers of the state at mauchline  invading england on july 8 hamilton had lambert and cromwell to face him and left argyll the preachers and their slashing communicants in his rear  lanark had vainly urged that the west country fanatics should be crushed before the border was crossed  by a march worthy of montrose across the fells into lanarkshire cromwell reached preston cut in between the northern parts of hamiltons army defeated the english royalists and langdale and cut to pieces or captured the scots disunited as their generals were at wigan and warrington august 1719  hamilton was taken and was decapitated later  the force that recrossed the border consisted of such mounted men as escaped with the detachment of monro which had not joined hamilton  the godly in scotland rejoiced at the defeat of their army the levies of the western shires of ayr renfrew and lanark occupied edinburgh argyll and the kirk party were masters and when cromwell arrived in edinburgh early in october he was entertained at dinner by argyll  the left wing of the covenant was now allied with the independentsthe deadly foes of presbytery  to the ordinary mind this looks like a new breach of the covenant that impossible treaty with omnipotence  charles had written that the divisions of parties were probably gods way to punish them for their many rebellions and perfidies  the punishment was now beginning in earnest and the alliance of extreme covenanters with bloody sectaries could not be maintained  yet historians admire the statesmanship of argyll  if the edge which the sword of the covenant turned against the english enemies of presbytery were blunted the edge that smote covenanters less extreme than argyll and the preachers was whetted afresh  in the estates of january 5 1649 argyll whose party had a large majority and the fanatical johnston of waristoun who made private covenants with jehovah demanded disenabling acts against all who had in any degree been tainted by the engagement for the rescue of the king  the engagers were divided into four classes who were rendered incapable by the act of classes of holding any office civil or military  this act deprived the country of the services of thousands of men just at the moment when the english army the independents argylls allies were holding the trial of charles i and in defiance of timid remonstrances from the scottish commissioners in england cut off that comely head january 30 1649 which meant war with scotland    scotland and charles ii   this was certain for on february 5 on the news of the deed done at whitehall the estates proclaimed charles ii as scottish kingif he took the covenant  by an ingenious intrigue argyll allowed lauderdale and lanark whom the estates had intended to arrest to escape to holland where charles was residing and their business was to bring that uncovenanted prince to sign the covenant and to overcome the influence of montrose who with clarendon of course resisted such a trebly dishonourable act of perjured hypocrisy  during the whole struggle since montrose took the kings side he had been thwarted by the hamiltons  they invariably wavered now they were for a futile policy of dishonour in which they involved their young king argyll and scotland montrose stood for honour and no covenant argyll the hamiltons lauderdale and the majority of the preachers stood for the covenant with dishonour and perjury the left wing of the preachers stood for the covenant but not for its dishonourable and foresworn acceptance by charles  as a covenanter charles ii would be the official foe of the english independents and army scotland would need every sword in the kingdom and the kingdoms best general montrose yet the act of classes under the dictation of the preachers rejected every man tainted with participation in or approval of the engagementor of neglecting family prayers  charles in fact began february 22 by appointing montrose his lieutenantgovernor and captaingeneral in scotland though lauderdale and lanark abate not an ace of their damned covenant in all their discourses wrote hyde  the dispute between montrose on the side of honour and that of lanark lauderdale and other scottish envoys ended asgiven the character of charles ii and his destitutionit must end charles january 22 1650 despatched montrose to fight for him in scotland and sent him the garter  montrose knew his doom he replied with the more alacrity shall i abandon still my life to search my death for the interests of your majestys honour and service  he searched his death and soon he found it  on may 1 charles by the treaty of breda vowed to sign the covenant a week earlier montrose not joined by the mackenzies had been defeated by strachan at carbisdale on the south of the kyle opposite invershin in sutherlandshire  he was presently captured and crowned a glorious life of honour by a more glorious death on the gibbet may 21  he had kept his promise he had searched his death he had loyally defended like jeanne darc a disloyal king he had carried fidelity and honour with him to the grave  his body was mutilated his limbs were exposedthey now lie in st giles church edinburgh where is his beautiful monument  montroses last words to charles march 26 from kirkwall implored that prince to be just to himselfnot to perjure himself by signing the covenant  the voice of honour is not always that of worldly wisdom but events proved that charles and scotland could have lost nothing and must have gained much had the king listened to montrose  he submitted we saw to commissioners sent to him from scotland  says one of these gentlemen he    sinfully complied with what we most sinfully pressed upon him    our sin was more than his  while his subjects in scotland were executing his loyal servants taken prisoners in montroses last defeat charles crossed the sea signing the covenants on board ship and landed at the mouth of spey  what he gained by his dishonour was the guilt of perjury and the consequent distrust of the wilder but more honest covenanters who knew that he had perjured himself and deemed his reception a cause of divine wrath and disastrous judgments  next he was separated from most of his false friends who had urged him to his guilt and from all royalists and he was not allowed to be with his army which the preachers kept purging of all who did not come up to their standard of sanctity  their hopeful scheme was to propitiate the deity and avert wrath by purging out officers of experience while filling up their places with godly but incompetent novices in war ministers sons clerks and such other sanctified creatures  this final and fatal absurdity was the result of playing at being the israel described in the early historic books of the old testament a policy initiated by knox in spite of the humorous protests of lethington  for the surer purging of that achan charles and to conciliate the party who deemed him the greatest cause of wrath of all the king had to sign a false and disgraceful declaration that he was afflicted in spirit before god because of the impieties of his father and mother  he was helpless in the hands of argyll david leslie and the rest he knew they would desert him if he did not sign and he yielded august 16  meanwhile cromwell with lambert monk 16000 foot and horse and a victualling fleet had reached musselburgh near edinburgh by july 28  david leslie very artfully evaded every attempt to force a fight but hung about him in all his movements  cromwell was obliged to retreat for lack of supplies in a devastated country and on september 1 reached dunbar by the coast road  leslie marching parallel along the hillridges occupied doonhill and secured a long deep and steep ravine the peaths near cockburnspath barring cromwells line of march  on september 2 the controlling clerical committee was still busily purging and depleting the scottish army  the night of september 2 3 was very wet the officers deserted their regiments to take shelter says leslie himself we might as easily have beaten them as we did james graham at philiphaugh if the officers had stayed by their own troops and regiments  several witnesses and cromwell himself asserted that owing to the insistence of the preachers leslie moved his men to the lower slopes on the afternoon of september 2  the lord hath delivered them into our hands cromwell is reported to have said  they now occupied a position where the banks of the lower broxburn were flat and assailable not steep and forming a strong natural moat as on the higher level  all night cromwell rode along and among his regiments of horse biting his lip till the blood ran down his chin  leslie thought to surprise cromwell cromwell surprised leslie crossed the broxburn on the low level before dawn and drove into the scots who were all unready the matches of their muskets being wet and unlighted  the centre made a good stand but a flank charge by english cavalry cut up the scots foot and leslie fled with the nobles gentry and mounted men  in killed wounded and prisoners the scots are said to have lost 14000 men a manifest exaggeration  it was an utter defeat  surely wrote cromwell it is probable the kirk has done her do  the kirk thought not purging must go on nobody must blame the covenant neglect of family prayers was selected as one cause of the defeat strachan and ker two extreme whigamores of the left wing of the godly went to raise a western force that would neither acknowledge charles nor join cromwell who now took edinburgh castle  charles was reduced by argyll to make to him the most slavish promises including the payment of 40000 pounds the part of the price of charles i which argyll had not yet touched  on october 4 charles made the start he fled to the royalists of angusogilvy and airlie he was caught brought back and preached at then came fighting between the royalists and the estates  middleton a good soldier atholl and others declared that they must and would fight for scotland though they were purged out by the preachers  the estates november 4 gave them an indemnity  on this point the kirk split into twain the wilder men led by the rev james guthrie refused reconciliation the remonstrants the less fanatical would consent to it on terms the resolutioners  the committee of estates dared to resist the remonstrants even the commissioners of the general assembly cannot be against the raising of all fencible personsand at last adopted the attitude of all sensible persons  by may 21 1651 the estates rescinded the insane act of classes but the strife between clerical remonstrants and resolutioners persisted till after the restoration the remonstrants being later named protesters  charles had been crowned at scone on january 1 again signing the covenants  leslie now occupied stirling avoiding an engagement  in july while a general assembly saw the strife of the two sects came news that lambert had crossed the forth at queensferry and defeated a scots force at inverkeithing where the macleans fell almost to a man monk captured a number of the general assembly and as cromwell moving to perth could now assail leslie and the main scottish force at stirling they by a desperate resolution with 4000 horse and 9000 foot invaded england by the west marches laughing says one of them at the ridiculousness of our own condition  on september 1 monk stormed and sacked dundee as montrose sacked aberdeen but if he made a massacre like that by edward i at berwick history is lenient to the crime  on august 22 charles with his army reached worcester whither cromwell marched with a force twice as great as that of the king  worcester was a sedan charles could neither hold it nor though he charged gallantly could he break through cromwells lines  before nightfall on september 3 charles was a fugitive he had no army hamilton was slain middleton and david leslie with thousands more were prisoners  monk had already captured at alyth august 28 the whole of the government the committee of estates and had also caught some preachers including james sharp later archbishop of st andrews  england had conquered scotland at last after twelve years of government by preachers acting as interpreters of the covenant between scotland and jehovah     chapter xxv  conquered scotland   during the nine years of the english military occupation of scotland everything was merely provisional nothing decisive could occur  in the first place october 1651 eight english commissioners including three soldiers monk lambert and deane undertook the administration of the conquered country  they announced tolerance in religion except for catholicism and anglicanism of course and during their occupation the english never wavered on a point so odious to the kirk  the english rulers also as much as they could protected the women and men whom the lairds and preachers smelled out and tortured and burned for witchcraft by way of compensation for the expenses of war all the estates of men who had sided with charles were confiscated  taxation also was heavy  on four several occasions attempts were made to establish the union of the two countries scotland finally was to return thirty members to sit in the english parliament  but as that parliament under cromwell was subject to strange and sudden changes and as the scottish representatives were usually men sold to the english side the experiment was not promising  in its first stage it collapsed with cromwells dismissal of the long parliament on april 20 1653  argyll meanwhile had submitted retaining his estates august 1652 but of five garrisons in his country three were recaptured not without his goodwill by the highlanders and in these events began monks aversion finally fatal to the marquis as a man whom none could trust and in whom finally nobody trusted  an english commission of justice established in may 1652 was confessedly more fair and impartial than any scotland had known which was explained by the fact that the english judges were kinless loons northern cavaliers were relieved by monks forbidding civil magistrates to outlaw and plunder persons lying under presbyterian excommunication and sanitary measures did something to remove from edinburgh the ancient reproach of filth for the time  while the protesters and resolutioners kept up their quarrel the protesters claiming to be the only genuine representatives of kirk and covenant the general assembly of the resolutioners was broken up july 21 1653 by lilburne with a few soldiers and henceforth the kirk having no general assembly was less capable of promoting civil broils  lilburne suspected that the assembly was in touch with new stirrings towards a rising in the highlands to lead which charles had in 1652 promised to send middleton who had escaped from an english prison as general  it was always hard to find any one under whom the great chiefs would serve and glencairn with kenmure was unable to check their jealousies  charles heard that argyll would appear in arms for the crown when he deemed the occasion good meanwhile his heir lord lorne would join the rising  he did so in july 1653 under the curse of argyll who by letters to lilburne and monk and by giving useful information to the english fatally committed himself as treasonable to the royal cause examples of his conduct were known to glencairn who communicated them to charles  at the end of february 1654 middleton arrived in sutherland to head the insurrection but monk chased the small and disunited force from county to county and in july morgan defeated and scattered its remnants at loch garry just south of dalnaspidal  the armstrongs and other border clans who had been mosstrooping in their ancient way were also reduced and new fortresses and garrisons bridled the fighting clans of the west  with cromwell as protector in 1654 free trade with england was offered to the scots with reduced taxation an attempt to legislate for the union failed  in 16551656 a council of state and a commission of justice included two or three scottish members and burghs were allowed to elect magistrates who would swear loyalty to cromwell  cromwell died on the day of his fortunate star september 3 1658 and twentyone members for scotland sat in richard cromwells parliament  when that was dissolved and when the rump was reinstated a new bill of union was introduced and by reason of the provisions for religious toleration a thing absolutely impious in presbyterian eyes was delayed till october 1659 the rump was sent to its account  conventions of burghs and shires were now held by monk who leading his army of occupation south in january 1660 left the resolutioners and protesters standing at gaze as hostile as ever awaiting what thing should befall  both parties still cherished the covenants and so long as these documents were held to be for ever binding on all generations so long as the kings authority was to be resisted in defence of these treaties with omnipotence it was plain that in scotland there could neither be content nor peace  for twentyeight years during a generation of profligacy and turmoil cruelty and corruption the kirk and country were to reap what they had sown in 1638     chapter xxvi  the restoration   there was dancing and derray in scotland among the laity when the king came to his own again  the darkest page in the national history seemed to have been turned the conquering english were gone with their abominable tolerance their craze for soap and water their aversion to witchburnings  the nobles and gentry would recover their lands and compensation for their losses there would be offices to win and the spoils of office  it seems that in scotland none of the lessons of misfortune had been learned  since january the chiefs of the milder party of preachers the resolutionersthey who had been reconciled with the engagerswere employing the rev james sharp who had been a prisoner in england as their agent with monk with lauderdale in april with charles in holland and again in london  sharp was no fanatic  from the first he assured his brethren douglas of edinburgh baillie and the rest that there was no chance for rigid presbyterianism  they could conceive of no presbyterianism which was not rigid in the manner of andrew melville to whom his king was christs silly vassal  sharp warned them early that in face of the irreconcilable protesters moderate episcopacy would be preferred and douglas himself assured sharp that the new generation in scotland bore a hearthatred to the covenant and are wearied of the yoke of presbyterial government  this was true the ruling classes had seen too much of presbyterial government and would prefer bishops as long as they were not pampered and allpowerful  on the other hand the lesser gentry still more their godly wives the farmers and burgesses and the preachers regarded the very shadow of episcopacy as a breach of the covenant and an insult to the almighty  the covenanters had forced the covenant on the consciences of thousands from the king downwards who in soul and conscience loathed it  they were to drink of the same cupepiscopacy was to be forced on them by fines and imprisonments  scotland her people and rulers were moving in a vicious circle  the resolutioners admitted that to allow the protesters to have any hand in affairs was to breed continual distemper and disorders and baillie was for banishing the leaders of the protesters irreconcilables like the rev james guthrie to the orkney islands  but the resolutioners on the other hand were no less eager to stop the use of the liturgy in charless own household and to persecute every sort of catholic dissenter sectary and quaker in scotland meanwhile argyll in debt despised on all sides and yet dreaded was holding a great openair communion meeting of protesters at paisley in the heart of the wildest covenanting region may 27 1660  he was still dangerous he was trying to make himself trusted by the protesters who were opposed to charles  it may be doubted if any great potentate in scotland except the marquis wished to revive the constitutional triumphs of argylls party in the last parliament of charles i  charles now named his privy council and ministers without waiting for parliamentary assentthough his first parliament would have assented to anything  he chose only his late supporters glencairn who raised his standard in 1653 rothes a humorous and not a cruel voluptuary and as secretary for scotland in london lauderdale who had urged him to take the covenant and who for twenty years was to be his buffoon his favourite and his wavering and unscrupulous adviser  among these greedy and treacherous profligates there would had he survived have been no place for montrose  in defiance of warnings from omens secondsighted men and sensible men argyll left the safe sanctuary of his mountains and seastraits and betook himself to london a fey man  most of his past was covered by an act of indemnity but not his doings in 1653  he was arrested before he saw the kings face july 8 1660 and lay in the tower till in december he was taken to be tried for treason in scotland  sharps friends were anxious to interfere in favour of establishing presbyterianism in england he told them that the hope was vain he repeatedly asked for leave to return home and while an english preacher assured charles that the rout of worcester had been gods vengeance for his taking of the covenant sharp june 25 told his resolutioners that the protesters doom is dight  administration in scotland was intrusted to the committee of estates whom monk 1650 had captured at alyth and with them glencairn as chancellor entered edinburgh on august 22  next day while the committee was busy james guthrie and some protester preachers met and in the old way drew up a supplication  they denounced religious toleration and asked for the establishment of presbytery in england and the filling of all offices with covenanters  they were all arrested and accused of attempting to rekindle civil war which would assuredly have followed had their prayer been accepted  next year guthrie was hanged but ten days after his arrest sharp had brought down a letter of charles to the edinburgh presbytery promising to protect and preserve the government of the church of scotland as it is established by law  had the words run as it may be established by law in parliament it would not have been a dishonourable quibbleas it was  parliament opened on new years day 1661 with middleton as commissioner in the words of sir george mackenzie then a very young advocate and man of letters never was parliament so obsequious  the king was declared supreme governor over all persons and in all causes a blow at kirk judicature and all acts between 1633 and 1661 were rescinded just as thirty years of ecclesiastical legislation had been rescinded by the covenanters  a sum of 40000 pounds yearly was settled on the king argyll was tried was defended by young george mackenzie and when he seemed safe his doom was fixed by the arrival of a campbell from london bearing some of his letters to lilburne and monk 16531655 which the indemnity of 1651 did not cover  he died by the axe not the rope like montrose with dignity and courage  the question of church government in scotland was left to charles and his advisers  the problem presented to the government of the restoration by the kirk was much more difficult and complicated than historians usually suppose  the pretensions which the preachers had inherited from knox and andrew melville were practically incompatible as had been proved with the existence of the state  in the southern and western shiressuch as those of dumfries galloway ayr renfrew and lanarkthe forces which attacked the engagers had been mustered these shires had backed strachan and ker and guthrie in the agitation against the king the estates and the less violent clergy after dunbar  but without argyll and with no probable noble leaders they could do little harm they had done none under the english occupation which abolished the general assembly  to have restored the assembly or rather two assembliesthat of the protesters and that of the resolutionistswould certainly have been perilous  probably the wisest plan would have been to grant a general assembly to meet after the session of parliament not as had been the custom to meet before it and influence or coerce the estates  had that measure proved perilous to peace it need not have been repeatedthe kirk might have been left in the state to which the english had reduced it  this measure would not have so much infuriated the devout as did the introduction of black prelacy and the ejection of some 300 adored ministers chiefly in the southwest and the making of a desert first and then peopling it with owls and satyrs the curates as archbishop leighton described the action of 1663  there ensued the finings of all who would not attend the ministrations of owls and satyrsa grievance which produced two rebellions 1666 and 1679 and a doctrine of anarchism and was only worn down by eternal and cruel persecutions  by violence the restoration achieved its aim the revolution of 1688 entered into the results it was a bitter moment in the evolution of scotlanda moment that need never have existed  episcopacy was restored four bishops were consecrated and sharp accepted as might have long been foreseen the see of st andrews  he was henceforth reckoned a judas and assuredly he had ruined his character for honour he became a puppet of government despised by his masters loathed by the rest of scotland  in mayseptember 1662 parliament ratified the change to episcopacy  it seems to have been thought that few preachers except the protesters would be recalcitrant refuse collation from bishops and leave their manses in point of fact though they were allowed to consult their consciences till february 1663 nearly 300 ministers preferred their consciences to their livings  they remained centres of the devotion of their flocks and the curates hastily gathered who took their places were stigmatised as ignorant and profligate while as they were resisted rabbled and daily insulted the country was full of disorder  the government thus mortally offended the devout classes though no attempt was made to introduce a liturgy  in the churches the services were exactly or almost exactly what they had been but excommunications could now only be done by sanction of the bishops  witchburnings in spite of the opposition of george mackenzie and the council were soon as common as under the covenant  oaths declaring it unlawful to enter into covenants or take up arms against the king were imposed on all persons in office  middleton of his own authority now proposed the ostracism by parliamentary ballot of twelve persons reckoned dangerous  lauderdale was mainly aimed at it is a pity that the bullet did not find its billet with crawford cassilis tweeddale lothian and other peers who did not approve of the recent measures  but lauderdale in london seeing charles daily won his favour middleton was recalled march 1663 and lauderdale entered freely on his wavering unscrupulous corrupt and disastrous period of power  the parliament of june 1663 meeting under rothes was packed by the least constitutional method of choosing the lords of the articles waristoun was brought from france tried and hanged expressing more fear than i ever saw wrote lauderdale whose act against separation and disobedience to ecclesiastical authority fined abstainers from services in their parish churches  in 1664 sharp who was despised by lauderdale and glencairn obtained the erection of that old grievancea court of high commission including bishops to punish nonconformists sir james turner was intrusted with the task of dragooning them by fining and the quartering of soldiers on those who would not attend the curates and would keep conventicles  turner was naturally clement and goodnatured but wine often deprived him of his wits and his soldiery behaved brutally  their excesses increased discontent and war with holland 1664 gave them hopes of a dutch ally  conventicles became common they had an organisation of scouts and sentinels  the malcontents intrigued with holland in 1666 and schemed to capture the three keys of the kingdomthe castles of stirling dumbarton and edinburgh  the statesgeneral promised when this was done to send ammunition and 150000 gulden july 1666  when rebellion did break out it had no foreign aid and a casual origin in the southwest turner commanded but seventy soldiers scattered all about the country  on november 14 some of them mishandled an old man in the clachan of dalry on the ken  a soldier was shot in revenge mackenzie speaks as if a conventicle was going on in the neighbourhood people gathered in arms with the laird of corsack young maxwell of monreith and mlennan caught turner undressed in dumfries and carried him with them as they went conventicling about as mackenzie writes holding prayermeetings led by wallace an old soldier of the covenant  at lanark they renewed the covenant  dalziel of binns who had learned war in russia led a pursuing force  the rebels were disappointed in hopes of dutch or native help at edinburgh they turned when within three miles of the town into the passes of the pentland hills and at bullion green on november 28 displayed fine soldierly qualities and courage but fled broken at nightfall  the soldiers and countryfolk who were unsympathetic took a number of prisoners preachers and laymen on whom the council under the presidency of sharp exercised a cruelty bred of terror  the prisoners were defended by george mackenzie it has been strangely stated that he was lord advocate and persecuted them  fifteen rebels were hanged the use of torture to extract information was a return under fletcher the kings advocate to a practice of scottish law which had been almost in abeyance since 1638except of course in the case of witches  turner vainly tried to save from the boot 208 the laird of corsack who had protected his life from the fanatics  the executioner favoured mr mackail says the rev mr kirkton himself a sufferer later  this mr mackail when a lad of twentyone 1662 had already denounced the rulers in a sermon as on the moral level of haman and judas  it is entirely untrue that sharp concealed a letter from the king commanding that no blood should be shed charles detested hanging people  if any one concealed his letter it was burnet archbishop of glasgow  dalziel now sent ballantyne to supersede turner and to exceed him in ferocity and bellenden and tweeddale wrote to lauderdale deprecating the cruelties and rapacity of the reaction and avowing contempt of sharp  he was snibbed confined to his diocese and cast down yea lower than the dust wrote rothes to lauderdale  he was held to have exaggerated in his reports the forces of the spirit of revolt but tweeddale sir robert murray and kincardine found when in power that matters were really much more serious than they had supposed  in the disturbed districtsmainly the old strathclyde and pictish gallowaythe conformist ministers were perpetually threatened insulted and robbed  according to a sympathetic historian on the day when charles should abolish bishops and permit free general assemblies the western whigs would become his lawabiding subjects but till that day they would be irreconcilable  but a government is not always well advised in yielding to violence  moreover when government had deserted its clergy and had granted free general assemblies the two covenants would rearise and the pretensions of the clergy to dominate the state would be revived lauderdale drifted into a policy of alternate indulgences or tolerations and of repression which had the desired effect at the maximum of cost to justice and decency  before england drove james ii from the throne but a small remnant of fanatics were in active resistance and the covenants had ceased to be dangerous  a scheme of partial toleration was mooted in 1667 and rothes was removed from his practical dictatorship while turner was made the scapegoat of rothes sharp and dalziel  the result of the scheme of toleration was an increase in disorder  bishop leighton had a plan for abolishing all but a shadow of episcopacy but the temper of the recalcitrants displayed itself in a book naphtali advocating the right of the godly to murder their oppressors  this work contained provocations to anarchism and in knoxs spirit encouraged any phinehas conscious of a call from heaven to do justice on such persons as he found guilty of troubling the godly  fired by such christian doctrines on july 11 1668 one mitchella preacher of the gospel and a youth of much zeal and piety says wodrow the historianshot at sharp wounded the bishop of orkney in the street of edinburgh and escaped  this event delayed the project of conciliation but in july 1669 the first indulgence was promulgated  on making certain concessions outed ministers were to be restored  twoand forty came in including the resolutioner douglas in 1660 the correspondent of sharp  the indulgence allowed the indulged to reject episcopal collation but while brethren exiled in holland denounced the scheme these brethren led by mr macward opposed all attempts at reconciliation it also offended the archbishops who issued a remonstrance  sharp was silenced burnet of glasgow was superseded and the see was given to the saintly but unpractical leighton  by 1670 conventiclers met in arms and a clanking act as lauderdale called it menaced them with death charles ii resented but did not rescind it  in fact the disorders and attacks on conformist ministers were of a violence much overlooked by our historians  in 1672 a second indulgence split the kirk into factionsthe exiles in holland maintaining that preachers who accepted it should be held men unholy false brethren  but the indulged increased in numbers and finally in influence  to such a man as leighton the whole quarrel seemed a scuffle of drunken men in the dark  an englishman entering a scottish church at this time found no sort of liturgy prayers and sermons were what the minister chose to make themin fact there was no persecution for religion says sir george mackenzie  but if men thought even a shadow of episcopacy an offence to omnipotence and the kings authority in ecclesiastical cases a usurping of the crown honours of christ if they consequently broke the law by attending armed conventicles and assailing conformist preachers and then were fined or imprisonedfrom their point of view they were being persecuted for their religion  meanwhile they bullied and rabbled the curates for their religion such was leightons drunken scuffle in the dark  in 1672 lauderdale married the rapacious and tyrannical daughter of will murrayof old the whippingboy of charles i later a disreputable intriguer  lauderdales own ferocity of temper and his greed had created so much dislike that in the parliament of 1673 he was met by a constitutional opposition headed by the duke of hamilton and with sir george mackenzie as its orator  lauderdale consented to withdraw monopolies on salt tobacco and brandy to other grievances he would not listen the distresses of the kirk were not brought forward and he dissolved the parliament  the opposition tried to get at him through the english commons who brought against him charges like those which were fatal to strafford  they failed and lauderdale holding seven offices himself while his brother haltoun was master of the mint ruled through a kind of clique of kinsmen and creatures  leighton in despair resigned his see the irreconcilables of the kirk had crowned him with insults  the kirk he said abounded in furious zeal and endless debates about the empty name and shadow of a difference in government in the meanwhile not having of solemn and orderly public worship as much as a shadow  wodrow the historian of the sufferings of the kirk declares that through the riotous proceedings of the religious malcontents the country resembled war as much as peace  but an act of council of 1677 bidding landowners sign a bond for the peaceable behaviour of all on their lands was refused obedience by many western lairds  they could not enforce order they said hence it seemed to follow that there was much disorder those who refused were by a stretch of the law of lawburrows bound over to keep the peace of the government  lauderdale having nothing that we would call a police little money and a small insufficient force of regulars called in the highland host the retainers of atholl glenorchy mar moray and airlie and other northern lords and quartered them on the disturbed districts for a month  they were then sent home bearing their spoils february 1678  atholl and perth later to be the catholic minister of james ii now went over to the party the opposition hamiltons party hamilton and others rode to london to complain against lauderdale but he aided by the silver tongue of mackenzie who had changed sides won over charles and lauderdales assailants were helpless  great unpopularity and disgrace were achieved by the treatment of the pious mitchell who we have seen missed sharp and shot the bishop of orkney in 1668  in 1674 he was taken and confessed before the council after receiving from rothes then chancellor assurance of his life this with lauderdales consent  but when brought before the judges he retracted his confession  he was kept a prisoner on the bass rock in 1676 was tortured in january 1678 was again tried  haltoun who in a letter of 1674 had mentioned the assurance of life rothes sharp and lauderdale all swore that to their memory no assurance had been given in 1674  mitchells counsel asked to be allowed to examine the register of the council but for some invisible technical reasons the lords of the justiciary refused the request they said came too late  mackenzie prosecuted he had been mitchells counsel in 1674 and it is impossible to follow the reasoning by which he justifies the condemnation and hanging of mitchell in january 1678  sharp was supposed to have urged mitchells trial and to have perjured himself which is far from certain  though mitchell was guilty the manner of his taking off was flagrantly unjust and most discreditable to all concerned  huge armed conventicles and others led by welsh a preacher marched about through the country in december 1678 to may 1679  in april 1679 two soldiers were murdered while in bed next day john graham of claverhouse who had served under the prince of orange with credit and now comes upon the scene reported that welsh was organising an armed rebellion and that the peasants were seizing the weapons of the militia balfour of kinloch burley and robert hamilton a laird in fife were the leaders of that extreme sect which was feared as much by the indulged preachers as by the curates and on may 2 1679 balfour with hackstoun of rathillet who merely looked on and other pious desperadoes passed half an hour in clumsily hacking sharp to death in the presence of his daughter at magus moor near st andrews  the slayers says one of them thanked the lord for leading them by his holy spirit in every step they stepped in that matter and it is obvious that mere argument was unavailing with gentlemen who cherished such opinions  in the portraits of sharp we see a face of refined goodness which makes the physiognomist distrust his art  from very early times cromwell had styled sharp sharp of that ilk  he was subtle he had no fanaticism he warned his brethren in 1660 of the impossibility of restoring their old authority and discipline  but when he accepted an archbishopric he sold his honour his servility to charles and lauderdale was disgusting fear made him cruel his conduct at mitchells last trial is at best ambiguous and the hatred in which he was held is proved by the falsehoods which his enemies told about his private life and his sorceries  the murderers crossed the country joined the armed fanatics of the west under robert hamilton and on restoration day may 29 burned acts of the government at rutherglen  claverhouse rode out of glasgow with a small force to inquire into this proceeding met the armed insurgents in a strong position defended by marshes and small lochs sent to lord ross at glasgow for reinforcements which did not arrive and has himself told how he was defeated pursued and driven back into glasgow  this may be accounted the beginning of the rebellion in my opinion  hamilton shot with his own hand one of the prisoners and reckoned the sparing of the others one of our first steppings aside  men so conscientious as hamilton were rare in his party which was ruined presently by its own distracted counsels  the forces of the victors of drumclog were swollen by their success but they were repulsed with loss in an attack on glasgow  the commands of ross and claverhouse were then withdrawn to stirling and when livingstone joined them at larbert the whole army mustered but 1800 menso weak were the regulars  the militia was raised and the king sent down his illegitimate son monmouth husband of the heiress of buccleuch at the head of several regiments of redcoats  argyll was not of service he was engaged in private war with the macleans who refused an appeal for help from the rebels  they in glasgow and at hamilton were quarrelling over the indulgence the extremists called mr welshs party rottenheartedwelsh would not reject the kings authoritythe welshites were the more numerous  on june 22 the clyde at bothwell bridge separated the rebelswhose preachers were inveighing against each otherfrom monmouths army  monmouth refused to negotiate till the others laid down their arms and after a brief artillery duel the royal infantry carried the bridge and the rest of the affair was pursuit by the cavalry  the rival covenanting leaders russel one of sharps murderers and ure give varying accounts of the affair and each party blames the other  the rebel force is reckoned at from five to seven thousand the royal army was of 2300 according to russel  some hundreds of the covenanters fell and many hundreds the privy council reported were taken  the battle of bothwell bridge severed the extremists robert hamilton richard cameron and cargill the famous preachers and the rest from the majority of the covenanters  they dwindled to the remnant growing the fiercer as their numbers decreased  only two ministers were hanged hundreds of prisoners were banished like cromwells prisoners after dunbar to the american colonies  of these some two hundred were drowned in the wreck of their vessel off the orkneys  the main body were penned up in greyfriars churchyard many escaped more signed a promise to remain peaceful and shun conventicles  there was more of cruel carelessness than of the deliberate cruelty displayed in the massacres and hangings of women after philiphaugh and dunaverty  but the avaricious and corrupt rulers after 1679 headed by james duke of york lauderdale being removed made the rising of bothwell bridge the pretext for fining and ruining hundreds of persons especially lairds who were accused of helping or harbouring rebels  the officials were rapacious for their own profit  the records of scores of trials prosecuted for the sake of spoil and disgraced by torture and injustice make miserable reading  between the trials of the accused and the struggle with the small minority of extremists led by richard cameron and the aged mr cargill the history of the country is monotonously wretched it was in prosecuting lairds and peasants and preachers that sir george mackenzie by nature a lenient man and a lover of literature gained the name of the bluidy advocate  cameron and his followers rode about after issuing the wildest manifestoes as at sanquhar in the shire of dumfries june 22 1680 bruce of earlshall was sent with a party of horse to pursue and in the wild marshes of airs moss in ayrshire cameron fell praying and fighting while hackstoun of rathillet less fortunate was taken and the murder of sharp was avenged on him with unspeakable cruelties  the remnant now formed itself into organised and armed societies their conduct made them feared and detested by the majority of the preachers who longed for a quiet life not for the establishment of a mosaic commonwealth and the execution of righteous judgments on malignants cargill was now the leader of the remnant and cargill in a conventicle at torwood of his own authority excommunicated the king the duke of york lauderdale rothes dalziel and mackenzie whom he accused of leniency to witches among other sins  the government apparently thought that excommunication to the mind of cargill and his adherents meant outlawry and that outlawry might mean the assassination of the excommunicated  cargill was hunted and july 12 1681 was captured by wild bonshaw  it was believed by his party that the decision to execute cargill was carried by the vote of argyll in the privy council and that cargill told rothes who had signed the covenant with him in their youth that rothes would be the first to die  rothes died on july 26 cargill was hanged on july 27  on the following day james duke of york as royal commissioner opened the first parliament since 167374  james secured an act making the right of succession to the crown independent of differences of religion he of course was a catholic  the test act was also passed a thing so selfcontradictory in its terms that any man might take it whose sense of humour overcame his sense of honour  many refused including a number of the conformist ministers  argyll took the test as far as it is consistent with itself and with the protestant religion  argyll the son of the executed marquis had recovered his lands and acquired the title of earl mainly through the help of lauderdale  during the religious troubles from 1660 onwards he had taken no great part but had sided with the government and approved of the torture of preachers but what ruined him now though the facts have been little noticed was his disregard of the claims of his creditors and his obtaining the lands of the macleans in mull and morven in discharge of an enormous debt of the maclean chief to the marquis executed in 1661  the macleans had vainly attempted to prove that the debt was vastly inflated by familiar processes and had resisted in arms the invasion of the campbells  they had friends in seaforth the mackenzies and in the earl of errol and other nobles  these men especially mackenzie of tarbet an astute intriguer seized their chance when argyll took the test with a qualification and though at first he satisfied and was reconciled to the duke of york they won over the duke accused argyll to the king brought him before a jury and had him condemned of treason and incarcerated  the object may have been to intimidate him and destroy his almost royal power in the west and the islands  in any case after a trial for treason in which one vote settled his doom he escaped in disguise as a footman perhaps by collusion as was suspected fled to england conspired there with scottish exiles and a covenanting refugee mr veitch and as charles would not allow him to be searched for he easily escaped to holland for details see my book sir george mackenzie  it was in fact clan hatred that dragged down argyll  his condemnation was an infamous perversion of justice but as charles would not allow him to be captured in london it is most improbable that he would have permitted the unjust capital sentence to be carried out  the escape was probably collusive and the sole result of these intricate iniquities was to create for the government an enemy who would have been dangerous if he had been trusted by the extreme presbyterians  in england no less than in scotland the supreme and odious injustice of argylls trial excited general indignation  the earl of aberdeen gordon of haddo was now chancellor and queensberry was treasurer for a while both were intrigued against at court by the earl of perth and his brother later lord melfort and probably by far the worst of all the knaves of the restoration  increasing outrages by the remnant now headed by the rev mr james renwick a very young man led to more furious repression especially as in 1683 government detected a double plotthe wilder english aim being to raise the rabble and to take or slay charles and his brother at the rye house while the more respectable conspirators english and scots were believed to be acquainted with though not engaged in this design the rev mr carstares was going and coming between argyll and the exiles in holland and the intriguers at home  they intended as usual first to surprise edinburgh castle  in england algernon sidney lord russell and others were arrested while baillie of jerviswoode and carstares were apprehendedcarstares in england  he was sent to scotland where he could be tortured  the trial of jerviswoode was if possible more unjust than even the common run of these affairs and he was executed december 24 1684  the conspiracy was in fact a very serious affair carstares was confessedly aware of its criminal aspect and was in the closest confidence of the ministers of william of orange  what his dealings were with them in later years he would never divulge  but it is clear that if the plotters slew charles and james the hour had struck for the dutch deliverers appearance  if we describe the rye house plot as aiming merely at the exclusion of the duke of york from the throne we shut our eyes to evidence and make ourselves incapable of understanding the events  there were plotters of every degree and rank and they were intriguing with argyll and through carstares who knew though he refused a part in the murder plot were in touch at once with argyll and the intimates of william of orange  meanwhile the hill men the adherents of renwick in october 1684 declared a war of assassination against their opponents and announced that they would try malignants in courts of their own  their manifesto the apologetical declaration caused an extraordinary measure of repression  a testthe abjuration of the criminal parts of renwicks declarationwas to be offered by military authority to all and sundry refusal to abjure entailed military execution  the test was only obnoxious to sincere fanatics but among them must have been hundreds of persons who had no criminal designs and merely deemed it a point of honour not to homologate any act of a government which was corrupt prelatic and unholy  later victims of this view of duty were margaret lauchleson and margaret wilsonan old woman and a young girlcruelly drowned by the local authorities at wigtown may 1685  a myth represents claverhouse as having been present  the shooting of john brown the christian carrier by claverhouse in the previous week was an affair of another character  claverhouse did not exceed his orders and ammunition and treasonable papers were in browns possession he was also sheltering a redhanded rebel  brown was not shot merely because he was a nonconformist nor was he shot by the hand of claverhouse  these incidents of the killing time were in the reign of james ii charles ii had died to the sincere grief of most of his subjects on february 2 1685  lecherous and treacherous as he was he was humorous and goodhumoured  the expected invasion of scotland by argyll of england by monmouth did not encourage the government to use respective lenity in the covenanting region from lanarkshire to galloway  argyll who sailed from holland on may 2 had a council of lowlanders who thwarted him  his interests were in his own principality but he found it occupied by atholl and his clansmen and the cadets of his own house as a rule would not rally to him  the lowlanders with him sir patrick hume sir john cochrane and the rest wished to move south and join hands with the remnant in the west and in galloway but the remnant distrusted the sudden religious zeal of argyll and were cowed by claverhouse  the coasts were watched by government vessels of war and when after vain movements round about his own castle inveraray argyll was obliged by his lowlanders to move on glasgow he was checked at every turn the leaders weary and lost in the marshes scattered from kilpatrick on clyde argyll crossed the river and was captured by servants of sir john shaw of greenock  he was not put to trial nor to torture he was executed on the verdict of 1681  about 200 suspected persons were lodged by government in dunottar castle at the time and treated with abominable cruelty  the covenanters were now effectually put down though renwick was not taken and hanged till 1688  the preachers were anxious for peace and quiet and were bitterly hostile to renwick  the covenant was a dead letter as far as power to do mischief was concerned  it was not persecution of the kirk but demand for toleration of catholics and a manifest desire to restore the church that in two years lost james his kingdoms  on april 29 1686 jamess message to the scots parliament asked toleration for our innocent subjects the catholics  he had substituted perths brother now entitled earl of melfort for queensberry perth was now chancellor both men had adopted their kings religion and the infamous melfort can hardly be supposed to have done so honestly  their families lost all in the event except their faith  with the request for toleration james sent promises of free trade with england and he asked for no supplies  perth had introduced catholic vestments and furnishings in holyrood chapel which provoked a no popery riot  parliament would not permit toleration james removed many of the council and filled their places with catholics  sir george mackenzies conscience dirled he refused to vote for toleration and he lost the lord advocateship being superseded by sir james dalrymple an old covenanting opponent of claverhouse in galloway  in august james by prerogative did what the estates would not do and he deprived the archbishop of glasgow and the bishop of dunkeld of their sees though a catholic he was the kingpope of a protestant church  in a decree of july 1687 he extended toleration to the kirk and a meeting of preachers at edinburgh expressed a deep sense of your majestys gracious and surprising favour  the kirk was indeed broken and when the revolution came was at last ready for a compromise from which the covenants were omitted  on february 17 1688 mr renwick was hanged at edinburgh he had been prosecuted by dalrymple  on the same day mackenzie superseded dalrymple as lord advocate  after the birth of the white rose prince of wales june 10 1688 scotland like england apprehended that a catholic king would be followed by a catholic son  the various contradictory lies about the childs birth flourished all the more because james ventured to select the magistrates of the royal burghs  it became certain that the prince of orange would invade and melfort madly withdrew the regular troops with claverhouse now viscount dundee to aid in resisting william in england though balcarres proposed a safer way of holding down the english northern counties by volunteers the highland clans and new levies  thus the privy council in scotland were left at the mercy of the populace  of the scottish army in england all were disbanded when james fled to france except a handful of cavalry whom dundee kept with him  perth fled from edinburgh but was taken and held a prisoner for four years the town trainband with the mob and some cameronians took holyrood slaying such of the guard as they did not imprison many died of their wounds and hunger  the chapel and catholic houses were sacked and gangs of the armed cameronian societies went about in the southwest rabbling robbing and driving away ministers of the episcopalian sort atholl was in power in edinburgh in london where jamess scots friends met the duke of hamilton was made president of council and power was left till the assembling of a convention at edinburgh march 1689 in the hands of william  in edinburgh castle the wavering duke of gordon was induced to remain by dundee and balcarres while dundee proposed to call a jacobite convention in stirling  melfort induced james to send a letter contrary to the desires of his party atholl who had promised to join them broke away the life of dundee was threatened by the fanatics and on march 18 seeing his party headless and heartless dundee rode north going wherever might lead him the shade of montrose  mackay now brought to edinburgh regiments from holland which overawed the jacobites and he secured for william the key of the north the castle of stirling  with hamilton as president the convention with only four adverse votes declared against james and his son and hamilton april 3 proclaimed at the cross the reign of william and mary  the claim of rights was passed and declared episcopacy intolerable  balcarres was thrown into prison on may 11 william took the coronation oath for scotland merely protesting that he would not root out heretics as the oath enjoined  this was the end o an auld sang the end of the stuart dynasty and of the equally divine rights of kings and of preachers  in a sketch it is impossible to convey any idea of the sufferings of scotland at least of covenanting scotland under the restoration  there was contest unrest and dragoonings and the quartering of a brutal and licentious soldiery on suspected persons  law especially since 1679 had been twisted for the conviction of persons whom the administration desired to rob  the greed and corruption of the rulers from lauderdale his wife and his brother haltoun to perth and his brother the earl of melfort whose very title was the name of an unjustly confiscated estate is almost inconceivable 225  few of the foremost men in power except sir george mackenzie and claverhouse were free from personal profligacy of every sort  claverhouse has left on record his aversion to severities against the peasantry he was for prosecuting such gentry as the dalrymples  as constable of dundee he refused to inflict capital punishment on petty offenders and mackenzie went as far as he dared in opposing the ferocities of the inquisition of witches  but in cases of alleged treason mackenzie knew no mercy  torture legal in scotland was used with barbarism unprecedented there after each plot or rising to extract secrets which save in one or two cases like that of carstares the victims did not possess  they were peasants preachers and a few country gentlemen the nobles had no inclination to suffer for the cause of the covenants  the covenants continued to be the idols of the societies of cameronians and of many preachers who were no longer inclined to die for these documentsthe expression of such strange doctrines the causes of so many sorrows and of so many martyrdoms  however little we may sympathise with the doctrines none the less the sufferers were idealists and no less than montrose preferred honour to life  with all its sins the restoration so far pulverised the pretensions which since 1560 the preachers had made that william of orange was not obliged to renew the conflict with the spiritual sons of knox and andrew melville  this fact is not so generally recognised as it might be  it is therefore proper to quote the corroborative opinion of the learned historiographer royal of scotland professor hume brown  by concession and repression the once mighty force of scottish presbyterianism had been broken  most deadly of the weapons in the accomplishment of this result had been the three acts of indulgence which had successively cut so deep into the ranks of uniformity  in succumbing to the threats and promises of the government the indulged ministers had undoubtedly compromised the fundamental principles of presbyterianism     the compliance of these ministers was in truth the first and necessary step towards that religious and political compromise which the force of circumstances was gradually imposing on the scottish people and the example of the indulged ministers who composed the great mass of the presbyterian clergy was of the most potent effect in substituting the idea of toleration for that of the religious absolutism of knox and melville 226  it may be added that the pretensions of knox and melville and all their followers were no essential part of presbyterial church government but were merely the continuation or survival of the clerical claims of apostolic authority as enforced by such popes as hildebrand and such martyrs as st thomas of canterbury     chapter xxvii  william and mary   while claverhouse hovered in the north the convention declared to be a parliament by william on june 5 took on for the first time in scotland since the reign of charles i the aspect of an english parliament and demanded english constitutional freedom of debate  the secretary in scotland was william earl of melville that hereditary waverer the duke of hamilton was royal commissioner but some official supporters of william especially sir james and sir john dalrymple were criticised and thwarted by the club of more extreme liberals  they were led by the lowland ally who had vexed argyll hume of polwarth and by montgomery of skelmorley who disappointed in his desire of place soon engaged in a jacobite plot  the club wished to hasten the grant of parliamentary liberties which william was anxious not to give and to take vengeance on officials such as sir james dalrymple and his son sir john now lord advocate as he had been under james ii  to these two men foes of claverhouse william clung while he could  the council obtained but did not need to use permission to torture jacobite prisoners cavaliers as at this time they were styled but chieseley of dalry who murdered sir george lockhart president of the college of justice was tortured  the advanced liberal acts which were passed did not receive the touch of the sceptre from hamilton williams commissioner thus they were vetoed and of no effect  the old packed committee the lords of the articles was denounced as a grievance the king was to be permitted to appoint no officers of state without parliaments approbation  hamilton offered compromises for william clung to the articles but he abandoned them in the following year and thenceforth till the union 1707 the scottish was a free parliament  various measures of legislation for the kirksome to emancipate it as in its palmy days some to keep it from meddling in politicswere proposed some measures to abolish some to retain lay patronage of livings were mooted  the advanced party for a while put a stop to the appointment of judges but in august came news of the viscount dundee in the north which terrified parliamentary politicians  edinburgh castle had been tamely yielded by the duke of gordon balcarres the associate of dundee had been imprisoned but dundee himself after being declared a rebel in april raised the standard of king james  as against him the whigs relied on mackay a brave officer who had been in dutch service and now commanded regiments of the scots brigade of holland  mackay pursued dundee as baillie had pursued montrose through the north at inverness dundee picked up some macdonalds under keppoch but keppoch was not satisfactory being something of a freebooter  the viscount now rode to the centre of his hopes to the macdonalds of glengarry the camerons of lochiel and the macleans who had been robbed of their lands by the earl of argyll executed in 1685  dundee summoned them to lochiels house on loch arkaig for may 18 he visited atholl and badenoch found a few mounted men as recruits at dundee returned through the wilds to lochaber and sent round that old summons to a rising the fiery cross charred and dipped in a goats blood  much time was spent in preliminary manoeuvring and sparring between mackay now reinforced by english regulars and dundee who for a time disbanded his levies while mackay went to receive fresh forces and to consult the government at edinburgh  he decided to march to the west and bridle the clans by erecting a strong fort at inverlochy where montrose routed argyll  a stronghold at inverlochy menaced the macdonalds to the north and the camerons in lochaber and southwards the stewarts in appin  but to reach inverlochy mackay had to march up the tay past blair atholl and so westward through very wild mountainous country  to oppose him dundee had collected 4000 of the clansmen and awaited ammunition and men from james then in ireland  by the advice of the great lochiel a man over seventy but miraculously athletic dundee decided to let the clans fight in their old waya rush a volley at close quarters and then the claymore  by june 28 dundee had received no aid from jamesof money we have not twenty pounds and he was between the earl of argyll son of the martyr of 1685 and mackay with his 4000 foot and eight troops of horse  on july 23 dundee seized the castle of blair atholl which had been the base of montrose in his campaigns and was the key of the country between the tay and lochaber  the atholl clans murrays and stewarts breaking away from the son of their chief the fickle marquis of atholl were led by stewart of ballechin but did not swell dundees force at the moment from james dundee now received but a battalion of halfstarved irishmen under the futile general cannon  on july 27 at blair dundee learned that mackays force had already entered the steep and narrow pass of killiecrankie where the road skirted the brawling waters of the garry  dundee had not time to defend the pass he marched his men from blair keeping the heights while mackay emerged from the gorge and let his forces rest on the wide level haugh beside the garry under the house of runraurie now called urrard with the deep and rapid river in their rear  on this haugh the tourist sees the tall standing stone which since 1735 at least has been known as dundees stone  from the haugh rises a steep acclivity leading to the plateau where the house of runraurie stood  mackay feared that dundee would occupy this plateau and that the fire thence would break up his own men on the haugh below  he therefore seized the plateau which was an unfortunate manoeuvre  he was so superior in numbers that both of his wings extended beyond dundees who had but forty illhorsed gentlemen by way of cavalry  after distracting mackay by movements along the heights as if to cut off his communications with the south dundee who had resisted the prayers of the chiefs that he would be sparing of his person gave the word to charge as the sun sank behind the western hills  rushing down hill under heavy fire and losing many men the clans when they came to the shock swept the enemy from the plateau drove them over the declivity forced many to attempt crossing the garry where they were drowned and followed slaying through the pass  half of hastings regiment untouched by the highland charge and all of levens men stood their ground and were standing there when sixteen of dundees horse returned from the pursuit  mackay who had lost his army stole across the garry with this remnant and made for stirling  he knew not that dundee lay on the field dying in the arms of victory  precisely when and in what manner dundee was slain is unknown there is even a fair presumption from letters of the english government that he was murdered by two men sent from england on some very secret mission  when last seen by his men dundee was plunged in the battle smoke sword in hand in advance of his horse  when the whigsterrified by the defeat and expecting dundee at stirling with the clans and the cavaliers of the lowlandsheard of his fall their sorrow was changed into rejoicing  the cause of king james was mortally wounded by the death of the glory of the grahams who alone could lead and keep together a highland host  deprived of his leadership and distrustful of his successor general cannon the clans gradually left the royal standard  the cameronian regiment recruited from the young men of the organised societies had been ordered to occupy dunkeld here they were left isolated in the air by mackay or his subordinates and on august 21 these raw recruits under colonel cleland who had fought at drumclog had to receive the attack of the highlanders cleland had fortified the abbey church and the castle and his cameronians fired from behind walls and from loopholes with such success that cannon called off the clansmen or could not bring them to a second attack both versions are given  cleland fell in the fight the clans disbanded and mackay occupied the castle of blair  three weeks later the cameronians being unpaid mutinied and ross annandale and polwarth urging their demands for constitutional rights threw the lowlands into a ferment  crawford whose manner of speech was sanctimonious was evicting from their parishes ministers who remained true to episcopacy and would not pray for william and mary  polwarth now went to london with an address to these sovereigns framed by the club the party of liberty  but the other leaders of that party annandale ross and montgomery of skelmorley all of them eager for place and office entered into a conspiracy of intrigue with the jacobites for jamess restoration  in february 1690 the club was distracted and to melville as commissioner in the scottish parliament william gave orders that the acts for reestablishing presbytery and abolishing lay patronage of livings were to be passed  montgomery was obliged to bid yet higher for the favour of the more extreme preachers and devoteesbut he failed  in april the lords of the articles were abolished at last and freedom of parliamentary debate was thus secured the westminster confession was reinstated and in may after the last remnants of a jacobite force in the north had been surprised and scattered or captured by sir thomas livingstone at cromdale haugh may 1 the alliance of jacobites and of the club broke down and the leaders of the club saved themselves by playing the part of informers  the new act regarding the kirk permitted the holding of synods and general assemblies to be summoned by permission of william or of the privy council with a royal commissioner present to restrain the preachers from meddling as a body with secular politics  the kirk was to be organised by the sixty bishops the survivors of the ministers ejected in 1663  the benefices of ejected episcopalian conformists were declared to be vacant  lay patronage was annulled the congregations had the right to approve or disapprove of presentees  but the kirk was deprived of her old weapon the attachment of civil penalties that is practical outlawry to her sentences of excommunication july 19 1690 the covenant was silently dropped  thus ended practically the war between kirk and state which had raged for nearly a hundred and twenty years  the cruel torturing of nevile payne an english jacobite taken in scotland showed that the new sovereigns and privy council retained the passions and methods of the old but this was the last occasion of judicial torture for political offences in scotland  payne was silent but was illegally imprisoned till his death  the proceedings of the restored general assembly were awaited with anxiety by the government  the extremists of the remnant the cameronians sent deputies to the kirk  they were opposed to acknowledging sovereigns who were the head of the prelatics in england and they not being supported by the assembly remained apart from the kirk and true to the covenants  much had passed which william dislikedthe abolition of patronage the persecution of episcopaliansand melville in 1691 was removed by the king from the commissionership  the highlands were still unsettled  in june 1691 breadalbane at heart a jacobite attempted to appease the chiefs by promises of money in settlement of various feuds especially that of the dispossessed macleans against the occupant of their lands argyll  breadalbane was known by hill the commander of fort william at inverlochy to be dealing between the clans and james as well as between william and the clans  william then campaigning in flanders was informed of this fact thought it of no importance and accepted a truce from july 1 to october 1 with buchan who commanded such feeble forces as still stood for james in the north at the same time william threatened the clans in the usual terms with fire and sword if the chiefs did not take the oaths to his government by january 1 1692  money and titles under the rank of earldoms were to be offered to macdonald of sleat maclean of dowart lochiel glengarry and clanranald if they would come in  all declined the baitif breadalbane really fished with it  it is plain contrary to lord macaulays statement that sir john dalrymple williams trusted man for scotland at this time hoped for breadalbanes success in pacifying the clans  but dalrymple by december 1691 wrote i think the clan donell must be rooted out and lochiel  he could not mean that he hoped to massacre so large a part of the population  he probably meant by punitive expeditions in the modern phraseby fire and sword in the style current thento break up the recalcitrants  meanwhile it was dalrymples hope to settle ancient quarrels about the superiorities of argyll over the camerons and the question of compensation for the lands reft by the argyll family from the macleans  before december 31 in fear of fire and sword the chiefs submitted except the greatest glengarry and the least in power macian or macdonald with his narrow realm of glencoe whence his men were used to plunder the cattle of their powerful neighbour breadalbane  dalrymple now desired not peace but the sword  by january 9 1692 dalrymple in london heard that glencoe had come in he had accidentally failed to come in by january 1 and dalrymple was sorry  by january 11 dalrymple knew that glencoe had not taken the oath before january 1 and rejoiced in the chance to root out that damnable sect  in fact in the end of december glencoe had gone to fort william to take the oaths before colonel hill but found that he must do so before the sheriff of the shire at remote inveraray  various accidents of weather delayed him the sheriff also was not at inveraray when glencoe arrived but administered the oaths on january 6  the document was taken to edinburgh where lord stair dalrymples father and others caused it to be deleted  glengarry was still unsworn but glengarry was too strong to be rooted out william ordered his commanding officer livingstone to extirpate that sect of thieves the glencoe men january 16  on the same day dalrymple sent down orders to hem in the macians and to guard all the passes by land or water from their glen  of the actual method of massacre employed dalrymple may have been ignorant but orders from court to spare none and to take no prisoners were received by livingstone on january 23  on february 1 campbell of glenlyon with 120 men was hospitably received by macian whose son alexander had married glenlyons niece on february 12 hill sent 400 of his inverlochy garrison to glencoe to join hands with 400 of argylls regiment under major duncanson  these troops were to guard the southern passes out of glencoe while hamilton was to sweep the passes from the north  at 5 am on february 13 the soldierguests of macian began to slay and plunder  men women and children were shot or bayoneted 1000 head of cattle were driven away but hamilton arrived too late  though the aged chief had been shot at once his sons took to the hills and the greater part of the population escaped with their lives thanks to hamiltons dilatoriness  all i regret is that any of the sect got away wrote dalrymple on march 5 and there is necessity to prosecute them to the utmost  news had already reached london that they are murdered in their beds  the newspapers however were silenced and the story was first given to europe in april by the paris gazette  the crime was unprecedented it had no precedent admits of no apology  many an expedition of fire and sword had occurred but never had there been a midnight massacre under trust of hosts by guests  king william on march 6 went off to his glorious wars on the continent probably hoping to hear that the fugitive macians were still being prosecutedif indeed he thought of them at all  but by october they were received into his peace  william was more troubled by the general assembly which refused to take oaths of allegiance to him and his wife and actually appointed a date for an assembly without his consent  when he gave it it was on condition that the members should take the oaths of allegiance  they refused it was the old deadlock but william at the last moment withdrew from the imposition of oaths of allegiancemoved it is said by mr carstares cardinal carstares who had been privy to the rye house plot  under queen anne however the conscientious preachers were compelled to take the oaths like mere laymen     chapter xxviii  darien   the scottish parliament of mayjuly 1695 held while william was abroad saw the beginning of evils for scotland  the affair of glencoe was examined into by a commission headed by tweeddale williams commissioner several judges sat in it  their report cleared william himself dalrymple it was found had exceeded his instructions  hill was exonerated  hamilton who commanded the detachment that arrived too late fled the country  william was asked to send home for trial duncanson and other butchers who were with his army  the king was also invited to deal with dalrymple as he thought fit  he thought fit to give dalrymple an indemnity and made him viscount stair with a grant of money but did not retain him in office  he did not send the subaltern butchers home for trial  many years later in 1745 the macians insisted on acting as guards of the house and family of the descendant of campbell of glenlyon the guest and murderer of the chief of glencoe  perhaps by way of a sop to the scots william allowed an act for the establishment of a scottish east india company to be passed on june 20 1695  he afterwards protested that in this matter he had been badly served probably meaning misinformed  the result was the darien expedition a great financial disaster for scotland and a terrible grievance  hitherto since the union of the crowns all scottish efforts to found trading companies as in england had been wrecked on english jealousy there had always been and to this new east india company there was a rival a preexisting english company  scottish acts for protection of home industries were met by english retaliation in a war of tariffs  scotland had prohibited the exportation of her raw materials such as wool but was cut off from english and other foreign markets for her cloths  the scots were more successful in secret and unlegalised trading with their kinsmen in the american colonies  the scottish east india companys aim was to sell scottish goods in many places india for example and it was secretly meant to found a factory and central mart on the isthmus of panama  for these ends capital was withdrawn from the new and unsuccessful manufacturing companies  the great scheme was the idea of william paterson born 1658 the fartravelled and financiallyspeculative son of a farmer in dumfriesshire  he was the projector or one of the projectors of the bank of england of 1694 investing 2000 pounds  he kept the darien part of his scheme for an east india company in the background and it seems that william when he granted a patent to that company knew nothing of this design to settle in or near the panama isthmus which was quite clearly within the spanish sphere of influence  when the philosopher john locke heard of the scheme he wished england to steal the idea and seize a port in darien it thus appears that he too was unaware that to do so was to inflict an insult and injury on spain  there is reason to suppose that the grant of the patent to the east india company was obtained by bribing some scottish politician or politicians unnamed though one name is not beyond probable conjecture  in any case paterson admitted english capitalists who took up half of the shares as the act of patent permitted them to do  by december william was writing that he had been illserved by some of my ministers  he had no notice of the details of the act of patent till he had returned to england and found english capitalists and the english parliament in a fury  the act committed william to interposing his authority if the ships of the company were detained by foreign powers and gave the adventurers leave to take reparation by force from their assailants this they later did when they captured in the firth of forth an english vessel the worcester  on the opening of the books of the new company in london october 1695 there had been a panic and a fall of twenty points in the shares of the english east india company  the english parliament had addressed william in opposition to the scots company  the english subscribers of half the paid up capital were terrorised and sold out  later hamburg investments were cancelled through williams influence  all lowland scotland hurried to investin the darkfor the darien part of the scheme was practically a secret it was vaguely announced that there was to be a settlement somewhere in africa or the indies or both materials of trade such as wigs combs bibles fishhooks and kidgloves were accumulated  offices were builtlater used as an asylum for pauper lunatics  when in july 1697 the secret of panama came out the english council of trade examined dampier the voyager and september announced that the territory had never been spains and that england ought to anticipate scotland by seizing golden island and the port on the mainland  in july 1698 the council of the intended scots colony was elected bought three ships and two tenders and despatched 1200 settlers with two preachers but with most inadequate provisions and flour as bad as that paid to assynt for the person of montrose  on october 30 in the gulf of darien they found natives who spoke spanish they learned that the nearest gold mines were in spanish hands and that the chiefs were carrying spanish insignia of office  by february 1699 the scots and spaniards were exchanging shots  presently a scottish ship cruising in search of supplies was seized by the spanish at carthagena the men lay in irons at seville till 1700  spain complained to william and the scots seized a merchant ship  the english governor of jamaica forbade his people by virtue of a letter addressed by the english government to all the colonies to grant supplies to the starving scots most of whom sailed away from the colony in june and suffered terrible things by sea and land  paterson returned to scotland  a new expedition which left leith on may 12 1699 found at darien some scots in two ships and remained on the scene distracted by quarrels till february 1700 when campbell of fonab sent with provisions in the speedy return from scotland arrived to find the spaniards assailing the adventurers  he cleared the spaniards out of their fort in fifteen minutes but the colonial council learned that spain was launching a small but adequate armada against them  after an honourable resistance the garrison capitulated and marched out with colours flying march 30  this occurred just when scotland was celebrating the arrival of the news of fonabs gallant feat of arms  at home the country was full of discontent williams agent at hamburg had prevented foreigners from investing in the scots company  english colonists had been forbidden to aid the scottish adventurers  two hundred thousand pounds several ships and many lives had been lost  it is very like 1641 wrote an onlooker so fierce were the passions that raged against william  the news of the surrender of the colonists increased the indignation  the king refused november 1700 to gratify the estates by regarding the darien colony as a legal enterprise  to do so was to incur war with spain and the anger of his english subjects  yet the colony had been legally founded in accordance with the terms of the act of patent  while the scots dwelt on this fact william replied that the colony being extinct circumstances were altered  the estates voted that darien was a lawful colony and 1701 in an address to the crown demanded compensation for the nations financial losses  william replied with expressions of sympathy and hopes that the two kingdoms would consider a scheme of union  a bill for union brought in through the english lords was rejected by the english commons  there was hardly an alternative between union and war between the two nations  war there would have been had the exiled prince of wales been brought up as a presbyterian  his father james vii died a few months before william iii passed away on march 7 1702  louis xiv acknowledged james prince of wales as james iii of england and ireland and viii of scotland and anne the boys aunt ascended the throne  as a stuart she was not unwelcome to the jacobites who hoped for various chances as anne was believed to be friendly to her nephew  in 1701 was passed an act for preventing wrongous imprisonment and against undue delay in trials  but nevile payne continued to be untried and illegally imprisoned  offenders generally could run their letters and protest if kept in durance untried for sixty days  the revolution of 168889 with williams very reluctant concessions had placed scotland in entirely new relations with england  scotland could now no longer be governed by the pen from london parliament could no longer be bridled and led at english will by the lords of the articles as the religious mainspring of scottish political life the domination of the preachers had been weakened by the new settlement of the kirk as the country was now set on commercial enterprises which england everywhere thwarted it was plain that the two kingdoms could not live together on the existing terms  union there must be or conquest as under cromwell yet an english war of conquest was impossible because it was impossible for scotland to resist  never would the country renew as in the old days the alliance of france for a french alliance meant the acceptance by scotland of a catholic king  england on her side if union came was accepting a partner with very poor material resources  as regards agriculture for example vast regions were untilled or tilled only in the straths and fertile spots by the hardy clansmen who could not raise oats enough for their own subsistence and periodically endured famines  in the ill years of william years of untoward weather distress had been extreme  in the fertile lowlands that old grievance insecurity of tenure and the raising of rents in proportion to improvements made by the tenants had baffled agriculture  enclosures were necessary for the protection of the crops but even if tenants or landlords had the energy or capital to make enclosures the neighbours destroyed them under cloud of night  the old labourservices were still extorted the tenants time and strength were not his own  land was exhausted by absence of fallows and lack of manure  the country was undrained lochs and morasses covered what is now fertile land and hillsides now in pasture were under the plough  the once prosperous linen trade had suffered from the war of tariffs  the life of the burghs political and municipal and trading was little advanced on the mediaeval model  the independent scot steadily resisted instruction from foreign and english craftsmen in most of the mechanical arts  laws for the encouragement of trades were passed and bore little fruit  companies were founded and were ruined by english tariffs and english competition  the most energetic of the population went abroad here they prospered in commerce and in military service while an enormous class of beggars lived on the hospitality of their neighbours at home  in such conditions of inequality it was plain that if there was to be a union the adjustment of proportions of taxation and of representation in parliament would require very delicate handling while the differences of church government were certain to cause jealousies and opposition     chapter xxix  preliminaries to the union   the scottish parliament was not dissolved at williams death nor did it meet at the time when legally it ought to have met  anne in a message expressed hopes that it would assent to union and promised to concur in any reasonable scheme for compensating the losers by the darien scheme  when parliament met queensberry being commissioner soon found it necessary june 30 1702 to adjourn  new officers of state were then appointed and there was a futile meeting between english and scottish commissioners chosen by the queen to consider the union  then came a general election 1703 which gave birth to the last scottish parliament  the commissioner queensberry and the other officers of state the court party were of course for union among them was prominent that wavering earl of mar who was so active in promoting the union and later precipitated the jacobite rising of 1715 there were in parliament the party of courtiers friends of england and union the party of cavaliers that is jacobites and the country party led by the duke of hamilton who was in touch with the jacobites but was quite untrustworthy and much suspected of desiring the crown of scotland for himself  queensberry cozened the cavaliersby promises of tolerating their episcopalian religioninto voting a bill recognising anne and then broke his promise  the bill for tolerating worship as practised by the episcopalians was dropped for the commissioner of the general assembly of the kirk declared that such toleration was the establishment of iniquity by law  queensberrys one aim was to get supply voted for war with france had begun  but the country and the cavalier parties refused supply till an act of security for religion liberty law and trade should be passed the majority decided that on the death of anne the estates should name as king of scotland a protestant representative of the house of stewart who should not be the successor to the english crown save under conditions guaranteeing scotland as a sovereign state with frequent parliaments and security for scottish navigation colonies trade and religion the act of security  it was also decided that landholders and the burghs should drill and arm their tenants and dependantsif protestant  queensberry refused to pass this act of security supply on the other side was denied and after a stormy scene queensberry prorogued parliament september 16 1703  in the excitement atholl had deserted the court party and voted with the majority  he had a great highland following he might throw it on the jacobite side and the infamous intriguer simon frazer the lord lovat of 1745 came over from france and betrayed to queensberry a real or a feigned intrigue of atholl with france and with the ministers of james viii called the pretender  atholl was the enemy of frazer a canting astute and unscrupulous ruffian  queensberry conceived that in a letter given to him by lovat he had irrefutable evidence against atholl as a conspirator and he allowed lovat to return to france where he was promptly imprisoned as a traitor atholl convinced anne of his own innocence and queensberry fell under ridicule and suspicion lost his office of commissioner and was superseded by tweeddale  in england the whole complex affair of lovats revelations was known as the scottish plot hamilton was involved or feared he might be involved and therefore favoured the new proposals of the courtiers and english party for placing limits on the prerogative of annes successor whoever he might be  in the estates july 1704 after months passed in constitutional chicanery the last years act of security was passed and touched with the sceptre and the house voted supply for six months  but owing to a fierce dispute on private businessnamely the raising of the question who were the persons accused in england of being engaged in the scottish plotno hint of listening to proposals for union was uttered  who could propose as commissioners to arrange union men who were involvedor in england had been accused of being involvedin the plot  scotland had not yet consented that whoever succeeded anne in england should also succeed in scotland  they retained a means of putting pressure on england the threat of having a separate king they had made and were making military preparations drill once amonth and england took up the gauntlet  the menacing attitude of scotland was debated on with much heat in the english upper house november 29 and a bill passed by the commons declared the retaliatory measures which england was ready to adopt  it was at once proved that england could put a much harder pinch on scotland than scotland could inflict on england  scottish drovers were no longer to sell cattle south of the border scottish ships trading with france were to be seized scottish coals and linen were to be excluded and regiments of regular troops were to be sent to the border if scotland did not accept the hanoverian succession before christmas 1705  if it came to war scotland could expect no help from her ancient ally france unless she raised the standard of king james  as he was a catholic the kirk would prohibit this measure so it was perfectly clear to every plain man that scotland must accept the union and make the best bargain she could  in spring 1705 the new duke of argyll red john of the battles a man of the sword and an accomplished orator was made commissioner and of course favoured the union as did queensberry and the other officers of state  friction between the two countries arose in spring when an edinburgh jury convicted and the mob insisted on the execution of an english captain green whose ship the worcester had been seized in the forth by roderick mackenzie secretary of the scottish east india company  green was supposed to have captured and destroyed a ship of the companys the speedy return which never did return  it was not proved that this ship had been greens victim but that he had committed acts of piracy is certain  the hanging of green increased the animosity of the sister kingdoms  when parliament met june 28 1705 it was a parliament of groups tweeddale and others turned out of office in favour of argylls government formed the flying squadron squadrone volante voting in whatever way would most annoy the government  argyll opened by proposing as did the queens message the instant discussion of the union july 3  the house preferred to deliberate on anything else and the leader of the jacobites or cavaliers lockhart of carnwath a very able sardonic man saw that this was for jacobite ends a tactical error  the more time was expended the more chance had queensberry to win votes for the union  fletcher of saltoun an independent and eloquent patriot and republican wasted time by impossible proposals  hamilton brought forward and by only two votes lost a proposal which england would never have dreamed of accepting  canny jacobites however abstained from voting and thence lockhart dates the ruin of his country supply at all events was granted and on that argyll adjourned  the queen was to select commissioners of both countries to negotiate the treaty of union among the commissioners lockhart was the only cavalier and he was merely to watch the case in the jacobite interest  the meetings of the two sets of commissioners began at whitehall on april 16  it was arranged that all proposals modifications and results should pass in writing and secrecy was to be complete  the scots desired union with home rule with a separate parliament  the english would negotiate only on the lines that the union was to be complete incorporating with one parliament for both peoples  by april 25 1706 the scots commissioners saw that on this point they must acquiesce the defeat of the french at ramilies may 23 proved that even if they could have leaned on the french france was a broken reed international reciprocity in trade complete freedom of trade at home and abroad they did obtain  as england thanks to william iii with his incessant continental wars had already a great national debt of which scotland owed nothing and as taxation in england was high while scottish taxes under the union would rise to the same level and to compensate for the darien losses the english granted a pecuniary equivalent may 10  they also did not raise the scottish taxes on windows lights coal malt and salt to the english level that of wartaxation  the equivalent was to purchase the scottish shares in the east india company with interest at five per cent up to may 1 1707  that grievance of the shareholders was thus healed what public debt scotland owed was to be paid the equivalent was about 400000 pounds and any part of the money unspent was to be given to improve fisheries and manufactures  the number of scottish members of the british parliament was fixed at fortyfive  on this point the scots felt that they were hardly used the number of their elected representatives of peers in the lords was sixteen  scotland retained her courts of law the feudal jurisdictions which gave to argyll and others almost princely powers were retained and scottish procedure in trials continued to vary much from the english model  appeals from the court of session had previously been brought before the parliament of scotland henceforth they were to be heard by the judges scots and english in the british house of lords  on july 23 1706 the treaty was completed on october 3 the scottish parliament met to debate on it with queensberry as commissioner  harley the english minister sent down the author of robinson crusoe to watch spy argue persuade and secretly report and de foes letters contain the history of the session  the parties in parliament were thus variously disposed the cavaliers including hamilton had been approached by louis xiv and king james the pretender but had not committed themselves  queensberry always knew every risky step taken by hamilton who began to take several but in each case received a friendly warning which he dared not disregard  at the opposite pole the cameronians and other extreme presbyterians loathed the union and at last novemberdecember a scheme for the cameronians and the clans of angus and perthshire to meet in arms in edinburgh and clear out the parliament caused much alarm  but hamilton before the arrangement came to a head was terrorised and the intentions of the cameronians as far as their records prove had never been officially ratified by their leaders 250  there was plenty of popular rioting during the session but argyll rode into edinburgh at the head of the horse guards and leven held all the gates with drafts from the garrison of the castle  the commissioners of the general assembly made protests on various points but were pacified after the security of the kirk had been guaranteed  finally hamilton prepared a parliamentary mine which would have blown the treaty of union skyhigh but on the night when he should have appeared in the house and set the match to his petardhe had toothache  this was the third occasion on which he had deserted the cavaliers the opposition fell to pieces  the squadrone volante and the majority of the peers supported the bill which was passed  on january 16 1707 the treaty of union was touched with the sceptre and there is the end of an auld sang said seafield  in may 1707 a solemn service was held at st pauls to commemorate the union  there was much friction in the first year of the union over excisemen and taxcollectors smuggling began to be a recognised profession  meanwhile since 1707 a colonel hooke had been acting in scotland nominally in jacobite really rather in french interests  hookes intrigues were in part betrayed by de foes agent ker of kersland an amusingly impudent knave and were thwarted by jealousies of argyll and hamilton  by deceptive promises for he was himself deceived into expecting the aid of the ulster protestants hooke induced louis xiv to send five menofwar twentyone frigates and only two transports to land james in scotland march 1708  the equinoctial gales and the severe illness of james who insisted on sailing delayed the start the men on the outlook for the fleet were intoxicated and forbin the french commander observing english ships of war coming towards the firth of forth fled refusing jamess urgent entreaties to be landed anywhere on the coast march 24 it was believed that had he landed only with a valet the discontented country would have risen for their native king  in parliament 17101711 the cavalier scottish members by tory support secured the release from prison of a rev mr greenshields an episcopalian who prayed for queen anne indeed but had used the liturgy the preachers were also galled by the imposition on them of an abjuration oath compelling them to pray for prelatical queen anne  lay patronage of livings was also restored 1712 after many vicissitudes and this thorn rankled in the kirk causing everwidening strife for more than a century  the imposition of a malt tax produced so much discontent that even argyll with all the scottish members of parliament was eager for the repeal of the act of union and proposed it in the house of peers when it was defeated by a small majority  in 1712 when about to start on a mission to france hamilton was slain in a duel by lord mohun  according to a statement of lockharts cavaliers were to look for the best from hamiltons mission it is fairly clear that he was to bring over james in disguise to england as in thackerays novel esmond  but the sword of mohun broke the jacobite plans  other hopes expired when bolingbroke and harley quarrelled and queen anne died august 1 1714  the best cause in europe was lost cried bishop atterbury for want of spirit  he would have proclaimed james as king but no man supported him and the elector of hanover george i peacefully accepted the throne     chapter xxx  george i   for a year the scottish jacobites and bolingbroke who fled to france and became jamess minister mismanaged the affairs of that most unfortunate of princes  by february 1715 the earl of mar who had been distrusted and disgraced by george i was arranging with the clans for a rising while aid from charles xii of sweden was expected from march to august 1715  it is notable that charles had invited dean swift to visit his court when swift was allied with bolingbroke and oxford  from the author of gulliver charles no doubt hoped to get a trustworthy account of their policy  the fated rising of 1715 was occasioned by the duke of berwicks advice to james that he must set forth to scotland or lose his honour  the prince therefore acting hastily on news which two or three days later proved to be false in a letter to mar fixed august 10 for a rising  the orders were at once countermanded when news proving their futility was received but jamess messenger allan cameron was detained on the road and mar not waiting for jamess answer to his own last despatch advising delay left london for scotland without a commission on august 27 held an assembly of the chiefs and still without a commission from james raised the standard of the king on september 6 254a  the folly of mar was consummate  he knew that ormonde the hope of the english jacobites had deserted his post and had fled to france  meanwhile louis xiv was dying he died on august 30 and the regent dorleans at the utmost would only connive at not assist jamess enterprise  everything was contrary everywhere was ignorance and confusion  lord john drummonds hopeful scheme for seizing edinburgh castle september 8 was quieted pulveris exigui jactu the gentlemen were powdering their hairdrinking at a tavernand bungled the business  the folly of government offered a chance in scotland they had but 2000 regulars at stirling where forth bridles the wild highlandman  mar who promptly occupied perth though he had some 12000 broadswords continued till the end to make perth his headquarters  a montrose a dundee even a prince charles would have masked argyll at stirling and seized edinburgh  in october 21november 3 berwick while urging james to sail absolutely refused to accompany him  the plans of ormonde for a descent on england were betrayed by colonel maclean in french service november 4  in disguise and narrowly escaping from murderous agents of stair british ambassador to france on his road 254b james journeyed to st malo november 8  in scotland the macgregors made a futile attempt on dumbarton castle while glengarry and the macleans advanced on inveraray castle negotiated with argylls brother the earl of islay and marched back to strathfillan  in northumberland forster and derwentwater with some catholic foxhunters in galloway the pacific viscount kenmure cruised vaguely about and joined forces  mackintosh of borlum by a wellconcealed movement carried a highland detachment of 1600 men across the firth of forth by boats october 1213 with orders to join forster and kenmure and arouse the border  but on approaching edinburgh mackintosh found argyll with 500 dragoons ready to welcome him mar took no advantage of argylls absence from stirling and mackintosh when argyll returned thither joined kenmure and forster occupied kelso and marched into lancashire  the jacobite forces were pitifully illsupplied they had very little ammunition the great charge against bolingbroke was that he sent none from france they seem to have had no idea that powder could be made by the art of man they were torn by jealousies and dispirited by their observation of mars incompetence  we cannot pursue in detail the story of the futile campaign  on november 12 the mixed highland lowland and english command found itself cooped up in preston and after a very gallant defence of the town the english leaders surrendered to the kings mercy after arranging an armistice which made it impossible for mackintosh to cut his way through the english ranks and retreat to the north  about 1600 prisoners were taken derwentwater and kenmure were later executed  forster and nithsdale made escapes charles wogan a kinsman of the chivalrous wogan of 1650 and mackintosh with six others forced their way out of newgate prison on the night before their trial  wogan was to make himself heard of again mar had thrown away his highlanders with little ammunition and without orders on a perfectly aimless and hopeless enterprise  meanwhile he himself at perth had been doing nothing while in the north simon frazer lord lovat escaped from his french prison raised his clan and took the castle of inverness for king george  he thus earned a pardon for his private and public crimes and he lived to ruin the jacobite cause and lose his own head in 174546  while the north rossshire and inverness were daunted and thwarted by the success of lovat mar led his whole force from perth to dunblane apparently in search of a ford over forth  his frazers and many of his gordons deserted on november 11 on november 12 mar at ardoch the site of an old roman camp learned that argyll was marching through dunblane to meet him  next day mars force occupied the crest of rising ground on the wide swell of sheriffmuir his left was all disorderly horse mixed with foot his right with the fighting clans was well ordered but the nature of the ground hid the two wings of the army from each other  on the right the macdonalds and macleans saw clanranald fall and on glengarrys cry vengeance today they charged with the claymore and swept away the regulars of argyll as at killiecrankie and prestonpans but as the clans pursued and slew their officers whispered that their own centre and left were broken and flying  argyll had driven them to allan water his force returning came within close range of the victorious right of mar  oh for one hour of dundee cried gordon of glenbucket but neither party advanced to the shock  argyll retired safely to dunblane while mar deserted his guns and powdercarts and hurried to perth  he had lost the gallant young earl of strathmore and the brave clanranald on argylls side his brother islay was wounded and the earl of forfar was slain  though it was a drawn battle it proved that mar could not move his forces began to scatter huntly was said to have behaved ill  it was known that dutch auxiliaries were to reinforce argyll and men began to try to make terms of surrender  huntly rode off to his own country and on december 22 old style james landed at peterhead  james had no lack of personal courage  he had charged again and again at malplaquet with the household cavalry of louis xiv and he had encountered great dangers of assassination on his way to st malo  but constant adversity had made him despondent and resigned while he saw facts as they really were with a sad lucidity  when he arrived in his kingdom the whig clans of the north had daunted seaforths mackenzies while in the south argyll with his dutch and other fresh reinforcements had driven mars men out of fife  writing to bolingbroke james described the situation  mar with scarcely any ammunition was facing argyll with 11000 men the north was held in force by the whig clans mackays rosses munroes and frazers deep snow alone delayed the advance of argyll now stimulated by the hostile cadogan marlboroughs favourite and it was perfectly plain that all was lost  for the head of james 100000 pounds was offered by hanoverian chivalry he was suffering from fever and ague the spanish gold that had at last been sent to him was lost at sea off dundee and it is no wonder that james never gay presented to his troops a disconsolate and discouraging aspect  on january 29 his army evacuated perth james wept at the order to burn the villages on argylls line of march and made a futile effort to compensate the people injured  from montrose february 314 he wrote for aid to the french regent but next day urged by mar and unknown to his army he with mar set sail for france  this evasion was doubtless caused by a circumstance unusual in warfare there was a price of 100000 pounds on jamess head moreover his force had not one days supply of powder  marshal keith brother of the earl marischal who retreated to the isles says that perhaps one days supply of powder might be found at aberdeen  nevertheless the fighting clans were eager to meet argyll and would have sold their lives at a high price  they scattered to their western fastnesses  the main political result apart from executions and the passing of forfeited estates into the management of that noted economist sir richard steele and other commissioners wasthe disgrace of argyll  he who with a petty force had saved scotland was represented by cadogan and by his political enemies as dilatory and disaffected  the duke lost all his posts and in 1716 when james had hopes from sweden islay argylls brother was negotiating with jacobite agents  james was creating him a peer of england  in scotland much indignation was aroused by the sending of scottish prisoners of war out of the kingdom for trialnamely to carlisleand by other severities  the union had never been more unpopular the country looked on itself as conquered and had no means of resistance for james now residing at avignon was a catholic and any insults and injuries from england were more tolerable than a restored nationality with a catholic king  into the jacobite hopes and intrigues the eternal web which from 1689 to 1763 was ever being woven and broken it is impossible here to enter though in the now published stuart papers the details are well known james was driven from avignon to italy to spain finally to live a pensioner at rome  the luckless attempt of the earl marischal keith his brother and lord george murray brother of the duke of atholl to invade scotland on the west with a small spanish force was crushed on june 10 1719 in the pass of glenshiel  two or three months later james returning from spain married the fair and hapless princess clementina sobieska whom charles wogan in an enterprise truly romantic had rescued from prison at innspruck and conveyed across the alps  from this wedding made wretched by the disappointment of the bride with her melancholy lordalways busied with political secrets from which she was excludedwas born on december 31 1720 charles edward stuart from his infancy the hope of the jacobite party from his cradle surrounded by the intrigues the jealousies the adulations of an exiled court and the quarrels of protestants and catholics irish scottish and english  thus among changes of tutors and ministers as the discovery or suspicion of treachery the bigotry of clementina and the pressure of other necessities might permit was that child reared whose name at least has received the crown of scottish affection and innumerable tributes of scottish song     chapter xxxi  the argathelians and the squadrone   leaving the fortunes of the jacobite party at their lowest ebb and turning to the domestic politics of scotland after 1719 we find that if it be happiness to have no history scotland had much reason to be content  there was but a dull personal strife between the faction of argyll and his brother islay called the argathelians from the latinised argathelia or argyll and the other faction known since the union as the squadrone volante or flying squadron who professed to be patriotically independent  as to argyll he had done all that man might do for george i  but as we saw the reports of cadogan and the jealousy of george who is said to have deemed argyll too friendly with his detested heir caused the disgrace of the duke in 1716 and the squadrone held the spoils of office  but in februaryapril 1719 george reversed his policy heaped argyll with favours made him as duke of greenwich a peer of england and gave him the high stewardship of the household  at this time all the sixteen representative peers of scotland favoured for various reasons of their own a proposed peerage bill  the prince of wales might when he came to the throne swamp the lords by large new creations in his own interest and the bill laid down that henceforth not more than six peers exclusive of members of the royal family should be created by any sovereign while in place of sixteen representative scotland should have twentyfive permanent peers  from his new hatred of the prince of wales argyll favoured the bill as did the others of the sixteen of the moment because they would be among the permanencies the scottish jacobite peers not representatives and the commons of both countries opposed the bill  the election of a scottish representative peer at this juncture led to negotiations between argyll and lockhart as leader of the suffering jacobites but terms were not arrived at the government secured a large whig majority in a general election 1722 and walpole began his long tenure of office    enclosure riots   in 1724 there were some popular discontents  enclosures as we saw had scarcely been known in scotland when they were made men women and children took pleasure in destroying them under cloud of night enclosures might keep a mans cattle on his own ground keep other mens off it and secure for the farmer his own manure  that good jacobite mackintosh of borlum who in 1715 led the highlanders to preston in 1729 wrote a book recommending enclosures and plantations  but when in 1724 the lairds of galloway and dumfriesshire anticipated and acted on his plan which in this case involved evictions of very indolent and ruinous farmers the tenants rose  multitudes of levellers destroyed the loose stone dykes and slaughtered cattle  they had already been passive resisters of rent the military were called in women were in the forefront of the brawls which were not quieted till the middle of 1725 when lord stair made an effort to introduce manufactures    malt riots   other disturbances began in a resolution of the house of commons at the end of 1724 not to impose a malt tax equal to that of england this had been successfully resisted in 1713 but to levy an additional sixpence on every barrel of ale and to remove the bounties on exported grain  at the union scotland had for the time been exempted from the malt tax specially devised to meet the expenses of the french war of that date  now in 17241725 scotland was up in arms to resist the attempt to rob a poor man of his beer  but walpole could put force on the scottish members of parliamenta parcel of low people that could not subsist says lockhart without their board wages  walpole threatened to withdraw the ten guineas hitherto paid weekly by government to those legislators  he offered to drop the sixpence on beer and put threepence on every bushel of malt a half of the english tax  on june 23 1725 the tax was to be exacted  the consequence was an attack on the military by the mob of glasgow who wrecked the house of their member in parliament campbell of shawfield  some of the assailants were shot general wade and the lord advocate forbes of culloden marched a force on glasgow the magistrates of the town were imprisoned but released on bail while in edinburgh the master brewers ordered by the court of session to raise the price of their ale struck for a week some were imprisoned others were threatened or cajoled and deserted their union the one result was that the chief of the squadrone the duke of roxburgh lost his secretaryship for scotland and argylls brother islay with the resolute forbes of culloden became practically the governors of the country  the secretaryship indeed was for a time abolished but islay practically wielded the power that had so long been in the hands of the secretary as agent of the court    the highlands   the clans had not been disarmed after 1715 moreover 6000 muskets had been brought in during the affair that ended at glenshiel in 1719 general wade was commissioned in 1724 to examine and report on the highlands lovat had already sent in a report  he pointed out that lowlanders paid blackmail for protection to highland raiders and that independent companies of highlanders paid by government had been useful but were broken up in 1717  what lovat wanted was a company and pay for himself  wade represented the force of the clans as about 22000 claymores half whig the extreme north and the campbells half jacobite  the commandants of forts should have independent companies cavalry should be quartered between inverness and perth and quarter sessions should be held at fort william and ruthven in badenoch  in 1725 wade disarmed seaforths clan the mackenzies easily for seaforth then in exile was on bad terms with james and wished to come home with a pardon  glengarry clanranald glencoe appin lochiel clan vourich and the gordons affected submissionbut only handed over two thousand rusty weapons of every sort  lovat did obtain an independent company later withdrawnwith results  the clans were by no means disarmed but wade did from 1725 to 1736 construct his famous military roads and bridges interconnecting the forts  the death of george i june 11 1727 induced james to hurry to lorraine and communicate with lockhart  but there was nothing to be done clementina had discredited her husband even in scotland much more in england by her hysterical complaints and her hatred of every man employed by james inflamed the petty jealousies and feuds among the exiles of his court  no man whom he could select would have been approved of by the party  to the bishops of the persecuted episcopalian remnant quarrelling over details of ritual called the usages james vainly recommended forbearance in love  lockhart disgusted with the clergy and siding with clementina against her husband believed that some of the wrangling churchmen betrayed the channel of his communications with his king 1727  islay gave lockhart a hint to disappear and he sailed from scotland for holland on april 8 1727  since james dismissed bolingbroke every one of his ministers was suspected by one faction or another of the party as a traitor atterbury denounced mar lockhart denounced hay titular earl of inverness clementina told feminine tales for which even the angry lockhart could find no evidence  james was the butt of every slanderous tongue but absolutely nothing against his moral character or his efforts to do his best or his tolerance and lack of suspiciousness can be wrung from documents 264  by 1734 the elder of jamess two sons prince charles was old enough to show courage and to thrust himself under fire in the siege of gaeta where his cousin the duc de liria was besieging the imperialists  he won golden opinions from the army but was already too strong for his tutorsmurray and sir thomas sheridan  he had both protestant and catholic governors between them he learned to spell execrably in three languages and sat loose to catholic doctrines  in january 1735 died his mother who had found refuge from her troubles in devotion  the grief of james and of the boys was acute  in 1736 lovat was looking towards the rising sun of prince charles was accused by a witness of enabling john roy stewart jacobite and poet to break prison at inverness and of sending by him a message of devotion to james from whom he expected a dukedom  lovat therefore lost his sheriffship and his independent company and tried to attach himself to argyll when the affair of the porteous riot caused a coldness between argyll and the english government 17361737    the porteous riot   the affair of porteous is so admirably well described in the heart of midlothian and recent research 265 has thrown so little light on the mystery if mystery there were that a brief summary of the tale may suffice  in the spring of 1736 two noted smugglers wilson and robertson were condemned to death  they had while in prison managed to widen the space between the windowbars of their cell and would have escaped but wilson a very stoutly built man went first and stuck in the aperture so that robertson had no chance  the pair determined to attack their guards in church where as usual they were to be paraded and preached at on the sunday preceding their execution  robertson leaped up and fled with the full sympathy of a large and interested congregation while wilson grasped a guard with each hand and a third with his teeth thus robertson got clean awayto holland it was saidwhile wilson was to be hanged on april 14  the acting lieutenant of the town guardan unpopular body mainly highlanderswas john porteous famous as a golfer but by the account of his enemies notorious as a brutal and callous ruffian  the crowd in the grassmarket was great but there was no attempt at a rescue  the mob however threw large stones at the guard who fired killing or wounding as usual harmless spectators  the case for porteous as reported in the state trials was that the attack was dangerous that the plan was to cut down and resuscitate wilson that porteous did not order but tried to prevent the firing and that neither at first nor in a later skirmish at the west bow did he fire himself  there was much cross swearing at the trial of porteous july 20 the jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to be hanged on september 8  a petition from him to queen caroline george ii was abroad drew attention to palpable discrepancies in the hostile evidence both parties in parliament backed his application and on august 28 a delay of justice for six weeks was granted  indignation was intense  an intended attack on the tolbooth where porteous lay had been matter of rumour three days earlier the prisoner should have been placed in the castle  at 10 pm on the night of september 7 the magistrates heard that boys were beating a drum and ordered the town guard under arms but the mob who had already secured the towns gates disarmed the veterans  mr lindsay lately provost escaped by the potter row gate near the old fatal kirkofield and warned general moyle in the castle  but moyle could not introduce soldiers without a warrant  before a warrant could arrive the mob had burned down the door of the tolbooth captured porteouswho was hiding up the chimneycarried him to the grassmarket and hanged him to a dyers pole  the only apparent sign that persons of rank above that of the mob were concerned was the leaving of a guinea in a shop whence they took the necessary rope  the magistrates had been guilty of gross negligence  the mob was merely a resolute mob but islay in london suspected that the political foes of the government were engaged or that the cameronians who had been renewing the covenants were concerned  islay hurried to edinburgh where no evidence could be extracted  the high flyers of our scottish church he wrote have made this infamous murder a point of conscience     all the lower rank of the people who have distinguished themselves by the pretensions of superior sanctity speak of this murder as the hand of god doing justice  they went by the precedent of the murder of archbishop sharp it appears  in the lords february 1737 a bill was passed for disabling the provostone wilsonfor public employment destroying the town charter abolishing the town guard and throwing down the gate of the nether bow  argyll opposed the bill in the commons all scottish members were against it walpole gave way  wilson was dismissed and a fine of 2000 pounds was levied and presented to the widow of porteous  an act commanding preachers to read monthly for a year in church a proclamation bidding their hearers aid the cause of justice against the murderers was an insult to the kirk from an assembly containing bishops  it is said that at least half of the ministers disobeyed with impunity  it was impossible of course to evict half of the preachers in the country  argyll now went into opposition against walpole and at least listened to keithlater the great fieldmarshal of frederick the great and brother of the exiled earl marischal  in 1737 the jacobites began to stir again a committee of five chiefs and lords was formed to manage their affairs  john murray of broughton went to rome and lost his heart to prince charlesnow a tall handsome lad of seventeen with large brown eyes and when he pleased a very attractive manner  to murray more than to any other man was due the rising of 1745  meanwhile in secular affairs scotland showed nothing more remarkable than the increasing dislike strengthened by argyll of walpoles government     chapter xxxii  the first secession   for long we have heard little of the kirk which between 1720 and 1740 passed through a cycle of internal storms  she had been little vexed either during her years of triumph or defeat by heresy or schism  but now the doctrines of antoinette bourignon a french lady mystic reached scotland and won the sympathies of some students of divinityincluding the rev john simson of an old clerical family which had been notorious since the reformation for the turbulence of its members  in 1714 and again in 1717 mr simson was acquitted by the assembly on the charges of being a jesuit a socinian and an arminian but was warned against a tendency to attribute too much to natural reason  in 172629 he was accused of minimising the doctrines of the creed of st athanasius and tending to the arian heresylately raked out of hell said the kirk session of portmoak 1725 addressing the sympathetic presbytery of kirkcaldy  at the assembly of 1726 that presbytery with others assailed mr simson who was in bad health and could talk of nothing but the council of nice  a committee including mars brother lord grange who took such strong measures with his wife lady grange forcibly translating her to the isle of st kilda inquired into the views of mr simsons own presbyterythat of glasgow  this presbytery crossexamined mr simsons pupils and mr simson observed that the proceedings were an unfruitful work of darkness  moreover mr simson was of the party of the squadrone while his assailants were argathelians  a large majority of the assembly gave the verdict that mr simson was a heretic finally though in 1728 his answers to questions would have satisfied good st athanasius mr simson found himself in the ideal position of being released from his academic duties but confirmed in his salary  the lenient goodnature of this decision with some other grievances set fire to a mine which blew the kirk in twain  the presbytery of auchterarder had set up a kind of standard of their ownthe auchterarder creedwhich included this formula it is not sound or orthodox to teach that we must forsake sin in order to our coming to christ and instating us in covenant with god  the general assembly condemned this part of the creed of auchterarder  the rev mr hog looking for weapons in defence of auchterarder republished part of a forgotten book of 1646 the marrow of modern divinity  the work appears to have been written by a speculative hairdresser an independent  a copy of the marrow was found by the famous mr boston of ettrick in the cottage of a parishioner  from the marrow he sucked much advantage its doctrines were grateful to the sympathisers with auchterarder and the republication of the book rent the kirk  in 1720 a committee of the general assembly condemned a set of propositions in the marrow as tending to antinomianism the doctrine that the saints cannot sin professed by trusty tompkins in woodstock butas in the case of the five condemned propositions of janseniusthe auchterarder party denied that the heresies could be found in the marrow  it was the old quarrel between faith and works  the clerical petitioners in favour of the marrow were rebuked by the assembly may 21 1722 they protested against a merely human majority in the assembly they appealed to the word of god to which the majority also appealed and there was a period of passion but schism had not yet arrived  the five or six friends of the marrow really disliked moral preaching as opposed to weekly discourses on the legal technicalities of justification sanctification and adoption  they were also opposed to the working of the act which in 1712 restored lay patronage  if the assembly enforced the law of the land in this matter and it did the assembly sinned against the divine right of congregations to elect their own preachers  men of this way of thinking were led by the rev mr ebenezer erskine a poet who in 1714 addressed an ode to george i  he therein denounced subverting patronage and           the woful dubious abjuration    which gave the clergy ground for speculation  but a jacobite song struck the same note     let not the abjuration    impose upon the nation  and george was deaf to the muse of mr erskine  in 1732 1733 mr erskine in sermons concerning patronage offended the assembly would not apologise appeared to a lay reader to claim direct inspiration and with three other brethren constituted himself and them into a presbytery  among their causes of separation or rather of deciding that the kirk had separated from them was the salary of emeritus professor simson  the new presbytery declared that the covenants were still and were eternally binding on scotland in fact these preachers were platonically for going back to the old ecclesiastical claims with the old war of church and state  they naturally denounced the act of 1736 which abolished the burning of witches  after a period of longsuffering patience and conciliatory efforts in 1740 the assembly deposed the seceders  in 1747 a party among the seceders excommunicated mr erskine and his brother one of those who handed mr erskine over to satan if the old formula were retained was his soninlaw  the feuds of burghers and antiburghers persons who were ready to take or refused to take the burgess oath new lights and old lights lasted very long and had evil consequences  as the populace love the headiest doctrines they preferred preachers in proportion as they leaned towards the marrow while lay patrons preferred candidates of the opposite views the assembly must either keep the law and back the patrons or break the law and cease to be a state church  the corruption of patronage was often notorious on one side on the other the desirability of burning witches and the belief in the eternity of the covenants were articles of faith and such articles were not to the taste of the moderates educated clergymen of the new school  thus arose the war of high flyers and moderates within the kirka war conducing to the great disruption of 1843 in which gallant little auchterarder was again in the foremost line     chapter xxxiii  the last jacobite rising   while the kirk was vainly striving to assuage the tempers of mr erskine and his friends the jacobites were preparing to fish in troubled waters in 1739 walpole was forced to declare war against spain and walpole had previously sounded james as to his own chances of being trusted by that exiled prince  james thought that walpole was merely angling for information  meanwhile jacobite affairs were managed by two rivals macgregor calling himself drummond of balhaldy and murray of broughton the sanguine balhaldy induced france to suppose that the jacobites in england and scotland were much more united powerful and ready for action than they really were when argyll left office in 1742 while walpole fell from power carteret and the duke of newcastle succeeding in 1743 murray found that france though now at war with england over the spanish succession was holding aloof from the jacobite cause though plied with flourishing and fabulous reports from balhaldy and the jacobite lord sempill  but in december 1743 on the strength of alleged jacobite energy in england balhaldy obtained leave from france to visit rome and bring prince charles  the prince had kept himself in training for war and was eager  taking leave of his father for the last time charles drove out of rome on january 9 1744 evaded in disguise every trap that was set for him and landed at antibes reaching paris on february 10  louis did not receive him openly if he received him at all the prince lurked at gravelines in disguise with the earl marischal while winds and waves half ruined and the approach of a british fleet drove into port a french fleet of invasion under roqueville march 6 7 1744  the prince wrote to sempill that he was ready and willing to sail for scotland in an open boat  in july 1744 he told murray that he would come next summer if he had no other companion than his valet  he nearly kept his word nor did murray resolutely oppose his will  at the end of may 1745 murrays servant brought a letter from the prince fall back fall edge he would land in the highlands in july  lochiel regretted the decision but said that as a man of honour he would join his prince if he arrived  on july 2 the prince left nantes in the dutillet usually styled la doutelle  he brought some money he had pawned the sobieski rubies some arms tullibardine his governor sheridan parson kelly the titular duke of atholl sir john macdonald a banker sullivan and one buchananthe seven men of moidart  on july 20 his consort the elizabeth fought the lion captain brett off the lizard both antagonists were crippled  on july 22august 2 charles passed the night on the little isle of eriskay appealed vainly to macleod and macdonald of sleat was urged at kinlochmoidart by the macdonalds to return to france but swept them off their feet by his resolution and with lochiel and the macdonalds raised the standard at the head of glenfinnan on august 1930  the english government had already offered 30000 pounds for the princes head  the clans had nothing to gain they held that they had honour to preserve they remembered montrose they put it to the touch and followed prince charlie  the strength of the princes force was first the macdonalds  on august 16 keppoch had cut off two companies of the royal scots near loch lochy but the chief of glengarry was old and wavering young glengarry captured on his way from france could not be with his clan his young brother aeneas led till his accidental death after the battle of falkirk  of the camerons it is enough to say that their leader was the gentle lochiel and that they were worthy of their chief  the macphersons came in rather late under cluny  the frazers were held back by the crafty lovat whose doubledealing with the abstention of macleod who was sworn to the cause and of macdonald of sleat ruined the enterprise clan chattan was headed by the beautiful lady mackintosh whose husband adhered to king george  of the dispossessed macleans some 250 were gathered under maclean of drimnin and of that resolute band some fifty survived culloden  these western clans including 220 stewarts of appin under ardshiel were the steel point of charless weapon to them should be added the macgregors under james mor son of rob roy a shifty character but a hero in fight  to resist these clans the earliest to join sir john cope commanding in scotland had about an equal force of all arms say 2500 to 3000 men scattered in all quarters and with very few fieldpieces  tweeddale holding the revived office of secretary for scotland was on the worst terms as leader of the squadrone with his argathelian rival islay now through the recent death of his brother red ian of the battles duke of argyll  scottish whigs were not encouraged to arm  the prince marched south while cope who had concentrated at stirling marched north to intercept him  at dalnacardoch he learned that charles was advancing to meet him in corryarrick pass here came in ardshiel glencoe and a glengarry reinforcement  at dalwhinnie cope found that the clans held the pass which is very defensible  he dared not face them and moved by ruthven in badenoch to inverness where he vainly expected to be met by the great whig clans of the north  joined now by cluny charles moved on that old base of montrose the castle of blair of atholl where the exiled duke commonly called marquis of tullibardine was received with enthusiasm  in the midregion between highland and lowland the ladies lady lude and the rest simply forced their sons brothers and lovers into arms  while charles danced and made friends and tasted his first pineapple at blair james mor took the fort of inversnaid  at perth september 410 charles was joined by the duke of perth the ogilvys under lord ogilvy some drummonds under lord strathallan the oliphants of gask and 200 robertsons of struan lord george murray brother of the duke of atholl who had been out in 1715 out in 1719 and later was un reconcilie came in and with him came discord  he had dealt as a friend and ally with cope at crieff his loyalty to either side was thus not unnaturally dubious he was suspected by murray of broughton envied by sullivan a soldier of some experience and though he was loyal to the lastthe best organiser and the most daring leadercharles never trusted him and his temper was always crossing that of the prince  the race for edinburgh now began cope bringing his troops by sea from aberdeen and charles doing what mar in 1715 had never ventured  he crossed the forth by the fords of frew six miles above stirling passed within gunshot of the castle and now there was no force between him and edinburgh save the demoralised dragoons of colonel gardiner  the sole use of the dragoons was wherever they came to let the world know that the clans were at their heels  on september 16 charles reached corstorphine and gardiners dragoons fell back on coltbridge  on the previous day the town had been terribly perturbed  the old walls never sound were dilapidated and commanded by houses on the outside volunteers were scarce and knew not how to load a musket  on sunday september 15 during sermontime the bells were rung backwards the drums they were beat the volunteers being told to march against the clans listened to the voices of mothers and aunts and of their own hearts and melted like a mist  hamiltons dragoons and ninety of the late porteouss town guard sallied forth joining gardiners men at coltbridge  a few of the mounted jacobite gentry such as lord elcho eldest son of the earl of wemyss trotted up to inspect the dragoons who fled and drew bridle only at musselburgh six miles east of edinburgh  the magistrates treated through a caddie or streetmessenger with the prince  he demanded surrender the bailies went and came in a hackney coach between charless quarters grays mill and edinburgh but on their return about 3 am lochiel with the camerons rushed in when the nether bow gate was opened to admit the cab of the magistrates  murray had guided the clan round by merchiston  at noon charles entered that unhappy palace of his race holyrood and king james was proclaimed at edinburgh cross while the beautiful mrs murray mounted distributed white cockades  edinburgh provided but few volunteers though the ladies tried to force them out  meanwhile cope was landing his men at dunbar from mr john home author of douglas a tragedy he learnt that charless force was under 2000 strong  he himself had counting the dragoons an almost equal strength with six fieldpieces manned by sailors  on september 20 cope advanced from haddington while charles with all the carriages he could collect for ambulance duty set forth from his camp at duddingston loch under arthurs seat  cope took the low road near the sea while charles took the high road holding the ridge till from birsley brae he beheld cope on the low level plain between seaton and prestonpans  the manoeuvres of the clans forced cope to change his front but wherever he went his men were more or less cooped up and confined to the defensive with the park wall on their rear  meanwhile mr anderson of whitburgh a local sportsman who had shot ducks in the morass on copes left brought to charles news of a practicable path through that marsh  even so the path was wet as high as the knee says ker of graden who had reconnoitred the british under fire  he was a roxburghshire laird and there was with the prince no better officer  in the grey dawn the clans waded through the marsh and leaped the ditch charles was forced to come with the second line fifty yards behind the first  the macdonalds held the right as they said they had done at bannockburn the camerons and macgregors were on the left they cast their plaids drew their blades and after enduring an irregular fire swept the redcoat ranks away they ran like rabets wrote charles in a genuine letter to james  gardiner was cut down his entire troop having fled while he was directing a small force of foot which stood its ground  charles stated his losses at a hundred killed and wounded all by gunshot  only two of the six fieldpieces were discharged by colonel whitefoord who was captured  friends and foes agree in saying that the prince devoted himself to the care of the wounded of both sides  lord george murray states copes losses killed wounded and taken at 3000 murray at under 1000  the prince would fain have marched on england but his force was thinned by desertions and english reinforcements would have been landed in his rear  for a month he had to hold court in edinburgh adored by the ladies to whom he behaved with a coldness of which charles ii would not have approved  these are my beauties he said pointing to a burly bearded highland sentry  he requisitioned public money and such horses and fodder as he could procure but to spare the townsfolk from the guns of the castle he was obliged to withdraw his blockade  he sent messengers to france asking for aid but received little though the marquis boyer deguilles was granted as a kind of representative of louis xv  his envoys to sleat and macleod sped ill and lovat only dallied france only hesitated while dutch and english regiments landed in the thames and marched to join general wade at newcastle  charles himself received reinforcements amounting to some 1500 men under lord ogilvy old lord pitsligo the master of strathallan drummond the brave lord balmerino and the viscount dundee  a treaty of alliance with france made at fontainebleau neutralised under the treaty of tournay 6000 dutch who might not by that treaty fight against the ally of france  the prince entertained no illusions  without french forces he told deguilles i cannot resist english dutch hessians and swiss  on october 1526 he wrote his last extant letter from scotland to king james  he puts his force at 8000 more truly 6000 with 300 horse with these as matters stand i shal have one decisive stroke fort but iff the french do not land perhaps none     as matters stand i must either conquer or perish in a little while  defeated in the heart of england and with a prize of 30000 pounds offered for his head he could not hope to escape  a victory for him would mean a landing of french troops and his invasion of england had for its aim to force the hand of france  her troops with prince henry among them dallied at dunkirk till christmas and were then dispersed while the duke of cumberland arrived in england from flanders on october 19  on october 30 the prince held a council of war  french supplies and guns had been landed at stonehaven and news came that 6000 french were ready at dunkirk at dunkirk they were but they never were ready  the news probably decided charles to cross the border while it appears that his men preferred to be content with simply making scotland again an independent kingdom with a catholic king  but to do this with french aid was to return to the state of things under mary of guise  the prince judging correctly wished to deal his decisive stroke near home at the old and now futile wade in northumberland  a victory would have disheartened england and left newcastle open to france  if charles were defeated his own escape by sea in a country where he had many well wishers was possible and the clans would have retreated through the cheviots  lord george murray insisted on a march by the western road lancashire being expected to rise and join the prince  but this plan left wade with a superior force on charless flank  the one difficulty that of holding a bridge say kelso bridge over tweed was not insuperable  rivers could not stop the highlanders  macdonald of morar thought charles the best general in the army and to the layman considering the necessity for an instant stroke and the advantages of the east as regards france the princes strategy appears better than lord georges  but lord george had his way  on october 31 charles reinforced by cluny with 400 macphersons concentrated at dalkeith  on november 1 the less trusted part of his force under tullibardine with the atholl men moved south by peebles and moffat to lockerbie menacing carlisle while the prince lord george and the fighting clans marched to kelsoa feint to deceive wade the main body then moved by jedburgh up rule water and down through liddesdale joining hands with tullibardine on november 9 and bivouacking within two miles of carlisle  on the 10th the atholl men went to work at the trenches on the 11th the army moved seven miles towards newcastle hoping to discuss wade at brampton on hilly ground but wade did not gratify them by arriving  on the 13th the atholl men were kept at their spadework and lord george in dudgeon resigned his command november 14 but at night carlisle surrendered murray and perth negotiating  lord george expressed his anger and jealousy to his brother tullibardine but perth resigned his command to pacify his rival  wade feebly tried to cross country failed and went back to newcastle  on november 10 with some 4500 men there had been many desertions the march through lancashire was decreed  save for mr townley and two vaughans the catholics did not stir  charles marched on foot in the van he was a trained pedestrian the townspeople stared at him and his highlanders but only at manchester november 29 30 had he a welcome enlisting about 150 doomed men  on november 27 cumberland took over command at lichfield his foot were distributed between tamworth and stafford his cavalry was at newcastleunderlyme lord george was moving on derby but learning cumberlands dispositions he led a column to congleton inducing cumberland to concentrate at lichfield while he himself by way of leek and ashburn joined the prince at derby  the army was in the highest spirits  the duke of richmond on the other side wrote from lichfield december 5 if the enemy please to cut us off from the main army they may and also if they please to give us the slip and march to london i fear they may before even this avant garde can come up with them    there is no pass to defend    the camp at finchley is confined to paper plansand wales was ready to join the prince  lord george did not know what richmond knew  despite the entreaties of the prince his council decided to retreat  on december 6 the clans uttering cries of rage were set with their faces to the north  the prince was now an altered man  full of distrust he marched not with lord george in the rear he rode in the van  meanwhile lord john drummond who on november 22 had landed at montrose with 800 french soldiers was ordered by charles to advance with large highland levies now collected and meet him as he moved north  lord john disobeyed orders received about december 18  expecting his advance charles most unhappily left the manchester men and others to hold carlisle to which he would return  cumberland took them allmany were hanged  in the north lord lewis gordon routed macleod at inverurie december 23 and defeated his effort to secure aberdeen  admirably commanded by lord george and behaving admirably for an irregular retreating force the army reached penrith on december 18 and at clifton lord george and cluny defeated cumberlands dragoons in a rearguard action  on december 19 carlisle was reached and as we saw a force was left to guard the castle all were taken  on december 20 the army forded the flooded esk the ladies of whom several had been with them rode it on their horses the men waded breasthigh as had there been need they would have forded tweed if the eastern route had been chosen and if retreat had been necessary  cumberland returned to london on january 5 and horace walpole no longer dreaded a rebellion that runs away  by different routes charles and lord george met december 26 at hamilton palace  charles stayed a night at dumfries  dumfries was hostile and was fined glasgow was also disaffected the ladies were unfriendly  at glasgow charles heard that seaforth chief of the mackenzies was aiding the hanoverians in the north combining with the great whig clans with macleod the munroes lord loudoun commanding some 2000 men and the mackays of sutherland and caithness  meanwhile lord john drummond strathallan and lord lewis gordon with lord macleod were concentrating to meet the prince at stirling the purpose being the hopeless one of capturing the castle the key of the north  with weak artillery and a futile and foolish french engineer officer to direct the siege they had no chance of success  the prince in bad health stayed january 410 at sir hugh patersons place bannockburn house  at stirling with his northern reinforcements charles may have had some seven or eight thousand men wherewith to meet general hawley a veteran of sheriffmuir advancing from edinburgh  hawley encamped at falkirk and while the atholl men were deserting by scores lord george skilfully deceived him arrived on the falkirk moor unobserved and held the ridge above hawleys position while the general was lunching with lady kilmarnock  in the first line of the princes force the macdonalds held the right wing the camerons whom the great wolfe describes as the bravest of the brave held the left with stewarts of appin frazers and macphersons in the centre  in the second line were the atholl men lord lewis gordons levies and lord ogilvys  the lowland horse and drummonds french details were in the rear  the ground was made up of eminences and ravines so that in the second line the various bodies were invisible to each other as at sheriffmuirwith similar results  when hawley found that he had been surprised he arrayed his thirteen battalions of regulars and 1000 men of argyll on the plain with three regiments of dragoons by whose charge he expected to sweep away charless right wing behind his cavalry were the luckless militia of glasgow and the lothians  in all he had from 10000 to 12000 men against perhaps 7000 at most for 1200 of charless force were left to contain blakeney in stirling castle  both sides on account of the heavy roads failed to bring forward their guns  hawley then advanced his cavalry up hill their left faced keppochs macdonalds their right faced the frazers under the master of lovat in charless centre  hawley then launched his cavalry which were met at close range by the reserved fire of the macdonalds and frazers  through the mist and rain the townsfolk looking on saw in five minutes the break in the battle  hamiltons and ligoniers cavalry turned and fled cobhams wheeled and rode across the highland left under fire while the macdonalds and frazers pursuing the cavalry found themselves among the glasgow militia whom they followed slaying  lord george had no pipers to sound the recall they had flung their pipes to their gillies and gone in with the claymore  thus the princes right far beyond his front were lost in the tempest while his left had discharged their muskets at cobhams horse and could not load again their powder being drenched with rain  they received the fire of hawleys right and charged with the claymore but were outflanked and enfiladed by some battalions drawn up en potence  many of the second line had blindly followed the first the rest shunned the action hawleys officers led away some regiments in an orderly retreat night fell no man knew what had really occurred till young gask and young strathallan with the french and atholl men ventured into falkirk and found hawleys camp deserted  the darkness the rain the nature of the ground and the clans want of discipline prevented the annihilation of hawleys army while the behaviour of his cavalry showed that the prince might have defeated cumberlands advanced force beyond derby with the greatest ease as the duke of richmond had anticipated  perhaps the right course now was to advance on edinburgh but the hopeless siege of stirling castle was continuedcharles perhaps hoping much from hawleys captured guns  the accidental shooting of young aeneas macdonnell second son of glengarry by a clanranald man begat a kind of blood feud between the clans and the unhappy cause of the accident had to be shot  lochgarry writing to young glengarry after culloden says that there was a general desertion in the whole army and this was the view of the chiefs who on news of cumberlands approach told charles january 29 that the army was depleted and resistance impossible  the chiefs were mistaken in point of fact a review at crieff later showed that even then only 1000 men were missing  as at derby and with right on his side charles insisted on meeting cumberland  he did well his men were flushed with victory had sufficient supplies were to encounter an army not yet encouraged by a refusal to face it and if defeated had the gates of the hills open behind them  in a very temperately written memorial charles placed these ideas before the chiefs  having told you my thoughts i am too sensible of what you have already ventured and done for me not to yield to your unanimous resolution if you persist  lord george lovat lochgarry keppoch ardshiel and cluny did persist the fatal die was cast and the men whowell fed and confidentmight have routed cumberland fled in confusion rather than retreatedto be ruined later when starving outwearied and with many of their best forces absent they staggered his army at culloden  charles had told the chiefs i can see nothing but ruin and destruction to us in case we should retreat 287  this retreat embittered charless feelings against lord george who may have been mistakenwho indeed at crieff seems to have recognised his error february 5 but he had taken his part and during the campaign henceforth as at culloden distinguished himself by every virtue of a soldier  after the retreat lord george moved on aberdeen charles to blair in atholl thence to moy the house of lady mackintosh where a blacksmith and four or five men ingeniously scattered loudoun and the macleods advancing to take him by a night surprise  this was the famous rout of moy  charles next february 20 took inverness castle and loudoun was driven into sutherland and cut off by lord georges dispositions from any chance of joining hands with cumberland  the duke had now 5000 hessian soldiers at his disposal these he would not have commanded had the princes army met him near stirling  charles was now at or near inverness he lost through illness the services of murray whose successor hay was impotent as an officer of commissariat  a gallant movement of lord george into atholl where he surprised all cumberlands posts but was foiled by the resistance of his brothers castle was interrupted by a recall to the north and on april 2 he retreated to the line of the spey  forbes of culloden and macleod had been driven to take refuge in skye but 1500 men of the princes best had been sent into sutherland when cumberland arrived at nairn april 14 and charles concentrated his starving forces on culloden moor  the macphersons the frazers the 1500 macdonalds and others in sutherland were absent on various duties when the wicked day of destiny approached  the men on culloden moor a flat waste unsuited to the tactics of the clans had but one biscuit apiece on the eve of the battle  lord george did not like the ground and proposed to surprise by a night attack cumberlands force at nairn  the prince eagerly agreed and according to him clanranalds advanced men were in touch with cumberlands outposts before lord george convinced the prince that retreat was necessary  the advance was lagging the way had been missed in the dark dawn was at hand  there are other versions in any case the hungry men were so outworn that many are said to have slept through next days battle  a great mistake was made next day if lochgarry who commanded the macdonalds of glengarry and maxwell of kirkconnel are correct in saying that lord george insisted on placing his atholl men on the right wing the macdonalds had an old claim to the right wing but as far as research enlightens us their failure on this fatal day was not due to jealous anger  the battle might have been avoided but to retreat was to lose inverness and all chance of supplies  on the highland right was the water of nairn and they were guarded by a wall which the campbells pulled down enabling cumberlands cavalry to take them in flank cumberland had about 9000 men including the campbells  charles according to his mustermaster had 5000 of horse he had but a handful  the battle began with an artillery duel during which the clans lost heavily while their few guns were useless and their right flank was exposed by the breaking down of the protecting wall  after some unexplained and dangerous delay lord george gave the word to charge in face of a blinding tempest of sleet and himself went in as did lochiel claymore in hand  but though the order was conveyed by ker of graden first to the macdonalds on the left as they had to charge over a wider space of ground the camerons clan chattan and macleans came first to the shock  nothing could be more desperate than their attack or more properly received says whitefoord  the assailants were enfiladed by wolfes regiment which moved up and took position at right angles like the fiftysecond on the flank of the last charge of the french guard at waterloo  the highland right broke through barrels regiment swept over the guns and died on the bayonets of the second line  they had thrown down their muskets after one fire and says cumberland stood and threw stones for at least a minute or two before their total rout began probably the fall of lochiel who was wounded and carried out of action determined the flight  meanwhile the left the macdonalds menaced on the flank by cavalry were plied at a hundred yards by grape  they saw their leaders the gallant keppoch and macdonnell of scothouse with many others fall under the grapeshot they saw the right wing broken and they did not come to the shock  if we may believe four sworn witnesses in a court of justice july 24 1752 whose testimony was accepted as the basis of a judicial decreet january 10 1756 290 keppoch was wounded while giving his orders to some of his men not to outrun the line in advancing and was shot dead as a friend was supporting him  when all retreated they passed the dead body of keppoch  the tradition constantly given in various forms that keppoch charged alone deserted by the children of his clan is worthless if sworn evidence may be trusted  as for the unhappy charles by the evidence of sir robert strange who was with him he had ridden along the line to the right animating the soldiers and endeavoured to rally the soldiers who annoyed by the enemys fire were beginning to quit the field  he was got off the field when the men in general were betaking themselves precipitately to flight nor was there any possibility of their being rallied  yorke an english officer says that the prince did not leave the field till after the retreat of the second line  so far the princes conduct was honourable and worthy of his name  but presently on the advice of his irish entourage sullivan and sheridan who always suggested suspicions and doubtless not forgetting the great price on his head he took his own way towards the west coast in place of joining lord george and the remnant with him at ruthven in badenoch  on april 26 he sailed from borradale in a boat and began that course of wanderings and hairbreadth escapes in which only the loyalty of highland hearts enabled him at last to escape the ships that watched the isles and the troops that netted the hills  some years later general wolfe then residing at inverness reviewed the occurrences and made up his mind that the battle had been a dangerous risk for cumberland while the pursuit though ruthlessly cruel was inefficient  despite cumberlands insistent orders to give no quarter orders justified by the absolutely false pretext that prince charles had set the example lochgarry reported that the army had not lost more than a thousand men  fire and sword and torture the destruction of tilled lands and even of the shellfish on the shore did not break the spirit of the highlanders  many bands held out in arms and lochgarry was only prevented by the princes command from laying an ambush for cumberland the campbells and the macleods under their recreant chief the whig macdonalds under sir alexander of sleat ravaged the lands of the jacobite clansmen but the spies of albemarle who now commanded in scotland reported the macleans the grants of glenmoriston with the macphersons glengarrys men and lochiels camerons as all eager to do it again if france would only help  but france was helpless and when lochiel sailed for france with the prince only cluny remained hunted like a partridge in the mountains to keep up the spirit of the cause  old lovat met a longdeserved death by the executioners axe though it needed the evidence of murray of broughton turned informer to convict that fox  kilmarnock and balmerino also were executed the good and brave duke of perth died on his way to france the aged tullibardine in the tower many gallant gentlemen were hanged lord george escaped and is the ancestor of the present duke of atholl many gentlemen took french service others fought in other alien armies three or four in the highlands or abroad took the wages of spies upon the prince  the 30000 pounds of french gold buried near loch arkaig caused endless feuds kinsman denouncing kinsman  the secrets of the years 17461760 are to be sought in the cumberland and stuart mss in windsor castle and the record office  legislation intended to scotch the snake of jacobitism began with religious persecution  the episcopalian clergy had no reason to love triumphant presbyterianism and actively or in sympathy were favourers of the exiled dynasty  episcopalian chapels sometimes mere rooms in private houses were burned or their humble furniture was destroyed  all episcopalian ministers were bidden to take the oath and pray for king george by september 1746 or suffer for the second offence transportation for life to the american colonies  later the orders conferred by scottish bishops were made of no avail  only with great difficulty and danger could parents obtain the rite of baptism for their children  very little is said in our histories about the sufferings of the episcopalians when it was their turn to be under the harrow  they were not violent they murdered no moderator of the general assembly  other measures were the disarming act the prohibition to wear the highland dress and the abolition of hereditable jurisdictions and the chiefs right to call out his clansmen in arms  compensation in money was paid from 21000 pounds to the duke of argyll to 13 pounds 6s 8d to the clerks of the registrar of aberbrothock  the whole sum was 152237 pounds 15s 4d  in 1754 an act annexed the forfeited estates of the jacobites who had been out or many of them inalienably to the crown  the estates were restored in 1784 meanwhile the profits were to be used for the improvement of the highlands  if submissive tenants received better terms and larger leases than of old jacobite tenants were evicted for not being punctual with rent  therefore on may 14 1752 some person unknown shot campbell of glenure who was about evicting the tenants on the lands of lochiel and stewart of ardshiel in appin  campbell rode down from fort william to ballachulish ferry and when he had crossed it said i am safe now i am out of my mothers country  but as he drove along the old road through the wood of lettermore perhaps a mile and a half south of ballachulish house the fatal shot was fired  for this crime james stewart of the glens was tried by a campbell jury at inveraray with the duke on the bench and was of course convicted and hanged on the top of a knoll above ballachulish ferry  james was innocent but allan breck stewart was certainly an accomplice of the man with the gun which by the way was the property neither of james stewart nor of stewart of fasnacloich  the murderer was anxious to save james by avowing the deed but his kinsfolk saying they will only hang both james and you bound him hand and foot and locked him up in the kitchen on the day of jamess execution 293  allan lay for some weeks at the house of a kinsman in rannoch and escaped to france where he had a fight with james mor macgregor then a spy in the service of the duke of newcastle  this murder of the red fox caused all the more excitement and is all the better remembered in lochaber and glencoe because agrarian violence in revenge for eviction has scarcely another example in the history of the highlands     conclusion   space does not permit an account of the assimilation of scotland to england in the years between the fortyfive and our own time moreover the history of this age cannot well be written without a dangerously close approach to many burning questions of our day  the history of the highlands from 1752 to the emigrations witnessed by dr johnson 1760 1780 and of the later evictions in the interests of sheep farms and deer forests has never been studied as it ought to be in the rich manuscript materials which are easily accessible  the great literary renaissance of scotland from 1745 to the death of sir walter scott the years of hume a pioneer in philosophy and in history and of the rev principal robertson with him and hume gibbon professed very modestly that he did not rank the times of adam smith of burns and of sir walter not to speak of the rev john home that foremost tragic poet may be studied in many a history of literature  according to voltaire scotland led the world in all studies from metaphysics to gardening  we think of watt and add engineering  the brief and inglorious administration of the earl of bute at once gave openings in the public service to scots of ability and excited that english hatred of these northern rivals which glows in churchills satires while this english jealousy aroused that scottish hatred of england which is the one passion that disturbs the placid letters of david hume  the later alliance of pitt with henry dundas made dundas far more powerful than any secretary for scotland had been since lauderdale and confirmed the connection of scotland with the services in india  but politically scotland till the reform bill had scarcely a recognisable existence  the electorate was tiny and great landholders controlled the votes whether genuine or created by legal fictionfaggot votes municipal administration in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was terribly corrupt and reform was demanded but the french revolution producing associations of friends of the people who were prosecuted and grievously punished in trials for sedition did not afford a fortunate moment for peaceful reforms  but early in the nineteenth century jeffrey editor of the edinburgh review made it the organ of liberalism and no less potent in england than in scotland while scott on the tory side led a following of scottish penmen across the border in the service of the quarterly review  with blackwoods magazine and wilson hogg and lockhart with jeffrey and the edinburgh the scottish metropolis almost rivalled london as the literary capital  about 1818 lockhart recognised the superiority of the whig wits in literature but against them all scott is a more than sufficient setoff the years of stress between waterloo 1815 and the reform bill 1832 made radicalism fostered by economic causes the enormous commercial and industrial growth and the unequal distribution of its rewards perhaps even more pronounced north than south of the tweed  in 1820 the radical war led to actual encounters between the yeomanry and the people  the ruffianism of the tory paper the beacon caused one fatal duel and was within an inch of leading to another in which a person of the very highest consequence would have gone on the sod  for the reform bill the mass of scottish opinion so long not really represented at all was as eager as for the covenant  so triumphant was the first whig or radical majority under the new system that jeffrey the whig pontiff perceived that the real struggle was to be between property and no property between capital and socialism  this circumstance had always been perfectly clear to scott and the tories  the watchword of the eighteenth century in literature religion and politics had been no enthusiasm  but throughout the century since 1740 enthusiasm the return to nature had gradually conquered till the rise of the romantic school with coleridge and scott  in religion the enthusiastic movement of the wesleys had altered the face of the church in england while in scotland the moderates had lost position and zeal or enthusiasm pervaded the kirk  the question of lay patronage of livings had passed through many phases since knox wrote it pertaineth to the people and to every several congregation to elect their minister  in 1833 immediately after the passing of the reform bill the return to the primitive knoxian rule was advocated by the evangelical or high flying opponents of the moderates  dr chalmers a most eloquent person whom scott regarded as truly a man of genius was the leader of the movement  the veto act by which the votes of a majority of heads of families were to be fatal to the claims of a patrons presentee had been passed by the general assembly it was contrary to queen annes patronage act of 1711a measure carried contrary to harleys policy by a coalition of english churchmen and scottish jacobite members of parliament  the rejection under the veto act of a presentee by the church of auchterarder was declared illegal by the court of session and the judges in the house of lords may 1839 the strathbogie imbroglio with two presbyteries one taking its orders from the court of session the other from the general assembly 1837 1841 brought the assembly into direct conflict with the law of the land  dr chalmers would not allow the spiritual claims of the kirk to be suppressed by the state  king christs crown honours were once more in question  on may 18 1843 the followers of the principles of knox and andrew melville marched out of the assembly into tanfield hall and made dr chalmers moderator and themselves the free church of scotland  in 1847 the hitherto separated synods of various dissenting bodies came together as united presbyterians and in 1902 they united with the free church as the united free church while a small minority mainly highland of the former free church now retains that title and apparently represents knoxian ideals  thus the knoxian ideals have modified even to this day the ecclesiastical life of scotland while the church of james i never by persecution extinguished nec tamen consumebatur has continued to exist and develop perhaps more in consequence of love of the liturgy than from any other cause  meanwhile and not least in the united free church extreme tenacity of dogma has yielded place to very advanced biblical criticism and knox could he revisit scotland with all his old opinions might not be wholly satisfied by the changes wrought in the course of more than three centuries  the scottish universities discouraged and almost destitute of pious benefactors since the end of the sixteenth century have profited by the increase of wealth and a comparatively recent outburst of generosity  they always provided the cheapest and now they provide the cheapest and most efficient education that is offered by any homes of learning of mediaeval foundation     footnotes   2  a good example of these celtic romances is the tain bo cualgne  4  the best account of roman military life in scotland from the time
