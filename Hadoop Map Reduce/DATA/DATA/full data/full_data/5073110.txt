5073110	wintry peacock  from the new decameronvolume iii  by d h lawrence  there was thin crisp snow on the ground the sky was blue the wind very cold the air clear farmers were just turning out the cows for an hour or so in the midday and the smell of cowsheds was unendurable as i entered tible i noticed the ashtwigs up in the sky were pale and luminous passing into the blue and then i saw the peacocks there they were in the road before me three of them and tailless brown speckled birds with darkblue necks and ragged crests they stepped archly over the filigree snow and their bodies moved with slow motion like small light flatbottomed boats i admired them they were curious then a gust of wind caught them heeled them over as if they were three frail boats opening their feathers like ragged sails they hopped and skipped with discomfort to get out of the draught of the wind and then in the lee of the walls they resumed their arch wintry motion light and unballasted now their tails were gone indifferent they were indifferent to my presence i might have touched them they turned off to the shelter of an open shed  as i passed the end of the upper house i saw a young woman just coming out of the back door i had spoken to her in the summer she recognised me at once and waved to me she was carrying a pail wearing a white apron that was longer than her preposterously short skirt and she had on the cotton bonnet i took off my hat to her and was going on but she put down her pail and darted with a swift furtive movement after me  do you mind waiting a minute she said ill be out in a minute  she gave me a slight odd smile and ran back her face was long and sallow and her nose rather red but her gloomy black eyes softened caressively to me for a moment with that momentary humility which makes a man lord of the earth  i stood in the road looking at the fluffy darkred young cattle that mooed and seemed to bark at me they seemed happy frisky cattle a little impudent and either determined to go back into the warm shed or determined not to go back i could not decide which  presently the woman came forward again her head rather ducked but she looked up at me and smiled with that odd immediate intimacy something witchlike and impossible  sorry to keep you waiting she said shall we stand in this cartshedit will be more out of the wind  so we stood among the shafts of the open cartshed that faced the road then she looked down at the ground a little sideways and i noticed a small black frown on her brows she seemed to brood for a moment then she looked straight into my eyes so that i blinked and wanted to turn my face aside she was searching me for something and her look was too near the frown was still on her keen sallow brow  can you speak french she asked me abruptly  more or less i replied  i was supposed to learn it at school she said but i dont know a word she ducked her head and laughed with a slightly ugly grimace and a rolling of her black eyes  no good keeping your mind full of scraps i answered  but she had turned aside her sallow long face and did not hear what i said suddenly again she looked at me she was searching and at the same time she smiled at me and her eyes looked softly darkly with infinite trustful humility into mine i was being cajoled  would you mind reading a letter for me in french she said her face immediately black and bitterlooking she glanced at me frowning  not at all i said  its a letter to my husband she said still scrutinising  i looked at her and didnt quite realise she looked too far into me my wits were gone she glanced round then she looked at me shrewdly she drew a letter from her pocket and handed it to me it was addressed from france to m alfred goyte at tible i took out the letter and began to read it as mere words mon cher alfredit might have been a bit of a torn newspaper so i followed the script the trite phrases of a letter from a frenchspeaking girl to an englishman i think of you always always do you think sometimes of me and then i vaguely realised that i was reading a mans private correspondence and yet how could one consider these trivial facile french phrases private nothing more trite and vulgar in the world than such a loveletterno newspaper more obvious  therefore i read with a callous heart the effusions of the belgian damsel but then i gathered my attention for the letter went on notre cher petit bébéour dear little baby was born a week ago almost i died knowing you were far away and perhaps forgetting the fruit of our perfect love but the child comforted me he has the smiling eyes and virile air of his english father i pray to the mother of jesus to send me the dear father of my child that i may see him with my child in his arms and that we may be united in holy family love ah my alfred can i tell you how i miss you how i weep for you my thoughts are with you always i think of nothing but you i live for nothing but you and our dear baby if you do not come back to me soon i shall die and our child will die but no you cannot come back to me but i can come to you i can come to england with our child if you do not wish to present me to your good mother and father you can meet me in some town some city for i shall be so frightened to be alone in england with my child and no one to take care of us yet i must come to you i must bring my child my little alfred to his father the big beautiful alfred that i love so much oh write and tell me where i shall come i have some money i am not a penniless creature i have money for myself and my dear baby  i read to the end it was signed your very happy and still more unhappy elise i suppose i must have been smiling  i can see it makes you laugh said mrs goyte sardonically i looked up at her  its a loveletter i know that she said theres too many alfreds in it  one too many i said  oh yesand what does she sayeliza we know her names eliza thats another thing she grimaced a little looking up at me with a mocking laugh  where did you get this letter i said  postman gave it me last week  and is your husband at home  i expect him home tonight he had an accident and hurt his leg hes been abroad most of his time for this last four years hes chauffeur to a gentleman who travels about in one country and another on some sort of business married we married why six years and i tell you ive seen little enough of him for four of them but he always was a rake he went through the south african war and stopped out there for five years im living with his father and mother ive no home of my own now my people had a big farmover a thousand acresin oxfordshire not like hereno oh theyre very good to me his father and mother oh yes they couldnt be

chauffeur no hes been all sorts of things was to be a farmbailiff by rights hes had a good educationbut he liked the motors betterthen he was five years in the cape mounted police i met him when he came back from there and married himmore fool me  at this point the peacocks came round the corner on a puff of wind  hello joey she called and one of the birds came forward on delicate legs its grey spreckled back was very elegant it rolled its full darkblue neck as it moved to her she crouched down joey dear she said in an odd saturnine caressive voice youre bound to find me arent you she put her face downward and the bird rolled his neck almost touching her face with his beak as if kissing her  he loves you i said  she twisted her face up at me with a laugh  yes she said he loves me joey doesthen to the birdand i love joey dont i i do love joey and she smoothed his feathers for a moment then she rose saying hes an affectionate bird  i smiled at the roll of her birrrd  oh yes he is she protested he came with me from my home seven years ago those others are his descendantsbut theyre not like joeyare they deeurr her voice rose at the end with a witchlike cry  then she forgot the birds in the cartshed and turned to business again  wont you read that letter she said read it so that i know what it says  its rather behind his back i said  oh never mind him she cried hes been behind my back long enough if he never did no worse things behind my back than i do behind his he wouldnt have cause to grumble you read me what it says  now i felt a distinct reluctance to do as she bid and yet i beganmy dear alfred  i guessed that much she said elizas dear alfred she laughed how do you say it in french eliza  i told her and she repeated the name with great contemptelise  go on she said youre not reading  so i begani have been thinking of you sometimeshave you been thinking of me  of several others as well beside her ill wager said mrs goyte  probably not said i and continued a dear little baby was born here a week ago ah can i tell you my feelings when i take my darling little brother into my arms  ill bet its his cried mrs goyte  no i said its her mothers  dont you believe it she cried its a blind you mark its her own right enoughand his  no i said its her mothers he has sweet smiling eyes but not like your beautiful english eyes  she suddenly struck her hand on her skirt with a wild motion and bent down doubled with laughter then she rose and covered her face with her hand  im forced to laugh at the beautiful english eyes she said  arent his eyes beautiful i asked  oh yesvery go onjoey dear deeurr joeythis to the peacock  erwe miss you very much we all miss you we wish you were here to see the darling baby ah alfred how happy we were when you stayed with us we all loved you so much my mother will call the baby alfred so that we shall never forget you  of course its his right enough cried mrs goyte  no i said its the mothers ermy mother is very well my father came home yesterdayfrom lille he is delighted with his son my little brother and wishes to have him named after you because you were so good to us all in that terrible time which i shall never forget i must weep now when i think of it well you are far away in england and perhaps i shall never see you again how did you find your dear mother and father i am so happy that your leg is better and that you can nearly walk  how did he find his dear wife cried mrs goyte he never told her that he had one think of taking the poor girl in like that  we are so pleased when you write to us yet now you are in england you will forget the family you served so well  a bit too welleh joey cried the wife  if it had not been for you we should not be alive now to grieve and to rejoice in this life that is so hard for us but we have recovered some of our losses and no longer feel the burden of poverty the little alfred is a great comforter to me i hold him to my breast and think of the big good alfred and i weep to think that those times of suffering were perhaps the times of a great happiness that is gone for ever  oh but isnt it a shame to take a poor girl in like that cried mrs goyte never to let on that he was married and raise her hopesi call it beastly i do  you dont know i said you know how anxious women are to fall in love wife or no wife how could he help it if she was determined to fall in love with him  he could have helped it if hed wanted to  well i said we arent all heroes  oh but thats differentthe big good alfreddid you ever hear such tommyrot in your lifego onwhat does she say at the end  er we shall be pleased to hear of your life in england we all send many kind regards to your good parents i wish you all happiness for your future days your very affectionate and evergrateful elise  there was silence for a moment during which mrs goyte remained with her head dropped sinister and abstracted suddenly she lifted her face and her eyes flashed  oh but i call it beastly i call it mean to take a girl in like that  nay i said probably he hasnt taken her in at all do you think those french girls are such poor innocent things i guess shes a great deal more downy than he  oh hes one of the biggest fools that ever walked she cried  there you are said i  but its his child right enough she said  i dont think so said i  im sure of it  oh well i saidif you prefer to think that way  what other reason has she for writing like that  i went out into the road and looked at the cattle  who is this driving the cows i said she too came out  its the boy from the next farm she said  oh well said i those belgian girls you never know where their letters will endand after all its his affairyou neednt bother  oh she cried with rough scornits not me that bothers but its the nasty meanness of it me writing him such loving lettersshe put her hands before her face and laughed malevolentlyand sending him nice little cakes and bits i thought hed fancy all the time you bet he fed that gurrl on my thingsi know he did its just like himill bet they laughed together over my letters ill bet anything they did  nay said i hed burn your letters for fear theyd give him away  there was a black look on her yellow face suddenly a voice was heard calling she poked her head out of the shed and answered coolly  all right then turning to me thats his mother looking after me  she laughed into my face witchlike and we turned down the road  when i awoke the morning after this episode i found the house darkened with deep soft snow which had blown against the large west windows covering them with a screen i went outside and saw the valley all white and ghastly below me the trees beneath black and thin looking like wire the rockfaces dark between the glistening shroud and the sky above sombre heavy yellowishdark much too heavy for the world below of hollow bluey whiteness figured with black i felt i was in a valley of the dead and i sensed i was a prisoner for the snow was everywhere deep and drifted in places so all the morning i remained indoors looking up the drive at the shrubs so heavily plumed with snow at the gateposts raised high with a foot or more of extra whiteness or i looked down into the whiteandblack valley that was utterly motionless and beyond life a hollow sarcophagus  nothing stirred the whole dayno plume fell off the shrubs the valley was as abstracted as a grove of death i looked over at the tiny halfburied farms away on the bare uplands beyond the valley hollow and i thought of tible in the snow of the black witchlike little mrs goyte and the snow seemed to lay me bare to influences i wanted to escape  in the faint glow of halfclear light that came about four oclock in the afternoon i was roused to see a motion in the snow away below near where the thorntrees stood very black and dwarfed like a little savage group in the dismal white i watched closely yes there was a flapping and a strugglea big bird it must be labouring in the snow i wondered our biggest birds in the valley were the large hawks that often hung flickering opposite my windows level with me but high above some prey on the steep valleyside this was much too big for a hawktoo big for any known bird i searched in my mind for the largest english wild birdsgeese buzzards  still it laboured and strove then was still a dark spot then struggled again i went out of the house and down the steep slope at risk of breaking my leg between the rocks i knew the ground so welland yet i got well shaken before i drew near the thorntrees  yes it was a bird it was joey it was the greybrown peacock with a blue neck he was snowwet and spent  joeyjoey deurr i said staggering unevenly towards him he looked so pathetic rowing and struggling in the snow too spent to rise his blue neck stretching out and lying sometimes on the snow his eyes closing and opening quickly his crest all battered  joey deeurr deeurr i said caressingly to him and at last he lay still blinking in the surged and furrowed snow whilst i came near and touched him stroked him gathered him under my arm he stretched his long wetted neck away from me as i held him none the less he was quiet in my arm too tired perhaps to struggle still he held his poor crested head away from me and seemed sometimes to droop to wilt as if he might suddenly die  he was not so heavy as i expected yet it was a struggle to get up to the house with him again we set him down not too near the fire and gently wiped him with cloths he submitted only now and then stretched his soft neck away from us avoiding us helplessly then we set warm food by him i put it to his beak tried to make him eat but he ignored it he seemed to be ignorant of what we were doing recoiled inside himself inexplicably so we put him in a basket with cloths and left him crouching oblivious his food we put near him the blinds were drawn the house was warm it was night sometimes he stirred but mostly he huddled still leaning his queer crested head on one side he touched no food and took no heed of sounds or movements we talked of brandy or stimulants but i realised we had best leave him alone  in the night however we heard him thumping about i got up anxiously with a candle he had eaten some food and scattered more making a mess and he was perched on the back of a heavy armchair so i concluded he was recovered or recovering  the next day was clear and the snow had frozen so i decided to carry him back to tible he consented after various flappings to sit in a big fishbag with his battered head peeping out with wild uneasiness and so i set off with him slithering down into the valley making good progress down in the pale shadows beside the rushing waters then climbing painfully up the arrested white valleyside plumed with clusters of young pinetrees into the paler white radiance of the snowy upper regions where the wind cut fine joey seemed to watch all the time with wide anxious unseeing eyes brilliant and inscrutable as i drew near to tible township he stirred violently in the bag though i do not know if he had recognised the place then as i came to the sheds he looked sharply from side to side and stretched his neck out long i was a little afraid of him he gave a loud vehement yell opening his sinister beak and i stood still looking at him as he struggled in the bag shaken myself by his struggles yet not thinking to release him  mrs goyte came darting past the end of the house her head sticking forward in sharp scrutiny she saw me and came forward  have you got joey she cried sharply as if i were a thief  i opened the bag and he flopped out flapping as if he hated the touch of the snow now she gathered him up and put her lips to his beak she was flushed and handsome her eyes bright her hair slack thick but more witchlike than ever she did not speak  she had been followed by a greyhaired woman with a round rather sallow face and a slightly hostile bearing  did you bring him with you then she asked sharply i answered that i had rescued him the previous evening  from the background slowly approached a slender man with a grey moustache and large patches on his trousers  youve got im back gain ah see he said to his daughterinlaw his wife explained how i had found joey  ah went on the grey man it wor our alfred scarred him off back your life he must a flyed ower t valley tha ma thank thy stars as e wor fun maggie ed a bin froze they a bit nesh you know he concluded to me  they are i answered this isnt their country  no it isna replied mr goyte he spoke very slowly and deliberately quietly as if the soft pedal were always down in his voice he looked at his daughterinlaw as she crouched flushed and dark before the peacock which would lay its long blue neck for a moment along her lap in spite of his grey moustache and thin grey hair the elderly man had a face young and almost delicate like a young mans his blue eyes twinkled with some inscrutable source of pleasure his skin was fine and tender his nose delicately arched his grey hair being slightly ruffled he had a debonnair look as of a youth who is in love  we mun tell im its come he said slowly and turning he called  alfredalfred wheers ter gotten to  then he turned again to the group  get up then maggie lass get up wi thee tha maes too much o th bod  a young man approached limping wearing a thick short coat and kneebreeches he was danishlooking broad at the loins  is come back then said the father to the sonleastwise hes bin browt back flyed ower the griff low  the son looked at me he had a devilmaycare bearing his cap on one side his hands stuck in the front pockets of his breeches but he said nothing  shall you come in a minute master said the elderly woman to me  ay come in an hae a cup o tea or summat youll do wi summat carryin that bod come on maggie wench lets go in  so we went indoors into the rather stuffy overcrowded livingroom that was too cosy and too warm the son followed last standing in the doorway the father talked to me maggie put out the teacups the mother went into the dairy again  thalt rouse thysen up a bit again now maggie the fatherinlaw

yexpect  the mother came in again and the talk became general maggie flashed her eyes at me from time to time complacent and satisfied moving among the men i paid her little compliments which she did not seem to hear she attended to me with a kind of sinister witchlike graciousness her dark head ducked between her shoulders at once humble and powerful she was happy as a child attending to her fatherinlaw and to me but there was something ominous between her eyebrows as if a dark moth were settled thereand something ominous in her bent hulking bearing  she sat on a low stool by the fire near her fatherinlaw her head was dropped she seemed in a state of abstraction from time to time she would suddenly recover and look up at us laughing and chatting then she would forget again yet in her hulked black forgetting she seemed very near to us  the door having been opened the peacock came slowly in prancing calmly he went near to her and crouched down coiling his blue neck she glanced at him but almost as if she did not observe him the bird sat silent seeming to sleep and the woman also sat huddled and silent seeming oblivious then once more there was a heavy step and alfred entered he looked at his wife and he looked at the peacock crouching by her he stood large in the doorway his hands stuck in front of him in his breeches pockets nobody spoke he turned on his heel and went out again  i rose also to go maggie started as if coming to herself  must you go she asked rising and coming near to me standing in front of me twisting her head sideways and looking up at me cant you stop a bit longer we can all be cosy today theres nothing to do outdoors and she laughed showing her teeth oddly she had a long chin  i said i must go the peacock uncoiled and coiled again his long blue neck as he lay on the hearth maggie still stood close in front of me so that i was acutely aware of my waistcoat buttons  oh well she said youll come again wont you do come again  i promised  come to tea one dayyes do  i promisedone day  the moment i was out of her presence i ceased utterly to exist for heras utterly as i ceased to exist for joey with her curious abstractedness she forgot me again immediately i knew it as i left her yet she seemed almost in physical contact with me while i was with her  the sky was all pallid again yellowish when i went out there was no sun the snow was blue and cold i hurried away down the hill musing on maggie the road made a loop down the sharp face of the slope as i went crunching over the laborious snow i became aware of a figure striding awkwardly down the steep scarp to intercept me it was a man with his hands in front of him half stuck in his breeches pockets and his shoulders squarea real knockabout fellow alfred of course he waited for me by the stone fence  excuse me he said as i came up  i came to a halt in front of him and looked into his sullen blue eyes he had a certain odd haughtiness on his brows but his blue eyes stared insolently at me  do you know anything about a letterin frenchthat my wife openeda letter of mine  yes said i she asked me to read it to her  he looked square at me he did not know exactly how to feel  what was there in it he asked  why i said dont you know  she makes out shes burnt it he said  without showing it you i asked  he nodded slightly he seemed to be meditating as to what line of action he should take he wanted to know the contents of the letter he must know and therefore he must ask me for evidently his wife had taunted him at the same time no doubt he would like to wreak untold vengeance on my unfortunate person so he eyed me and i eyed him and neither of us spoke he did not want to repeat his request to me and yet i only looked at him and considered  suddenly he threw back his head and glanced down the valley then he changed his position and he looked at me more confidentially  she burnt the blasted thing before i saw it he said  well i answered slowly she doesnt know herself what was in it  he continued to watch me narrowly i grinned to myself  i didnt like to read her out what there was in it i continued  he suddenly flushed out so that the veins in his neck stood out and he stirred again uncomfortably  the belgian girl said her baby had been born a week ago and that they were going to call it alfred i told him  he met my eyes i was grinning he began to grin too  good luck to her he said  best of luck said i  and what did you tell her he asked  that the baby belonged to the old motherthat it was brother to your girl who was writing to you as a friend of the family  he stood smiling with the long subtle malice of a farmer  and did she take it in he asked  as much as she took anything else  he stood grinning fixedly then he broke into a short laugh  good for her he exclaimed cryptically  and then he laughed aloud once more evidently feeling he had won a big move in his contest with his wife  what about the other woman i asked  who  elise  ohhe shifted uneasilyshe was all right  youll be getting back to her i said  he looked at me then he made a grimace with his mouth  not me he said back your life its a plant  you dont think the cher petit bébé is a little alfred  it might be he said  only might  yesan theres lots of mites in a pound of cheese he laughed boisterously but uneasily  what did she say exactly he asked  i began to repeat as well as i could the phrases of the letter  mon cher alfredfiguretoi comme je suis désolée  he listened with some confusion when i had finished all i could remember he said  they know how to pitch you out a letter those belgian lasses  practice said i  they get plenty he said  there was a pause  oh well he said ive never got that letter anyhow  the wind blew fine and keen in the sunshine across the snow i blew my nose and prepared to depart  and she doesnt know anything he continued jerking his head up the hill in the direction of tible  she knows nothing but what ive saidthat is if she really burnt the letter  i believe she burnt it he said for spite shes a little devil she is but i shall have it out with her his jaw was stubborn and sullen then suddenly he turned to me with a new note  why he said why didnt you wring that b peacocks neckthat bjoey  why i said what for  i hate the brute he said i let fly at him the night i got back  i laughed he stood and mused  poor little elise he murmured  was she smallpetite i asked he jerked up his head  no he said rather tall  taller than your wife i suppose  again he looked into my eyes and then once more he went into a loud burst of laughter that made the still snowdeserted valley clap again  god its a knockout he said thoroughly amused then he stood at ease one foot out his hands in his breeches pocket in front of him his head thrown back a handsome figure of a man  but ill do that blasted joey in he mused i ran down the hill shouting also with laughter
