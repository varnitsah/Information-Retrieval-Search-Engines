87257658	wyandott√©  or  the hutted knoll  a tale  complete in one volume  by j fenimore cooper  1871           i venerate the pilgrims cause     yet for the red man dare to plead     we bow to heavens recorded laws     he turns to nature for his creed      sprague       preface    the history of the borders is filled with legends of the sufferings of isolated families during the troubled scenes of colonial warfare those which we now offer to the reader are distinctive in many of their leading facts if not rigidly true in the details the first alone is necessary to the legitimate objects of fiction  one of the misfortunes of a nation is to hear little besides its own praises although the american revolution was probably as just an effort as was ever made by a people to resist the first inroads of oppression the cause had its evil aspects as well as all other human struggles we have been so much accustomed to hear everything extolled of late years that could be dragged into the remotest connection with that great event and the principles which led to it that there is danger of overlooking truth in a pseudo patriotism nothing is really patriotic however that is not strictly true and just any more than it is paternal love to undermine the constitution of a child by an indiscriminate indulgence in pernicious diet that there were demagogues in 1776 is as certain as that there are demagogues in 1843 and will probably continue to be demagogues as long as means for misleading the common mind shall exist  a great deal of undigested morality is uttered to the world under the disguise of a pretended public virtue in the eye of reason the man who deliberately and voluntarily contracts civil engagements is more strictly bound to their fulfilment than he whose whole obligations consist of an accident over which he had not the smallest control that of birth though the very reverse of this is usually maintained under the influence of popular prejudice the reader will probably discover how we view this master in the course of our narrative  perhaps this story is obnoxious to the charge of a slight anachronism in representing the activity of the indians a year earlier than any were actually employed in the struggle of 1775 during the century of warfare that existed between the english and french colonies the savage tribes were important agents in furthering the views of the respective belligerents the war was on the frontiers and these fierce savages were in a measure necessary to the management of hostilities that invaded their own villages and huntinggrounds in 1775 the enemy came from the side of the atlantic and it was only after the struggle had acquired force that the operations of the interior rendered the services of such allies desirable in other respects without pretending to refer to any real events the incidents of this tale are believed to be sufficiently historical for all the legitimate purposes of fiction  in this book the writer has aimed at sketching several distinct varieties of the human race as true to the governing impulses of their educations habits modes of thinking and natures the red man had his morality as much as his white brother and it is well known that even christian ethics are coloured and governed by standards of opinion set up on purely human authority the honesty of one christian is not always that of another any more than his humanity truth fidelity or faith the spirit must quit its earthly tabernacle altogether ere it cease to be influenced by its tints and imperfections      chapter i    an acorn fell from an old oak tree   and lay on the frosty ground   o what shall the fate of the acorn be   was whispered all around   by lowtoned voices chiming sweet   like a flowerets bell when swung   and grasshopper steeds were gathering fleet   and the beetles hoofs uprung    mrs seba smith  there is a widespread error on the subject of american scenery from the size of the lakes the length and breadth of the rivers the vast solitudes of the forests and the seemingly boundless expanse of the prairies the world has come to attach to it an idea of grandeur a word that is in nearly every case misapplied the scenery of that portion of the american continent which has fallen to the share of the anglosaxon race very seldom rises to a scale that merits this term when it does it is more owing to the accessories as in the case of the interminable woods than to the natural face of the country to him who is accustomed to the terrific sublimity of the alps the softened and yet wild grandeur of the italian lakes or to the noble witchery of the shores of the mediterranean this country is apt to seem tame and uninteresting as a whole though it certainly has exceptions that carry charms of this nature to the verge of loveliness  of the latter character is the face of most of that region which lies in the angle formed by the junction of the mohawk with the hudson extending as far south or even farther than the line of pennsylvania and west to the verge of that vast rolling plain which composes western new york this is a region of more than ten thousand square miles of surface embracing today ten counties at least and supporting a rural population of near half a million of souls excluding the river towns  all who have seen this district of country and who are familiar with the elements of charming rather than grand scenery it possesses are agreed in extolling its capabilities and in some instances its realities the want of high finish is common to everything of this sort in america and perhaps we may add that the absence of picturesqueness as connected with the works of man is a general defect still this particular region and all others resembling it for they abound on the wide surface of the twentysix stateshas beauties of its own that it would be difficult to meet with in any of the older portions of the earth  they who have done us the honour to read our previous works will at once understand that the district to which we allude is that of which we have taken more than one occasion to write and we return to it now less with a desire to celebrate its charms than to exhibit them in a somewhat novel and yet perfectly historical aspect our own earlier labours will have told the reader that all of this extended district of country with the exception of belts of settlements along the two great rivers named was a wilderness anterior to the american revolution there was a minor class of exceptions to this general rule however to which it will be proper to advert lest by conceiving us too literally the reader may think he can convict us of a contradiction in order to be fully understood the explanations shall be given at a little length  while it is true then that the mountainous region which now contains the counties of schoharie otsego chenango broome delaware c was a wilderness in 1775 the colonial governors had begun to make grants of its lands some twenty years earlier the patent of the estate on which we are writing lies before us and it bears the date of 1769 with an indian grant annexed that is a year or two older this may be taken as a mean date for the portion of country alluded to some of the deeds being older and others still more recent these grants of land were originally made subject to quitrents to the crown and usually on the payment of heavy fees to the colonial officers after going through the somewhat supererogatory duty of extinguishing the indian title as it was called the latter were pretty effectually extinguished in that day as well as in our own and it would be a matter of curious research to ascertain the precise nature of the purchasemoney given to the aborigines in the case of the patent before us the indian right was extinguished by means of a few rifles blankets kettles and beads though the grant covers a nominal hundred thousand and a real hundred and ten or twenty thousand acres of land  the abuse of the grants as land became more valuable induced a law restricting the number of acres patented to any one person at any one time to a thousand our monarchical predecessors had the same facilities and it may be added the same propensities to rendering a law a dead letter as belongs to our republican selves the patent on our table being for a nominal hundred thousand acres contains the names of one hundred different grantees while three several parchment documents at its side each signed by thirtythree of these very persons vest the legal estate in the first named for whose sole benefit the whole concession was made the dates of the last instruments succeeding by one or two days that of the royal patent itself  such is the history of most of the original titles to the many estates that dotted the region we have described prior to the revolution money and favouritism however were not always the motives of these large concessions occasionally services presented their claims and many instances occur in which old officers of the army in particular received a species of reward by a patent for land the fees being duly paid and the indian title righteously extinguished these grants to ancient soldiers were seldom large except in the cases of officers of rank three or four thousand wellselected acres being a sufficient boon to the younger sons of scottish lairds or english squires who had been accustomed to look upon a single farm as an estate  as most of the soldiers mentioned were used to forest life from having been long stationed at frontier posts and had thus become familiarized with its privations and hardened against its dangers it was no unusual thing for them to sell out or go on halfpay when the wants of a family began to urge their claims and to retire to their patents as the land itself as well as the instrument by which it was granted was invariably termed with a view of establishing themselves permanently as landlords  these grants from the crown in the portions of the colony of new york that lie west of the river counties were generally if not invariably simple concessions of the fee subject to quitrents to the king and reservations of mines of the precious metals without any of the privileges of feudal seignory as existed in the older manors on the hudson on the islands and on the sound why this distinction was made it exceeds our power to say but that the fact was so as a rule we have it in proof by means of a great number of the original patents themselves that have been transmitted to us from various sources still the habits of home entailed the name even where the thing was not to be found titular manors exist in a few instances to this day where no manorial rights were ever granted and manorhouses were common appellations for the residences of the landlords of large estates that were held in fee without any exclusive privileges and subject to the reservation named some of these manorial residences were of so primitive an appearance as to induce the belief that the names were bestowed in pleasantry the dwellings themselves being of logs with the bark still on them and the other fixtures to correspond notwithstanding all these drawbacks early impressions and rooted habits could easily transfer terms to such an abode and there was always a saddened enjoyment among these exiles when they could liken their forest names and usages to those they had left in the distant scenes of their childhood  the effect of the different causes we have here given was to dot the region described though at long intervals with spots of a semi civilized appearance in the midst of the vastnay almost boundless expanse of forest some of these early settlements had made considerable advances towards finish and comfort ere the war of 76 drove their occupants to seek protection against the inroads of the savages and long after the influx of immigration which succeeded the peace the fruits the meadows and the tilled fields of these oases in the desert rendered them conspicuous amidst the blackened stumps piled logs and smooty fallows of an active and bustling settlement at even a much later day they were to be distinguished by the smoother surfaces of their fields the greater growth and more bountiful yield of their orchards and by the general appearance of a more finished civilization and of greater age here and there a hamlet had sprung up and isolated places like cherry valley and wyoming were found that have since become known to the general history of the country  our present tale now leads us to the description of one of those early personal or family settlements that had grown up in what was then a very remote part of the territory in question under the care and supervision of an ancient officer of the name of willoughby captain willoughby after serving many years had married an american wife and continuing his services until a son and daughter were born he sold his commission procured a grant of land and determined to retire to his new possessions in order to pass the close of his life in the tranquil pursuits of agriculture and in the bosom of his family an adopted child was also added to his cares being an educated as well as a provident man captain willoughby had set about the execution of this scheme with deliberation prudence and intelligence on the frontiers or lines as it is the custom to term the american boundaries he had become acquainted with a tuscarora known by the english sobriquet of saucy nick this fellow a sort of halfoutcast from his own people had early attached himself to the whites had acquired their language and owing to a singular mixture of good and bad qualities blended with great native shrewdness he had wormed himself into the confidence of several commanders of small garrisons among whom was our captain no sooner was the mind of the latter made up concerning his future course than he sent for nick who was then in the fort when the following conversation took place  nick commenced the captain passing his hand over his brow as was his wont when in a reflecting mood nick i have an important movement in view in which you can be of some service to me  the tuscarora fastening his dark basilisklike eyes on the soldier gazed a moment as if to read his soul then he jerked a thumb backward over his own shoulder and said with a grave smile  nick understand want six two scalp off frenchmans head wife and child out yonder over dere up in canada nick do himwhat you give  no you red rascal i want nothing of the sortit is peace now this conversation took place in 1764 and you know i never bought a scalp in time of war let me hear no more of this  what you want den asked nick like one who was a good deal puzzled  i want landgood landlittle but good i am about to get a granta patent  yes interrupted nick nodding i know himpaper to

susquehannah and delaware where the streams run rapidly and where there are no fevers and bring me an account of three or four thousand acres of rich bottomland in such a way as a surveyor can find it and i can get a patent for it what say you nick will you go  he not wanted nick sell e captain his own land here in e fort  knave do you not know me well enough not to trifle when i am serious  nick serous toomoravian priest no serouser more dan nick at dis moment got land to sell  captain willoughby had found occasion to punish the tuscarora in the course of his services and as the parties understood each other perfectly well the former saw the improbability of the latters daring to trifle with him  where is this land of yours nick he inquired after studying the indians countenance for a moment where does it lie what is it like how much is there of it and how came you to own it  ask him just so agin said nick taking up four twigs to note down the questions seriatim  the captain repeated his inquiries the tuscarora laying down a stick at each separate interrogatory  where he be answered nick taking up a twig as a memorandum he out derewhere he want himwhere he sayone days march from susquehanna  well proceed  what he likelike land to be sure tink he like water got some waterno too muchgot some landgot no treegot some tree got good sugarbushgot place for wheat and corn

too familiar with the woods not to understand the value of such a thing  no destroystand up yetgood as evernick dere last season  why then do you tell of it are not the beaver of more value to you than any price you may receive for the land  cotch him all four two year agorest run away no find beaver to stay long when indian once know two time where to set he trap beaver cunninger an pale

and rough or will it be good for corn  all sugarbushwhat you want better spose you want corn plant him spose you want sugar make him  captain willoughby was struck with this description and he returned to the subject again and again at length after extracting all the information he could get from nick he struck a bargain with the fellow a surveyor was engaged and he started for the place under the guidance of the tuscarora the result showed that nick had not exaggerated the pond was found as he had described it to be covering at least four hundred acres of low bottomland while near three thousand acres of higher riverflat covered with beach and maple spread around it for a considerable distance the adjacent mountains too were arable though bold and promised in time to become a fertile and manageable district calculating his distances with judgment the surveyor laid out his metes and bounds in such a manner as to include the pond all the lowland and about three thousand acres of hill or mountain making the materials for a very pretty little patent of somewhat more than six thousand acres of capital land he then collected a few chiefs of the nearest tribe dealt out his rum tobacco blankets wampum and gunpowder got twelve indians to make their marks on a bit of deerskin and returned to his employer with a map a fieldbook and a deed by which the indian title was extinguished the surveyor received his compensation and set off on a similar excursion for a different employer and in another direction nick got his reward too and was well satisfied with the transaction this he afterwards called sellin beaver when he all run away  furnished with the necessary means captain willoughby now sued out his patent as it was termed in due form having some influence the affair was soon arranged the grant was made by the governor in council a massive seal was annexed to a famous sheet of parchment the signatures were obtained and willoughbys patent took its place on the records of the colony as well as on its maps we are wrong as respects the latter particular it did not take its place on the maps of the colony though it took a place the location given for many years afterwards being some forty or fifty miles too far west in this peculiarity there was nothing novel the surveys of all new regions being liable to similar trifling mistakes thus it was that an estate lying within fiveandtwenty miles of the city of new york and in which we happen to have a small interest at this hour was clipped of its fair proportions in consequence of losing some miles that run over obtrusively into another colony and within a short distance of the spot where we are writing a patent has been squeezed entirely out of existence between the claims of two older grants  no such calamity befell willoughbys patent however the land was found with all its marked or blazed trees its heaps of stones large butternut corners and dead oaks in a word everything was as it should be even to the quality of the soil the beaverpond and the quantity as respects the last the colony never gave struck measure a thousand acres on paper seldom falling short of eleven or twelve hundred in soil in the present instance the six thousand two hundred and fortysix acres of willoughbys patent were subsequently ascertained to contain just seven thousand and ninetytwo acres of solid ground  our limits and plan will not permit us to give more than a sketch of the proceedings of the captain in taking possession though we feel certain that a minute account of the progress of such a settlement would possess a sort of robinson crusoelike interest that might repay the reader as usual the adventurers commenced their operations in the spring mrs willoughby and the children were left with their friends in albany while the captain and his party pioneered their way to the patent in the best manner they could this party consisted of nick who went in the capacity of hunter an office of a good deal of dignity and of the last importance to a set of adventurers on an expedition of this nature then there were eight axemen a house carpenter a mason and a millwright these with captain willoughby and an invalid sergeant of the name of joyce composed the party  our adventurers made most of their journey by water after finding their way to the head of the canaideraga mistaking it for the otsego they felled trees hollowed them into canoes embarked and aided by a yoke of oxen that were driven along the shore they wormed their way through the oaks into the susquehanna descending that river until they reached the unadilla which stream they ascended until they came to the small river known in the parlance of the country by the erroneous name of a creek that ran through the captains new estate the labour of this ascent was exceedingly severe but the whole journey was completed by the end of april and while the streams were high snow still lay in the woods but the sap had started and the season was beginning to show its promise  the first measure adopted by our adventurers was to hut in the very centre of the pond which it will be remembered covered four hundred acres was an island of some five or six acres in extent it was a rocky knoll that rose forty feet above the surface of the water and was still crowned with noble pines a species of tree that had escaped the ravages of the beaver in the pond itself a few stubs alone remained the water having killed the trees which had fallen and decayed this circumstance showed that the stream had long before been dammed successions of families of beavers having probably occupied the place and renewed the works for centuries at intervals of generations the dam in existence however was not very old the animals having fled from their great enemy man rather than from any other foe  to the island captain willoughby transferred all his stores and here he built his hut this was opposed to the notions of his axemen who rightly enough fancied the mainland would be more convenient but the captain and the sergeant after a council of war decided that the position on the knoll would be the most military and might be defended the longest against man or beast another station was taken up however on the nearest shore where such of the men were permitted to hut as preferred the location  these preliminaries observed the captain meditated a bold stroke against the wilderness by draining the pond and coming at once into the possession of a noble farm cleared of trees and stumps as it might be by a coup de main this would be compressing the results of ordinary years of toil into those of a single season and everybody was agreed as to the expediency of the course provided it were feasible  the feasibility was soon ascertained the stream which ran through the valley was far from swift until it reached a pass where the hills approached each other in low promontories there the land fell rapidly away to what might be termed a lower terrace across this gorge or defile a distance of about five hundred feet the dam had been thrown a good deal aided by the position of some rocks that here rose to the surface and through which the little river found its passage the part which might be termed the keystone of the dam was only twenty yards wide and immediately below it the rocks fell away rapidly quite sixty feet carrying down the waste water in a sort of fall here the millwright announced his determination to commence operations at once putting in a protest against destroying the works of the beavers a pond of four hundred acres being too great a luxury for the region the man was overruled and the labour commenced  the first blow was struck against the dam about nine oclock on the 2d day of may 1765 and by evening the little sylvanlooking lake which had lain embedded in the forest glittering in the morning sun unruffled by a breath of air had entirely disappeared in its place there remained an open expanse of wet mud thickly covered with pools and the remains of beaverhouses with a small river winding its way slowly through the slime the change to the eye was melancholy indeed though the prospect was cheering to the agriculturist no sooner did the water obtain a little passage than it began to clear the way for itself gushing out in a torrent through the pass already mentioned  the following morning captain willoughby almost mourned over the works of his hands the scene was so very different from that it had presented when the flats were covered with water that it was impossible not to feel the change for quite a month it had an influence on the whole party nick in particular denounced it as unwise and uncalled for though he had made his price out of the very circumstance in prospective and even sergeant joyce was compelled to admit that the knoll an island no longer had lost quite half its security as a military position the next month however brought other changes half the pools had vanished by drainings and evaporation the mud had begun to crack and in some places to pulverize while the upper margin of the old pond had become sufficiently firm to permit the oxen to walk over it without miring fences of trees brush and even rails enclosed on this portion of the flats quite fifty acres of land and indian corn oats pumpkins peas potatoes flax and several other sorts of seed were already in the ground the spring proved dry and the sun of the fortythird degree of latitude was doing its work with great power and beneficence what was of nearly equal importance the age of the pond had prevented any recent accumulation of vegetable matter and consequently spared those who laboured around the spot the impurities of atmosphere usually consequent on its decay grassseed too had been liberally scattered on favourable places and things began to assume the appearance of what is termed living  august presented a still different picture a sawmill was up and had been at work for some time piles of green boards began to make their appearance and the plane of the carpenter was already in motion captain willoughby was rich in a small way in other words he possessed a few thousand pounds besides his land and had yet to receive the price of his commission a portion of these means were employed judiciously to advance his establishment and satisfied that there would be no scarcity of fodder for the ensuing winter a man had been sent into the settlements for another yoke of cattle and a couple of cows farming utensils were manufactured on the spot and sleds began to take the place of carts the latter exceeding the skill of any of the workmen present  october offered its products as a reward for all this toil the yield was enormous and of excellent quality of indian corn the captain gathered several hundred bushels besides stacks of stalks and tops his turnips too were superabundant in quantity and of a delicacy and flavour entirely unknown to the precincts of old lands the potatoes had not done so well to own the truth they were a little watery though there were enough of them to winter every hoof he had of themselves then the peas and garden truck were both good and plenty and a few pigs having been procured there was the certainty of enjoying a plenty of that important article pork during the coming winter  late in the autumn the captain rejoined his family in albany quitting the field for winter quarters he left sergeant joyce in garrison supported by nick a miller the mason carpenter and three of the axemen their duty was to prepare materials for the approaching season to take care of the stock to put in winter crops to make a few bridges clear out a road or two haul wood to keep themselves from freezing to build a log barn and some sheds and otherwise to advance the interests of the settlement they were also to commence a house for the patentee  as his children were at school captain willoughby determined not to take his family immediately to the hutted knoll as the place soon came to be called from the circumstance of the original bivouack this name was conferred by sergeant joyce who had a taste in that way and as it got to be confirmed by the condescension of the proprietor and his family we have chosen it to designate our present labours from time to time a messenger arrived with news from the place and twice in the course of the winter the same individual went back with supplies and encouraging messages to the different persons left in the clearing as spring approached however the captain began to make his preparations for the coming campaign in which he was to be accompanied by his wife mrs willoughby a mild affectionate truehearted new york woman having decided not to let her husband pass another summer in that solitude without feeling the cheering influence of her presence  in march before the snow began to melt several sleighloads of different necessaries were sent up the valley of the mohawk to a point opposite the head of the otsego where a thriving village called fortplain now stands thence men were employed in transporting the articles partly by means of jumpers improvised for the occasion and partly on packhorses to the lake which was found this time instead of its neighbour the canaderaiga this necessary and laborious service occupied six weeks the captain having been up as far as the lake once himself returning to albany however ere the snow was gone      chapter ii    all things are newthe buds the leaves   that gild the elmtrees nodding crest   and even the nest beneath the eaves   there are no birds in last years nest    longfellow  i have good news for you wilhelmina cried the captain coming into the parlour where his wife used to sit and knit or sew quite half the day and speaking with a bright face and in a cheerful voicehere is a letter from my excellent old colonel and bobs affair is all settled and agreed on he is to leave school next week and to put on his majestys livery the week after  mrs willoughby smiled and yet two or three tears followed each other down her cheeks even while she smiled the first was produced by pleasure at hearing that her son had got an ensigncy in the 60th or royal americans and the last was a tribute paid to nature a mothers fears at consigning an only boy to the profession of arms  i am rejoiced willoughby she said because you rejoice and i know that robert will be delighted at possessing the kings commission but he is very young to be sent into the dangers of battle and the camp  i was younger when i actually went into battle for then it was war now we have a peace that promises to be endless and bob will have abundance of time to cultivate a beard before he smells gunpowder as for myselfhe added in a halfregretful manner for old habits and opinions would occasionally cross his mindas for myself the cultivation of turnips must be my future occupation well the bit of parchment is sold bob has got his in its place while the difference in price is in my pocket and no more need be saidand here come our dear girls wilhelmina to prevent any regrets the father of two such daughters ought at least to be happy  at this instant beulah and maud willoughby for so the adopted child was called as well as the real entered the room having taken the lodgings of their parents in a morning walk on which they were regularly sent by the mistress of the boardingschool in which they were receiving what was then thought to be a firstrate american female education and much reason had their fond parents to be proud of them beulah the eldest was just eleven while her sister was eighteen months younger the first had a staid and yet a cheerful look but her cheeks were blooming her eyes bright and her smile sweet maud the adopted one however had already the sunny countenance of an angel with quite as much of the appearance of health as her sister her face had more finesse her looks more intelligence her playfulness more feeling her smile more tenderness at times at others more meaning it is scarcely necessary to say that both had that delicacy of outline which seems almost inseparable from the female form in this country what was perhaps more usual in that day among persons of their class than it is in our own each spoke her own language with an even graceful utterance and a faultless accuracy of pronunciation equally removed from effort and provincialisms as the dutch was in very common use then at albany and most females of dutch origin had a slight touch of their mother tongue in their enunciation of english this purity of dialect in the two girls was to be ascribed to the fact that their father was an englishman by birth their mother an american of purely english origin though named after a dutch god mother and the head of the school in which they had now been three years was a native of london and a lady by habits and education  now maud cried the captain after he had kissed the forehead eyes and cheeks of his smiling little favouritenow maud i will set you to guess what good news i have for you and beulah  you and mother dont mean to go to that bad beave manor this summer as some call the ugly pond answered the child quick as lightning  that is kind of you my darling more kind than prudent but you are not right  try beulah now interrupted the mother who while she too doted on her youngest child had an increasing respect for the greater solidity and better judgment of her sister let us hear beulahs guess  it is something about my brother i know by mothers eyes answered the eldest girl looking inquiringly into mrs willoughbys face  oh yes cried maud beginning to jump about the room until she ended her saltations in her fathers armsbob has got his commissioni know it all well enough nowi would not thank you to tell mei know it all nowdear bob how he will laugh and how happy i am  is it so mother asked beulah anxiously and without even a smile  maud is right bob is an ensignor will be one in a day or two you do not seem pleased my child  i wish robert were not a soldier mother now he will be always away and we shall never see him then he may be obliged to fight and who knows how unhappy it may make him  beulah thought more of her brother than she did of herself and sooth to say her mother had many of the childs misgivings with maud it was altogether different she saw only the bright side of the picture bob gay and brilliant his face covered with smiles his appearance admired himself and of course his sisters happy captain willoughby sympathized altogether with his pet accustomed to arms he rejoiced that a career in which he had partially failedthis he did not conceal from himself or his wifethat this same career had opened as he trusted with better auspices on his only son he covered maud with kisses and then rushed from the house finding his heart too full to run the risk of being unmanned in the presence of females  a week later availing themselves of one of the last falls of snow of the season captain willoughby and his wife left albany for the knoll the leavetaking was tender and to the parents bitter though after all it was known that little more than a hundred miles would separate them from their beloved daughters fifty of these miles however were absolutely wilderness and to achieve them quite a hundred of tangled forest or of difficult navigation were to be passed the communications would be at considerable intervals and difficult still they might be held and the anxious mother left many injunctions with mrs waring the head of the school in relation to the health of her daughters and the manner in which she was to be sent for in the event of any serious illness  mrs willoughby had often overcome as she fancied the difficulties of a wilderness in the company of her husband it is the fashion highly to extol napoleons passage of the alps simply in reference to its physical obstacles there never was a brigade moved twentyfour hours into the american wilds that had not greater embarrassments of this nature to overcome unless in those cases in which favourable river navigation has offered its facilities still time and necessity had made a sort of military ways to all the more important frontier points occupied by the british garrisons and the experience of mrs willoughby had not hitherto been of the severe character of that she was now compelled to undergo  the first fifty miles were passed over in a sleigh in a few hours and with little or no personal fatigue this brought the travellers to a dutch inn on the mohawk where the captain had often made his halts and whither he had from time to time sent his advanced parties in the course of the winter and spring here a jumper was found prepared to receive mrs willoughby and the horse being led by the captain himself a passage through the forest was effected as far as the head of the otsego the distance being about twelve miles it required two days for its performance as the settlements extended south from the mohawk a few miles the first night was passed in a log cabin on the extreme verge of civilization if civilization it could be called and the remaining eight miles were got over in the course of the succeeding day this was more than would probably have been achieved in the virgin forest and under the circumstances had not so many of the captains people passed over the same ground going and returning thereby learning how to avoid the greatest difficulties of the route and here and there constructing a rude bridge they had also blazed the trees shortening the road by pointing out its true direction  at the head of the otsego our adventurers were fairly in the wilderness huts had been built to receive the travellers and here the whole party assembled in readiness to make a fresh start in company it consisted of more than a dozen persons in all the black domestics of the family being present as well as several mechanics whom captain willoughby had employed to carry on his improvements the men sent in advance had not been idle any more than those left at the hutted knoll they had built three or four skiffs one small batteau and a couple of canoes these were all in the water in waiting for the disappearance of the ice which was now reduced to a mass of stalactites in form greenish and sombre in hue as they floated in a body but clear and bright when separated and exposed to the sun the south winds began to prevail and the shore was glittering with the fastmelting piles of the frozen fluid though it would have been vain yet to attempt a passage through it  the otsego is a sheet that we have taken more than one occasion to describe and the picture it then presented amidst its frame of mountains will readily be imagined by most of our readers in 1765 no sign of a settlement was visible on its shores few of the grants of land in that vicinity extending back so far still the spot began to be known and hunters had been in the habit of frequenting its bosom and its shores for the last twenty years or more not a vestige of their presence however was to be seen from the huts of the captain but mrs willoughby assured her husband as she stood leaning on his arm the morning after her arrival that never before had she gazed on so eloquent and yet so pleasing a picture of solitude as that which lay spread before her eyes  there is something encouraging and soothing in this bland south wind too she added which seems to promise that we shall meet with a beneficent nature in the spot to which we are going the south airs of spring to me are always filled with promise  and justly love for they are the harbingers of a renewed vegetation if the wind increase as i think it may we shall see this chilling sheet of ice succeeded by the more cheerful view of water it is in this way that all these lakes open their bosoms in april  captain willoughby did not know it while speaking but at that moment quite two miles of the lower or southern end of the lake was clear and the opening giving a sweep to the breeze the latter was already driving the sheets of ice before it towards the head at a rate of quite a mile in the hour just then an irishman named michael ohearn who had recently arrived in america and whom the captain had hired as a servant of all work came rushing up to his master and opened his teeming thoughts with an earnestness of manner and a confusion of rhetoric that were equally characteristic of the man and of a portion of his nation  is it journeying south or to the other end of this bit of wather or ice that yer honour is thinking of he cried well and therell be room for us all and to spare for divil a birrd will be left in that quarter by night or forenent twelve oclock either calculating by the clock if one had such a thing as a body might say  as this was said not only vehemently but with an accent that defies imitation with the pen mrs willoughby was quite at a loss to get a clue to the idea but her husband more accustomed to men of mikes class was sufficiently lucky to comprehend what he was at  you mean the pigeons mike i suppose the captain answered good humouredly there are certainly a goodly number of them and i dare say our hunters will bring us in some for dinner it is a certain sign that the winter is gone when birds and beasts follow their instincts in this manner where are you from mike  county leitrim yer honour answered the other touching his cap  ay that one may guess said the captain smiling but where last  from looking at the birrds siroch its a sight that will do madam good and contains a sartainty therell be room enough made for us where all these cratures came from im thinking yer honour if we dont ate them theyll be wanting to ate us what a power of them counting big and little though they re all of a size just as much as if they had flown through a hole made on purpose to kape them down to a convanient bigness in body and feathers  such a flight of pigeons in ireland would make a sensation mike observed the captain willing to amuse his wife by drawing out the county leitrimman a little  it would make a dinner yer honour for every mothers son of em counting the gurrrls in the bargain such a power of birrds would knock down praties in a wonderful degree and make even butthermilk chape and plenthiful will it be always such abundance with us down at the huts yer honour or is this sight only a delusion to fill us with hopes thats never to be satisfied  pigeons are seldom wanting in this country mike in the spring and autumn though we have both birds and beasts in plenty that are preferable for food  will it be plentthier than thiswell its enough to destroy human appetite the sight of em id give the half joe i lost among them blackguards in albany at their pauss as they calls it jist to let my sisthers childer have their supper out of one of these flocks such as they are betther or no betther och its pleasant to think of them childer having their will for once on such a power of wild savage birrds  captain willoughby smiled at this proof of naivet√© in his new domestic and then led his wife back to the hut if being time to make some fresh dispositions for the approaching movement by noon it became apparent to those who were waiting such an event that the lake was opening and about the same time one of the hunters came in from a neighbouring mountain and reported that he had seen clear water as near their position as three or four miles by this time it was blowing fresh and the wind having a clear rake drove up the honeycomb looking sheet before it as the scraper accumulates snow when the sun set the whole north shore was white with piles of glittering icicles while the bosom of the otsego no longer disturbed by the wind resembled a placid mirror  early on the following morning the whole party embarked there was no wind and men were placed at the paddles and the oars care was taken on quitting the huts to close their doors and shutters for they were to be taverns to cover the heads of many a traveller in the frequent journeys that were likely to be made between the knoll and the settlements these stations then were of the last importance and a frontierman always had the same regard for them that the mountaineer of the alps has for his refuge  the passage down the otsego was the easiest and most agreeable portion of the whole journey the day was pleasant and the oarsmen vigorous if not very skilful rendering the movement rapid and sufficiently direct but one drawback occurred to the prosperity of the voyage among the labourers hired by the captain was a connecticut man of the name of joel strides between whom and the county leitrimman there had early commenced a warfare of tricks and petty annoyances a warfare that was perfectly defensive on the part of ohearn who did little more in the way of retort than comment on the long lank shapeless figure and meagre countenance of his enemy joel had not been seen to smile since he engaged with the captain though three times had he laughed outright and each time at the occurrence of some mishap to michael ohearn the fruit of one of his own schemes of annoyance  on the present occasion joel who had the distribution of such duty placed mike in a skiff by himself flattering the poor fellow with the credit he would achieve by rowing a boat to the foot of the lake without assistance he might as well have asked mike to walk to the outlet on the surface of the water this arrangement proceeded from an innate love of mischief in joel who had much of the quiet waggery blended with many of the bad qualities of the men of his peculiar class a narrow and conceited selfishness lay at the root of the larger portion of this mans faults as a physical being he was a perfect laboursaving machine himself bringing all the resources of a naturally quick and acute mind to bear on this one end never doing anything that required a particle more than the exertion and strength that were absolutely necessary to effect his object he rowed the skiff in which the captain and his wife had embarked with his own hands and previously to starting he had selected the best sculls from the other boats had fitted his twhart with the closest attention to his own ease and had placed a stretcher for his feet with an intelligence and knowledge of mechanics that would have done credit to a whitehall waterman this much proceeded from the predominating principle of his nature which was always to have an eye on the interests of joel strides though the effect happened in this instance to be beneficial to those he served  michael ohearn on the contrary thought only of the end and this so intensely not to so say vehemently as generally to overlook the means frank generous selfdevoted and withal accustomed to get most things wrongendforemost he usually threw away twice the same labour in effecting a given purpose that was expended by the yankee doing the thing worse too besides losing twice the time he never paused to think of this however the masthers boat was to be rowed to the other end of the lake and though he had never rowed a boat an inch in his life he was ready and willing to undertake the job if a certain quantity of work will not do it thought mike ill try as much agin and the divil is in it if that wont sarve the purpose of that little bit of a job  under such circumstances the party started most of the skiffs and canoes went off half an hour before mrs willoughby was ready and joel managed to keep mike for he last under the pretence of wishing his aid in loading his own boat with the bed and bedding from the hut all was ready at length and taking his seat with a sort of quiet deliberation joel said in his drawling way youll follow us mike and you cant be a thousand miles out of the way then he pulled from the shore with a quiet steady stroke of the sculls that sent the skiff ahead with great rapidity though with much ease to himself  michael ohearn stood looking at the retiring skiff in silent admiration for two or three minutes he was quite alone for all the other boats were already two or three miles on their way and distance already prevented him from seeing the mischief that was lurking in joels hypocritical eyes  follow yees soliloquized mikethe divil burn ye for a guessing yankee as ye arhow am i to follow with such legs as the likes of these if it wasnt for the masther and the missus raal jontlemen and ladies they be id turn my back on ye in the desert and let ye find that beaver estate in yer own disagreeable company hawell i must thry and if the boat wont go itll be no fault of the man that has a good disposition to make it  mike now took his seat on a board that lay across the gunwale of the skiff at a most inconvenient height placed two sculls in the water one of which was six inches longer than the other made a desperate effort and got his craft fairly afloat now michael ohearn was not lefthanded and as usually happens with such men the inequality between the two limbs was quite marked by a sinister accident too it happened that the longest oar got into the strongest hand and there it would have staid to the end of time before mike would think of changing it on that account joel alone sat with his face towards the head of the lake and he alone could see the dilemma in which the county leitrimman was placed neither the captain nor his wife thought of looking behind and the yankee had all the fun to himself as for mike he succeeded in getting a few rods from the land when the strong arm and the longer lever asserting their superiority the skiff began to incline to the westward so intense however was the poor fellows zeal that he did not discover the change in his course until he had so far turned as to give him a glimpse of his retiring master then he inferred that all was right and pulled more leisurely the result was that in about ten minutes mike was stopped by the land the boat touching the north shore again two or three rods from the very point whence it had started the honest fellow got up looked around him scratched his head gazed wistfully after the fastreceding boat of his master and broke out in another soliloquy  bad luck to them that made ye ye onesided thing he said shaking his head reproachfully at the skiff theres liberty for ye to do as ye ought and yell not be doing it just out of contrairiness why the divil cant ye do like the other skiffs and go where yere wanted on the road towards thim beavers och yell be sorry for this when yere left behind out of sight  then it flashed on mikes mind that possibly some article had been left in the hut and the skiff had come back to look after it so up he ran to the captains deserted lodge entered it was lost to view for a minute then came in sight again scratching his head and renewing his mutteringno he said divil a thing can i see and it must be pure contrairiness perhaps the baste will behave betther next time so ill thry it agin and give it an occasion barring obstinacy t is as goodlookin a skiff as the best of them  mike was as good as his word and gave the skiff as fair an opportunity of behaving itself as was ever offered to a boat seven times did he quit the shore and as often return to it gradually working his way towards the western shore and slightly down the lake in this manner mike at length got himself so far on the side of the lake as to present a barrier of land to the evil disposition of his skiff to incline to the westward it could go no longer in that direction at least  divil burn ye the honest fellow cried the perspiration rolling down his face i think yell be satisfied without walking out into the forest where i wish ye war with all my heart amang the threes that made ye now ill see if yer contrairy enough to run up a hill  mike next essayed to pull along the shore in the hope that the sight of the land and of the overhanging pines and hemlocks would cure the boats propensity to turn in that direction it is not necessary to say that his expectations were disappointed and he finally was reduced to getting out into the water cool as was the weather and of wading along the shore dragging the boat after him all this joel saw before he passed out of sight but no movement of his muscles let the captain into the secret of the poor irishmans strait  in the meanwhile the rest of the flotilla or brigade of boats as the captain termed them went prosperously on their way going from one end of the lake to the other in the course of three hours as one of the party had been over the route several times already there was no hesitation on the subject of the point to which the boats were to proceed they all touched the shore near the stone that is now called the otsego rock beneath a steep wooded bank and quite near to the place where the susquehannah glanced out of the lake in a swift current beneath a higharched tracery of branches that were not yet clothed with leaves  here the question was put as to what had become of mike his skiff was nowhere visible and the captain felt the necessity of having him looked for before he proceeded any further after a short consultation a boat manned by two negroes father and son named pliny the elder and pliny the younger or in common parlance old plin and young plin was sent back along the westshore to hunt him up of course a hut was immediately prepared for the reception of mrs willoughby upon the plain that stretches across the valley at this point this was on the site of the present village of cooperstown but just twenty years anterior to the commencement of the pretty little shire town that now exists on the spot  it was night ere the two plinies appeared towing mike as their great namesakes of antiquity might have brought in a carthaginian galley in triumph the county leitrimman had made his way with excessive toil about a league ere he was met and glad enough was he to see his succour approach in that day the strong antipathy which now exists between the black and the emigrant irishman was unknown the competition for household service commencing more than half a century later still as the negro loved fun constitutionally and pliny the younger was somewhat of a wag mike did not entirely escape scotfree  why you drag im like ox irish mike cried the younger negrowhy you no row im like other folk  ahyoure as bad as the rest of em growled mike they tould me ameriky was a mighty warm country and warrm i find it sure enough though the wather isnt as warm as good whiskey come ye black divils and see if ye can coax this contrairy crathure to do as a person wants  the negroes soon had mike in tow and then they went down the lake merrily laughing and cracking their jokes at the irishmans expense after the fashion of their race it was fortunate for the leitrimman that he was accustomed to ditching though it may be questioned if the pores of his body closed again that day so very effectually had they been opened when he rejoined his master not a syllable was said of the mishap joel having the prudence to keep his own secret and even joining mike in denouncing the bad qualities of the boat we will only add here that a little calculation entered into this trick joel perceiving that mike was a favourite and wishing to bring him into discredit  early the next morning the captain sent the negroes and mike down the susquehannah a mile to clear away some floodwood of which one of the hunters had brought in a report the preceding day two hours later the boats left the shore and began to float downward with the current following the direction of a stream that has obtained its name from its sinuosities  in a few minutes the boats reached the floodwood where to joels great amusement mike and the negroes the latter having little more calculation than the former had commenced their operations on the upper side of the raft piling the logs on one another with a view to make a passage through the centre of course there was a halt the females landing captain willoughby now cast an eye round him in hesitation when a knowing look from joel caught his attention  this does not seem to be right he saidcannot we better if a little  its right wrong captain answered joel laughing like one who enjoyed other peoples ignorance a sensible crittur would begin the work on such a job at the lower side of the raft  take the direction and order things to suit yourself  this was just what joel liked headwork before all other work for him and he set about the duty authoritatively and with promptitude after rating the negroes roundly for their stupidity and laying it on mike without much delicacy of thought or diction over the shoulders of the two blacks he mustered his forces and began to clear the channel with intelligence and readiness  going to the lower side of the jammed floodwood he soon succeeded in loosening one or two trees which floated away making room for others to follow by these means a passage was effected in half an hour joel having the prudence to set no more timber in motion than was necessary to his purpose lest it might choke the stream below in this manner the party got through and the river being high at that season by night the travellers were halfway to the mouth of the unadilla the next evening they encamped at the junction of the two streams making their preparations to ascend the latter the following morning  the toil of the ascent however did not commence until the boats entered what was called the creek or the small tributary of the unadilla on which the beavers had erected their works and which ran through the manor here indeed the progress was slow and laborious the rapidity of the current and the shallowness of the water rendering every foot gained a work of exertion and pain perseverance and skill notwithstanding prevailed all the boats reaching the foot of the rapids or straggling falls on which the captain had built his mills about an hour before the sun disappeared here of course the boats were left a rude road having been cut by means of which the freights were transported on a sledge the remainder of the distance throughout the whole of this trying day joel had not only worked headwork but he had actually exerted himself with his body as for mike never before had he made such desperate efforts he felt all the disgrace of his adventure on the lake and was disposed to wipe it out by his exploits on the rivers thus mike was ever loyal to his employer he had sold his flesh and blood for money and a man of his conscience was inclined to give a fair pennysworth the tractable manner in which the boat had floated down the river it is true caused him some surprise as was shown in his remark to the younger pliny on landing  this is a curious boat afther all said pat one time its all contrariness and then agin its as obliging as ones own mother it followed the day alls one like a puppy dog while yon on the big wather there was no more dhriving it than a hog och its a faimale boat by its whims      chapter iii    he sleeps forgetful of his once bright flame   he has no feeling of the glory gone   he has no eye to catch the mounting flame   that once in transport drew him on   he lies in dull oblivious dreams nor cares   who the wreathed laurel bears    percival  the appearance of a place in which the remainder of ones life is to be past is always noted with interest on a first visit thus it was that mrs willoughby had been observant and silent from the moment the captain informed her that they had passed the line of his estate and were approaching the spot where they were to dwell the stream was so small and the girding of the forest so close that there was little range for the sight but the anxious wife and mother could perceive that the hills drew together at this point the valley narrowing essentially that rocks began to appear in the bed of the river and that the growth of the timber indicated fertility and a generous soil  when the boat stopped the little stream came brawling down a ragged declivity and a mill one so arranged as to grind and saw both in a very small way however gave the first signs of civilization she had beheld since quitting the last hut near the mohawk after issuing a few orders the captain drew his wifes arm through his own and hurried up the ascent with an eagerness that was almost boyish to show her what had been done towards the improvement of the knoll there is a pleasure in diving into a virgin forest and commencing the labours of civilization that has no exact parallel in any other human occupation that of building or of laying out grounds has certainly some resemblance to it but it is a resemblance so faint and distant as scarcely to liken the enjoyment each produces the former approaches nearer to the feeling of creating and is far more pregnant with anticipations and hopes though its first effects are seldom agreeable and are sometimes nearly hideous our captain however had escaped most of these last consequences by possessing the advantage of having a clearing without going through the usual processes of chopping and burning the first of which leaves the earth dotted for many years with unsightly stumps while the rains and snows do not wash out the hues of the last for several seasons  an exclamation betrayed the pleasure with which mrs willoughby got her first glimpse of the drained pond it was when she had clambered to the point of the rocks where the stream began to tumble downward into the valley below a year had done a vast deal for the place the few stumps and stubs which had disfigured the basin when it was first laid bare had all been drawn by oxen and burned this left the entire surface of the four hundred acres smooth and fit for the plough the soil was the deposit of centuries and the inclination from the woods to the stream was scarcely perceptible to the eye in fact it was barely sufficient to drain the drippings of the winters snows the form of the area was a little irregular just enough so to be picturesque while the inequalities were surprisingly few and trifling in a word nature had formed just such a spot as delights the husbandmans heart and placed it beneath a sun which while its fierceness is relieved by winters of frost and snow had a power to bring out all its latent resources  trees had been felled around the whole area with the open spaces filled by branches in a way to form what is termed a brush fence this is not a sightly object and the captain had ordered the line to be drawn within the woods so that the visible boundaries of the open land were the virgin forest itself his men had protested against this a fence however unseemly being in their view an indispensable accessory to civilization but the captains authority if not his better taste prevailed and the boundary of felled trees and brush was completely concealed in the background of woods as yet there was no necessity for crossfences the whole open space lying in a single field one hundred acres were in winter wheat as this grain had been got in the previous autumn it was now standing on the finest and driest of the soil giving an air of rich fertility to the whole basin grassseed had been sown along both banks of the stream and its waters were quietly flowing between two wide belts of fresh verdure the young plants having already started in that sheltered receptacle of the suns rays other portions of the flat showed signs of improvement the plough having actually been at work for quite a fortnight  all this was far more than even the captain had expected and much more than his wife had dared to hope mrs willoughby had been accustomed to witness the slow progress of a new settlement but never before had she seen what might be done on a beaverdam to her all appeared like magic and her first question would have been to ask her husband to explain what had been done with the trees and stumps had not her future residence caught her eye captain willoughby had left his orders concerning the house previously to quitting the knoll and he was now well pleased to perceive that they had been attended to as this spot will prove the scene of many of the incidents we are bound to relate it may be proper here to describe it at some length  the hillock that rose out of the pond in the form of a rocky little island was one of those capricious formations that are often met with on the surface of the earth it stood about thirty rods from the northern side of the area very nearly central as to its eastern and western boundaries and presented a slope inclining towards the south its greatest height was at its northern end where it rose out of the rich alluvion of the soil literally a rock of some forty feet in perpendicular height having a summit of about an acre of level land and falling off on its three sides to the east and west precipitously to the south quite gently and with regularity it was this accidental formation which had induced the captain to select the spot as the site of his residence for dwelling so far from any post and in a place so difficult of access something like military defences were merely precautions of ordinary prudence while the pond remained the islet was susceptible of being made very strong against any of the usual assaults of indian warfare and now that the basin was drained it had great advantages for the same purpose the perpendicular rock to the north even overhung the plain it was almost inaccessible while the formation on the other sides offered singular facilities both for a dwelling and for security all this the captain who was so familiar with the finesse of indian stratagem had resolved to improve in the following manner  in the first place he directed the men to build a massive wall of stone for a hundred and fifty feet in length and six feet in height this stretched in front of the perpendicular rock with receding walls to its verge the latter were about two hundred feet in length each this was enclosing an area of two hundred by one hundred and fifty feet within a blind wall of masonry through this wall there was only a single passage a gateway in the centre of its southern face the materials had all been found on the hill itself which was well covered with heavy stones within this wall which was substantially laid by a scotch mason one accustomed to the craft the men had erected a building of massive squared pine timber well secured by cross partitions this building followed the wall in its whole extent was just fifteen feet in elevation without the roof and was composed in part by the wall itself the latter forming nearly onehalf its height on the exterior the breadth of this edifice was only twenty feet clear of the stones and woodwork leaving a court within of about one hundred by one hundred and seventyfive feet in extent the roof extended over the gateway even so that the space within was completely covered the gates being closed this much had been done during the preceding fall and winter the edifice presenting an appearance of rude completeness on the exterior still it had a sombre and goallike air there being nothing resembling a window visible no aperture indeed on either of its outer faces but the open gateway of which the massive leaves were finished and placed against the adjacent walls but which were not yet hung it is scarcely necessary to say this house resembled barracks more than an ordinary dwelling mrs willoughby stood gazing at it half in doubt whether to admire or to condemn when a voice within a few yards suddenly drew her attention in another direction  how you like him asked nick who was seated on a stone at the margin of the stream washing his feet after a long days hunt no tink him better dan beaver skin capin know all bout him now he give nick some more last quitrent  last indeed it will be then nick for i have already paid you twice for your rights  discovery wort great deal capinsee what great man he make pale face  ay but your discovery nick is not of that sort  what sort den demanded nick with the rapidity of lightning give him back e beaver if you no like he discovery grad to see em back agin skin higher price dan ever  nick youre a cormorant if there ever was one in this world here there is a dollar for you the quitrent is paid for this year at least it ought to be for the last time  let him go for all summer capin yes nick wonderful commerant no such eye he got among oneida  here the tuscarora left the side of the stream and came up on the rock shaking hands goodhumouredly with mrs willoughby who rather liked the knave though she knew him to possess most of the vices of his class  he very hansom beaverdam said nick sweeping his hand gracefully over the view bye nd bye hell bring potatoe and corn and cider all e squaw want capin got good fort too old soldier love fort like to live in him  the day may come nick when that fort may serve us all a good turn out here in the wilderness mrs willoughby observed in a somewhat melancholy tone for her tender thoughts naturally turned towards her youthful and innocent daughters  the indian gazed at the house with that fierce intentness which sometimes glared in a manner that had got to be in its ordinary aspects dull and besotted there was a startling intelligence in his eye at such moments the feelings of youth and earlier habit once more asserting their power twenty years before nick had been foremost on the warpath and what was scarcely less honourable among the wisest around the councilfire he was born a chief and had made himself an outcast from his tribe more by the excess of ungovernable passions than from any act of base meanness  capm tell nick now what he mean by building such house out here among ole beaver bones he said sideling up nearer to his employer and gazing with some curiosity into his face  what do i mean nickwhy i mean to have a place of safety to put the heads of my wife and children in at need the road to canada is not so long but a redskin can make one pair of moccasins go over it then the oneidas and mohawks are not all children of heaven  no paleface rogue go about i spose said nick sarcastically  yes there are men of that class who are none the worse for being locked out of ones house at times but what do you think of the hutyou know i call the place the hut the hutted knoll  he hole plenty of beaver if you cotch himbut no water left and he all go away why you make him stone first den you make him wood ater eh plenty rock plenty tree  why the stone wall can neither be cut away nor set fire to nick thats the reason i took as much stone as was necessary and then used wood which is more easily worked and which is also drier  goodnick tought just dat how you get him water if injen come  theres the stream that winds round the foot of the hill nick as you see and then there is a delicious spring within one hundred yards of the very gate  which side of him asked nick with his startling rapidity  why here to the left of the gate and a little to the right of the large stone  nono interrupted the indian no leftno rightwhich side inside gate outside gate  ohthe spring is outside the gate certainly but means might be found to make a covered way to it and then the stream winds round directly underneath the rocks behind the house and wafer could be raised from that by means of a rope our rifles would count for something too in drawing water as well as in drawing blood  goodrifle got long arm he talk so ingin mind him when you tink redskin come agin your fort capin now you got him done  a long time first i hope nick we are at peace with france again and i see no prospect of any new quarrel very soon so long as the french and english are at peace the red men will not dare to touch either  dat true as missionary what a soldier do capin if so much peace warrior love a warpath  i wish it were not so nick but my hatchet is buried i hope for ever  nick hope capin know where to find him if he want to very bad to put anyting where he forget particlarly tomahawk sometime quarrel come like rain when you dont tink  yes that also cannot be denied yet i fear the next quarrel will be among ourselves nickthe government at home and the people of the colonies are getting to have bad blood between them  dat very queer why paleface moder and paleface darter no love one anoder like redskin  really nick you are somewhat interrogating this evening but my squaw must be a little desirous of seeing the inside of her house as well as its outside and i must refer you to that honest fellow yonder for an answer his name is mike i hope he and you will always be good friends  so saying the captain nodded in a friendly manner and led mrs willoughby towards the hut taking a footpath that was already trodden firm and which followed the sinuosities of the stream to which it served as a sort of a dyke nick took the captain at his word and turning about he met the county leitrimman with an air of great blandness thrusting out a hand in the paleface fashion as a sign of amity saying at the same time  how do mikesagosagograd you comegood fellow to drink santa cruz wid nick  how do mike exclaimed the other looking at the tuscarora with astonishment for this was positively the first red man the irishman had ever seen how do mike ould nick be yewellye look pretty much as i

two keeping his eyes fastened on the other intently for he actually expected to see some prodigious and sudden change in his appearance when he thought he had got a good position for manly defence or rapid retreat as either might become necessary the county leitrimman put on a bolder front and resumed the discourse  if its so indifferent to ye where ye dwell asked mike why cant you keep at home and let a body carry these cloaks and bundles of the missuses out yonder to the house wither shes gone  nick help carry em carry ting for dat squaw hundred time  that what dye mane madam willoughby by

speak as well as he know how nick never been to school call e squaw good squaw what want more  get out if ye come a foot nearer ill be at ye like a dog upon a bull though ye gore me what brought ye into this paiceful sittlement where nothing but virtue and honesty have taken up their abode  what more mike might have said is not known as nick caught a sign from the captain and went loping across the flat at his customary gait leaving the irishman standing on the defensive and to own the truth not sorry to be rid of him unfortunately for the immediate enlightenment of mikes mind joel overheard the dialogue and comprehending its meaning with his native readiness he joined his companion in a mood but little disposed to clear up the error  did ye see that crathure asked mike with emphasis  sartainhe is often seen here at the hut he may be said to live here half his time  a pritty hut then ye must have of it why do ye tolerate the vagabond hes not fit for christian society  oh hes good company sometimes mike when you know him better youll like him better come up with the bundles and let us follow the captain is looking after us as you see  well may he look to see us in sich companywill he harrm the missus  not he i tell you youll like him yourself when you come to know him  if i do burn me why he says himself that hes ould nick and im sure i never fancied the crathure but it was in just some such forrm och hes illlooking enough for twenty ould nicks  lest the reader get an exaggerated notion of michaels credulity it may be well to say that nick had painted a few days before in a fit of caprice and that onehalf of his face was black and the other a deep red while each of his eyes was surrounded with a circle of white all of which had got to be a little confused in consequence of a night or two of orgies succeeded by mornings in which the toilet had been altogether neglected his dress too a blanket with tawdry red and yellow trimmings with ornamented leggings and moccasins to correspond had all aided in maintaining the accidental mystification mike followed his companion growling out his discontent and watching the form of the indian as the latter still went loping over the flat having passed the captain with a message to the barns  ill warrant ye now the captain wouldnt tolerate such a crathure but hes sent him off to the woods as ye may see like a divil as he is to think of such a things spakeing to the missus will i fight himthat will i rather than hell say an uncivil word to the likes of her hes claws they tell me though he kapes them so well covered in his fine brogues divil burn me but id grapple him by the toes  joel now saw how deep was michaels delusion and knowing it must soon be over he determined to make a merit of necessity by letting his friend into the truth thereby creating a confidence that would open the way to a hundred future mischievous scenes  claws he repeated with an air of surpriseand why do you think an injin has claws mike  an injin dye call that miscoloured crathure an injin joel isnt it one of yer yankee divils  out upon you for an irish ninny do you think the captain would board a devil the fellows a tuscarora and is as well known here as the owner of the hut himself its saucy nick  yes saucy ould nickhad it from his very mout and even the divil would hardly be such a blackguard as to lie about his own name och hes a roarer sure enough and then for the tusks you mintion i didnt see em with my eyes but the crathure has a mouth that might hould a basketfull  joel now perceived that he must go more seriously to work to undeceive his companion mike honestly believed he had met an american devil and it required no little argumentation to persuade him of the contrary we shall leave joel employed in this difficult task in which he finally succeeded and follow the captain and his wife to the hut  the lord and lady of the manor examined everything around their future residence with curious eyes jamie allen the scotch mason mentioned was standing in front of the house to hear what might be said of his wall while two or three other mechanics betrayed some such agitation as the tyro in literature manifests ere he learns what the critics have said of his first work the exterior gave great satisfaction to the captain the wall was not only solid and secure but it was really handsome this was in some measure owing to the quality of the stones but quite as much to jamies dexterity in using them the wall and chimneys of the latter of which there were no less than six were all laid in lime too it having been found necessary to burn some of the material to plaster the interior then the gates were massive being framed in oak filled in with fourinch plank and might have resisted a very formidable assault their strong iron hinges were all in their places but the heavy job of hanging had been deferred to a leisure moment when all the strength of the manor might be collected for that purpose there they stood inclining against the wall one on each side of the gateway like indolent sentinels on post who felt too secure from attack to raise their eyes  the different mechanics crowded round the captain each eager to show his own portion of what had been done the winter had not been wasted but proper materials being in abundance and on the spot captain willoughby had every reason to be satisfied with what he got for his money completely shut out from the rest of the world the men had worked cheerfully and with little interruption for their labours composed their recreation mrs willoughby found the cart of the building her family was to occupy with the usual offices done and furnished this comprised all the front on theeastern side of the gateway and most of the wing in the same half extending back to the cliff it is true the finish was plain but everything was comfortable the ceilings were only ten feet high certainly but it was thought prodigious in the colony in that day and then the plastering of jamie was by no means as unexceptionable as his stonework still every room had its two coats and whitewash gave them a clean and healthful aspect the end of the wing that came next the cliff was a laundry and a pump was fitted by means of which water was raised from the rivulet next came the kitchen a spacious and comfortable room of thirty by twenty feet an upperservants apartment succeeded after which were the bedrooms of the family a large parlour and a library or office for the captain as the entire range on this particular side of the house extended near or quite two hundred and fifty feet there was no want of space or accommodation  the opposite or western half of the edifice was devoted to more homely uses it contained an eatingroom and divers sleepingrooms far the domestics and labourers besides storerooms garners and omnium gatherums of all sorts the vast ranges of garrets too answered for various purposes of household and farming economy all the windows and sundry doors opened into the court while the whole of the exterior wall both wooden and stone presented a perfect blank in the way of outlets it was the captains intention however to cut divers loops through the logs at some convenient moment so that men stationed in the garrets might command the different faces of the structure with their musketry but like the gates these means of defence were laid aside for a more favourable opportunity  our excellent matron was delighted with her domestic arrangements they much surpassed any of the various barracks in which she had dwelt and a smile of happiness beamed on her handsome face as she followed her husband from room to room listening to his explanations when they entered their private apartments and these were furnished and ready to receive them respect caused the rest to leave them by themselves and once more they found that they were alone  well wilhelmina asked the gratified husbandgratified because he saw pleasure beaming in the mild countenance and serene blue eyes of one of the best wives livingwell wilhelmina he asked can you give up albany and all the comforts of your friends dwellings to be satisfied in a home like this it is not probable i shall ever build again whatever bob may do when he comes after me this structure then part house part barrack part fort as it is must be our residence for the remainder of our days we are hutted for life  it is allsufficient willoughby it has space comfort warmth coolness and security what more can a wife and a mother ask when she is surrounded by those she most loves only attend to the security hugh remember how far we are removed from any succour and how sudden and fierce the indians are in their attacks twice have we ourselves been near being destroyed by surprises from which accident or gods providence protected us rather than our own vigilance if this could happen in garrisons and with kings troops around us how much more easily might it happen here with only common labourers to watch what is going on  you exaggerate the danger wife there are no indians in this part of the country who would dare to molest a settlement like ours we count thirteen ablebodied men in all besides seven women and could use seventeen or eighteen muskets and rifles on an emergency no tribe would dare commence hostilities in a time of general peace and so near the settlements too and as to stragglers who might indeed murder to rob we are so strong ourselves that we may sleep in peace so far as they are concerned  one never knows that dearest hugh a marauding party of halfadozen might prove too much for many times their own number when unprepared i do hope you will have the gates hung at least should the girls come here in the autumn i could not sleep without hanging the gates  fear nothing love said the captain kissing his wife with manly tenderness as for beulah and maud let them come when they please we shall always have a welcome for them and no place can be safer than under their fathers eyes  i care not so much for myself hugh but do not let the gates be forgotten until the girls come  everything shall be done as you desire wife of mine though it will be a hard job to get two such confounded heavy loads of wood on their hinges we must take some day when everybody is at home and everybody willing to work saturday next i intend to have a review and once a month the year round there will be a muster when all the arms are to be cleaned and loaded and orders given how to act in case of an alarm an old soldier would be disgraced to allow himself to be run down by mere vagabonds my pride is concerned and you may sleep in peace  yes do dearest hughthen the matron proceeded through the rooms expressing her satisfaction at the care which had been had for her comfort in her own rooms in particular  sooth to say the interior of the hut presented that odd contrast between civilization and rude expedients which so frequently occurs on an american frontier where persons educated in refinement often find themselves brought in close collision with savage life carpets in america and in the year of our lord 1765 were not quite as much a matter of course in domestic economy as they are today still they were to be found though it was rare indeed that they covered more than the centre of the room one of these great essentials without which no place can appear comfortable in a cold climate was spread on the floor of mrs willoughbys parloura room that served for both eating and as a sala the knights hall of the hut measuring twenty by twentyfour feetthough in fact this carpet concealed exactly two thirds of the white clean plank then the chairs were massive and even rich while one might see his face in the dark mahogany of the tables there were cellaretsthe captain being a connoisseur in wines bureaus secretaries beaufets and other similar articles that had been collected in the course of twenty years housekeeping and scattered at different posts were collected and brought hither by means of sledges and the facilities of the watercourses fashion had little to do with furniture in that simple age when the son did not hesitate to wear even the clothes of the father years and years after the tailor had taken leave of them massive old furniture in particular lasted for generations and our matron now saw many articles that had belonged to her grandfather assembled beneath the first roof that she could ever strictly call her own  mrs willoughby took a survey of the offices last here she found already established the two plinies with mari the sister of the elder pliny bess the wife of the younger and monyalias desdemona a collateral of the race by ties and affinities that garterkingat arms could not have traced genealogically since he would have been puzzled to say whether the woman was the cousin or aunt or step daughter of mari or all three all the women were hard at work bess singing in a voice that reached the adjoining forest marithis name was pronounced with a strong emphasis on the last syllable or like maria without the final vowelmari was the head of the kitchen even pliny the elder standing in salutary dread of her authority and her orders to her brother and nephew were pouring forth in an english that was divided into three categories the anglosaxon the low dutch and the guinea dialect a medley that rendered her discourse a droll assemblage of the vulgar and the classical  here niggers she cried why you dont jump about like paus dance ebbery ting want a hand and some want a foot plate to wash crockery to open water to bile dem knife to clean and noting missed lord heres a madam and e whole kitchen in a diffusion  well mari exclaimed the captain goodnaturedly here you are scolding away as if you had been in the place these six months and knew all its faults and weaknesses  cant help a scold master in sich a time as discome away from dem plates you great smash and let a proper hand take hold on em  here we ought to say that captain willoughby had christened bess by the sobriquet of great smash on account of her size which fell little short of two hundred estimated in pounds and a certain facility she possessed in destroying crockery while mony went by the milder appellation of little smash not that bowls or plates fared any better in her hands but because she weighed only one hundred and eighty  dis is what i tell em master continued mari in a remonstrating argumentative sort of a tone with dogmatism and respect singularly mingled in her mannerdis massa just what i tell em all i tell em says i this is hunter knoll and not allbonnyhere no storeno place to

empty spit mari as long as he is with us fear nothing he will not harm you his name is nick  de ole nick massa  no only saucy nick the fellow is a little slovenly today in his appearance and you see he has brought already several partridges besides a rabbit we shall have venison in the season  here all the negroes after staring at nick quite a minute set up a loud shout laughing as if the tuscarora had been created for their special amusement although the captain was somewhat of a martinet in his domestic discipline it had ever altogether exceeded his authority or his art to prevent these bursts of merriment and he led his wife away from the din leaving mari great smash and little smash with the two plinies in ecstasies at their own uproar burst succeeded burst until the indian walked away in offended dignity  such was the commencement of the domestication of the willoughbys at the hutted knoll the plan of our tale does not require us to follow them minutely for the few succeeding years though some further explanation may be necessary to show why this settlement varied a little from the ordinary course  that very season or in the summer of 1765 mrs willoughby inherited some real estate in albany by the death of an uncle as well as a few thousand pounds currency in ready money this addition to his fortune made the captain exceedingly comfortable or for that day rich and it left him to act his pleasure as related to his lands situated as these last were so remote from other settlements as to render highways for some time hopeless he saw no use in endeavouring to anticipate the natural order of things it would only create embarrassment to raise produce that could not be sent to market and he well knew that a population of any amount could not exist in quiet without the usual attendants of buying and selling then it suited his own taste to be the commanderinchief of an isolated establishment like this and he was content to live in abundance on his flats feeding his people his cattle and even his hogs to satiety and having wherewithal to send away the occasional adventurer who entered his clearing contented and happy  thus it was that he neither sold nor leased no person dwelt on his land who was not a direct dependant or hireling and all that the earth yielded he could call his own nothing was sent abroad for sale but cattle every year a small drove of fat beeves and milch cows found their way through the forest to albany and the proceeds returned in the shape of foreign supplies the rents and the interests on bonds were left to accumulate or were applied to aid robert in obtaining a new step in the army lands began to be granted nearer and nearer to his own and here and there some old officer like himself or a solitary farmer began to cut away the wilderness but none in his immediate vicinity  still the captain did not live altogether as a hermit he visited edmeston of mount edmeston a neighbour less than fifty miles distant was occasionally seen at johnson hall with sir william or at the bachelor establishment of sir john on the mohawk and once or twice he so far overcame his indolence as to consent to serve as a member for a new county that was called tryon after a ruling governor      chapter iv    hail sober evening thee the harassd brain   and aching heart with fond orisons greet   the respite thou of toil the balm of pain   to thoughtful mind the hour for musing meet   tis then the sage from forth his lone retreat   the rolling universe around espies   tis then the bard may hold communion sweet   with lovely shapes unkenned by grosser eyes   and quick perception comes of finer mysteries    sands  in the preceding chapter we closed the minuter narrative with a scene at the hut in the spring of 1765 we must now advance the time just ten years opening anew in the month of may 1775 this it is scarcely necessary to tell the reader is bringing him at once up to the earliest days of the revolution the contest which preceded that great event had in fact occurred in the intervening time and we are now about to plunge into the current of some of the minor incidents of the struggle itself  ten years are a century in the history of a perfectly new settlement the changes they produce are even surprising though in ordinary cases they do not suffice to erase the signs of a recent origin the forest is opened and the light of day admitted it is true but its remains are still to be seen in multitudes of unsightly stumps dead standing trees and illlooking stubs these vestiges of the savage state usually remain a quarter of a century in certain region they are to be found for even more than twice that period all this however had captain willoughby escaped in consequence of limiting his clearing in a great measure to that which had been made by the beavers and from which time and natural decay had long before his arrival removed every ungainly object it is true here and there a few acres had been cleared on the firmer ground at the margin of the flats where barns and farm buildings had been built and orchards planted but in order to preserve the harmony of his view the captain had caused all the stumps to be pulled and burnt giving to these places the same air of agricultural finish as characterized the fields on the lower land  to this sylvan scene at a moment which preceded the setting of the sun by a little more than an hour and in the first week of the genial month of may we must now bring the reader in fancy the season had been early and the beaver manor or the part of it which was cultivated lying low and sheltered vegetation had advanced considerably beyond the point that is usual at that date in the elevated region of which we have been writing the meadows were green with matted grasses the wheat and rye resembled rich velvets and the ploughed fields had the fresh and mellowed appearance of good husbandry and a rich soil the shrubbery of which the captains english taste had introduced quantities was already in leaf and even portions of the forest began to veil their sombre mysteries with the delicate foliage of an american spring  the site of the ancient pond was a miracle of rustic beauty everything like inequality or imperfection had disappeared the whole presenting a broad and picturesquely shaped basin with outlines fashioned principally by nature an artist that rarely fails in effect the flat was divided into fields by low postandrail fences the captain making it a law to banish all unruly animals from his estate the barns and outbuildings were neatly made and judiciously placed and the three or four roads or lanes that led to them crossed the lowland in such graceful curves as greatly to increase the beauty of the landscape here and there a log cabin was visible nearly buried in the forest with a few necessary and neat appliances around it the homes of labourers who had long dwelt in them and who seemed content to pass their lives in the same place as most of these men had married and become fathers the whole colony including children notwithstanding the captains policy not to settle had grown to considerably more than a hundred souls of whom threeandtwenty were ablebodied men among the latter were the millers but their mills were buried in the ravine where they had been first placed quite out of sight from the picture above concealing all the unavoidable and ungainlylooking objects of a sawmill yard  as a matter of course the object of the greatest interest as it was the most conspicuous was the hutted knoll as the house was now altogether called and the objects it contained thither then we will now direct our attention and describe things as they appeared ten years after they were first presented to the reader  the same agricultural finish as prevailed on the flats pervaded every object on the knoll though some labour had been expended to produce it everything like a visible rock the face of the cliff on the northern end excepted had disappeared the stones having been blasted and either worked into walls for foundations or walls for fence the entire base of the knoll always excepting the little precipice at the rivulet was encircled by one of the latter erected under the superintendence of jamie allen who still remained at the hut a bachelor and as he said himself a happy man the southernface of the knoll was converted into lawn there being quite two acres intersected with walks and well garnished with shrubbery what was unusual in america at that day the captain owing to his english education had avoided straight lines and formal paths giving to the little spot the improvement on nature which is a consequence of embellishing her works without destroying them on each side of this lawn was an orchard thrifty and young and which were already beginning to show signs of putting forth their blossoms  about the hut itself the appearance of change was not so manifest captain willoughby had caused it to be constructed originally as he intended to preserve it and if formed no part of his plan to cover it with tawdry colours there it stood brown above and grey beneath as wood or stone was the material with a widely projecting roof it had no piazzas or stoups and was still without external windows one range excepted the loops had been cut but it was more for the benefit of lighting the garrets than for any other reason all of them being glazed and serving the end for which they had been pierced the gates remained precisely in the situation in which they were when last presented to the eye of the reader there they stood each leaning against the wall on its own side of the gateway the hinges beginning to rust by time and exposure ten years had not produced a day of sufficient leisure in which to hang them though mrs willoughby frequently spoke of the necessity of doing so in the course of the first summer even she had got to be so familiarized to her situation and so accustomed to seeing the leaves where they stood that she now regarded them as a couple of sleeping lions in stone or as characteristic ornaments rather than as substantial defences to the entrance of the dwelling  the interior of the hut however had undergone many alterations the western half had been completed and handsome rooms had been fitted up for guests and inmates of the family in the portion of the edifice occupied by the latter additional comforts had been introduced and the garners cribs and lodgings of the labourers having been transferred to the skirts of the forest the house was more strictly and exclusively the abode of a respectable and wellregulated family in the rear too a wing had been thrown along the verge of the cliff completely enclosing the court this wing which overhung the rivulet and had not only a most picturesque site but a most picturesque and lovely view now contained the library parlour and musicroom together with other apartments devoted to the uses of the ladies during the day the old portions of the house that had once been similarly occupied being now converted into sleeping apartments the new wing was constructed entirely of massive squared logs so as to render it bulletproof here being no necessity for a stone foundation standing as it did on the verge of a cliff some forty feet in height this was the part of the edifice which had external windows the elevation removing it from the danger of inroads or hostile shot while the air and view were both grateful and desirable some extra attention had been paid to the appearance of the meadows on this side of the knoll and the captain had studiously kept their skirts as far as the eye could see from the windows in virgin forest placing the barns cabins and other detached buildings so far south as to be removed from view beulah willoughby a gentle tranquil creature had a profound admiration of the beauties of nature and to her her parents had yielded the control of everything that was considered accessary to the mere charms of the eye her taste had directed most of that which had not been effected by the noble luxuriance of nature wild roses were already putting forth their leaves in various fissures of the rocks where earth had been placed for their support and the margin of the little stream that actually washed the base of the cliff winding off in a charming sweep through the meadows a rivulet of less than twenty feet in width was garnished with willows and alder quitting this sylvan spot we will return to the little shrub adorned area in front of the hut this spot the captain called his glacis while his daughters termed it the lawn the hour it will be remembered was shortly before sunset and thither nearly all the family had repaired to breathe the freshness of the pure air and bathe in the genial warmth of a season which is ever so grateful to those who have recently escaped from the rigour of a stern winter rude and sufficiently picturesque gardenseats were scattered about and on one of these were seated the captain and his wife he with his hair sprinkled with grey a hale athletic healthy man of sixty and she a freshlooking mildfeatured and still handsome matron of fortyeight in front stood a venerablelooking personage of small stature dressed in rusty black of the cut that denoted the attire of a clergyman before it was considered aristocratic to wear the outward symbols of belonging to the church of god this was the rev jedidiah woods a native of new england who had long served as a chaplain in the same regiment with the captain and who being a bachelor on retired pay had dwelt with his old messmate for the last eight years in the double capacity of one who exercised the healing art as well for the soul as for the body to his other offices he added that of an instructor in various branches of knowledge to the young people the chaplain for so he was called by everybody in and around the hut was at the moment of which we are writing busy in expounding to his friends certain nice distinctions that existed or which he fancied to exist between a tomcod and a chub the former of which fish he very erroneously conceived he held in his hand at that moment the rev mr woods being a much better angler than naturalist to his dissertation mrs willoughby listened with great goodnature endeavouring all the while to feel interested while her husband kept uttering his by all means yes certainly youre quite right woods his gaze at the same time fastened on joel strides and pliny the elder who were unharnessing their teams on the flats beneath having just finished a land and deeming it too late to commence another  beulah her pretty face shaded by a large sunbonnet was superintending the labours of jamie allen who finding nothing just then to do as a mason was acting in the capacity of gardener his hat was thrown upon the grass with his white locks bare and he was delving about some shrubs with the intention of giving them the benefit of a fresh dressing of manure maud however without a hat of any sort her long luxuriant silken golden tresses covering her shoulders and occasionally veiling her warm rich cheek was exercising with a battledore keeping little smash now increased in size to quite fourteen stone rather actively employed as an assistant whenever the exuberance of her own spirits caused her to throw the plaything beyond her reach in one of the orchards near by two men were employed trimming the trees to these the captain next turned all his attention just as he had encouraged the chaplain to persevere by exclaiming out of all question my dear sirthough he was absolutely ignorant that the other had just advanced a downright scientific heresy at this critical moment a cry from little smash that almost equalled a downfall of crockery in its clamour drew every eye in her direction  what is the matter desdemona asked the chaplain a little tartly by no means pleased at having his natural history startled by sounds so inapplicable to the subject how often have i told you that the lord views with displeasure anything so violent and improper as your outcries  cant help him dominienebber can help him when he take me sudden see masser dere come ole nick  there was nick sure enough for the first time in more than two years the tuscarora was seen approaching the house on the long loping trot that he affected when he wished to seem busy or honestly earning his money he was advancing by the only road that was ever travelled by the stranger as he approached the hut or he came up the valley as the woman spoke he had just made his appearance over the rocks in the direction of the mills at that distance quite half a mile he would not have been recognised but for this gait which was too familiar to all at the knoll however to be mistaken  that is nick sure enough exclaimed the captain the fellow comes at the pace of a runner or as if he were the bearer of some important news  the tricks of saucy nick are too well known to deceive any here observed mrs willoughby who surrounded by her husband and children always felt so happy as to deprecate every appearance of danger  these savages will keep that pace for hours at a time observed the chaplain a circumstance that has induced some naturalists to fancy a difference in the species if not in the genus  is he chub or tomcod woods asked the captain throwing back on the other all he recollected of the previous discourse  nay observed mrs willoughby anxiously i do think he may have some intelligence it is now more than a twelvemonth since we have seen nick  it is more than twice twelvemonth my dear i have not seen the fellows face since i denied him the keg of rum for his discovery of another beaver pond he has tried to sell me a new pond every season since the purchase of this  do you think he took serious offence hugh at that refusal if so would it not be better to give him what he asks  i have thought little about it and care less my dear nick and i know each other pretty well it is an acquaintance of thirty years standing and one that has endured trials by flood and field and even by the horsewhip no less than three times have i been obliged to make these salutary applications to nicks back with my own hands though it is now more than ten years since a blow has passed between us  does a savage ever forgive a blow asked the chaplain with a grave air and a look of surprise  i fancy a savage is quite as apt to forgive it as a civilized man woods to you who have served so long in his majestys army a blow in the way of punishment can be no great novelty  certainly not as respects the soldiers but i did not know indians were ever flogged  that is because you never happened to be present at the ceremonybut this is nick sure enough and by his trot i begin to think the fellow has some message or news  how old is the man captain does an indian never break down  nick must be fairly fifty now i have known him more than half that period and he was an experienced and to own the truth a brave and skilful warrior when we first met i rate him fifty every day of it  by this time the newcomer was so near that the conversation ceased all standing gazing at him as he drew near and maud gathering up her hair with maiden bashfulness though certainly nick was no stranger as for little smash she waddled off to proclaim the news to the younger pliny mari and great smash all of whom were still in the kitchen of the hut flourishing sleek and glistening  soon after nick arrived he came up the knoll on his loping trot never stopping until he was within five or six yards of the captain when he suddenly halted folded his arms and stood in a composed attitude lest he should betray a womanish desire to tell his story he did not even pant but appeared as composed and unmoved as if he had walked the halfmile he had been seen to pass over on a trot  sagosago cried the captain heartilyyou are welcome back nick i am glad to see you still so active  sagoanswered the guttural voice of the indian who quietly nodded his head  what will you have to refresh you after such a journey nickour trees give us good cider now  santa cruz betterrejoined the sententious tuscarora  santa cruz is certainly stronger answered the captain laughing and in that sense you may find it better you shall have a glass as soon as we go to the house what news do you bring that you come in so fast  glass wont do nick bring news worth jug squaw give two jug for nicks news is it bargin  i cried mrs willoughbywhat concern can i have with your news my daughters are both with me and heaven be praised both are well what can i care for your news nick  got no pappoose but gal tink you got boyofficergreat chiefup here down yonderover dere  robertmajor willoughby what can you have to tell me of my son  tell all about him for one jug jug out yonder nicks story out here one good as tother  you shall have all you ask nickthese were not temperance days when conscience took so firm a stand between the bottle and the lipsyou shall have all you ask nick provided you can really give me good accounts of my noble boy speak then what have you to say  say you see him in ten five minute sent nick before to keep moder from too much cry  an exclamation from maud followed then the ardent girl was seen rushing down the lawn her hat thrown aside and her bright fair hair again flowing in ringlets on her shoulders she flew rather than ran in the direction of the mill where the figure of robert willoughby was seen rushing forward to meet her suddenly the girl stopped threw herself on a log and hid her face in a few minutes she was locked in her brothers arms neither mrs willoughby nor beulah imitated this impetuous movement on the part of maud but the captain chaplain and even jamie allen hastened down the road to meet and welcome the young major ten minutes later bob willoughby was folded to his mothers heart then came beulahs turn after which the news having flown through the household the young man had to receive the greetings of mari both the smashes the younger pliny and all the dogs a tumultuous quarter of an hour brought all round again to its proper place and restored something like order to the knoll still an excitement prevailed the rest of the day for the sudden arrival of a guest always produced a sensation in that retired settlement much more likely then was the unexpected appearance of the only son and heir to create one as everybody bustled and was in motion the whole family was in the parlour and major willoughby was receiving the grateful refreshment of a delicious cup of tea before the sun set the chaplain would have retired out of delicacy but to this the captain would not listen he would have everything proceed as if the son were a customary guest though it might have been seen by the manner in which his mothers affectionate eye was fastened on his handsome face as well as that in which his sister beulah in particular hung about him under the pretence of supplying his wants that the young man was anything but an everyday inmate  how the lad has grown said the captain tears of pride starting into his eyes in spite of a very manful resolution to appear composed and soldierlike  i was about to remark that myself captain observed the chaplain i do think mr robert has got to his full six feetevery inch as tall as you are yourself my good sir  that is he woodsand taller in one sense he is a major already at twentyseven it is a step i was not able to reach at near twice the age  that is owing my dear sir answered the son quickly and with a slight tremor in his voice to your not having as kind a father as has fallen to my shareor at least one not as well provided with the means of purchasing  say none at all bob and you can wound no feeling while you will tell the truth my father died a lieutenantcolonel when i was a schoolboy i owed my ensigncy to my uncle sir hugh the father of the present sir harry willoughby after that i owed each step to hard and long service your mothers legacies have helped you along at a faster rate though i do trust there has been some merit to aid in the preferment  speaking of sir harry willoughby sir reminds me of one part of my errand to the hut said the major glancing his eye towards his father as if to prepare him for some unexpected intelligence  what of my cousin demanded the captain calmly we have not met in thirty years and are the next thing to strangers to each other has he made that silly match of which i heard something when last in york has he disinherited his daughter as he threatened use no reserve here our friend woods is one of the family  sir harry willoughby is not married sir but dead  dead repeated the captain setting down his cup like one who received a sudden shock i hope not without having been reconciled to his daughter and providing for her large family  he died in her arms and escaped the consequences of his silly intention to marry his own housekeeper with one material exception he has left mrs bowater his whole fortune  the captain sat thoughtful for some time every one else being silent and attentive but the mothers feelings prompted her to inquire as to the nature of the exception  why mother contrary to all my expectations and i may say wishes he has left me twentyfive thousand pounds in the fives i only hold the money as my fathers trustee  you do no such thing master bob i can tell you said the captain with emphasis  the son looked at the father a moment as if to see whether he was understood and then he proceeded  i presume you remember sir said the major that you are the heir to the title  i have not forgot that major willoughby but what is an empty baronetcy to a happy husband and father like me here in the wilds of america were i still in the army and a colonel the thing might be of use as i am i would rather have a tolerable road from this place to the mohawk than the duchy of norfolk without the estate  estate there is none certainly returned the major in a tone of a little disappointment except the twentyfive thousand pounds unless you include that which you possess where you are not insignificant by the way sir  it will do well enough for old hugh willoughby late a captain in his majestys 23d regiment of foot but not so well for sir hugh no no bob let the baronetcy sleep awhile it has been used quite enough for the last hundred years or more out of this circle there are probably not ten persons in america who know that i have any claims to it  the major coloured and he played with the spoon of his empty cup stealing a glance or two around before he answered  i beg your pardon sir hughmy dear father i meanbutto own the truth never anticipating such a decision on your part i have spoken of the thing to a good many friendsi dare say if the truth were known ive called you the baronet or sir hugh to others at least a dozen times  well should it be so the thing will be forgotten a parson can be unfrocked woods and a baronet can be unbaroneted i suppose  but sir williamso everybody called the wellknown sir william johnson in the colony of new yorkbut sir william found it useful willoughby and so i dare say will his son and successor sir john observed the attentive wife and anxious mother and if you are not now in the army bob is it will be a good thing for our son one day and ought not to be lost  ah i see how it is beulah your mother has no notion to lose the right of being called lady willoughby  i am sure my mother sir wishes to be called nothing that does not become your wife if you remain mr hugh willoughby she will remain mrs hugh willoughby but papa it might be useful to bob  beulah was a great favourite with the captain maud being only his darling he listened always to whatever the former said therefore with indulgence and respect he often told the chaplain that his daughter beulah had the true feelings of her sex possessing a sort of instinct for whatever was right and becoming in woman  well bob may have the baronetcy then he said smiling major sir robert willoughby will not sound amiss in a despatch  but bob cannot have it father exclaimed maudno one can have it but you and its a pity it should be lost  let him wait then until i am out of the way when he may claim his own  can that be done inquired the mother to whom nothing was without interest that affected her children how is it mr woods may a title be dropped and then picked up againhow is this robert  i believe it may my dear motherit will always exist so long as there is an heir and my fathers disrelish for it will not be binding on me  oh in that case then all will come right in the endthough as your father does not want it i wish you could have it now  this was said with the most satisfied air in the world as if the speaker had no possible interest in the matter herself and it closed the conversation for that time it was not easy to keep up an interest in anything that related to the family where mrs willoughby was concerned in which heart did not predominate a baronetcy was a considerable dignity in the colony of new york in the year of our lord 1775 and it gave its possessor far more importance than it would have done in england in the whole colony there was but one though a good many were to be found further south and he was known as sir john as in england lord rockingham or in america at a later day la fayette was known as the marquis under such circumstances then it would have been no trifling sacrifice to an ordinary woman to forego the pleasure of being called my lady but the sacrifice cost our matron no pain no regrets no thought even the same attachments which made her happy away from the world in the wilderness where she dwelt supplanted all other feelings and left her no room or leisure to think of such vanities when the discourse changed it was understood that sir hugh was not to be sir hugh and that sir robert must bide his time  where did you fall in with the tuscarora bob suddenly asked the captain as much to bring up another subject as through curiosity the fellow had been so long away i began to think we should never see him again  he tells me sir he has been on a war path somewhere out among the western savages it seems these indians fight among themselves from time to time and nick has been trying to keep his hand in i found him down at canajoharie and took him for a guide though he had the honesty to own he was on the point of coming over here had i not engaged him  ill answer for it he didnt tell you that until you had paid him for the job  why to own the truth he did not sir he pretended something about owing money in the village and got his pay in advance i learned his intentions only when we were within a few miles of the hut  im glad to find bob that you give the place its proper name how gloriously sir hugh willoughby bart of the hut tryon county new york would sound woodsdid nick boast of the scalps he has taken from the carthaginians  he lays claim to three i believe though i have seen none of his trophies  the roman heroyet i have known nick rather a dangerous warrior he was out against us in some of my earliest service and our acquaintance was made by my saving his life from the bayonet of one of my own grenadiers i thought the fellow remembered the act for some years but in the end i believe i flogged all the gratitude out of him his motives now are concentrated in the little island of santa cruz  here he is father said maud stretching her light flexible form out of a window mike and the indian are seated at the lower spring with a jug between them and appear to be in a deep conversation  ay i remember on their first acquaintance that mike mistook saucy nick for old nick the indian was indignant for a while at being mistaken for the evil spirit but the worthies soon found a bond of union between them and before six months he and the irishman became sworn friends it is said whenever two human beings love a common principle that it never fails to make them firm allies  and what was the principle in this case captain willoughby inquired the chaplain with curiosity  santa cruz mike renounced whiskey altogether after he came to america and took to rum as for nick he was never so vulgar as to find pleasure in the former liquor  the whole party had gathered to the windows while the discourse was proceeding and looking out each individual saw mike and his friend in the situation described by maud the two amateurs connoisseurs would not be misapplied eitherhad seated themselves at the brink of a spring of delicious water and removing the corncob that pliny the younger had felt it to be classical to affix to the nozzle of a quart jug had some time before commenced the delightful recreation of sounding the depth not of the spring but of the vessel as respects the former mike who was a wag in his way had taken a hint from a practice said to be common in ireland called potatoe and point which means to eat the potatoe and point at the butter declaring that rum and pint was every bit as entertaining as a pint of rum on this principle then with a broad grin on a face that opened from ear to ear whenever he laughed the county leitrimman would gravely point his finger at the water in a sort of mockhomage and follow up the movement with such a suck at the nozzle as aided by the efforts of nick soon analyzed the upper half of the liquor that had entered by that very passage all this time conversation did not flag and as the parties grew warm confidence increased though reason sensibly diminished as a part of this discourse will have some bearing on what is to follow it may be in place to relate it here  yere a jewel ye be ould nick or young nick cried mike in an ecstasy of friendship just after he had completed his first halfpint yere as wilcome at the huts as if ye owned thim and i love ye as i did my own brother before i left the county leitrimpaice to his sowl  he dead asked nick sententiously for he had lived enough among the palefaces to have some notions of then theory about the soul  thats more than i knowbut living or dead the man must have a sowl ye understand nicholas a human crathure widout a sowl is what i call a heretick and none of the ohearns ever came to that  nick was tolerably drunk but by no means so far gone that he had not manners enough to make a grave and somewhat dignified gesture which was as much as to say he was familiar with the subject  all go ole fashion here he asked avoiding every appearance of curiosity however  that does itthat it does nicholas all goes ould enough the captain begins to get ould and the missus is oulder than she used to be and joels wife looks a hundred though she isnt tirty and joel himself the spalpeenhe looks a gulp at the jug stopped the communication  dirty too added the sententious tuscarora who did not comprehend more than half his friend said  ay dirrtyhes always that hes a dirthy fellow that thinks his yankee charactur is above all other things  nicks countenance became illuminated with an expression nowise akin to that produced by rum and he fastened on his companion one of his fiery gazes which occasionally seemed to penetrate to the centre of the object looked at  why paleface hate one anoder why irishman dont love yankee  och love the crathure is it youd betther ask me to love a tod for so michael would pronounce the word toad what is there to love about him but skin and bone id as soon love a skiliten yesan immortal skiliten  nick made another gesture and then he endeavoured to reflect like one who had a grave business in contemplation the santa cruz confused his brain but the indian never entirely lost his presence of mind or never at least so long as he could either see or walk  dont like himrejoined nick like anybody  to be sure i doesi like the captinoch hes a jontleman and i likes the missus shes a laddyand i likes miss beuly whos a swate young womanand then theres miss maud whos the delight of my eyes fegs but isnt she a crathure to relish  mike spoke like a good honest fellow as he was at the bottom with all his heart and soul the indian did not seem pleased but he made no answer  youve been in the wars then nick asked the irishman after a short pause  yesnick been chief agintake scalps  ach thats a mighty ugly thrade if youd tell em that in ireland theyd not think it a possibility  no like fight in ireland hah  ill not say thatno ill not say that for manys the jollification at which the fighting is the chafe amusement but we likes thumping on the headnot skinning it  that your fashionmy fashion take scalp you thump i skinwhich best  augh skinnin is a dreadthful operation but shillalehwork comes nately and natrally how many of these said scalps now may ye have picked up nick in yer last journey  treeall man and womanno pappoose one big enough make two so call him four  oh divil burn ye nick but theres a spice of your namesake in ye afther all tree human crathures skinned and you not satisfied and so yell chait a bit to make em four dye never think now of yer latther ind dye never confess  tink every day of dat hope to find more before last day come plenty scalp here ha mike  this was said a little incautiously perhaps but it was said under a strong native impulse the irishman however was never very logical or clearheaded and three gills of rum had by no means helped to purify his brain he heard the word plenty knew he was well fed and warmly clad and just now that santa cruz so much abounded the term seemed peculiarly applicable  its a plinthiful place it is is this very manor theres all sorts of things in it thats wanted theres food and raiment and cattle and grain and porkers and praichingyes divil burn it nick but theres what goes for praiching though its no more like what we calls praiching than yere like miss maud in comeliness and yell own yourself nick yere no beauty  got handsome hair said nick surlilyhow she look widout scalp  the likes of her is it who ever saw one of her beauthy without the finest hair that ever was what do you get for your scalpsare they of any use when you find em  bring plenty byemby whole country glad to see him before longden beavers get pond agin  hows thathows that indian baiver get pounded theres no pound hereabouts and baivers is not an animal to be shut up like a hog  nick perceived that his friend was past argumentation and as he himself was approaching the state when the drunkard receives delight from he knows not what it is unnecessary to relate any more of the dialogue the jug was finished each man very honestly drinking his pint and as naturally submitting to its consequences and this so much the more because the two were so engrossed with the rum that both forgot to pay that attention to the spring that might have been expected from its proximity      chapter v    the soul my lord is fashionedlike the lyre   strike one chord suddenly and others vibrate   your name abruptly mentioned casual words   of comment on your deeds praise from your uncle   news from the armies talk of your return   a word let fall touching your youthful passion   suffused her cheek calld to her drooping eye   a momentary lustre made her pulse   leap headlong and her bosom palpitate    hillhouse  the approach of night at sea and in a wilderness has always something more solemn in it than on land in the centre of civilization as the curtain is drawn before his eyes the solitude of the mariner is increased while even his sleepless vigilance seems in a measure baffled by the manner in which he is cut off from the signs of the hour thus too in the forest or in an isolated clearing the mysteries of the woods are deepened and danger is robbed of its forethought and customary guards that evening major willoughby stood at a window with an arm round the slender waist of beulah maud standing a little aloof and as the twilight retired leaving the shadows of evening to thicken on the forest that lay within a few hundred feet of that side of the hut and casting a gloom over the whole of the quiet solitude he felt the force of the feeling just mentioned in a degree he had never before experienced  this is a very retired abode my sisters he said thoughtfully do my father and mother never speak of bringing you out more into the world  they take us to new york every winter now father is in the assembly quietly answered beulah we expected to meet you there last season and were greatly disappointed that you did not come  my regiment was sent to the eastward as you know and having just received my new rank of major it would not do to be absent at the moment do you ever see any one here besides those who belong to the manor  oh yesexclaimed maud eagerlythen she paused as if sorry she had said anything continuing after a little pause in a much more moderated veini mean occasionally no doubt the place is very retired  of what characters are your visitershunters trappers settlers savages or travellers  maud did not answer but beulah after waiting a moment for her sister to reply took that office on herself  some of all she said though few certainly of the latter class the hunters are often here one or two a month in the mild season settlers rarely as you may suppose since my father will not sell and there are not many about i believe the indians come more frequently though i think we have seen less of them during nicks absence than while he was more with us still we have as many as a hundred in a year perhaps counting the women they come in parties you know and five or six of these will make that number as for travellers they are rare being generally surveyors landhunters or perhaps a proprietor who is looking up his estate we had two of the last in the fall before we went below  that is singular and yet one might well look for an estate in a wilderness like this who were your proprietors  an elderly man and a young one the first was a sort of partner of the late sir williams i believe who has a grant somewhere near us for which he was searching his name was fonda the other was one of the beekmans who has lately succeeded his father in a property of considerable extent somewhere at no great distance from us and came to take a look at it they say he has quite a hundred thousand acres in one body  and did he find his land tracts of thousands and tens of thousands are sometimes not to be discovered  we saw him twice going and returning and he was successful the last time he was detained by a snowstorm and staid with us some daysso long indeed that he remained and accompanied us out when we went below we saw much of him too last winter in town  maud you wrote me nothing of all this are visiters of this sort so very common that you do not speak of them in your letters  did i notbeulah will scarce pardon me for that she thinks mr evert beekman more worthy of a place in a letter than i do perhaps  i think him a very respectable and sensible young man answered beulah quietly though there was a deeper tint on her cheek than common which it was too dark to see i am not certain however he need fill much space in the letters of either of your sisters  well this is something gleaned said the major laughingand now beulah if you will only let out a secret of the same sort about maud i shall be au fait of all the family mysteries  all repeated maud quicklywould there be nothing to tell of a certain major willoughby brother of mine  not a syllable i am as heartwhole as a sound oak and hope to remain so at all events all i love is in this house to tell you the truth girls these are not times for a soldier to think of anything but his duty the quarrel is getting to be serious between the mother country and her colonies  not so serious brother observed beulah earnestly as to amount to that evert beekman thinks there will be trouble but he does not appear to fancy it will go as far as very serious violence  evert beekmanmost of that family are loyal i believe how is it with this evert  i dare say you would call him a rebel answered maud laughing for now beulah chose to be silent leaving her sister to explain he is not fiery but he calls himself an american with emphasis and that is saying a good deal when it means he is not an englishman pray what do you call yourself bob  icertainly an american in one sense but an englishman in another an american as my father was a cumberlandman and an englishman as a subject and as connected with the empire  as st paul was a roman heighowell i fear i have but one characteror if i have two they are an american and a new york girl did i dress in scarlet as you do i might feel english too possibly  this is making a trifling misunderstanding too serious observed beulah nothing can come of all the big words that have been used than more big words i know that is evert beekmans opinion  i hope you may prove a true prophet answered the major once more buried in thought this place does seem to be fearfully retired for a family like ours i hope my father may be persuaded to pass more of his time in new york does he ever speak on the subject girls or appear to have any uneasiness  uneasiness about what the place is health itself all sorts of fevers and agues and those things being quite unknown mamma says the toothache even cannot be found in this healthful spot  that is luckyand yet i wish captain willoughbysir hugh willoughby could be induced to live more in new york girls of your time of life ought to be in the way of seeing the world too  in other words of seeing admirers major bob said maud laughing and bending forward to steal a glance in her brothers face good night sir hugh wishes us to send you into his library when we can spare you and my lady has sent us a hint that it is ten oclock at which hour it is usual for sober people to retire  the major kissed both sisters with warm affectionbeulah fancied with a sobered tenderness and maud thought kindlyand then they retired to join their mother while he went to seek his father  the captain was smoking in the library as a room of allhead work was called in company with the chaplain the practice of using tobacco in this form had grown to be so strong in both of these old inmates of garrisons that they usually passed an hour in the recreation before they went to bed nor shall we mislead the reader with any notions of fineflavoured havana segars pipes with virginia cut being the materials employed in the indulgence a little excellent cogniac and water in which however the spring was not as much neglected as in the orgies related in the previous chapter moistened their lips from time to time giving a certain zest and comfort to their enjoyments just as the door opened to admit the major he was the subject of discourse the proud parent and the partial friend finding almost an equal gratification in discussing his fine manly appearance good qualities and future hopes his presence was untimely then in one sense though he was welcome and indeed expected the captain pushed a chair to his son and invited him to take a seat near the table which held a spare pipe or two a box of tobacco a decanter of excellent brandy a pitcher of pure water all pleasant companions to the elderly gentlemen then in possession  i suppose you are too much of a maccaroni bob to smoke observed the smiling father i detested a pipe at your time of life or may say i was afraid of it the only smoke that was in fashion among our scarlet coats being the smoke of gunpowder well how comes on gage and your neighbours the yankees  why sir answered the major looking behind him to make sure that the door was shutwhy sir to own the truth my visit here just at this moment is connected with the present state of that quarrel  both the captain and the chaplain drew the pipes from their mouths holding them suspended in surprise and attention  the deuce it is exclaimed the former i thought i owed this unexpected pleasure to your affectionate desire to let me know i had inherited the empty honours of a baronetcy  that was one motive sir but the least i beg you to remember the awkwardness of my position as a kings officer in the midst of enemies  the devil i say parson this exceeds heresy and schism do you call lodging in your fathers house major willoughby being in the midst of enemies this is rebellion against nature and is worse than rebellion against the king  my dear father no one feels more secure with you than i do or even with mr woods here but there are others besides you two in this part of the world and your very settlement may not be safe a week longer probably would not be if my presence in it were known  both the listeners now fairly laid down their pipes and the smoke began gradually to dissipate as it might have been rising from a field of battle one looked at the other in wonder and then both looked at the major in curiosity  what is the meaning of all this my son asked the captain gravely has anything new occurred to complicate the old causes of quarrel  blood has at length been drawn sir open rebellion has commenced  this is a serious matter indeed if it be really so but do you not exaggerate the consequences of some fresh indiscretion of the soldiery in firing on the people remember in the other affair even the colonial authorities justified the officers  this is a very different matter sir blood has not been drawn in a riot but in a battle  battle you amaze me sir that is indeed a serious matter and may lead to most serious consequences  the lord preserve us from evil times ejaculated the chaplain and lead us poor dependent creatures that we are into the paths of peace and quietness without his grace we are the blind leading the blind  do you mean major willoughby that armed and disciplined bodies have met in actual conflict  perhaps not literally so my dear father but the minutemen of massachusetts and his majestys forces have met and fought this i know full well for my own regiment was in the field and i hope it is unnecessary to add that its second officer was not absent  of course these minutemenrabble would be the better wordcould not stand before you said the captain compressing his lips under a strong impulse of military pride  major willoughby coloured and to own the truth at that moment he wished the rev mr woods if not literally at the devil at least safe and sound in another room anywhere so it were out of earshot of the answer  why sir he said hesitating not to say stammering notwithstanding a prodigious effort to seem philosophical and calmto own the truth these minutefellows are not quite as contemptible as we soldiers would be apt to think it was a stonewall affair and dodging work and so you know sir drilled troops wouldnt have the usual chance they pressed us pretty warmly on the retreat  retreat major willoughby  i called it retreat sure enough but it was only a march in again after having done the business on which we went out i shall admit i say sir that we were hard pressed until reinforced  reinforced my dear bob your regiment our regiment could not need a reinforcement against all the yankees in new england  the major could not abstain from laughing a little at this exhibition of his fathers esprit de corps but native frankness and love of truth compelled him to admit the contrary  it did sir notwithstanding he answered and not to mince the matter it needed it confoundedly some of our officers who have seen the hardest service of the last war declare that taking the march and the popping work and the distance altogether it was the warmest day they remember our loss too was by no means insignificant as i hope you will believe when you know the troops engaged we report something like three hundred casualties  the captain did not answer for quite a minute all this time he sat thoughtful and even pale for his mind was teeming with the pregnant consequences of such an outbreak then he desired his son to give a succinct but connected history of the whole affair the major complied beginning his narrative with an account of the general state of the country and concluding it by giving as far as it was possible for one whose professional pride and political feelings were too deeply involved to be entirely impartial a reasonably just account of the particular occurrence already mentioned  the events that led to and the hot skirmish which it is the practice of the country to call the battle of lexington and the incidents of the day itself are too familiar to the ordinary reader to require repetition here the major explained all the military points very clearly did full justice to the perseverance and daring of the provincials as he called his enemiesfor an american himself he would not term them americansand threw in as many explanatory remarks as he could think of by way of vindicating the march in again this he did too quite as much out of filial piety as out of selflove for to own the truth the captains mortification as a soldier was so very evident as to give his son sensible pain  the effect of all this continued the major when his narrative of the military movements was ended has been to raise a tremendous feeling throughout the country and god knows what is to follow  and this you have come hither to tell me robert said the father kindly it is well done and as i would have expected from you we might have passed the summer here and not have heard a whisper of so important an event  soon after the affairor as soon as we got some notion of its effect on the provinces general gage sent me privately with despatches to governor tryon he governor tryon was aware of your position and as i had also to communicate the death of sir harry willoughby he directed me to come up the river privately have an interview with sir john if possible and then push on under a feigned name and communicate with you he thinks now sir william is dead that with your estate and new rank and local influence you might be very serviceable in sustaining the royal cause for it is not to be concealed that this affair is likely to take the character of an open and widespread revolt against the authority of the crown  general tryon does me too much honour answered the captain coldly my estate is a small body of wild land my influence extends little beyond this beaver meadow and is confined to my own household and some fifteen or twenty labourers and as for the new rank of which you speak it is not likely the colonists will care much for that if they disregard the rights of the king still you have acted like a son in running the risk you do bob and i pray god you may get back to your regiment in safety  this is a cordial to my hopes sir for nothing would pain me more than to believe you think it my duty because i was born in the colonies to throw up my commission and take side with the rebels  i do not conceive that to be your duty any more than i conceive it to be mine to take sides against them because i happened to be born in england it is a weak view of moral obligations that confines them merely to the accidents of birth and birthplace such a subsequent state of things may have grown up as to change all our duties and it is necessary that we discharge them as they are not as they may have been hitherto or may be hereafter those who clamour so much about mere birthplace usually have no very clear sense of their higher obligations over our birth we can have no control while we are rigidly responsible for the fulfilment of obligations voluntarily contracted  do you reason thus captain asked the chaplain with strong interestnow i confess i feel in this matter not only very much like a native american but very much like a native yankee in the bargain you know i was born in the bay andthe major must excuse mebut it illbecomes my cloth to deceivei hope the major will pardon meii do hope  speak out mr woods said robert willoughby smilingyou have nothing to fear from your old friend the major  so i thoughtso i thoughtwell then i was gladyes really rejoiced at heart to hear that my countrymen downeast there had made the kings troops scamper  i am not aware that i used any such terms sir in connection with the manner in which we marched in after the duty we went out on was performed returned the young soldier a little stiffly i suppose it is natural for one yankee to sympathize with another but my father mr woods is an old england and not a newenglandman and he may be excused if he feel more for the servants of the crown  certainly my dear majorcertainly my dear mr robertmy old pupil and i hope my friendall this is true enough and very natural i allow captain willoughby to wish the best for the kings troops while i wish the best for my own countrymen  this is natural on both sides out of all question though it by no means follows that it is right our country right or wrong is a highsounding maxim but it is scarcely the honest mans maxim our country after all cannot have nearer claims upon us than our parents for instance and who can claim a moral right to sustain even his own father in error injustice or crime no noi hate your pithy sayings they commonly mean nothing that is substantially good at bottom  but ones country in a time of actual war sir said the major in a tone of as much remonstrance as habit would allow him to use to his own father  quite true bob but the difficulty here is to know which is ones country it is a family quarrel at the best and it will hardly do to talk about foreigners at all it is the same as if i should treat maud unkindly or harshly because she is the child of only a friend and not my own natural daughter as god is my judge woods i am unconscious of not loving maud meredith at this moment as tenderly as i love beulah willoughby there was a period in her childhood when the playful little witch had most of my heart i am afraid if the truth were known it is use and duty then and not mere birth that ought to tie our hearts  the major thought it might very well be that one child should be loved more than another though he did not understand how there could be a divided allegiance the chaplain looked at the subject with views still more narrowed and he took up the cudgels of argument in sober earnest conceiving this to be as good an opportunity as another for disposing of the matter  i am all for birth and blood and natural ties he said always excepting the peculiar claims of miss maud whose case is sui generis and not to be confounded with any other case a man can have but one country any more than he can have but one nature and as he is forced to be true to that nature so ought he morally to be true to that country the captain says that it is difficult to determine which is ones country in a civil war but i cannot admit the argument if massachusetts and england get to blows massachusetts is my country if suffolk and worcester counties get into a quarrel my duty calls me to worcester where i was born and so i should carry out the principle from country to country county to county town to town parish to parish or even household to household  this is an extraordinary view of ones duty indeed my dear mr woods cried the major with a good deal of animation and if one half the household quarrelled with the other you would take sides with that in which you happened to find yourself at the moment  it is an extraordinary view of ones duty for a parson observed the captain let us reason backward a little and ascertain where we shall come out you put the head of the household out of the question has he no claims is a father to be altogether overlooked in the struggle between the children are his laws to be brokenhis rights invadedor his person to be maltreated perhaps and his curse disregarded because a set of unruly children get by the ears on points connected with their own selfishness  i give up the household cried the chaplain for the bible settles that and what the bible disposes of is beyond disputehonour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land which the lord thy god giveth theeare terrible words and must not be disobeyed but the decalogue has not another syllable which touches the question thou shalt not kill means murder only common vulgar murderand thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery c dont bear on civil war as i see remember the sabbath to keep it holythou shalt not covet the ox nor the assthou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vainnone of these not one of them bears at all on this question  what do you think of the words of the saviour where he tells us to render unto c√¶sar the things which are c√¶sars has c√¶sar no rights here can massachusetts and my lord north settle their quarrels in such a manner as to put c√¶sar altogether out of view  the chaplain looked down a moment pondered a little and then he came up to the attack again with renewed ardour  c√¶sar is out of the question here if his majesty will come and take sides with us we shall be ready to honour and obey him but if he choose to remain alienated from us it is his act not ours  this is a new mode of settling allegiance if c√¶sar will do as we wish he shall still be c√¶sar but if he refuse to do as we wish then down with c√¶sar i am an old soldier woods and while i feel that this question has two sides to it my disposition to reverence and honour the king is still strong  the major appeared delighted and finding matters going on so favourably he pleaded fatigue and withdrew feeling satisfied that if his father fairly got into a warm discussion taking the loyal side of the question he would do more to confirm himself in the desired views than could be effected by any other means by this time the disputants were so warm as scarcely to notice the disappearance of the young man the argument proceeding  the subject is too hackneyed and indeed possesses too little interest to induce us to give more than an outline of what passed the captain and the chaplain belonged to that class of friends which may be termed argumentative their constant discussions were a strong link in the chain of esteem for they had a tendency to enliven their solitude and to give a zest to lives that without them would have been exceedingly monotonous their ordinary subjects were theology and war the chaplain having some practical knowledge of the last and the captain a lively disposition to the first in these discussions the clergyman was goodnatured and the soldier polite circumstances that tended to render them far more agreeable to the listeners than they might otherwise have proved  on the present occasion the chaplain rang the changes diligently on the natural feelings while his friend spoke most of the higher duties the ad captandum part of the argument oddly enough fell to the share of the minister of the church while the intellectual discriminating and really logical portion of the subject was handled by one trained in garrisons and camps with a truth both of ethics and reason that would have done credit to a drilled casuist the war of words continued till past midnight both disputants soon getting back to their pipes carrying on the conflict amid a smoke that did no dishonour to such a wellcontested field leaving the captain and his friend thus intently engaged we will take one or two glimpses into different parts of the house before we cause all our characters to retire for the night  about the time the battle in the library was at its height mrs willoughby was alone in her room having disposed of all the cares and most of the duties of the day the mothers heart was filled with a calm delight that it would have been difficult for herself to describe all she held most dear on earth her husband her kindhearted faithful longloved husband her noble son the pride and joy of her heart beulah her own naturalborn daughter the mild tractable sincere truehearted child that so much resembled herself and maud the adopted one rendered dear by solicitude and tenderness and now so fondly beloved on her own account were all with her beneath her own roof almost within the circle of her arms the hutted knoll was no longer a solitude the manor was not a wilderness to her for where her heart was there truly was her treasure also after passing a few minutes in silent but delightful thought this excellent guileless woman knelt and poured out her soul in thanksgivings to the being who had surrounded her lot with so many blessings alas little did she suspect the extent duration and direful nature of the evils which at that very moment were pending over her native country or the pains that her own affectionate hear was to endure the major had not suffered a whisper of the real nature of his errand to escape him except to his father and the chaplain and we will now follow him to his apartment and pass a minute t√™te√†t√™te with the young soldier ere he too lays his head on his pillow  a couple of neat rooms were prepared and furnished that were held sacred to the uses of the heir they were known to the whole household black and white as the young captains quarters and even maud called them in her laughing offhandedness bobs sanctum here then the major found everything as he left it on his last visit a twelvemonth before and some few things that were strangers to him in the bargain in that day toilets covered with muslin more or less worked and ornamented were a regular appliance of every bedroom of a betterclass house throughout america the more modern duchesses psyches dressingtables c c of our own extravagant and benefitoftheacttaking generation were then unknown a moderately sized glass surrounded by curved gilded ornaments hanging against the wall above the said muslincovered table quite as a matter of law if not of domestic faith  as soon as the major had set down his candle he looked about him as one recognises old friends pleased at renewing his acquaintance with so many dear and cherished objects the very playthings of his childhood were there and even a beautiful and longused hoop was embellished with ribbons by some hand unknown to himself can this be my mother thought the young man approaching to examine the well remembered hoop which he had never found so honoured before can my kind tenderhearted mother who never will forget that i am no longer a child can she have really done this i must laugh at her tomorrow about it even while i kiss and bless her then he turned to the toilet where stood a basket filled with different articles which at once he understood were offerings to himself never had he visited the hut without finding such a basket in his room at night it was a tender proof how truly and well he was remembered in his absence  ah thought the major as he opened a bundle of knit lambswool stockings here is my dear mother again with her thoughts about damp feet and the exposure of service and a dozen shirts too with beulah pinned on one of themhow the deuce does the dear girl suppose i am to carry away such a stock of linen without even a horse to ease me of a bundle my kit would be like that of the commanderin chief were i to take away all that these dear relatives design for me whats thisa purse a handsome silken purse too with beulahs name on it has maud nothing here why has maud forgotten me ruffles handkerchiefs gartersyes here is a pair of my good mothers own knitting but nothing of maudsha what have we here as i live a beautiful silken scarfnetted in a way to make a whole regiment envious can this have been bought or has it been the work of a twelvemonth no name on it either would my father have done this perhaps it is one of his old scarfsif so it is an old new one for i do not think it has ever been worn i must inquire into this in the morningi wonder there is nothing of mauds  as the major laid aside his presents he kissed the scarf and theni regret to say without saying his prayersthe young man went to bed  the scene must now be transferred to the room where the sistersin affection if not in bloodwere about to seek their pillows also maud ever the quickest and most prompt in her movements was already in her nightclothes and wrapping a shawl about herself was seated waiting for beulah to finish her nightly orisons it was not long before the latter rose from her knees and then our heroine spoke  the major must have examined the basket by this time she cried her cheek rivalling the tint of a riband it leaned against on the back of the chair i heard his heavy tramptramptrampas he went to his roomhow differently these men walk from us girls beulah  they do indeed and bob has got to be so large and heavy now that he quite frightens me sometimes do you not think he grows wonderfully like papa  i do not see it he wears his own hair and its a pity he should ever cut it off its so handsome and curling then he is taller but lighterhas more colouris so much youngerand everyway so different i wonder you think so i do not think him in the least like father  well that is odd maud both mother and myself were struck with the resemblance this evening and we were both delighted to see it papa is quite handsome and so i think is bob mother says he is not quite as handsome as father was at his age but so like him it is surprising  men may be handsome and not alike father is certainly one of the handsomest elderly men of my acquaintanceand the major is sosoish but i wonder you can think a man of sevenandtwenty so very like one of sixty odd bob tells me he can play the flute quite readily now beulah  i dare say he does everything he undertakes uncommonly well mr woods said a few days since he had never met with a boy who was quicker at his mathematics  oh all mr woods geese are swans i dare say there have been other boys who were quite as clever i do not believe in nonpareils beulah  you surprise me maudyou whom i always supposed such a friend of bobs he thinks everything you do too so perfect now this very evening he was looking at the sketch you have made of the knoll and he protested he did not know a regular artist in england even that would have done it better  maud stole a glance at her sister while the latter was speaking from under her cap and her cheeks now fairly put the riband to shame but her smile was still saucy and wilful  oh nonsense she saidbobs no judge of drawingshe scarce knows a tree from a horse  im surprised to hear you say so maud said the generousminded and affectionate beulah who could see no imperfection in bob and that of your brother when he taught you to draw you thought him well skilled as an artist  did ii dare say im a capricious creaturebut somehow i dont regard bob just as i used to he has been away from us so much of late you knowand the army makes men so formidableand they are not like us you knowand altogether i think bob excessively changed  well im glad mamma dont hear this maud she looks upon her son now he is a major and twentyseven just as she used to look upon him when he was in petticoatsnay i think she considers us all exactly as so many little children  she is a dear good mother i know said maud with emphasis tears starting to her eyes involuntarily almost impetuously whatever she says does wishes hopes or thinks is right  oh i knew you would come to as soon as there was a question about mother well for my part i have no such horror of men as not to feel just as much tenderness for father or brother as i feel for mamma herself  not for bob beulah tenderness for bob why my dear sister that is feeling tenderness for a major of foot a very different thing from feeling it for ones mother as for papadear me he is glorious and i do so love him  you ought to maud for you were and i am not certain that you are not at this moment his darling  it was odd that this was said without the least thought on the part of the speaker that maud was not her natural sisterthat in fact she was not in the least degree related to her by blood but so closely and judiciously had captain and mrs willoughby managed the affair of their adopted child that neither they themselves beulah nor the inmates of the family or household ever thought of her but as of a real daughter of her nominal parents as for beulah her feelings were so simple and sincere that they were even beyond the ordinary considerations of delicacy and she took precisely the same liberties with her titular as she would have done with a natural sister maud alone of all in the hut remembered her birth and submitted to some of its most obvious consequences as respects the captain the idea never crossed her mind that she was adopted by him as respects her mother she filled to her in every sense that sacred character beulah too was a sister in thought and deed but bob he had so changed had been so many years separated from her had once actually called her miss meredith somehow she knew not how herselfit was fully six years since she had begun to remember that he was not her brother  as for my father said maud rising with emotion and speaking with startling emphasisi will not say i love himi worship him  ah i know that well enough maud and to say the truth you are a couple of idolaters between you mamma says this sometimes though she owns she is not jealous but it would pain her excessively to hear that you do not feel towards bob just as we all feel  but ought ibeulah i cannot  ought youwhy not maud are you in your senses child  butyou knowim sureyou ought to remember  what demanded beulah really frightened at the others excessive agitation  that i am not his realtrueborn sister  this was the first time in their lives either had ever alluded to the fact in the others presence beulah turned pale she trembled all over as if in an ague then she luckily burst into tears else she might have fainted  beulahmy sistermy own sister cried maud throwing herself into the arms of the distressed girl  ah maud you are you shall for ever be my only only sister      chapter vi    o it is great for our country to die where ranks are contending     bright is the wreath of our fame glory awaits us for aye   glory that never is dim shining on with light never ending     glory that never shall fade never o never away    percival  notwithstanding the startling intelligence that had so unexpectedly reached it and the warm polemical conflict that had been carried on within its walls the night passed peacefully over the roof of the hutted knoll at the return of dawn the two plinys both the smashes and all the menials were again afoot and ere long mike saucy nick joel and the rest were seen astir in the open fields or in the margin of the woods cattle were fed cows milked fires lighted and everything pursued its course in the order of may the three wenches as female negroes were then termed ex officio in america opened their throats as was usual at that hour and were heard singing at their labours in a way nearly to deaden the morning carols of the tenants of the forest mari in particular would have drowned the roar of niagara the captain used to call her his clarion  in due time the superiors of the household made their appearance mrs willoughby was the first out of her room as was ever the case when there was anything to be done on the present occasion the fatted calf was to be killed not in honour of the return of a prodigal son however but in behalf of one who was the pride of her eyes and the joy of her heart the breakfast that she ordered was just the sort of breakfast that one must visit america to witness france can set forth a very scientific d√©jeuner √† la fourchette and england has labouredand ponderous imitations but for the spontaneous superabundant unsophisticated natural allsufficing and allsubduing mornings meal take america in a betterclass house in the country and you reach the ne plus ultra in that sort of thing tea coffee and chocolate of which the first and last were excellent and the second respectable ham fish eggs toast cakes rolls marmalades c c c were thrown together in noble confusion frequently occasioning the guest as mr woods naively confessed an utter confusion of mind as to which he was to attack when all were inviting and each would be welcome  leaving mrs willoughby in deep consultation with mari on the subject of this feast we will next look after the two sweet girls whom we so abruptly deserted in the last chapter when mauds glowing cheeks were first visible that morning signs of tears might have been discovered on them as the traces of the dew are found on the leaf of the rose but they completely vanished under the duties of the toilet and she came forth from her chamber bright and cloudless as the glorious may morning which had returned to cheer the solitude of the manor beulah followed tranquil bland and mild as the day itself the living image of the purity of soul and deep affections of her honest nature  the sisters went into the breakfastroom where they had little lady like offices of their own to discharge too in honour of the guest each employing herself in decorating the table and in seeing that it wanted nothing in the proprieties as their pleasing tasks were fulfilled the discourse did not flag between them nothing however had been said that made the smallest allusion to the conversation of the past night neither felt any wish to revive that subject and as for maud bitterly did she regret ever having broached it at times her cheeks burned with blushes as she recalled her words and yet she scarce knew the reason why the feeling of beulah was different she wondered her sister could ever think she was a meredith and not a willoughby at times she feared some unfortunate oversight of her own some careless allusion or indiscreet act might have served to remind maud of the circumstances of her real birth yet there was nothing in the last likely to awaken unpleasant reflections apart from the circumstance that she was not truly a child of the family into which she had been transplanted the merediths were at least as nonourable a family as the willoughbys in the ordinary worldly view of the matter nor was maud by any means a dependant in the way of money five thousand pounds in the english funds had been settled on her by the marriage articles of her parents and twenty years of careful husbandry during which every shilling had been scrupulously devoted to accumulation had quite doubled the original amount so far from being penniless therefore mauds fortune was often alluded to by the captain in a jocular way as if purposely to remind her that she had the means of independence and duties connected with it it is true maud herself had no suspicion that she had been educated altogether by her father and that her own money had not been used for this purpose to own the truth she thought little about it knew little about it beyond the fact that she had a fortune of her own into the possession of which she must step when she attained her majority how she came by it even was a question she never asked though there were moments when tender regrets and affectionate melancholy would come over her heart as she thought of her natural parents and of their early deaths still maud implicitly reposed on the captain and mrs willoughby as on a father and mother and it was not owing to them or anything connected with their love treatment words or thoughts that she was reminded that they were not so in very fact as well as in tenderness  bob will think you made these plum sweetmeats beulah said maud with a saucy smile as she placed a glass plate on the tablehe never thinks i can make anything of this sort and as he is so fond of plums he will be certain to taste them then you will come in for the praise  you appear to think that praise he must perhaps he may not fancy them good  if i thought so i would take them away this instant cried maud standing in the attitude of one in doubt bob does not think much of such things in girls for he says ladies need not be cooks and yet when one does make a thing of this sort one would certainly like to have it well made  set your heart at ease maud the plums are deliciousmuch the best we ever had and we are rather famous for them you know ill answer for it bob will pronounce them the best he has ever tasted  and if he shouldnt why should i carethat is not very muchabout it you know they are the first i ever made and one may be permitted to fail on a first effort besides a man may go to england and see fine sights and live in great houses and all that and not understand when he has good plum sweetmeats before him and when bad i dare say there are many colonels in the army who are ignorant on this point  beulah laughed and admitted the truth of the remark though in her secret mind she had almost persuaded herself that bob knew everything  do you not think our brother improved in appearance maud she asked after a short pause the visit to england has done him that service at least  i dont see it beulahi see no change to me bob is just the same today that he has ever been that is ever since he grew to be a manwith boys of course it is different ever since he was made a captain i mean  as major willoughby had reached that rank the day he was oneand twenty the reader can understand the precise date when maud began to take her present views of his appearance and character  i am surprised to hear you say so maud papa says he is better set up as he calls it by his english drill and that he looks altogether more like a soldier than he did  bob has always had a martial look cried maud quicklyhe got that in garrison when a boy  if so i hope he may never lose it said the subject of the remark himself who had entered the room unperceived and overheard this speech being a soldier one would wish to look like what he is my little critic  the kiss that followed and that given to beulah were no more than the usual morning salutations of a brother to his sisters slight touches of rosy cheeks and yet maud blushed for as she said to herself she had been taken by surprise  they say listeners never hear good of themselves answered maud with a vivacity that betokened confusion had you come a minute sooner master bob it might have been an advantage  oh beulahs remarks i do not fear so long as i get off unscathed from yours miss maud i shall think myself a lucky fellow but what has brought me and my training into discussion this morning  it is natural for sisters to speak about their brother after so long  tell him nothing about it beulah interrupted maud let him listen and eavesdrop and find out as he may if he would learn our secrets there major willoughby i hope that is a promise of a breakfast which will satisfy even your military appetite  it looks well indeed maudand there i perceive are some of beulahs excellent plums of which i am so fondknow they were made especially for me and i must kiss you sister for this proof of remembrance  beulah to whose simple mind it seemed injustice to appropriate credit that belonged to another was about to tell the truth but an imploring gesture from her sister induced her to smile and receive the salute in silence  has any one seen captain willoughby and parson woods this morning inquired the major i left them desperately engaged in discussion and i really feel some apprehension as to the remains left on the field of battle  here they both come cried maud glad to find the discourse taking so complete a change and there is mamma followed by pliny to tell beulah to take her station at the coffee while i go to the chocolate leaving the tea to the only hand that can make it so that my father will drink it  the parties mentioned entered the room in the order named the usual salutations followed and all took their seats at table captain willoughby was silent and thoughtful at first leaving his son to rattle on in a way that betokened care in his view of the matter quite as much as it betokened lightheartedness in those of his mother and sisters the chaplain was rather more communicative than his friend but he too seemed restless and desirous of arriving at some point that was not likely to come uppermost in such a family party at length the impulses of mr woods got the better of his discretion even and he could conceal his thoughts no longer  captain willoughby he said in a sort of apologetic and yet simple and natural manner i have done little since we parted seven hours since but think of the matter under discussion  if you have my dear woods there has been a strong sympathy between us i have scarcely slept i may say i have thought of nothing else myself and am glad you have broached the subject again  i was about to say my worthy sir that reflection and my pillow and your sound and admirable arguments have produced an entire change in my sentiments i think now altogether with you  the devil you do woods cried the captain looking up from his bit of dry toast in astonishment why my dear fellowthis is odd excessively odd if the truth must be saidto own the real state of the case chaplain you have won me over and i was just about to make proper acknowledgments of your victory  it need scarcely be added that the rest of the company were not a little amazed at these crossconcessions while maud was exceedingly amused as for mrs willoughby nothing laughable ever occurred in connection with her husband and then she would as soon think of assailing the church itself as to ridicule one of its ministers beulah could see nothing but what was right in her father at least and as for the major he felt too much concerned at this unexpected admission of his fathers to perceive anything but the error  have you not overlooked the injunction of scripture my excellent friend rejoined the chaplain have you left to the rights of c√¶sar all their weight and authority the kings name is a tower of strength  have not you woods forgotten the superior claims of reason and right over those of accident and birththat man is to be considered as a reasoning being to be governed by principles and evervarying facts and not a mere animal left to the control of an instinct that perishes with its usefulness  what can they mean mother whispered maud scarce able to repress the laughter that came so easily to one with a keen sense of the ludicrous  they have been arguing about the right of parliament to tax the colonies i believe my dear and overpersuaded each other thats all it is odd robert that mr woods should convert your father  no my dearest mother it is something even more serious than that by this time the disputants who sat opposite each other were fairly launched into the discussion again and heeded nothing that passedno dearest mother it is far worse than even that pliny tell my man to brush the huntingjacketand see he has his breakfast in good stylehe is a grumbling rascal and will give the house a bad character elseyou need not come back until we ring for youyes mother yes dearest girls this is a far more serious matter than you suppose though it ought not to be mentioned idly among the people god knows now they may take itand bad news flies swift enough of itself  merciful providence exclaimed mrs willoughbywhat can you mean my son  i mean mother that civil war has actually commenced in the colonies and that the people of your blood and race are in open arms against the people of my fathers native countryin a word against me  how can that be robert who would dare to strike a blow against the king  when men get excited and their passions are once inflamed they will do much my mother that they might not dream of else  this must be a mistake some evildisposed person has told you this robert knowing your attachment to the crown  i wish it were so dear madam but my own eyes have seeni may say my own flesh has felt the contrary  the major then related what had happened letting his auditors into the secret of the true state of the country it is scarcely necessary to allude to the degree of consternation and pain with which he was heard or to the grief which succeeded  you spoke of yourself dear bob said maud naturally and with strong feelingyou were not hurt in this cruel cruel battle  i ought not to have mentioned it although i did certainly receive a smart contusionnothing more i assure youhere in the shoulder and it now scarcely inconveniences me  by this time all were listening curiosity and interest having silenced even the disputants especially as this was the first they had heard of the majors casualty then neither felt the zeal which had warmed him in the previous contest but was better disposed to turn aside from its pursuit  i hope it did not send you to the rear bob anxiously inquired the father  i was in the rear sir when i got the hurt answered the major laughing the rear is the post of honour on a retreat you know my dear father and i believe our march scarce deserves another name  that is hard too on kings troops what sort of fellows had you to oppose my son  a rather intrusive set sir their object was to persuade us to go into boston as fast as possible and it was a little difficult at times not to listen to their arguments if my lord percy had not come out with a strong party and two pieces of artillery we might not have stood it much longer our men were fagged like hunted deer and the day proved oppressively hot  artillery too exclaimed the captain his military pride reviving a little to unsettle his last convictions of duty did you open your columns and charge your enemies in line  it would have been charging air no sooner did we halt than our foes dispersed or no sooner did we renew the march than every line of wall along our route became a line of hostile muskets i trust you will do us justice siryou know the regiments and can scarce think they misbehaved  british troops seldom do that although i have known it happen no men however are usually more steady and then these provincials are formidable as skirmishers in that character i know them too what has been the effect of all this on the country bobyou told us something of it last night complete the history  the provinces are in a tumult as for new england a flame of fire could scarce be more devastating though i think this colony is less excited still here men are arming in thousands  dear medear meejaculated the peacefullyinclined chaplainthat human beings can thus be inclined to self destruction  is tryon activewhat do the royal authorities all this time  of course they neglect nothing feasible but they must principally rely on the loyalty and influence of the gentry until succour can arrive from europe if that fail them their difficulties will be much increased  captain willoughby understood his son he glanced towards his unconscious wife as if to see how far she felt with him  our own families are divided of course much as they have been in the previous discussions he added the de lanceys van cortlandts philipses bayards and most of that town connection with a large portion of the long island families i should think are with the crown while the livingstons morrises schuylers rensselaers and their friends go with the colony is not this the manner in which they are divided  with some limitations sir all the de lanceys with most of their strong connections and influence are with uswith the king i meanwhile all the livingstons and morrises are against us the other families are dividedas with the cortlandts schuylers and rensselaers it is fortunate for the patroon that he is a boy  why so bob asked the captain looking inquiringly up at his son  simply sir that his great estate may not be confiscated so many of his near connections are against us that he could hardly escape the contamination and the consequences would be inevitable  do you consider that so certain sir as there are two sides to the question may there not be two results to the war  i think not sir england is no power to be defied by colonies insignificant as these  this is well enough for a kings officer major willoughby but all large bodies of men are formidable when they are right and nations these colonies are a nation in extent and numberare not so easily put down when the spirit of liberty is up and doing among them  the major listened to his father with pain and wonder the captain spoke earnestly and there was a flush about his fine countenance that gave it sternness and authority unused to debate with his father especially when the latter was in such a mood the son remained silent though his mother who was thoroughly loyal in her heartmeaning loyal as applied to a sovereignand who had the utmost confidence in her husbands tenderness and consideration for herself was not so scrupulous  why willoughby she cried you really incline to rebellion i even i who was born in the colonies think them very wrong to resist their anointed king and sovereign prince  ah wilhelmina answered the captain more mildly you have a true colonists admiration of home but i was old enough when i left england to appreciate what i saw and knew and cannot feel all this provincial admiration  but surely my dear captain england is a very great country interrupted the chaplaina prodigious country one that can claim all our respect and love look at the church now the purified continuation of the ancient visible authority of christ on earth it is the consideration of this church that has subdued my natural love of birthplace and altered my sentiments  all very true and all very well in your mouth chaplain yet even the visible church may err this doctrine of divine right would have kept the stuarts on the throne and it is not even english doctrine much less then need it be american i am no cromwellian no republican that wishes to oppose the throne in order to destroy it a good king is a good thing and a prodigious blessing to a country still a people needs look to its political privileges if it wish to preserve them you and i will discuss this matter another time parson there will be plenty of opportunities he added rising and smiling goodhumouredly i must now call my people together and let them know this news it is not fair to conceal a civil war  my dear sir exclaimed the major in concernare you not wrong precipitate i meanis it not better to preserve the secret to give yourself time for reflectionto await eventsi can discover no necessity for this haste should you see things differently hereafter an incautious word uttered at this moment might bring much motive for regret  i have thought of all this bob during the nightfor hardly did i close my eyesand you cannot change my purpose it is honest to let my people know how matters stand and so far from being hazardous as you seem to think i consider it wise god knows what time will bring forth but in every or any event fairdealing can scarcely injure him who practises it i have already sent directions to have the whole settlement collected on the lawn at the ringing of the bell and i expect every moment we shall hear the summons  against this decision there was no appeal mild and indulgent as the captain habitually was his authority was not to be disputed when he chose to exercise it some doubts arose and the father participated in them for a moment as to what might be the effect on the majors fortunes for should a very patriotic spirit arise among the men two thirds of whom were native americans and what was more from the eastern colonies he might be detained or at least betrayed on his return and delivered into the hands of the revolted authorities this was a very serious consideration and it detained the captain in the house some time after the people were assembled debating the chances in the bosom of his own family  we exaggerate the danger the captain at length exclaimed most of these men have been with me for years and i know not one among them who i think would wish to injure me or even you my son in this way there is far more danger in attempting to deceive them than in making them confidants i will go out and tell the truth then we shall at least have the security of selfapprobation if you escape the danger of being sold by nick my son i think you have little to fear from any other  by nick repeated halfadozen voices in surprisesurely father surely willoughbysurely my dear captain you cannot suspect as old and tried a follower as the tuscarora  ay he is an old follower certainly and he has been punished often enough if he has not been tried i have never suffered my distrust of that fellow to go to sleepit is unsafe with an indian unless you have a strong hold on his gratitude  but willoughby he it was who found this manor for us rejoined the wife without him we should never have been the owners of this lovely place this beaverdam and all else that we so much enjoy  true my dear and without good golden guineas we should not have had nick  but sir i pay as liberally as he can wish observed the major if bribes will buy him mine are as good as anothers  we shall seeunder actual circumstances i think we shall be in every respect safer by keeping nothing back than by telling all to the people  the captain now put on his hat and issued through the undefended gateway followed by every individual of his family as the summons had been general when the willoughbys and the chaplain appeared on the lawn every living soul of that isolated settlement even to infants in the arms was collected there the captain commanded the profound respect of all his dependants though a few among them did not love him the fault was not his however but was inherent rather in the untoward characters of the disaffected themselves his habits of authority were unsuited to their habits of a presuming equality perhaps and it is impossible for the comparatively powerful and affluent to escape the envy and repinings of men who unable to draw the real distinctions that separate the gentleman from the lowminded and grovelling impute their advantages to accidents and money but even the few who permitted this malign and corrupting tendency to influence their feelings could not deny that their master was just and benevolent though he did not always exhibit this justice and benevolence precisely in the way best calculated to soothe their own craving selflove and exaggerated notions of assumed natural claims in a word captain willoughby in the eyes of a few unquiet and bloated imaginations among his people was obnoxious to the imputation of pride and this because he saw and felt the consequences of education habits manners opinions and sentiments that were hidden from those who not only had no perception of their existence but who had no knowledge whatever of the qualities that brought them into being popes familiar line of what can we reason but from what we know is peculiarly applicable to persons of this class who are ever for dragging all things down to standards created by their own ignorance and who slaves of the basest and meanest passions reason as if they were possessors of all the knowledge sensibilities and refinements of their own country and times of this class of men comes the ordinary demagogue a wretch equally incapable of setting an example of any of the higher qualities in his own person or practice and of appreciating it when exhibited by others such men abound under all systems where human liberty is highly privileged being the moral fungi of freedom as the rankest weeds are known to be the troublesome and baneful productions of the richest soils  it was no unusual thing for the people of the hutted knoll to be collected in the manner we have described we are writing of a period that the present enlightened generation is apt to confound with the darker ages of american knowledge in much that relates to social usages at least though it escaped the longburied wisdom of the mormon bible and millers interpretations of the prophecies in that day men were not so silly as to attempt to appear always wise but some of the f√™tes and festivals of our anglosaxon ancestors were still tolerated among us the allabsorbing and allswallowing jubilee of independenceday not having yet overshadowed everything else in the shape of a holiday now captain willoughby had brought with him to the colonies the love of festivals that is so much more prevalent in the old world than in the new and it was by no means an uncommon thing for him to call his people together to make merry on a birthday or the anniversary of some battle in which he had been one of the victors when he appeared on the lawn on the present occasion therefore it was expected he was about to meet them with some such announcement  the inhabitants of the manor or the estate of the hutted knoll might be divided into three great physical and we might add moral categories or races viz the anglosaxon the dutch both high and low and the african the first was the most numerous including the families of the millers most of the mechanics and that of joel strides the landoverseer the second was composed chiefly of labourers and the last were exclusively household servants with the exception of one of the plinys who was a ploughman though permitted to live with his kinsfolk in the hut these divisions maud in one of her merry humours had nicknamed the three tribes while her father to make the enumeration complete had classed the serjeant mike and jamie allen as supernumeraries  the three tribes and the three supernumeraries then were all collected on the lawn as the captain and his family approached by a sort of secret instinct too they had divided themselves into knots the dutch keeping a little aloof from the yankees and the blacks almost as a matter of religion standing a short distance in the rear as became people of their colour and slaves mike and jamie however had got a sort of neutral position between the two great divisions of the whites as if equally indifferent to their dissensions or antipathies in this manner all parties stood impatiently awaiting an announcement that had been so long delayed the captain advanced to the front and removing his hat a ceremony he always observed on similar occasions and which had the effect to make his listeners imitate his own courtesy he addressed the crowd  when people live together in a wilderness like this commenced the captain there ought to be no secrets between them my friends in matters that touch the common interests we are like men on a remote island a sort of colony of our own and we must act fairly and frankly by each other in this spirit then i am now about to lay before you all that i know myself concerning an affair of the last importance to the colonies and to the empire here joel pricked up his ears and cast a knowing glance at the miller a countryman and early neighbour of his own who had charge of the grinding for the settlement and who went by that appellation par excellence you all know continued the captain that there have been serious difficulties between the colonies and parliament now for more than ten years difficulties that have been once or twice partially settled but which have as often broken out in some new shape as soon as an old quarrel was adjusted  here the captain paused a moment and joel who was the usual spokesman of the people took an occasion to put a question  the captain means i spose he said in a sly halfhonest half jesuitical manner the right of parliament to tax us americans without our own consent or our having any members in their legyslatoore  i mean what you say the tax on tea the shutting the port of boston and other steps have brought larger bodies of the kings troops among us than have been usual boston as you probably know has had a strong garrison now for some months about six weeks since the commanderinchief sent a detachment out as far as concord in new hampshire to destroy certain stores this detachment had a meeting with the minutemen and blood was drawn a running fight ensued in which several hundreds have been killed and wounded and i think i know both sides sufficiently well to predict that a long and bloody civil war is begun these are facts you should know and accordingly i tell them to you  this simple but explicit account was received very differently by the different listeners joel strides leaned forward with intense interest so as not to lose a syllable most of the new englanders or yankees paid great attention and exchanged meaning glances with each other when the captain had got through as for mike he grasped a shillelah that he habitually carried when not at work looking round as if waiting for orders from the captain on whom to begin jamie was thoughtful and grave and once or twice as the captain proceeded he scratched his head in doubt the dutch seemed curious but bewildered gaping at each other like men who might make up their minds if you would give them time but who certainly had not yet as for the blacks their eyes began to open like saucers when they heard of the quarrel when it got to the blows their mouths were all grinning with the delight of a thing so exciting at the mention of the number of the dead however something like awe passed over them and changed their countenances to dismay nick alone was indifferent by the cold apathy of his manner the captain saw at once that the battle of lexington had not been a secret to the tuscarora when he commenced his own account as the captain always encouraged a proper familiarity in his dependants he now told them he was ready to answer any questions they might think expedient to put to him in gratification of their natural curiosity  i spose this news comes by the major asked joel  you may well suppose that strides my son is here and we have no other means of getting it  will yer honour be wishful that we shoulther our firearms and go out and fight one of them sides or tother demanded mike  i wish nothing of the sort ohearn it will be time enough for us to take a decided part when we get better ideas of what is really going on  doesnt the captain then think matters have got far enough towards a head for the americans to make up their minds conclusively as it might be put in joel in his very worst manner  i think it will be wiser for us all to remain where we are and as we are civil war is a serious matter strides and no man should rush blindly into its dangers and difficulties  joel looked at the miller and the miller looked at joel neither said anything however at the time jamie allen had been out in the fortyfive when thirty years younger than he was that day and though he had his predilections and antipathies circumstances had taught him prudence  will the parliament think ye no be bidding the soldiery to wark their will on the puir unairmed folk up and down the country and they not provided with the means to resist them  och jamie interrupted mike who did not appear to deem it necessary to treat this matter with even decent respectwhere will be yer valour and stomach to ask sich a question as that a man is always reathy when he has his arrms and legs free to act accorthing to natur what would a rigiment of throops do agin the likes of sich a place as this im sure its tin years ive been in it and ive niver been able to find my way out of it set a souldier to rowing on the lake forenent the rising sun with orders to get to the other ind and a pretty job he d make of marching on that same i knows it for ive thried it and it is not a new beginner that will make much of sich oare barring he knows nothin about them  this was not very intelligible to anybody but joel and he had ceased to laugh at mikes voyage now some six or seven years divers other disasters all having their origin in a similar confusion of ideas having in the interval supplanted that calamity as it might be seriatim still it was an indication that mike might be set down as a belligerent who was disposed to follow his leader into the battle without troubling him with many questions concerning the merits of the quarrel nevertheless the county leitrimman acknowledged particular principles all of which had a certain influence on his conduct whenever he could get at them to render them available first and foremost he cordially disliked a yankee and he hated an englishman both as an oppressor and a heretic yet he loved his master and all that belonged to him these were contradictory feelings certainly but mike was all contradiction both in theory and in practice  the anglosaxon tribe now professed a willingness to retire promising to think of the matter a course against which mike loudly protested declaring he never knew any good come of thinking when matters had got as far as blows jamie too went off scratching his head and he was seen to make many pauses that day between the shovelsfull of earth he from time to time threw around his plants as if pondering on what he had heard as for the dutch their hour had not come no one expected them to decide the day they first heard of argument  the negroes got together and began to dwell on the marvels of a battle in which so many christians had been put to death little smash placed the slain at a few thousands but great smash as better became her loftier appellation and higher spirit affirmed that the captain had stated hundreds of thousands a loss with less than which as she contended no great battle could possibly be fought  when the captain was housed serjeant joyce demanded an audience the object of which was simply to ask for orders without the least reference to principles      chapter vii          we are all here         father mother         sister brother   all who hold each other dear   each chair is filldwere all at home   tonight let no cold stranger come   it is not often thus around   our old familiar hearth were found   bless then the meeting and the spot   for once be every care forgot   let gentle peace assert her power   and kind affection rule the hour         were allall here    sprague  although most of the people retired to their dwellings or their labours as soon as the captain dismissed them a few remained to receive his farther orders among these last were joel the carpenter and the blacksmith these men now joined the chief of the settlement and his son who had lingered near the gateway in conversation concerning the alterations that the present state of things might render necessary in and about the hut  joel observed the captain when the three men were near enough to hear his orders this great change in the times will render some changes in our means of defence prudent if not necessary  does the captain spose the people of the colony will attack us asked the wily overseer with emphasis  perhaps not the people of the colony mr strides for we have not yet declared ourselves their enemies but there are other foes who are more to be apprehended than the people of the colony  i should think the kings troops not likely to trouble themselves to ventur herethe road might prove easier to come than to return besides our plunder would scarce pay for such a march  perhaps notbut there never has yet been a war in these colonies that some of the savage tribes were not engaged in it before the whites had fairly got themselves into line  do you really think sir there can be much serious danger of that exclaimed the major in surprise  beyond a question my son the scalpingknife will be at work in six months if it be not busy already should onehalf of your reports and rumours turn out to be true such is american history  i rather think sir your apprehensions for my mother and sisters may mislead you i do not believe the american authorities will ever allow themselves to be driven into a measure so perfectly horrible and unjustifiable and were the english ministry sufficiently cruel or unprincipled to adopt the policy the honest indignation of so humane a people would be certain to drive them from power  as the major ceased speaking he turned and caught the expression of joels countenance and was struck with the look of intense interest with which the overseer watched his own warm and sincere manner  humanity is a very pretty stalkinghorse for political orations bob quietly returned the father but it will scarcely count for much with an old campaigner god send you may come out of this war with the same ingenuous and natural feelings as you go into it  the major will scarce dread the savages should he be on the side of his natral friends remarked joel and if what he says about the humanity of the kings advisers be true he will be safe from them  the major will be on the side to which duty calls him mr strides if it may be agreeable to your views of the matter answered the young man with a little more hauteur than the occasion required  the father felt uneasy and he regretted that his son had been so indiscreet though he saw no remedy but by drawing the attention of the men to the matter before them  neither the real wishes of the people of america nor of the people of england will avail much in carrying on this war he said its conduct will fall into the hands of those who will look more to the ends than to the means and success will be found a sufficient apology for any wrong this has been the history of all the wars of my time and it is likely to prove the history of this i fear it will make little difference to us on which side we may be in feeling there will be savages to guard against in either case this gate must be hung one of the first things joel and i have serious thoughts of placing palisades around the knoll the hut well palisaded would make a work that could not be easily carried without artillery  joel seemed struck with the idea though it did not appear that it was favourably he stood studying the house and the massive gates for a minute or two ere he delivered his sentiments on the subject when he did speak it was a good deal more in doubt than in approbation  its all very true captain he said the house would seem to be a good deal more safe like if the gates were up but a body dont know sometimes gates be a security and sometimes they isnt it all depends on which side the danger comes still as these are made and finished all to hanging its most a pity too they shouldnt be used if a body could find time  the time must be found and the gates be hung interrupted the captain too much accustomed to joels doubting sortoconcluding manner to be always patient under the infliction not only the gates but the palisades must be got out holes dug and the circumvallation completed  it must be as the captain says of course he being master here but times precious in may theres half our plantin to be done yet and some of the ground hasnt got the last ploughin harvest wont come without seedtime for no man let him be great or let him be small and it does seem to me a sort o wastin of the lords blessins to be hangin gates and diggin holes for thatthe thing the captain mentionedwhen theres no visible danger in sight to recommend the measure to prudence as it might be  that may be your opinion mr strides but it is not mine i intend to guard against a visible danger that is out of sight and i will thank you to have these gates hung this very day  this very daythe captains a mind to be musical about the matter every hand in the settlement couldnt get them gates in their places in less than a week  it appears to me strides you are playing on the music as you call it yourself now  no indeed captain them gates will have to be hung on the mechanic principle and it will take at least two or three days for the carpenter and blacksmith to get up the works thats to do it then the hanging itself i should think would stand us in hand a day for each side as for the circumvalley what between the cuttin and haulin and diggin and settin that would occupy all hands until after first hoein that is hoein would come afore the plantin  it does not appear to me bob such a heavy job as joel represents the gates are heavy certainly and may take us a day or two but as for stockadingive seen barracks stockaded in in a week if i remember right you know something of thiswhat is your opinion  that this house can be stockaded in in the time you mention and as i have a strong reluctance to leave the family before it is in security with your permission i will remain and superintend the work  the offer was gladly accepted on more accounts than one and the captain accustomed to be obeyed when he was in earnest issued his orders forthwith to let the work proceed joel however was excused in order that he might finish the planting he had commenced and which a very few hands could complete within the required time as no ditch was necessary the work was of a very simple nature and the major set about his portion of it without even reentering the house  the first thing was to draw a line for a trench some six or seven feet deep that was to encircle the whole building at a distance of about thirty yards from the house this line ran on each side of the hut on the very verge of the declivities rendering the flanks far more secure than the front where it crossed the lawn on a gently inclining surface in one hour the major had traced this lines with accuracy and he had six or eight men at work with spades digging the trench a gang of hands was sent into the woods with orders to cut the requisite quantify of young chestnuts and by noon a load of the material actually appeared on the ground still nothing was done to the gates  to own the truth the captain was now delighted the scene reminded him of some in his military life and he bustled about giving his orders with a good deal of the fire of youth renewed taking care however in no manner to interfere with the plans of his son mike buried himself like a mole and had actually advanced several feet before either of the yankees had got even a fair footing on the bottom of his part of the trench as for jamie allen he went to work with deliberation but it was not long before his naked gray hairs were seen on a level with the surface of the ground the digging was not hard though a little stony and the work proceeded with spirit and success all that day and the next and the next and the next the knoll appeared alive earth being cast upward teams moving carpenters sawing and labourers toiling many of the men protested that their work was useless unnecessary unlawful even but no one dared hesitate under the eyes of the major when his father had once issued a serious command in the mean time joels planting was finished though he made many long pauses while at work on the flats to look up and gaze at the scene of activity and bustle that was presented at the knoll on the fourth day towards evening he was obliged to join the general bee with the few hands he had retained with himself  by this time the trench was dug most of the timber was prepared and the business of setting up the stockade was commenced each young tree was cut to the length of twenty feet and pointed at one end mortices to receive crosspieces were cut at proper distances and holes were bored to admit the pins this was all the preparation and the timbers were set in the trench pointed ends uppermost when a sufficient number were thus arranged a few inches from each other the cross pieces were pinned on bringing the whole into a single connected frame or bent the bent was then raised to a perpendicular and secured by pounding the earth around the lower ends of the timbers the latter process required care and judgment and it was entrusted to the especial supervision of the deliberate jamie the major having discovered that the yankees in general were too impatient to get on and to make a show serjeant joyce was particularly useful in dressing the rows of timber and in giving the whole arrangement a military air  guid wark is far better than quick wark observed the coolheaded scotchman as he moved about among the men and its no the fuss and bustle of acteevity that is to give the captain pleasure the thing that is well done is done with the least noise and confusion set the stockades mair pairpendiclar my men  aydress them too my ladsadded the venerable exserjeant  this is queer plantin jamie put in joel and queerer grain will come of it do you think these young chestnuts will ever grow agin that you put them out in rows like so much corn  now its no for the growth we does it joel but to presairve the human growth we have to keep the savage bairbers o the wilderness fra clippin our polls before the shearin time o natur has gathered us a in for the hairvest of etairnity they that no like the safety were makin for them can gang their way to ither places where they 11 find no forts or stockades to trouble their een  im not critical at all jamie though to my notion a much better use for your timber plantation would be to turn it into sheds for cattle in the winter months i can see some good in that but none in this  bad luck to ye then misther sthroddle cried mike from the bottom of the trench where he was using a pounding instrument with the zeal of a paviourbad luck to the likes of ye say i misther strides if yeve no relish for a fortification in a time of war yeve only to shoulther yer knapsack and go out into the open counthry where yell have all to yer own satisfaction is it forthify the house will we that we will and not a hair of the missusss head nor of the young ladies heads nor of the masthers head though hes mighty bald as it is but not a hair of all their heads shall be harmed while jamie and mike and the bould ould serjeant here can have their way i wish i had the trench full of yer savages and a gineral funeral wed make of the vagabonds och theyre the divils imps i hear from all sides and no love do i owe them  and yet youre the bosom friend of nick whos anything but what i call a specimen of his people  is it nick ye re afther well nicks halfcivilized accorthin to yer yankee manners and hes no spicimen at all let him hear you call him by sich a name if ye want throuble  joel walked away muttering leaving the labourers in doubt whether he relished least the work he was now obliged to unite in furthering or mikes hit at his own peculiar people still the work proceeded and in one week from the day it was commenced the stockade was complete its gate excepted the entrance through the palisades was directly in front of that to the house and both passages still remained open one set of gates not being completed and the other not yet being hung  it was on a saturday evening when the last palisade was placed firmly in the ground and all the signs of the recent labour were removed in order to restore as much of the former beauty of the knoll as possible it had been a busy week so much so indeed as to prevent the major from holding any of that confidential intercourse with his mother and sisters in which it had been his habit to indulge in former visits the fatigues of the days sent everybody to their pillows early and the snatches of discourse which passed had been affectionate and pleasant rather than communicative now that the principal job was so near being finished however and the rubbish was cleared away the captain summoned the family to the lawn again to enjoy a delicious evening near the close of the winning month of may the season was early and the weather more bland than was usual even in that sheltered and genial valley for the first time that year mrs willoughby consented to order the teaequipage to be carried to a permanent table that had been placed under the shade of a fine elm in readiness for any f√™te champ√™tre of this simple character  come wilhelmina give us a cup of your fragrant hyson of which we have luckily abundance tax or no tax i should lose caste were it known how much american treason we have gulped down in this way but a little tea up here in the forest can do no mans conscience any great violence in the long run i suppose major willoughby his majestys forces do not disdain tea in these stirring times  far from it sir we deem it so loyal to drink it that it is said the port and sherry of the different messes at boston are getting to be much neglected i am an admirer of tea for itself however caring little about its collateral qualities farrelturning to his man who was aiding pliny the elder in arranging the tablewhen you are through here bring out the basket you will find on the toilet in my room  true bob observed the mother smilingthat basket has scarce been treated with civility not a syllable of thanks have i heard for all the fine things it contains  my mind has been occupied with care for your safety dear mother and that must be my excuse now however there is an appearance of security which gives one a breathingtime and my gratitude receives a sudden impulse as for you maud i regret to be compelled to say that you stand convicted of laziness not a single thing do i owe to your labours or recollection of me  is that possible exclaimed the captain who was pouring water into the teapot maud is the last person i should suspect of neglect of this nature i do assure you bob no one listens to news of your promotions and movements with more interest than maud  maud herself made no answer she bent her head aside in a secret consciousness that her sister might alone detect and form her own conclusions concerning the colour that she felt warming her cheeks but mauds own sensitive feelings attributed more to beulah than the sincere and simpleminded girl deserved so completely was she accustomed to regard robert and maud as brother and sister that even all which had passed produced no effect in unsettling her opinions or in giving her thoughts a new direction just at this moment farrel came back and placed the basket on the bench at the side of his master  now my dearest mother and you girlsthe major had begun to drop the use of the word sisters when addressing both the young ladiesnow my dearest mother and you girls i am about to give each her due in the first place i confess my own unworthiness and acknowledge that i do not deserve onehalf the kind attention i have received in these various presents after which we will descend to particulars  the major then exposed every article contained in the basket finding the words mother and beulah pinned on each but nowhere any indication that his younger sister had even borne him in mind his father looked surprised at this not to say a little grave and he waited with evident curiosity for the gifts of maud as one thing after another came up without any signs of her having recollected the absentee  this is odd truly observed the father seriously i hope bob you have done nothing to deserve this i should be sorry to have my little girl affronted  i assure you sir that i am altogether ignorant of any act and i can solemnly protest against any intention to give offence if guilty i now pray maud to pardon me  you have done nothing bobsaid nothing bobthought nothing to offend me cried maud eagerly  why then have you forgotten him darling when your mother and sister have done so much in the way of recollection asked the captain  forced gifts my dear father are no gifts i do not like to be compelled to make presents  this was uttered in a way to induce the major to throw all the articles back into the basket as if he wished to get rid of the subject without further comment owing to this precipitation the scarf was not seen fortunately for maud who was ready to burst into tears the service of the tea prevented any farther allusion to the matter  you have told me major observed captain willoughby that your old regiment has a new colonel but you have forgotten to mention his name i hope it is my old messmate tom wallingford who wrote me he had some such hopes last year  general wallingford has got a lightdragoon regimentgeneral meredith has my old corps he is now in this country at the head of one of gages brigades  it is a strong proof of the manner in which maudmaud willoughby as she was ever termedhad become identified with the family of the hutted knoll that with two exceptions not a person present thought of her when the name of this general meredith was mentioned though in truth he was the uncle of her late father the exceptions were the major and herself the former now never heard the name without thinking of his beautiful little playfellow and nominal sister while maud of late had become curious and even anxious on the subject of her natural relatives still a feeling akin to awe a sentiment that appeared as if it would be doing violence to a most solemn duty prevented her from making any allusion to her change of thought in the presence of those whom during childhood she had viewed only as her nearest relatives and who still continued so to regard her she would have given the world to ask bob a few questions concerning the kinsman he had mentioned but could not think of doing so before her mother whatever she might be induced to attempt with the young man when by himself  nick next came strolling along gazing at the stockade and drawing near the table with an indifference to persons and things that characterized his habits when close to the party he stopped keeping his eye on the recent works  you see nick i am about to turn soldier again in my old days observed the captain it is now many years since you and i have met within a line of palisades how do you like our work  what you make him for capin  so as to be secure against any redskins who may happen to long for our scalps  why want your scalp hatchet hasnt been dug up atween us bury him so deep cant find him in ten two six year  ay it has long been buried it is true but you red gentlemen have a trick of digging it up with great readiness when there is any occasion for it i suppose you know nick that there are troubles in the colonies  tell nick all about himanswered the indian evasivelyno read no heardont talk muchtalk most wid irishercant understand what he wantsay ting one way den say him anoder  mike is not very lucid of a certainty rejoined the captain laughing all the party joining in the merrimentbut he is a sterling good fellow and is always to be found in a time of need  poor riflenebber hitshoot one way look tother  he is no great shot i will admit but he is a famous fellow with a shillaleh has he given you any of the news  all he say newsmuch news ten time as one time capin lend nick a quarter dollar yesterday  i did lend you a quarter certainly nick and i supposed it had gone to the miller for rum before this what am i to understand by your holding it out in this mannerthat you mean to repay me  sartaingood quarterjust like him capin lent nick like as one pea nick man of honour keep his word  this does look more like it than common nick the money was to be returned today but i did not expect to see it so many previous contracts of that nature having been vacated as the lawyers call it  tuscarora chief alway gentleman what he say he do good quarter dollar dat capin  it is unexceptionable old acquaintance ill not disdain receiving it as it may serve for a future loan  no need byembytake him nowcapin lend nick dollar pay him to morrow  the captain protested against the sequitur that the indian evidently wished to establish declining though in a goodnatured manner to lend the larger sum nick was disappointed and walked sullenly away moving nearer to the stockade with the air of an offended man  that is an extraordinary fellow sir observed the majori really wonder you tolerate him so much about the hut it might be a good idea to banish him now that the war has broken out  which would be a thing more easily said than done a drop of water might as readily be banished from that stream as an indian from any part of the forest he may choose to visit you brought him here yourself bob and should not blame us for tolerating his presence  i brought him sir because i found he recognised me even in this dress and it was wise to make a friend of him then i wanted a guide and i was well assured he knew the way if any man did he is a surly scoundrel however and appears to have changed his character since i was a boy  if there be any change bob it is in yourself nick has been nick these thirty years or as long as i have known him rascal he is or his tribe would not have cast him out indian justice is stern but it is natural justice no man is ever put to the ban among the red men until they are satisfied he is not fit to enjoy savage rights in garrison we always looked upon nick as a clever knave and treated him accordingly when one is on his guard against such a fellow he can do little harm and this tuscarora has a salutary dread of me which keeps him in tolerable order during his visits to the hut the principal mischief he does here is to get mike and jamie deeper in the santa cruz than i could wish but the miller has his orders to sell no more rum  i hardly think you do nick justice willoughby observed the right judging and gentle wife he has some good qualities but you soldiers always apply martiallaw to the weaknesses of your fellow creatures  and you tenderhearted women my dear wilhelmina think everybody as good as yourselves  remember hugh when your son there had the cankerrash how actively and readily the tuscarora went into the forest to look for the goldthread that even the doctors admitted cured him it was difficult to find robert but nick remembered a spot where he had seen it fifty miles off and without a request even from us he travelled that distance to procure it  yes this is truereturned the captain thoughtfullythough i question if the cure was owing to the goldthread as you call it wilhelmina every man has some good quality or other and i much fear some bad ones alsobut here is the fellow coming back and i do not like to let him think himself of sufficient consequence to be the subject of our remarks  very true sirit adds excessively to the trouble of such fellows to let them fancy themselves of importance  nick now came slowly back after having examined the recent changes to his satisfaction he stood a moment in silence near the table and then assuming an air of more dignity than common he addressed the captain  nick ole chief he said been at council fire often as capin cant tell all he know want to hear about new war  why nick it is a family quarrel this time the french have nothing to do with it  yengeese fight yengeeseum  i am afraid it will so turn out do not the tuscaroras sometimes dig up the hatchet against the tuscaroras  tuscarora man kill tuscarora mangoodhe quarrel and kill he enemy but tuscarora warrior nebber take scalp of tuscarora squaw and pappoose what you tink he do dat for red man no hog to eat pork  it must be admitted nick you are a very literal logiciandog wont eat dog is our english saying still the yankee will fight the yengeese it would seem in a word the great father in england has raised the hatchet against his american children  how you like him capinum which go on straight path which go on crooked how you like him  i like it little nick and wish with all my heart the quarrel had not taken place  mean to put on regimentalshah mean to be capin agin follow drum and fife like ole time  i rather think not old comrade after sixty one likes peace better than war and i intend to stay at home  what for den build fort why you put fence round a house like pound for sheep  because i intend to stay there the stockade will be good to keep off any or every enemy who may take it into their heads to come against us you have known me defend a worse position than this  he got no gate muttered nickwhat he good for widout gate yengeese yankees red man french man walk in just as he please no good to leave such squaw wid a door wide open  thank you nick cried mrs willoughby i knew you were my friend and have not forgotten the goldthread  he very good answered the indian with an important look pappoose get well like noting he amost die today tomorrow he run about and play nick do him too cure him wid goldthread  oh you are or were quite a physician at one time nick i remember when you had the smallpox yourself  the indian turned with the quickness of lightning to mrs willoughby whom he startled with his energy as he demanded  you remember dat mrs capin who gib himwho cure himum  upon my word nick you almost frighten me i fear i gave you the disease but it was for your own good it was done you were inoculated by myself when the soldiers were dying around us because they had never had that care taken of them all i inoculated lived yourself among the number  the startling expression passed away from the fierce countenance of the savage leaving in its place another so kind and amicable as to prove he not only was aware of the benefit he had received but that he was deeply grateful for it he drew near to mrs willoughby took her still white and soft hand in his own sinewy and dark fingers then dropped the blanket that he had thrown carelessly across his body from a shoulder and laid it on a mark left by the disease by way of pointing to her good work he smiled as this was done  ole mark he said nodding his headsign we good friendhe nebber go away while nick live  this touched the captains heart and he tossed a dollar towards the indian who suffered it however to lie at his feet unnoticed turning to the stockade he pointed significantly at the open gateways  great danger go trough little ole he said sententiously walking away as he concluded why you leave big ole open  we must get those gates hung next week said the captain positively and yet it is almost absurd to apprehend anything serious in this remote settlement and that at so early a period in the war  nothing further passed on the lawn worthy to be recorded the sun set and the family withdrew into the house as usual to trust to the overseeing care of divine providence throughout a night passed in a wilderness by common consent the discourse turned upon things noway connected with the civil war or its expected results until the party was about to separate for the night when the major found himself alone with his sisters in his own little parlour dressingroom or study whatever the room adjoining his chamber could properly be called  you will not leave us soon robert said beulah taking her brothers hand with confiding affection i hardly think my father young and active enough or rather alarmed enough to live in times like these  he is a soldier beulah and a good one so good that his son can teach him nothing i wish i could say that he is as good a subject i fear he leans to the side of the colonies  heaven be praised exclaimed beulahoh that his son would incline in the same direction  nay beulah rejoined maud reproachfully you speak without reflection mamma bitterly regrets that papa sees things in the light he does she thinks the parliament right and the colonies wrong  what a thing is a civil war ejaculated the majorhere is husband divided against wifeson against fatherbrother against sister i could almost wish i were dead ere i had lived to see this  nay robert it is not so bad as that either added maud my mother will never oppose my fathers will or judgment good wives you know never do that she will only pray that he may decide right and in a way that his children will never have cause to regret as for me i count for nothing of course  and beulah maud is she nothing too here will beulah be praying for her brothers defeat throughout this war it has been some presentiment of this difference of opinion that has probably induced you to forget me while beulah and my mother were passing so many hours to fill that basket  perhaps you do maud injustice robert said beulah smiling i think i can say none loves you better than our dear sisteror no one has thought of you more in your absence  why then does the basket contain no proof of this remembrancenot even a chain of haira purse or a ringnothing in short to show that i have not been forgotten when away  even if this be so said maud with spirit in what am i worse than yourself what proof is there that you have remembered us  this answered the major laying before his sisters two small packages each marked with the name of its proper owner my mother has hers too and my father has not been forgotten  beulahs exclamations proved how much she was gratified with her presents principally trinkets and jewelry suited to her years and station first kissing the major she declared her mother must see what she had received before she retired for the night and hurried from the room that maud was not less pleased was apparent by her glowing cheeks and tearful eyes though for a wonder she was far more restrained in the expression of her feelings after examining the different articles with pleasure for a minute or two she went with a quick impetuous movement to the basket tumbled all its contents on the table until she reached the scarf which she tossed towards the major saying with a faint laugh  there unbelieverheathenis that nothing was that made in a minute think you  this cried the major opening the beautiful glossy fabric in surprise is not this one of my fathers old sashes to which i have fallen heir in the order of nature  maud dropped her trinkets and seizing two corners of the sash she opened it in a way to exhibit its freshness and beauty  is this old or worn she asked reproachfully your father never even saw it bob it has not yet been around the waist of man  it is not possiblethis would be the work of monthsis so beautifulyou cannot have purchased it  maud appeared distressed at his doubts opening the folds still wider she raised the centre of the silk to the light pointed to certain letters that had been wrought into the fabric so ingeniously as to escape ordinary observation and yet so plainly as to be distinctly legible when the attention was once drawn to them the major took the sash into his own hands altogether held it opened before the candles and read the words maud meredith aloud dropping the sash he turned to seek the face of the donor but she had fled the room he followed her footsteps and entered the library just as she was about to escape from it by a different door  i am offended at your incredulity said maud making an effort to laugh away the scene and will not remain to hear lame excuses your new regiment can have no nature in it or brothers would not treat sisters thus  maud meredith is not my sister he said earnestly though maud willoughby may be why is the name meredith  as a retort to one of your own allusionsdid you not call me miss meredith one day when i last saw you in albany  ay but that was in jest my dearest maud it was not a deliberate thing like the name on that sash  oh jokes may be premeditated as well as murder and many a one is murdered you know mine is a prolonged jest  tell me does my motherdoes beulah know who made this sash  how else could it have been made bob do you think i went into the woods and worked by myself like some romantic damsel who had an unmeaning secret to keep against the curious eyes of persecuting friends  i know not what i thoughtscarce know what i think now but my mother does she know of this name  maud blushed to the eyes but the habit and the love of truth were so strong in her that she shook her head in the negative  nor beulahshe i am certain would not have permitted meredith to appear where willoughby should have been  nor beulah either major willoughby pronouncing the name with an affectation of reverence the honour of the willoughbys is thus preserved from every taint and all the blame must fall on poor maud meredith  you dislike the name of willoughby then and intend to drop it in futurei have remarked that you sign yourself only maud in your last lettersnever before however did i suspect the reason  who wishes to live for ever an impostor it is not my legal name and i shall soon be called on to perform legal acts remember mr robert willoughby i am twenty when it comes to pounds shillings and pence i must not forge a little habit is necessary to teach me the use of my own bon√¢ fide signature  but oursthe name is not hateful to youyou do not throw it aside seriously for ever  yours what the honoured name of my dear dearest fatherof my motherof beulahof yourself bob  maud did not remain to terminate her speech bursting into tears she vanished      chapter viii    the village towertis joy to mei cry the lord is here   the village bells they fill the soul with ecstasy sincere   and thus i sing the light hath shined to lands in darkness hurled   their sound is now in all the earth their words throughout the world    coxe  another night past in peace within the settlement of the hutted knoll the following morning was the sabbath and it came forth balmy genial and mild worthy of the great festival of the christian world on the subject of religion captain willoughby was a little of a martinet understanding by liberty of conscience the right of improving by the instruction of those ministers who belonged to the church of england several of his labourers had left him because he refused to allow of any other ministrations on his estate his doctrine being that every man had a right to do as he pleased in such matters and as he did not choose to allow of schism within the sphere of his own influence if others desired to be schismatics they were at liberty to go elsewhere in order to indulge their tastes joel strides and jamie allen were both disaffected to this sort of orthodoxy and they had frequent private discussions on its propriety the former in his usual wily and jesuitical mode of sneering and insinuating and the latter respectfully as related to his master but earnestly as it concerned his conscience others too were dissentients but with less repining though occasionally they would stay away from mr woods services mike alone took an open and manly stand in the matter and he a little outheroded herod or in other words he exceeded the captain himself in strictness of construction on the very morning we have just described he was present at a discussion between the yankee overseer and the scotch mason in which these two dissenters the first a congregationalist and the last a seceder were complaining of the hardships of a ten years abstinence during which no spiritual provender had been fed out to them from a proper source the irishman broke out upon the complainants in a way that will at once let the reader into the secret of the county leitrimmans principles if he has any desire to know them  bad luck to all sorts of religion but the right one cried mike in a most tolerant spirit who dye think will be wishful of hearing mass and praching that comes from any of your heretick parsons yere as dape in the mire yerselves as mr woods is in the woods and no one to lade ye out of either but an evil spirit that would rather see all mankind briling in agony than dancing at a fair  go to your confessional mike returned joel with a sneerits a month or more sin you seen it and the priest will think you have forgotten him and go away offended  och its such a praist as the likes of yees has no nade of throubling yer conscience is aisy misther straddle so that yer belly is filled and yer wages is paid bad luck o sich religion  the allusion of joel related to a practice of michaels that is deserving of notice it seems that the poor fellow excluded by his insulated position from any communication with a priest of his own church was in the habit of resorting to a particular rock in the forest where he would kneel and acknowledge his sins very much as he would have done had the rock been a confessional containing one authorized to grant him absolution accident revealed the secret and from that time michaels devotion was a standing jest among the dissenters of the valley the county leitrimman was certainly a little too much addicted to santa cruz and he was accused of always visiting his romantic chapel after a debauch of course he was but little pleased with joels remark on the present occasion and being like a modern newspaper somewhat more vituperative than logical he broke out as related  jamie continued joel too much accustomed to mikes violence to heed it it does seem to me a hardship to be obliged to frequent a church of which a mans conscience cant approve mr woods though a native colonist is an old england parson and he has so many popish ways about him that i am under considerable concern of mind concern of itself was not sufficiently emphatic for one of joels sensitive feelingsi am under considerable concern of mind about the children they sit under no other preaching and though lyddy and i do all we can to gainsay the sermons as soon as meetin is out some of it will stick you may worry the best christian into idolatry and unbelief by parseverance and falsehood now that things look so serious too in the colonies we ought to be most careful  jamie did not clearly understand the application of the present state of the colonies nor had he quite made up his mind touching the merits of the quarrel between parliament and the americans as between the stuarts and the house of hanover he was for the former and that mainly because he thought them scotch and it was surely a good thing for a scotchman to govern england but as between the old countries and the new he was rather inclined to think the rights of the first ought to predominate there being something opposed to natural order agreeably to his notions in permitting the reverse of this doctrine to prevail as for presbyterianism however even in the mitigated form of new england church government he deemed it to be so much better than episcopacy that he would have taken up arms old as he was for the party that it could be made to appear was fighting to uphold the last we have no wish to mislead the reader neither of the persons mentioned mike included actually knew anything of the points in dispute between the different sects or churches mentioned but only fancied themselves in possession of the doctrines traditions and authorities connected with the subject these fancies however served to keep alive a discussion that soon had many listeners and never before since his first ministration in the valley did mr woods meet as disaffected a congregation as on this day  the church of the hutted knoll or as the clergyman more modestly termed it the chapel stood in the centre of the meadows on a very low swell of their surface where a bit of solid dry ground had been discovered fit for such a purpose the principal object had been to make it central though some attention had been paid also to the picturesque it was well shaded with young elms just then opening into leaf and about a dozen graves principally of very young children were memorials of the mortality of the settlement the building was of stone the work of jamie allens own hands but small square with a pointed roof and totally without tower or belfry the interior was of unpainted cherry and through a want of skill in the mechanics had a cold and raw look little suited to the objects of the structure still the small altar the desk and the pulpit and the large square curtained pew of the captain the only one the house contained were all well ornamented with hangings or cloth and gave the place somewhat of an air of clerical comfort and propriety the rest of the congregation sat on benches with kneelingboards before them the walls were plastered and a proof that parsimony had no connection with the simple character of the building and a thing almost as unusual in america at that period as it is today in parts of italy the chapel was entirely finished  it has been said that the morning of the particular sabbath at which we have now arrived was mild and balmy the sun of the fortythird degree of latitude poured out its genial rays upon the valley gilding the tender leaves of the surrounding forest with such touches of light as are best known to the painters of italy the fineness of the weather brought nearly all the working people of the settlement to the chapel quite an hour before the ringing of its little bell enabling the men to compare opinions afresh on the subject of the political troubles of the times and the women to gossip about their children  on all such occasions joel was a principal spokesman nature having created him for a demagogue in a small way an office for which education had in no degree unfitted him as had been usual with him of late he turned the discourse on the importance of having correct information of what was going on in the inhabited parts of the country and of the expediency of sending some trustworthy person on such an errand he had frequently intimated his own readiness to go if his neighbours wished it  were all in the dark here he remarked and might stay so to the end of time without some one to be relied on to tell us the news major willoughby is a fine manjoel meant morally not physicallybut hes a kings officer and natrally feels inclined to make the best of things for the riglars the captain too was once a soldier himself and his feelins turn as it might be unavidably to the side he has been most used to we are like people on a desart island out here in the wildernessand if ships wont arrive to tell us how matters come on we must send one out to larn it for us im the last man at the damso the oi polloi called the valleyto say anything hard of either the captain or his son but one is english born and the other is english bred and each will make a difference in a mans feelins  to this proposition the miller in particular assented and for the twentieth time he made some suggestion about the propriety of joels going himself in order to ascertain how the land lay  you can be back by hoeing he added and have plenty of time to go as far as boston should you wish to  now while the great events were in progress which led to the subversion of british power in america an undercurrent of feeling if not of incidents was running in this valley which threatened to wash away the foundations of the captains authority joel and the miller if not downright conspirators had hopes calculations and even projects of their own that never would have originated with men of the same class in another state of society or it might almost be said in another part of the world the sagacity of the overseer had long enabled him to foresee that the issue of the present troubles would be insurrection and a sort of instinct which some men possess for the strongest side had pointed out to him the importance of being a patriot the captain he little doubted would take part with the crown and then no one knew what might be the consequences it is not probable that joels instinct for the strongest side predicted the precise confiscations that subsequently ensued some of which had all the grasping lawlessness of a gross abuse of power but he could easily foresee that if the owner of the estate should be driven off the property and its proceeds probably for a series of years would be very apt to fall under his own control and management many a patriot has been made by anticipations less brilliant than these and as joel and the miller talked the matter over between them they had calculated all the possible emolument of fattening beeves and packing pork for hostile armies or isolated frontier posts with a strong gusto for the occupation should open war but fairly commence and could the captain only be induced to abandon the knoll and take refuge within a british camp everything might be made to go smoothly until settling day should follow a peace at that moment non est inventus would be a sufficient answer to a demand for any balance  they tell me said joel in an aside to the miller that law is as good as done with in the bay colony already and you know if the law has run out there it will quickly come to an end here york never had much character for law  thats true joel then you know the captain himself is the only magistrate hereabout and when he is away we shall have to be governed by a committee of safety or something of that natur  a committee of safety will be the thing  what is a committee of safety joel demanded the miller who had made far less progress in the arts of the demagogue than his friend and who in fact had much less native fitness for the vocation i have heern tell of them regulations but do not rightly understand em ater all  you know what a committee is asked joel glancing inquiringly at his friend  i spose i doit means mens takin on themselves the trouble and care of public business  thats itnow a committee of safety means a few of us for instance having the charge of the affairs of this settlement in order to see that no harm shall come to anything especially to the people  it would be a good thing to have one here the carpenter and you and i might be members joel  well talk about it another time the corn is just planted you know and it has got to be hoed twice and topped before it can be gathered let us wait and see how things come on at boston  while this incipient plot was thus slowly coming to a head and the congregation was gradually collecting at the chapel a very different scene was enacting in the hut breakfast was no sooner through than mrs willoughby retired to her own sittingroom whither her son was shortly summoned to join her expecting some of the inquiries which maternal affection might prompt the major proceeded to the place named with alacrity but on entering the room to his great surprise he found maud with his mother the latter seemed grave and concerned while the former was not entirely free from alarm the young man glanced inquiringly at the young lady and he fancied he saw tears struggling to break out of her eyes  come hither robertsaid mrs willoughby pointing to a chair at her sidewith a gravity that struck her son as unusuali have brought you here to listen to one of the oldfashioned lectures of which you got so many when a boy  your advice my dear motheror even your reproofswould be listened to with far more reverence and respect now than i fear they were then returned the major seating himself by the side of mrs willoughby and taking one of her hands affectionately in both his own it is only in afterlife that we learn to appreciate the tenderness and care of such a parent as you have been though what i have done lately to bring me in danger of the guardhouse i cannot imagine surely you cannot blame me for adhering to the crown at a moment like this  i shall not interfere with your conscience in this matter robert and my own feelings american as i am by birth and family rather incline me to think as you think i have wished to see you my son on a different business  do not keep me in suspense mother i feel like a prisoner who is waiting to hear his charges read what have i done  nay it is rather for you to tell me what you have done you cannot have forgotten robert how very anxious i have been to awaken and keep alive family affection among my children how very important both your father and i have always deemed it and how strongly we have endeavoured to impress this importance on all your minds the tie of family and the love it ought to produce is one of the sweetest of all our earthly duties perhaps we old people see its value more than you young but to us the weakening of it seems like a disaster only a little less to be deplored than death  dearestdearest mother what can youwhat do you meanwhat can iwhat can maud have to do with this  do not your consciences tell you both has there not been some misunderstandingperhaps a quarrelcertainly a coldness between you a mother has a quick and a jealous eye and i have seen for some time that there is not the old confidence the free natural manner in either of you that there used to be and which always gave your father and me so much genuine happiness speak then and let me make peace between you  robert willoughby would not have looked at maud at that moment to have been given a regiment as for maud herself she was utterly incapable of raising her eyes from the floor the former coloured to the temples a proof of consciousness his mother fancied while the latters face resembled ivory as much as flesh and blood  if you think robert continued mrs willoughby that maud has forgotten you or shown pique for any little former misunderstanding during your last absence you do her injustice no one has done as much for you in the way of memorial that beautiful sash being all her own work and made of materials purchased with her own pocketmoney maud loves you truly too for whatever may be the airs she gives herself while you are together when absent no one seems to care more for your wishes and happiness than that very wilful and capricious girl  mothermother murmured maud burying her face in both her hands  mrs willoughby was woman in all her feelings habits and nature no one would have been more keenly alive to the peculiar sensibilities of her sex under ordinary circumstances than herself but she was now acting and thinking altogether in her character of a mother and so long and intimately had she regarded the two beings before her in that common and sacred light that it would have been like the dawn of a new existence for her just then to look upon them as not really akin to each other  i shall not nor can i treat either of you as a child she continued and must therefore appeal only to your own good sense to make a peace i know it can be nothing serious but it is painful to me to see even an affected coldness among my children think maud that we are on the point of a war and how bitterly you would regret it should any accident befall your brother and your memory not be able to recall the time passed among us in his last visit with entire satisfaction  the mothers voice trembled but tears no longer struggled about the eyelids of maud her face was pale as death and it seemed as if every ordinary fountain of sorrow were dried up  dear bob this is too much she said eagerly though in husky tones here is my handnay here are both mother must not think this cruel charge iscan be true  the major arose approached his sister and impressed a kiss on her cold cheek mrs willoughby smiled at these tokens of amity and the conversation continued in a less earnest manner  this is right my children said the singlehearted mrs willoughby whose sensitive maternal love saw nothing but the dreaded consequences of weakened domestic affections and i shall be all the happier for having witnessed it young soldiers maud who are sent early from their homes have too many inducements to forget them and those they contain and we women are so dependent on the love of our male friends that it is wisdom in us to keep alive all the earlier ties as long and as much as possible  i am sure dearest mother murmured maud though in a voice that was scarcely audible i shall be the last to wish to weaken this family tie no one can feel a warmermore propera more sisterly affection for robert than i dohe was always so kind to me when a childand so ready to assist meand so manlyand so everything that he ought to beit is surprising you should have fancied there was any coldness between us  major willoughby even bent forward to listen so intense was his curiosity to hear what maud said a circumstance which had she seen it would probably have closed her lips but her eyes were riveted on the floor her cheeks were bloodless and her voice so low that nothing but the breathless stillness he observed would have allowed the young man to hear it where he sat  you forget motherrejoined the major satisfied that the last murmur had died on his earsthat maud will probably be transplanted into another family one of these days where we who know her so well and have reason to love her so much can only foresee that she will form new and even stronger ties than any that accident may have formed for her here  neverneverexclaimed maud ferventlyi can never love any as well as i love those who are in this house  the relief she wanted stopped her voice and bursting into tears she threwherself into mrs willoughbys arms and sobbed like a child the mother now motioned to her son to quit the room while she remained herself to soothe the weeping girl as she so often had done before when overcome by her infantile or youthful griefs throughout this interview habit and singleheartedness so exercised their influence that the excellent matron did not in the most remote manner recollect that her son and maud were not natural relatives accustomed herself to see the latter every day and to think of her as she had from the moment when she was placed in her arms an infant of a few weeks old the effect that separation might produce on others never presented itself to her mind major willoughby a boy of eight when maud was received in the family had known from the first her precise position and it was perhaps morally impossible that he should not recall the circumstance in their subsequent intercourse more especially as school college and the army had given him so much leisure to reflect on such things apart from the influence of family habits while it was to be expected that a consequence of his own peculiar mode of thinking on this subject would be to produce something like a sympathetic sentiment in the bosom of maud until within the last few years however she had been so much of a child herself and had been treated so much like a child by the young soldier that it was only through a change in him that was perceptible only to herself and which occurred when he first met her grown into womanhood that she alone admitted any feelings that were not strictly to be referred to sisterly regard all this nevertheless was a profound mystery to every member of the family but the two who were its subjects no other thoughts than the simplest and most obvious ever suggesting themselves to the minds of the others  in half an hour mrs willoughby had quieted all mauds present troubles and the whole family left the house to repair to the chapel michael though he had no great reverence for mr woods ministrations had constituted himself sexton an office which had devolved on him in consequence of his skill with the spade once initiated into one branch of this duty he had insisted on performing all the others and it was sometimes a curious spectacle to see the honest fellow busy about the interior of the building during service literally stopping one of his ears with a thumb with a view while he acquitted himself of what he conceived to be temporal obligations to exclude as much heresy as possible one of his rules was to refuse to commence tolling the bell until he saw mrs willoughby and her daughter within a reasonable distance of the place of worship a rule that had brought about more than one lively discussion between himself and the levellingminded if not heavenlyminded joel strides on the present occasion this simple process did not pass altogether without a dispute  come mike its halfpast ten the people have been waiting about the meetin us some time you should open the doors and toll the bell people cant wait for ever for anybody not even for your church  then let em just go home agin and come when theyre called because the ould women and the young women and the childer and the likes o them wishes to scandalize their fellow cratures christians i will not call em let em mate in the mill or the schoolhouse and not come forenent a church on sich a business as that is it toll the bell will i afore the missus is in sightnonot for a whole gineration of ye joel and every one o them too a much likelier man than ye bees yerself  religion is no respecter of personsreturned the philosophical joel them that likes masters and mistresses may have them for all me but it riles me to meet with meanness  it does cried mike looking up at his companion with a very startling expression of wonder if that be true ye must be in a mighty throubled state most of the livelong day ye must  i tell you michael ohearn religion is no respecter of persons the lord cares jist as much for me as he does for captain willoughby or his wife or his son or his darters or anything that is his  divil burn me now joel if i believe that again cried mike in his dogmatic manner them that understands knows the difference between mankind and im sure it can be no great sacret to the lord when it is so well known to a poor fellow like myself theres a plenthy of fellowcratures that has a mighty good notion of their own excellence but when it comes to rason and thruth its no very great figure ye all make in proving what ye say this chapel is the masters if chapel the heretical box can be called and yonder bell was bought wid his money and the rope is his and the hands that mane to pull it is his and so theres little use in talking agin rocks and agin minds thats made up even harder than rocks and to spare  this settled the matter the bell was not tolled until mrs willoughby and her daughters had got fairly through the still unprotected gateway of the stockade although the recent discussion of political questions had so far substituted discontent for subordination in the settlement that more than half of those who were of new england descent had openly expressed their dissatisfaction at the delay mike however was as unmoved as the little chapel itself refusing to open the door until the proper moment had arrived according to his own notion of the fitness of things he then proceeded to the elm against which the little bell was hung and commenced tolling it with as much seriousness as if the conveyer of sounds had been duly consecrated  when the family from the hut entered the chapel all the rest of the congregation were in their customary seats this arrival however added materially to the audience great smash and little smash the two plinys and some five or six coloured children between the ages of six and twelve following in the train of their master for the blacks a small gallery had been built where they could sit apart a proscribed if not a persecuted race little did the plinys or the smashes notwithstanding think of this habit had rendered their situation more than tolerable for it had created notions and usages that would have rendered them uncomfortable in closer contact with the whites in that day the two colours never ate together by any accident the eastern castes being scarcely more rigid in the observance of their rules than the people of america were on this great point the men who would toil together joke together and pass their days in familiar intercourse would not sit down at the same board there seemed to be a sort of contamination according to the opinions of one of these castes in breaking bread with the other this prejudice often gave rise to singular scenes more especially in the households of those who habitually laboured in company with their slaves in such families it not unfrequently happened that a black led the councils of the farm he might be seen seated by the fire uttering his opinions dogmatically reasoning warmly against his own master and dealing out his wisdom ex cathedra even while he waited with patient humility when he might approach and satisfy his hunger after all of the other colour had quitted the table  mr woods was not fortunate in the selection of his subject on the occasion of which we are writing there had been so much personal activity and so much political discussion during the past week as to prevent him from writing a new sermon and of course he was compelled to fail back on the other end of the barrel the recent arguments inclined him to maintain his own opinions and he chose a discourse that he had delivered to the garrison of which he had last been chaplain to this choice he had been enticed by the text which was render unto c√¶sar the things that are c√¶sars a mandate that would be far more palatable to an audience composed of royal troops than to one which had become a good deal disaffected by the arts and arguments of joel strides and the miller still as the sermon contained a proper amount of theological truisms and had a sufficiency of general orthodoxy to cover a portion of its political bearing it gave far more dissatisfaction to a few of the knowing than to the multitude to own the truth the worthy priest was so much addicted to continuing his regimental and garrison course of religious instruction that his ordinary listeners would scarcely observe this tendency to loyalty though it was far different with those who were eagerly looking for causes of suspicion and denunciation in the higher quarters  well said joel as he and the miller followed by their respective families proceeded towards the mill where the household of the strides were to pass the remainder of the day well this is a bold sermon for a minister to preach in times like these i kind o guess if mr woods was down in the bay render unto c√¶sar the things that are c√¶sars wouldnt be doctrine to be so quietly received by every congregation whats your notion about that miss strides  miss strides thought exactly as her husband thought and the miller and his wife were not long in chiming in with her accordingly the sermon furnished material for conversation throughout the remainder of the day at the mill and divers conclusions were drawn from it that were ominous to the preachers future comfort and security  nor did the wellmeaning parson entirely escape comment in the higher quarters  i wish woods you had made choice of some other subject observed the captain as he and his friend walked the lawn together in waiting for a summons to dinner  in times like these one cannot be too careful of the political notions he throws out and to own the truth to you i am more than half inclined to think that c√¶sar is exercising quite as much authority in these colonies as justly falls to his share  why my dear captain you have heard this very sermon three or four times already and you have more than once mentioned it with commendation  ay but that was in garrison where one is obliged to teach subordination i remember the sermon quite well and a very good one it was twenty years since when you first preached it but  i apprehend captain willoughby that tempora mutantur et nos mutamus in illis that the mandates and maxims of the saviour are far beyond the mutations and erring passions of mortality his sayings are intended for all times  certainly as respects their general principles and governing truths but no text is to be interpreted without some reference to circumstances all i mean is that the preaching which might be very suitable to a battalion of his majestys fortieth might be very unsuitable for the labourers of the hutted knoll more especially so soon after what i find is called the battle of lexington  the summons to dinner cut short the discourse and probably prevented a long warm but friendly argument  that afternoon and evening captain willoughby and his son had a private and confidential discourse the former advised the major to rejoin his regiment without delay unless he were prepared to throw up his commission and take sides with the colonists altogether to this the young soldier would not listen returning to the charge in the hope of rekindling the dormant flame of his fathers loyalty  the reader is not to suppose that captain willoughbys own mind was absolutely made up to fly into open rebellion far from it he had his doubts and misgivings on the subjects of both principles and prudence but he inclined strongly to the equity of the demands of the americans independence or separation if thought of at all in 1775 entered into the projects of but very few the warmest wish of the most ardent of the whigs of the colonies being directed toward compromise and a distinct recognition of their political franchises the events that followed so thickly were merely the consequences of causes which once set in motion soon attained an impetus that defied ordinary human control it was doubtless one of the leading incidents of the great and mysterious scheme of divine providence for the government of the future destinies of man that political separation should commence in this hemisphere at that particular juncture to be carried out ere the end of a century to its final and natural conclusion  but the present interview was less to debate the merits of any disputed question than to consult on the means of future intercourse and to determine on what was best to be done at the present moment after discussing the matter pro and con it was decided that the major should quit the knoll the next day and return to boston avoiding albany and those points of the country in which he would be most exposed to detection so many persons were joining the american forces that were collecting about the besieged town that his journeying on the proper road would excite no suspicion and once in the american camp nothing would be easier than to find his way into the peninsula all this young willoughby felt no difficulty in being able to accomplish provided he could get into the settlements without being followed by information of his real character the period of spies and of the severe exercise of martiallaw was not yet reached and all that was apprehended was detention of the last however there was great danger positive certainty indeed in the event of discovery and major willoughby had gleaned enough during his visit to feel some apprehensions of being betrayed he regretted having brought his servant with him for the man was a european and by his dulness and speech might easily get them both into difficulties so serious indeed was this last danger deemed by the father that he insisted on roberts starting without the man leaving the last to follow on the first suitable occasion  as soon as this point was settled there arose the question of the proper guide although he distrusted the tuscarora captain willoughby after much reflection came to the opinion that it would be safer to make an ally of him than to give him an opportunity of being employed by the other side nick was sent for and questioned he promised to take the major to the hudson at a point between lunenburg and kinderhook where he would be likely to cross the river without awakening suspicion his own reward to depend on his coming back to the hutted knoll with a letter from the major authorizing the father to pay him for his services this plan it was conceived would keep nick true to his faith for the time being at least  many other points were discussed between the father and son the latter promising if anything of importance occurred to find the means of communicating it to his friends at the knoll while parrel was to follow his master at the end of six weeks or two months with letters from the family many of the captains old armyfriends were now in situations of authority and command and he sent to them messages of prudence and admonitions to be moderate in their views which subsequent events proved were little regarded to general gage he even wrote using the precaution not to sign the letter though its sentiments were so much in favour of the colonies that had it been intercepted it is most probable the americans would have forwarded the missive to its direction  these matters arranged the father and son parted for the night some time after the houseclock had struck the hour of twelve      chapter ix    though old in cunning as in years   he is so small that like a child   in face and form the god appears   and sportive like a boy and wild   lightly he moves from place to place   in none at rest in none content   delighted some new toy to chase   on childish purpose ever bent   beware to childhoods spirits gay   is added more than childhoods power   and you perchance may rue the hour   that saw you join his seeming play    griffen  the intention of the major to quit the knoll that day was announced to the family at breakfast on the following morning his mother and beulah heard this intelligence with a natural and affectionate concern that they had no scruples in avowing but maud seemed to have so schooled her feelings that the grief she really felt was under a prudent control to her it appeared as if her secret were constantly on the point of exposure and she believed that would cause her instant death to survive its shame was impossible in her eyes and all the energies of her nature were aroused with the determination of burying her weakness in her own bosom she had been so near revealing it to beulah that even now she trembled as she thought of the precipice over which she had been impending strengthening her resolution by the recollection of the danger she had run  as a matter of necessary caution the intended movements of the young man were kept a profound secret from all in the settlement nick had disappeared in the course of the night carrying with him the majors pack having repaired to a designated point on the stream where he was to be joined by his fellowtraveller at an hour named there were several forestpaths which led to the larger settlements that usually travelled was in the direction of old fort stanwix first proceeding north and then taking a southeastern direction along the shores of the mohawk this was the route by which the major had come another struck the otsego and joined the mohawk at the point more than once mentioned in our opening chapters as these were the two ordinary pathsif paths they could be called where few or no traces of footsteps were visibleit was more than probable any plan to arrest the traveller would be laid in reference to their courses the major had consequently resolved to avoid them both and to strike boldly into the mountains until he should reach the susquehanna cross that stream on its flood wood and finding one of its tributaries that flowed in from the eastward by following its banks to the high land which divides the waters of the mohawk from this latter river place himself on a route that would obliquely traverse the watercourses which in this quarter of the country have all a general north or south direction avoiding schenectady and albany he might incline towards the old establishments of the descendants of the emigrants from the palatinate on the schoharie and reach the hudson at a point deemed safe for his purposes through some of the passes of the mountains in their vicinity he was to travel in the character of a landowner who had been visiting his patent and his father supplied him with a map and an old fieldbook which would serve to corroborate his assumed character in the event of suspicion or arrest not much danger was apprehended however the quarrel being yet too recent to admit of the organization and distrust that subsequently produced so much vigilance and activity  you will contrive to let us hear of your safe arrival in boston bob observed the father as he sat stirring his tea in a thoughtful wayi hope to god the matter will go no farther and that our apprehensions after all have given this dark appearance to what has already happened  ah my dear father you little know the state of the country through which i have so lately travelled answered the major shaking his head an alarm of fire in an american town would scarce create more movement and not so much excitement the colonies are alive particularly those of new england and a civil war is inevitable though i trust the power of england will render it short  then robert do not trust yourself among the people of new england cried the anxious mother go rather to new york where we have so many friends and so much influence it will be far easier to reach new york than to reach boston  that may be true mother but it will scarcely be as creditable my regiment is in boston and its enemies are before boston an old soldier like captain willoughby will tell you that the major is a very necessary officer to a corps nonomy best course is to fall into the current of adventurers who are pushing towards boston and appear like one of their number until i can get an opportunity of stealing away from them and join my own people  have a care bob that you do not commit a military crime perhaps these provincial officers may take it into their heads to treat you as a spy should you fall into their hands  little fear of that sir at present it is a sort of colonial scramble for what they fancy liberty that they will fight in their zeal i know for i have seen it but matters have not at all gone as far as you appear to apprehend i question if they would even stop gage himself from going through their camp were he outside and did he express a desire to return  and yet you tell me arms and ammunition are seized all over the land that several old halfpay officers of the king have been arrested and put under a sort of parole  such things were talked of certainly though i question if they have yet been done luckily for yourself under your present opinions at least you are not on halfpay even  it is fortunate bob though you mention it with a smile with my present feelings i should indeed be sorry to be on halfpay or quarterpay were there such a thing i now feel myself myown master at liberty to follow the dictates of my conscience and the suggestions of my judgment  well sir you are a little fortunate it must be acknowledged i cannot see how any man can be at liberty to throw off the allegiance he owes his natural sovereign what think you maud  this was said half in bitterness half in jest though the appeal at its close was uttered in a serious manner and a little anxiously maud hesitated as if to muster her thoughts ere she replied  my feelings are against rebellion she said at length though i fear my reason tells me there is no such thing as a natural sovereign if the parliament had not given us the present family a century since by what rule of nature would it be our princes bob  ah these are some of the flights of your rich imagination my dear maud it is parliament that has made them our princes and parliament at least is our legal constitutional master  that is just the point in dispute parliament may be the rightful governors of england but are they the rightful governors of america  enough said the captain rising from tablewe will not discuss such a question just as we are about to separate go my son a duty that is to be performed cannot be done too soon your fowlingpiece and ammunition are ready for you and i shall take care to circulate the report that you have gone to pass an hour in the woods in search of pigeons god bless you bob however we may differ in this matter you are my sonmy only sonmy dear and wellbeloved boygod for ever bless you  a profound stillness succeeded this burst of nature and then the young man took his leave of his mother and the girls mrs willoughby kissed her child she did not even weep until she was in her room then indeed she went to her knees her tears and her prayers beulah all heart and truth as she was wept freely on her brothers neck but maud though pale and trembling received his kiss without returning it though she could not help saying with a meaning that the young man had in his mind all that day ay and for many succeeding daysbe careful of yourself and run into no unnecessary dangers god bless you dear dear bob  maud alone followed the movements of the gentlemen with her eyes the peculiar construction of the hut prevented external view from the south windows but there was a loop in a small paintingroom of the garret that was especially under her charge thither then she flew to ease her nearly bursting heart with tears and to watch the retiring footsteps of robert she saw him accompanied by his father and the chaplain stroll leisurely down the lawn conversing and affecting an indifferent manner with a wish to conceal his intent to depart the glass of the loop was open to admit the air and maud strained her sense of hearing in the desire to catch if possible another tone of his voice in this she was unsuccessful though he stopped and gazed back at the hut as if to take a parting look her father and mr woods did not turn and maud thrust her hand through the opening and waved her handkerchief he will think it beulah or i she thought and it may prove a consolation to him to know how much we love him the major saw the signal and returned it his father unexpectedly turned and caught a glimpse of the retiring hand as it was disappearing within the loop that is our precious maud he said without other thought than of her sisterly affection it is her paintingroom beulahs is on the other side of the gateway but the window does not seem to be open  the major started kissed his hand fervently five or six times and then he walked on as if to change the conversation he said hastily and with a little want of connection with what had just passed  yes sir that gate sure enoughhave it hung at once i do entreat of you i shall not be easy until i hear that both the gates are hung that in the stockade and that in the house itself  it was my intention to commence today returned the father but your departure has prevented it i will wait a day or two to let your mother and sisters tranquillize their minds a little before we besiege them with the noise and clamour of the workmen  better besiege them with that my dear sir than leave them exposed to an indian or even a rebel attack  the major then went on to give some of his more modern military notions touching the art of defence as one of the old school he believed his father a miracle of skill but what young man who had enjoyed the advantages of ten or fifteen years of the most recent training in any branch of knowledge ever believed the educations of those who went before him beyond the attacks of criticism the captain listened patiently and with an old mans tolerance for inexperience glad to have any diversion to unhappy thoughts  all this time maud watched their movements from the loop with eyes streaming with tears she saw robert pause and look back again and again and once more she thrust out the handkerchief it was plain however he did not see it for he turned and proceeded without any answering signal  he never can know whether it was beulah or i thought maud yet he may fancy we are both here  on the rocks that overhung the mills the gentlemen paused and conversed for quite a quarter of an hour the distance prevented maud from discerning their countenances but she could perceive the thoughtful and as she fancied melancholy attitude of the major as leaning on his fowlingpiece his lace was turned towards the knoll and his eyes were really riveted on the loop at the end of the time mentioned the young soldier shook hands hastily and covertly with his companions hurried towards the path and descended out of sight following the course of the stream maud saw him no more though her father and mr woods stood on the rocks quite half an hour longer catching occasional glimpses of his form as it came out of the shadows of the forest into the open space of the little river and indeed until the major was within a short distance of the spot where he was to meet the indian then they heard the reports of both barrels of his fowlingpiece fired in quick succession the signals that he had joined his guide this welcome news received the two gentlemen returned slowly towards the house  such was the commencement of a day which while it brought forth nothing alarming to the family of the hutted knoll was still pregnant with important consequences major willoughby disappeared from the sight of his father about ten in the morning and before twelve the settlement was alive with the rumours of a fresh arrival joel knew not whether to rejoice or to despair as he saw a party of eight or ten armed men rising above the rock and holding their course across the flats towards the house he entertained no doubt of its being a party sent by the provincial authorities to arrest the captain and he foresaw the probability of anothers being put into the lucrative station of receiver of the estate during the struggle which was in perspective it is surprising how many and sometimes how pure patriots are produced by just such hopes as those of joels at this day there is scarce an instance of a confiscated estate during the american revolution connected with which racy traditions are not to be found that tell of treachery very similar to this contemplated by the overseer in some instances of treachery effected by means of kinsmen and false friends  joel had actually got on his sunday coat and was making his way towards the knoll in order to be present at least at the anticipated scene when to his amazement and somewhat to his disappointment he saw the captain and chaplain moving down the lawn in a manner to show that these unexpected arrivals brought not unwelcome guests this caused him to pause and when he perceived that the only two among the strangers who had the air of gentlemen were met with cordial shakes of the hand he turned back towards his own tenement a halfdissatisfied and yet half contented man  the visit which the captain had come out to receive instead of producing any uneasiness in his family was in truth highly agreeable and very opportune it was evert beekman with an old friend attended by a party of chainbearers hunters c on his way from the patent he owned in the neighbourhoodthat is to say within fifty milesand halting at the hutted knoll under the courteous pretence of paying his respects to the family but in reality to bring the suit he had now been making to beulah for quite a twelvemonth to a successful termination  the attachment between evert beekman and beulah willoughby was of a character so simple so sincere and so natural as scarce to furnish materials for a brief episode the young man had not made his addresses without leave obtained from the parents he had been acceptable to the daughter from the commencement of their acquaintance and she had only asked time to reflect ere she gave her answer when he proposed a day or two before the family left new york  to own the truth beulah was a little surprised that her suitor had delayed his appearance till near the close of may when she had expected to see him at the beginning of the month a letter however was out of the question since there was no mode of transmitting it unless the messenger were sent expressly and the young man had now come in person to make his own apologies  beulah received evert beekman naturally and without the least exaggeration of manner though a quiet happiness beamed in her handsome face that said as much as lover could reasonably desire her parents welcomed him cordially and the suitor must have been dull indeed not to anticipate all he hoped nor was it long before every doubt was removed the truthful conscientious beulah had well consulted her heart and while she blushed at her own temerity she owned her attachment to her admirer the very day of his arrival they became formally betrothed as our tale however has but a secondary connection with this little episode we shall not dwell on it more than is necessary to the principal object it was a busy morning altogether and though there were many tears there were also many smiles by the time it was usual at that bland season for the family to assemble on the lawn everything even to the day was settled between beulah and her lover and there was a little leisure to think of other things it was while the younger pliny and one of the smashes were preparing the tea that the following conversation was held being introduced by mr woods in the way of digressing from feelings in which he was not quite as much interested as some of the rest of the party  do you bring us anything new from boston demanded the chaplain i have been dying to ask the question these two hoursever since dinner in fact but somehow mr beekman i have not been able to edge in an inquiry  this was said goodnaturedly but quite innocently eliciting smiles blushes and meaning glances in return evert beekman however looked grave before he made his reply  to own the truth mr woods he said things are getting to be very serious boston is surrounded by thousands of our people and we hope not only to keep the kings forces in the peninsula but in the end to drive them out of the colony  this is a bold measure mr beekmana very bold step to take against c√¶sar  woods preached about the rights of c√¶sar no later than yesterday you ought to know beekman put in the laughing captain and i am afraid he will be publicly praying for the success of the british arms before long  i did pray for the royal family said the chaplain with spirit and hope i shall ever continue to do so  my dear fellow i do not object to that pray for all conditions of men enemies and friends alike and particularly pray for our princes but pray also to turn the hearts of their advisers  beekman seemed uneasy he belonged to a decidedly whig family and was himself at the very moment spoken of as the colonel of one of the regiments about to be raised in the colony of new york he held that rank in the militia as it was and no one doubted his disposition to resist the british forces at the proper moment he had even stolen away from what he conceived to be very imperative duties to secure the woman of his heart before he went into the field his answer in accordance partook essentially of the bias of his mind  i do not know sir that it is quite wise to pray so very willingly for the royal family he said we may wish them worldly happiness and spiritual consolation as part of the human race but political and specific prayers in times like these are to be used with caution men attach more than the common religious notion just now to prayers for the king which some interpret into direct petitions against the united colonies  well rejoined the captain i cannot agree to this myself if there were a prayer to confound parliament and its counsels i should be very apt to join in it cordially but i am not yet ready to throw aside king queen princes and princesses all in a lump on account of a few taxes and a tittle tea  i am sorry to hear this from you sir answered evert when your opinions were canvassed lately at albany i gave a sort of pledge that you were certainly more with us than against us  well then i think beekman you drew me in my true outlines in the main i think the colonies right though i am still willing to pray for the king  i am one of those captain willoughby who look forward to the most serious times the feeling throughout the colonies is tremendous and the disposition on the part of the royal officers is to meet the crisis with force  you have a brother a captain of foot in one of the regiments of the crown colonel beekmanwhat are his views in this serious state of affairs  he has already thrown up his commissionrefusing even to sell out a privilege that was afforded him his name is now before congress for a majority in one of the new regiments that are to be raised  the captain looked grave mrs willoughby anxious beulah interested and maud thoughtful  this has a serious aspect truly observed the first when men abandon all their early hopes to assume new duties there must be a deep and engrossing cause i had not thought it like to come to this  we have had hopes major willoughby might do the same i know that a regiment is at his disposal if he be disposed to join us no one would be more gladly received we are to have gates montgomery lee and many other old officers from regular corps on our side  will colonel lee be put at the head of the american forces  i think not sir he has a high reputation and a good deal of experience but he is a humourist and what is something though you will pardon it he is not an american born  it is quite right to consult such considerations beekman were i in congress they would influence me englishman as i am and in many things must always remain  i am glad to hear you say that willoughby exclaimed the chaplain right down rejoiced to hear you say so a man is bound to stand by his birthplace through thick and thin  how do you then reconcile your opinions in this matter to your birthplace woods asked the laughing captain  to own the truth the chaplain was a little confused he had entered into the controversy with so much zeal of late as to have imbibed the feelings of a thorough partisan and as is usual with such philosophers was beginning to overlook everything that made against his opinions and to exaggerate everything that sustained them  howhe cried with zeal if not with consistencywhy well enough i am an englishman too in the general view of the case though born in massachusetts of english descent and an english subject  umphthen beekman here who is of dutch descent is not bound by the same principles as we are ourselves  not by the same feelings possibly but surely by the same principles colonel beekman is an englishman by construction and you are by birth yes im what may be called a constructive englishman  even mrs willoughby and beulah laughed at this though not a smile had crossed mauds face since her eye had lost robert willoughby from view the captains ideas seemed to take a new direction and he was silent some little time before he spoke  under the circumstances in which we are now placed as respects each other mr beekman he said it is proper that there should be no concealments on grave points had you arrived an hour or two earlier you would have met a face well known to you in that of my son major willoughby  major willoughby my dear sir exclaimed beekman with a start of unpleasant surprise i had supposed him with the royal army in boston you say he has left the knolli sincerely hope not for albany  noi wished him to go in that direction at first and to see you in particular but his representations of the state of the country induced me to change my mind he travels by a private way avoiding all the towns of note or size  in that he has done well sir near to me as a brother of beulahs must always seem i should be sorry to see bob just at this moment if there be no hope of getting him to join us the farther we are separated the better  this was said gravely and it caused all who heard it fully to appreciate the serious character of a quarrel that threatened to arm brother against brother as if by common consent the discourse changed all appearing anxious at a moment otherwise so happy to obliterate impressions so unpleasant from their thoughts  the captain his wife beulah and the colonel had several long and private communications in the course of the evening maud was not sorry to be left to herself and the chaplain devoted his time to the entertainment of the friend of beekman who was in truth a surveyor brought along partly to preserve appearances and partly for service the chainbearers hunters c had been distributed in the different cabins of the settlement immediately on the arrival of the party  that night when the sisters retired maud perceived that beulah had something to communicate out of the common way still she did not know whether it would be proper for her to make any inquiries and things were permitted to take their natural course at length beulah in her gentle way remarkedit is a fearful thing maud for a woman to take upon herself the new duties obligations and ties of a wife  she should not do it beulah unless she feels a love for the man of her choice that will sustain her in them you who have real parents living ought to feel this fully as i doubt not you do  real parents maud you frighten me are not my parents yoursis not all our love common  i am ashamed of myself beulah dearer and better parents than mine no girl ever had i am ashamed of my words and beg you will forget them  that i shall be very ready to do it was a great consolation to think that should i be compelled to quit home as compelled i must be in the end i should leave with my father and mother a child as dutiful and one that loves them as sincerely as yourself maud  you have thought right beulah i do love them to my hearts core then you are right in another sense for i shall never marry my mind is made up to that  well dear many are happy that never marrymany women are happier than those that do evert has a kind manly affectionate heart and i know will do all he can to prevent my regretting home but we can never have more than one mother maud  maud did not answer though she looked surprised that beulah should say this to her  evert has reasoned and talked so much to my father and mother continued the fianc√©e blushing that they have thought we had better be married at once do you know maud that it has been settled this evening that the ceremony is to take place tomorrow  this is sudden indeed beulah why have they determined on so unexpected a thing  it is all owing to the state of the country i know not how he has done itbut evert has persuaded my father that the sooner i am his wife the more secure we shall all be here at the knoll  i hope you love evert beekman dearest dearest beulah  what a question maud do you suppose i could stand up before a minister of god and plight my faith to a man i did not lovewhy have you seemed to doubt it  i do not doubt iti am very foolish for i know you are conscientious as the saints in heavenand yet beulah i think i could scarce be so tranquil about one i loved  the gentle beulah smiled but she no longer felt uneasiness she understood the impulses and sentiments of her own pure but tranquil nature too well to distrust herself and she could easily imagine that maud would not be as composed under similar circumstances  perhaps it is well sister of mine she answered laughing though blushing that you are so resolved to remain single for one hardly knows where to find a suitor sufficiently devoted and ethereal for your taste no one pleased you last winter though the least encouragement would have brought a dozen to your feet and here there is no one you can possibly have unless it be dear good old mr woods  maud compressed her lips and really looked stern so determined was she to command herself then she answered somewhat in her sisters vein  it is very true she said there is no hero for me to accept unless it be dear mr woods and he poor man has had one wife that cured him of any desire to possess another they say  mr woods i never knew that he was married who can have told you this maud  i got it from robertanswered the other hesitating a little he was talking one day of such things  what things dear  whyof getting marriedi believe it was about marrying relativesor connectionsor some such thing for mr woods married a cousin german it would seemand so he told me all about it bob was old enough to know his wife when she died poor man she led him a hard lifehe must be far from the knoll by this time beulah  mr woodsi left him with papa a few minutes since talking over the ceremony for tomorrow  i meant bob  here the sisters caught each others eyes and both blushed consciousness presenting to them at the same instant the images that were uppermost in their respective minds but no more was said they continued their employments in silence and soon each was kneeling in prayer  the following day evert beekman and beulah willoughby were married the ceremony took place immediately after breakfast in the little chapel no one being present but the relatives and michael ohearn who quieted his conscience for not worshipping with the rest of the people by acting as their sexton the honest county leitrim man was let into the secretas a great secret howeverat early dawn and he had the place swept and in order in good season appearing in his sunday attire to do honour to the occasion as he thought became him  a mother as tender as mrs willoughby could not resign the first claim on her child without indulging her tears maud wept too but it was as much in sympathy for beulahs happiness as from any other cause the marriage in other respects was simple and without any ostentatious manifestations of feeling it was in truth one of those rational and wise connections which promise to wear well there being a perfect fitness in station wealth connections years manners and habits between the parties violence was done to nothing in bringing this discreet and wellprincipled couple together evert was as worthy of beulah as she was worthy of him there was confidence in the future on every side and not a doubt or a misgiving of any sort mingled with the regrets if regrets they could be called that were in some measure inseparable from the solemn ceremony  the marriage was completed the affectionate father had held the weeping but smiling bride on his bosom the tender mother had folded her to her heart maud had pressed her in her arms in a fervent embrace and the chaplain had claimed his kiss when the wellmeaning sexton approached  is it the likes of yees i wish well to said mikeye may well say that and to yer husband and childer and all that will go before and all that have come after ye i knowd ye when ye was mighty little and that was years agone and niver have i seen a cross look on yer pretthy face ive appinted to myself manys the time a consait to tell ye all this by worrd of mouth but the likes of yees and of the missus and of miss maud thereoch isnt she a swate one and manys the pity theres no sich tall handsome jontleman to take her in the bargain bad luck to him for staying away and so god bless ye all praist in the bargain though hes no praist at all and heres my good wishes said and done      chapter x    ho princes of jacob the strength and the stay   of the daughters of zionnow up and away   lo the hunters have struck her and bleeding alone   like a pard in the desert she maketh her moan   up with warhorse and banner with spear and with sword   on the spoiler go down in the might of the lord    lunt  the succeeding fortnight or three weeks brought no material changes beyond those connected with the progress of the season vegetation was out in its richest luxuriance the rows of corn and potatoes freshly hoed were ornamenting the flats the wheat and other grains were throwing up their heads and the meadows were beginning to exchange their flowers for the seed as for the forest it had now veiled its mysteries beneath broad curtains of a green so bright and lively that one can only meet it beneath a generous sun tempered by genial rains and a mountain air the chainbearers and other companions of beekman quitted the valley the day after the wedding leaving no one of their party behind but its principal  the absence of the major was not noted by joel and his set in the excitement of receiving so many guests and in the movement of the wedding but as soon as the fact was ascertained the overseer and miller made the pretence of a slacktime in their work and obtained permission to go to the mohawk on private concerns of their own such journeys were sufficiently common to obviate suspicion and the leave had the two conspirators started off in company the morning of the second day or fortyeight hours after the major and nick had disappeared as the latter was known to have come in by the fort stanwix route it was naturally enough supposed that he had returned by the same and joel determined to head him on the mohawk at some point near schenectady where he might make a merit of his own patriotism by betraying the son of his master the reader is not to suppose joel intended to do all this openly so far from it his plan was to keep himself in the background while he attracted attention to the supposed toryism of the captain and illustrated his own attachment to the colonies  it is scarcely necessary to say that this plan failed in consequence of the new path taken by nick at the very moment when joel and the miller were lounging about a dutch inn some fifteen or twenty miles above schenectady in waiting for the travellers to descend the valley of the mohawk robert willoughby and his guide were actually crossing the hudson in momentary security at least after remaining at his post until satisfied his intended prey had escaped him joel with his friend returned to the settlement still the opportunity had been improved to make himself better acquainted with the real state of the country to open communications with certain patriots of a moral calibre about equal to his own but of greater influence to throw out divers injurious hints and secret insinuations concerning the captain and to speculate on the propriety of leaving so important a person to work his will at a time so critical but the pear was not yet ripe and all that could now be done was to clear the way a little for something important in future  in the meantime evert beekman having secured his gentle and true hearted wife began though with a heavy heart to bethink him of his great political duties it was well understood that he was to have a regiment of the new levies and beulah had schooled her affectionate heart to a degree that permitted her to part with him in such a cause with seeming resignation it was sooth to say a curious spectacle to see how these two sisters bent all their thoughts and wishes in matters of a public nature to favour the engrossing sentiments of their sex and natures maud being strongly disposed to sustain the royal cause and the bride to support that in which her husband had enlisted heart and hand  as for captain willoughby he said little on the subject of politics but the marriage of beulah had a powerful influence in confirming his mind in the direction it had taken after the memorable argument with the chaplain colonel beekman was a man of strong good sense though without the least brilliancy and his arguments were all so clear and practical as to carry with them far more weight than was usual in the violent partisan discussions of the period beulah fancied him a solon in sagacity and a bacon in wisdom her father without proceeding quite as far as this was well pleased with his cool discriminating judgment and much disposed to defer to his opinions the chaplain was left out of the discussions as incorrigible  the middle of june was passed at the time colonel beekman began to think of tearing himself from his wife in order to return into the active scenes of preparation he had quitted to make this visit as usual the family frequented the lawn at the close of the day the circumstance of most of the windows of the hut looking on the court rendering this resort to the open air more agreeable than might otherwise have been the case evert was undecided whether to go the following morning or to remain a day longer when the lawn was thus occupied on the evening of the 25th of the month mrs willoughby making the tea as usual her daughters sitting near her sewing and the gentlemen at hand discussing the virtues of different sorts of seedcorn  there is a stranger suddenly exclaimed the chaplain looking towards the rocks near the mill the point at which all arrivals in the valley were first seen from the hut he comes too like a man in haste whatever may be his errand  god be praised returned the captain rising it is nick on his usual trot and this is about the time he should be back the bearer of good news a week earlier might have augured better but this will do the fellow moves over the ground as if he really had something to communicate  mrs willoughby and her daughters suspended their avocations and the gentlemen stood in silent expectation watching the long loping strides of the tuscarora as he came rapidly across the plain in a few minutes the indian came upon the lawn perfectly in wind moving with deliberation and gravity as he drew nearer to the party captain willoughby knowing his man waited quite another minute after the redman was leaning against an appletree before he questioned him  welcome back nick he then said where did you leave my son  he tell dere answered the indian presenting a note which the captain read  this is all right nick and it shows you have been a true man your wages shall be paid tonight but this letter has been written on the eastern bank of the hudson and is quite three weeks oldwhy have we not seen you

captain received the note which he read with extreme gravity and some surprise  this is in bobs handwriting he said and is dated boston june 18th 1775 but it is without signature and is not only bob but bob short  read dear willoughby exclaimed the anxious mother news from him concerns us all  news wilhelminathey may call this news in boston but one is very little the better for it at the hutted

redcoat small grave wont hold yankee hear what he count most redcoat more than tousand warrior british groan like squaw dat lose her hunter  such was saucy nicks description of the celebrated and in some particulars unrivalled combat of bunker hill of which he had actually been an eyewitness on the ground though using the precaution to keep his body well covered he did not think it necessary to state the fact that he had given the coupdegrace himself to the owner of the epaulette nor did he deem it essential to furnish all the particulars of his mode of obtaining so many buckles in other respects his account was fair enough nothing extenuating or setting down aught in malice the auditors had listened with intense feeling and maud when the allusion was made to robert willoughby buried her pallid face in her hands and wept as for beulah time and again she glanced anxiously at her husband and bethought her of the danger to which he might so soon be exposed  the receipt of this important intelligence confirmed beekman in the intention to depart the very next morning he tore himself away from beulah and proceeded to albany the appointment of washington and a long list of other officers soon succeeded including his own as a colonel and the war may be said to have commenced systematically its distant din occasionally reached the hutted knoll but the summer passed away bringing with it no event to affect the tranquillity of that settlement even joels schemes were thwarted for a time and he was fain to continue to wear the mask and to gather that harvest for another which he had hoped to reap for his own benefit  beulah had all a young wifes fears for her husband but as month succeeded month and one affair followed another without bringing him harm she began to submit to the anxieties inseparable from her situation with less of selftorment and more of reason her mother and maud were invaluable friends to her in this novel and trying situation though each had her own engrossing cares on account of robert willoughby as no other great battle however occurred in the course of the year 75 beekman remained in safety with the troops that invested boston and the major with the army within it neither was much exposed and glad enough were these gentle affectionate hearts when they learned that the sea separated the combatants  this did not occur however until another winter was passed in november the family left the hut as had been its practice of late years and went out into the more inhabited districts to pass the winter this time it came only to albany where colonel beekman joined it passing a few happy weeks with his wellbeloved beulah the ancient town mentioned was not gay at a moment like that but it had many young officers in it on the american side of the question who were willing enough to make themselves acceptable to maud the captain was not sorry to see several of these youths manifesting assiduity about her he had so long been accustomed to consider as his youngest daughter for by this time his opinions had taken so strong a bias in favour of the rights of the colonies that beekman himself scarce rejoiced more whenever he heard of any little success alighting on the american arms  it will all come right in the end the worthy captain used to assure his friend the chaplain they will open their eyes at home ere long and the injustice of taxing the colonies will be admitted then all will come round again the king will be as much beloved as ever and england and america will be all the better friends for having a mutual respect i know my countrymen well they mean right and will do right as soon as their stomachs are a little lowered and they come to look at the truth coolly ill answer for it the battle of bunkers hill made usthe captain had spoken in this way now for some monthsmade us a thousand advocates where we had one before this is the nature of john bull give him reason to respect you and he will soon do you justice but give him reason to feel otherwise and he becomes a careless if not a hard master  such were the opinions captain willoughby entertained of his native land a land he had not seen in thirty years and one in which he had so recently inherited unexpected honours without awakening a desire to return and enjoy them his opinions were right in part certainly for they depended on a law of nature while it is not improbable they were wrong in all that was connected with the notions of any peculiarly manly quality in any particular part of christendom no maxim is truer than that which teaches us like causes produce like effects and as human beings are governed by very similar laws all over the face of this round world of ours nothing is more certain than the similarity of their propensities  maud had no smiles beyond those extracted by her naturally sweet disposition and a very prevalent desire to oblige for any of the young soldiers or young civilians who crowded about her chair during the albany winter mentioned two or three of colonel beekmans military friends in particular would very gladly have become connected with an officer so much respected through means so exceedingly agreeable but no encouragement emboldened either to go beyond the attention and assiduities of a marked politeness  i know not how it is observed mrs willoughby one day in a t√™te√†t√™te with her husband maud seems to take less pleasure than is usual with girls of her years in the attentions of your sex that her heart is affectionatewarmeven tender i am very certain and yet no sign of preference partiality or weakness in favour of any of these fine young men of whom we see so many can i discover in the child they all seem alike to her  her time will come as it happened to her mother before her answered the captain whoopingcough and measles are not more certain to befall children than love to befall a young woman you were all made for it my dear willy and no fear but the girl will catch the disease one of these days and that too without any inoculation  i am sure i have no wish to separate from my childso mrs willoughby always spoke of and so she always felt towards maudi am sure i have no wish to separate from my child but as we cannot always remain it is perhaps better this one should marry like the other there is young verplanck much devoted to her he is everyway a suitable match and then he is in everts own regiment  ay he would do though to my fancy luke herring is the far better match  that is because he is richer and more powerful hughyou men cannot think of a daughters establishment without immediately dragging in houses and lands as part of the ceremony  by george wife of mine houses and lands in moderation are very good sweeteners of matrimony  and yet hugh i have been very happy as a wife nor have you been very miserable as a husband without any excess of riches to sweeten the state answered mrs willoughby reproachfully had you been a full general i could not have loved you more than i have done as a mere captain  all very true wilhelmina dearest returned the husband kissing the faithful partner of his bosom with strong affectionvery true my dear girl for girl you are and ever will be in my eyes but you are one in a million and i humbly trust there are not ten hundred and one in every thousand just like myself for my part i wish dear saucy capricious little maud no worse luck in a husband than luke herring  she will never be his wife i know her and my own sex too well to think it you are wrong however willoughby in applying such terms to the child maud is not in the least capricious especially in her affections see with what truth and faithfulness of sisterly attachment she clings to bob i do declare i am often ashamed to feel that even his own mother has less solicitude about him than this dear girl  pooh willy dont be afflicted with the idea that you dont make yourself sufficiently miserable about the boy bob will do well enough and will very likely come out of this affair a lieutenantcolonel i may live yet to see him a general officer certainly if i live to be as old as my grandfather sir thomas as for maud she finds beulah uneasy about beekman and having no husband herself or any over that she cares a straw about why she just falls upon bob as a pis aller ill warrant you she cares no more for him than any of the rest of usthan myself for instance though as an old soldier i dont scream every time i fancy a gun fired over yonder at boston  i wish it were well over it is so unnatural for evert and robert to be on opposite sides  yes it is out of the common way i admit and yet twill all come round in the long run this mr washington is a clever fellow and seems to play his cards with spirit and judgment he was with us in that awkward affair of braddocks and between you and me wilhelmina he covered the regulars or we should all have laid our bones on that accursed field i wrote you at the time what i thought of him and now you see it is all coming to pass  it was one of the captains foibles to believe himself a political prophet and as he had really both written and spoken highly of washington at the time mentioned it had no small influence on his opinions to find himself acting on the same side with this admired favourite prophecies often produce their own fulfilment in cases of much greater gravity than this and it is not surprising that our captain found himself strengthened in his notions by the circumstance  the winter passed away without any of mauds suitors making a visible impression on her heart in march the english evacuated boston robert willoughby sailing with his regiment for halifax and thence with the expedition against charleston under sir henry clinton the next month the family returned to the knoll where it was thought wiser and even safer to be at a moment so critical than even in a more frequented place the war proceeded and to the captains great regret without any very visible approaches towards the reconciliation he had so confidently anticipated this rather checked his warmth in favour of the colonial cause for an englishman by birth he was much opposed at bottom to anything like a dissolution of the tie that connected america with the mother country a political event that now began seriously to be talked of among the initiated  desirous of thinking as little as possible of disagreeable things the worthy owner of the valley busied himself with his crops his mills and his improvements he had intended to commence leasing his wild lands about this time and to begin a more extended settlement with an eye to futurity but the state of the country forbade the execution of the project and he was fain to limit his efforts by their former boundaries the geographical position of the valley put it beyond any of the ordinary exactions of military service and as there was a little doubt thrown around its owners opinions partly in consequence of his sons present and his own previous connection with the royal army and partly on account of joels secret machinations the authorities were well content to let the settlement alone provided it would take care of itself notwithstanding the prominent patriotism of joel strides and the miller they were well satisfied themselves with this state of things preferring peace and quietness to the more stirring scenes of war their schemes moreover had met with somewhat of a check in the feeling of the population of the valley which on an occasion calculated to put their attachment to its owner to the proof had rather shown that they remembered his justice liberality and upright conduct more than exactly comported with their longings this manifestation of respect was shown at an election for a representative in a local convention in which every individual at the hutted knoll who had a voice at all the two conspirators excepted had given it in favour of the captain so decided was this expression of feeling indeed that it compelled joel and the miller to chime in with the cry of the hour and to vote contrary to their own wishes  one dwelling at the hutted knoll in the summer of 1776 could never have imagined that he was a resident of a country convulsed by a revolution and disfigured by war there everything seemed peaceful and calm the woods sighing with the airs of their sublime solitude the genial sun shedding its heats on a grateful and generous soil vegetation ripening and yielding with all the abundance of a bountiful nature as in the more tranquil days of peace and hope  there is something frightful in the calm of this valley beulah exclaimed maud one sunday as she and her sister looked out of the library window amid the breathing stillness of the forest listening to the melancholy sound of the bell that summoned them to prayers there is a frightful calm over this place at an hour when we know that strife and bloodshed are so active in the country oh that the hateful congress had never thought of making this war  evert writes me all is well maud that the times will lead to good the people are right and america will now be a nationin time he thinks a great and a very great nation  ah it is this ambition of greatness that hurries them all on why can they not be satisfied with being respectable subjects of so great a country as england that they must destroy each other for this phantom of liberty will it make them wiser or happier or better than they are  thus reasoned maud under the influence of one engrossing sentiment as our tale proceeds we shall have occasion to show perhaps how far was that submission to events which she inculcated from the impulses of her true character beulah answered mildly but it was more as a young american wife  i know evert thinks it all right maud and you will own he is neither fiery nor impetuous if his cool judgment approve of what has been done we may well suppose that it has not been done in too much haste or needlessly  think beulah rejoined maud with an ashen cheek and in trembling tones that evert and robert may at this very moment be engaged in strife against each other the last messenger who came in brought us the miserable tidings that sir william howe was landing a large army near new york and that the americans were preparing to meet it we are certain that bob is with his regiment and his regiment we know is in the army how can we think of this liberty at a moment so critical  beulah did not reply for in spite of her quiet nature and implicit confidence in her husband she could not escape a womans solicitude the colonel had promised to write at every good occasion and that which he promised was usually performed she thought and thought rightly that a very few days would bring them intelligence of importance though it came in a shape she had little anticipated and by a messenger she had then no desire to see  in the meantime the season and its labours advanced august was over and september with its fruits had succeeded promising to bring the year round without any new or extraordinary incidents to change the fortunes of the inmates of the hutted knoll beulah had now been married more than a twelvemonth and was already a mother and of course all that time had elapsed since the son quitted his fathers house nick too had disappeared shortly after his return from boston and throughout this eventful summer his dark red countenance had not been seen in the valley      chapter xi    and now tis still no sound to wake   the primal forests awful shade   and breathless lies the covert brake   where many an ambushed form is laid   i see the redmans gleaming eye   yet all so hushed the gloom profound   that summer birds flit heedlessly   and mocking nature smiles around    lunt  the eventful summer of 1776 had been genial and generous in the valley of the hutted knoll with a desire to drive away obtrusive thoughts the captain had been much in his fields and he was bethinking himself of making a large contribution to the good cause in the way of fatted porkers of which he had an unusual number that he thought might yet be driven through the forest to fort stanwix before the season closed in the way of intelligence from the seat of war nothing had reached the family but a letter from the major which he had managed to get sent and in which he wrote with necessary caution he merely mentioned the arrival of sir william howes forces and the state of his own health there was a short postscript in the following words the letter having been directed to his fathertell dearest maud he said that charming women have ceased to charm me glory occupying so much of my daydreams like an ignis fatuus i fear and that as for love all my affections are centred in the dear objects at the hutted knoll if i had met with a single woman i admired half as much as i do her pretty self i should have been married long since this was written in answer to some thoughtless rattle that the captain had volunteered to put in his last letter as coming from maud who had sensitively shrunk from sending a message when asked and it was read by father mother and beulah as the badinage of a brother to a sister without awaking a second thought in either not so with maud herself however when her seniors had done with this letter she carried it to her own room reading and rereading it a dozen times nor could she muster resolution to return it but finding at length that the epistle was forgotten she succeeded in retaining it without awakening attention to what she had done this letter now became her constant companion and a hundred times did the sweet gill trace its characters in the privacy of her chamber or in that of her now solitary walks in the woods  as yet the war had produced none of those scenes of ruthless frontier violence that had distinguished all the previous conflicts of america the enemy was on the coast and thither the efforts of the combatants had been principally directed it is true an attempt on canada had been made but it failed for want of means neither party being in a condition to effect much as yet in that quarter the captain had commented on this peculiarity of the present struggle all those which had preceded it having as a matter of course taken the direction of the frontiers between the hostile provinces  there is no use woods in bothering ourselves about these things after all observed captain willoughby one day when the subject of hanging the longneglected gates came up between them its a heavy job and the crops will suffer if we take off the hands this week we are as safe here as we should be in hyde park and safer too for there housebreakers and footpads abound whereas your preaching has left nothing but very vulgar and everyday sinners at the knoll  the chaplain had little to say against this reasoning for to own the truth he saw no particular cause for apprehension impunity had produced the feeling of security until these gates had got to be rather a subject of amusement than of any serious discussion the preceding year when the stockade was erected joel had managed to throw so many obstacles in the way of hanging the gates that the duty was not performed throughout the whole of the present summer the subject having been mentioned but once or twice and then only to be postponed to a more fitting occasion  as yet no one in the valley knew of the great event which had taken place in july a rumour of a design to declare the provinces independent had reached the hut in may but the majors letter was silent on this important event and positive information had arrived by no other channel otherwise the captain would have regarded the struggle as much more serious than he had ever done before and he might have set about raising these allimportant gates in earnest as it was however there they stood each pair leaning against its proper wall or stockade though those of the latter were so light as to have required but eight or ten men to set them on their hinges in a couple of hours at most  captain willoughby still confined his agricultural schemes to the site of the old beaver pond the area of that was perfectly beautiful every unsightly object having been removed while the fences and the tillage were faultlessly neat and regular care had been taken too to render the few small fields around the cabins which skirted this lovely rural scene worthy of their vicinage the stumps had all been dug the surfaces levelled and the orchards and gardens were in keeping with the charms that nature had so bountifully scattered about the place  while however all in the shape of tillage was confined to this one spot the cattle ranged the forest for miles not only was the valley but the adjacent mountainsides were covered with intersecting paths beaten by the herds in the course of years these paths led to many a glen or lookout where beulah and maud had long been in the habit of pursuing their rambles during the sultry heats of summer though so beautiful to the eye the flats were not agreeable for walks and it was but natural for the lovers of the picturesque to seek the eminences where they could overlook the vast surfaces of leaves that were spread before them or to bury themselves in ravines and glens within which the rays of the sun scarce penetrated the paths mentioned led near or to a hundred of these places all within a mile or two of the hut as a matter of course then they were not neglected  beulah had now been a mother several months her little evert was born at the knoll and he occupied most of those gentle and affectionate thoughts which were not engrossed by his absent father her marriage of itself had made some changes in her intercourse with maud but the birth of the child had brought about still more the care of this little being formed beulahs great delight and mrs willoughby had all that peculiar interest in her descendant which marks a grandmothers irresponsible love these two passed half their time in the nursery a room fitted between their respective chambers leaving maud more alone than it was her wont to be and of course to brood over her thoughts and feelings these periods of solitude our heroine was much accustomed to pass in the forest use had so far emboldened her that apprehension never shortened her walks or lessened their pleasure of danger from any ordinary source there was literally next to none man never having been known to approach the valley unless by the regular path while the beasts of prey had been so actively hunted as rarely to be seen in that quarter of the country the panther excepted no wild quadruped was to be in the least feared in summer and of the first none had ever been met with by nick or any of the numerous woodsmen who had now frequented the adjacent hills for two lustrums  about three hours before the setting of the sun on the evening of the 23d of september 1776 maud willoughby was pursuing her way quite alone along one of the paths beaten by the cattle at some little distance from a rocky eminence where there was a lookout on which mike by her fathers orders had made a rude seat it was on the side of the clearing most remote from all the cabins though once on the elevation she could command a view of the whole of the little panorama around the site of the ancient pond in that day ladies wore the well known gipsey hat a style that was peculiarly suited to the face of our heroine exercise had given her cheeks a rich glow and though a shade of sadness or at least of reflection was now habitually thrown athwart her sweet countenance this bloom added an unusual lustre to her eyes and a brilliancy to her beauty that the proudest belle of any drawingroom might have been glad to possess although living so retired her dress always became her rank being simple but of the character that denotes refinement and the habits and tastes of a gentlewoman in this particular maud had ever been observant of what was due to herself and more than all had she attended to her present appearance since a chance expression of robert willoughbys had betrayed how much he prized the quality in her  looking thus and in a melancholy frame of mind maud reached the rock and took her place on its simple seat throwing aside her hat to catch a little of the cooling air on her burning cheeks she turned to look at the lovely view again with a pleasure that never tired the rays of the sun were streaming athwart the verdant meadows and rich corn lengthening the shadows and mellowing everything as if expressly to please the eye of one like her who now gazed upon the scene most of the people of the settlement were in the open air the men closing their days works in the fields and the women and children busied beneath shades with their wheels and needles the whole presenting such a picture of peaceful rural life as a poet might delight to describe or an artist to delineate with his pencil    the landscape smiles   calm in the sun and silent are the hills   and valleys and the blue serene of air  the vanished lark  it is very beautiful thought maud why cannot men be content with such scenes of loveliness and nature as this and love each other and be at peace as gods laws command then we might all be living happily together mere without trembling lest news of some sad misfortune should reach us from hour to hour beulah and evert would not be separated but both could remain with their childand my dear dear father and mother would be so happy to have us all around them in securityand then bob tooperhaps bob might bring a wife from the town with him that i could love as i do beulahit was one of mauds daydreams to love the wife of bob and make him happy by contributing to the happiness of those he most prizedno i could never love her as i do beulah but i should make her very dear to me as i ought to since she would be bobs wife  the expression of mauds face towards the close of this mental soliloquy was of singular sadness and yet it was the very picture of sincerity and truth it was some such look as the windows of the mind assume when the feelings struggle against nature and hope for resignation and submission to duty  at this instant a cry arose from the valley it was one of those spontaneous involuntary outbreakings of alarm that no art can imitate no pen describe but which conveys to the listeners ear terror in the very sound at the next instant the men from the mill were seen rushing up to the summit of the cliff that impended over their dwellings followed by their wives dragging children after them making frantic gestures indicative of alarm the first impulse of maud was to fly but a moments reflection told her it was much too late for that to remain and witness what followed would be safer and more wise her dress was dark and she would not be likely to be observed at the distance at which she was placed having behind her too a back ground of gloomy rock then the scene was too exciting to admit of much hesitation or delay in coming to a decision a fearful species of maddened curiosity mingling with her alarm under such circumstances it is not surprising that maud continued gazing on what she saw with eyes that seemed to devour the objects before them  the first cry from the valley was followed by the appearance of the fugitives from the mill these took the way towards the hut calling on the nearest labourers by name to seek safety in flight the words could not be distinguished at the rock though indistinct sounds might but the gestures could not be mistaken in half a minute the plain was alive with fugitives some rushing to their cabins for their children and all taking the direction of the stockade as soon as the last were found in five minutes the roads and lanes near the knoll were crowded with men women and children hastening forward to its protection while a few of the former had already rushed through the gateways as maud correctly fancied in quest of their arms  captain willoughby was riding among his labourers when this fearful interruption to a tranquillity so placid first broke upon his ear accustomed to alarms he galloped forward to meet the fugitives from the mill issuing orders as he passed to several of the men nearest the house with the miller who thought little of anything but safety at that instant he conversed a moment and then pushed boldly on towards the verge of the cliffs maud trembled as she saw her father in a situation which she thought must be so exposed but his cool manner of riding about proved that he saw no enemy very near at length he waved his hat to some object or person in the glen beneath and she even thought she heard his shout at the next moment he turned his horse and was seen scouring along the road towards the hut the lawn was covered with the fugitives as the captain reached it while a few armed men were already coming out of the courtyard gesticulating as if giving orders the captain dashed through them all without drawing the rein and disappeared in the court a minute later he reissued bearing his arms followed by his wife and beulah the latter pressing little evert to her bosom  something like order now began to appear among the men counting all ages and both colours the valley at this particular moment could muster thirtythree males capable of bearing arms to these might be added some ten or fifteen women who had occasionally brought down a deer and who might be thought more or less dangerous stationed at a loop with a rifle or a musket captain willoughby had taken some pains to drill the former who could go through some of the simpler light infantry evolutions among them he had appointed sundry corporals while joel strides had been named a serjeant joyce now an aged and warworn veteran did the duty of adjutant twenty men were soon drawn up in array in front of the open gateway on the lawn under the immediate orders of joyce and the last woman and child that had been seen approaching the place of refuge had passed within the stockade at this instant captain willoughby called a party of the stragglers around him and set about hanging the gates of the outer passage or that which led through the palisades  maud would now have left the rock but at that moment a dark body of indians poured up over the cliffs crowning it with a menacing cloud of at least fifty armed warriors the rivulet lay between her and the hut and the nearest bridge that crossed it would have brought her within reach of danger then it would require at least half an hour to reach that bridge by the circuitous path she would be compelled to take and there was little hope of getting over it before the strangers should have advanced it was better to remain where she could behold what was passing and to be governed by events than to rush blindly into unseen risks  the party that crowned the cliffs near the mills showed no impatience to advance it was evidently busy in reconnoitring and in receiving accessions to its numbers the latter soon increased to some seventy or eighty warriors after waiting several minutes in inaction a musket or rifle was fired towards the hut as if to try the effect of a summons and the range of a bullet at this hint the men on the lawn retired within the stockade stacked their arms and joined the party that was endeavouring to get the gates in their places from the circumstance that her father directed all the women and children to retire within the court maud supposed that the bullet might have fallen somewhere near them it was quite evident however that no one was injured  the gates intended for the stockade being open like the rest of that work were materially lighter than those constructed for the house itself the difficulty was in handling them with the accuracy required to enter the hinges of which there were three pairs this difficulty existed on account of their great height of physical force enough could be applied to toss them over the stockade itself if necessary but finesse was needed rather than force to effect the principal object and that under difficult circumstances it is scarcely possible that the proximity of so fierce an enemy as a body of savages in their warpaint for such the men at the mill had discovered was the guise of their assailants would in any measure favour the coolness and tact of the labourers poor maud lost the sense of her own danger in the nervous desire to see the longforgotten gates hung and she rose once or twice in feverish excitement as she saw that the leaf which was raised fell in or out missing its fastenings still the men persevered one or two sentinels being placed to watch the indians and give timely notice of their approach should they advance  maud now kneeled with her face bowed to the seat and uttered a short but most fervent prayer in behalf of the dear beings that the hut contained this calmed her spirits a little and she rose once more to watch the course of events the body of men had left the gate at which they had just been toiling and were crowding around its fellow one leaf was hung as an assurance of this she soon after saw her father swing it backward and forward on its hinges to cause it to settle into its place this was an immense relief though she had heard too many tales of indian warfare to think there was any imminent danger of an attack by open day in the very face of the garrison the cool manner in which her father proceeded satisfied her that he felt the same security for the moment his great object being in truth to make suitable provision against the hours of darkness  although maud had been educated as a lady and possessed the delicacy and refinement of her class she had unavoidably caught some of the fire and resolution of a frontier life to her the forest for instance possessed no fancied dangers but when there was real ground for alarm she estimated its causes intelligently and with calmness so it was also in the present crisis she remembered all she had been taught or had heard and quick of apprehension her information was justly applied to the estimate of present circumstances  the men at the hut soon had the second leaf of the gate ready to be raised at this instant an indian advanced across the flat alone bearing a branch of a tree in his hand and moving swiftly this was a flag of truce desiring to communicate with the palefaces captain willoughby met the messenger alone at the foot of the lawn and there a conference took place that lasted several minutes maud could only conjecture its objects though she thought her fathers attitude commanding and his gestures stern the redman as usual was quiet and dignified this much our heroine saw or fancied she saw but beyond this of course all was vague conjecture just as the two were about to part and had even made courteous signs of their intention a shout arose from the workmen which ascended though faintly as high as the rock captain willoughby turned and then maud saw his arm extended towards the stockade the second leaf of the gate was in its place swinging to and fro in a sort of exulting demonstration of its uses the savage moved away more slowly than he had advanced occasionally stopping to reconnoitre the knoll and its defences  captain willoughby now returned to his people and he was some time busied in examining the gates and giving directions about its fastenings utterly forgetful of her own situation maud shed tears of joy as she saw that this great object was successfully effected the stockade was an immense security to the people of the hut although it certainly might be scaled such an enterprise would require great caution courage and address and it could hardly be effected at all by daylight at night even it would allow the sentinels time to give the alarm and with a vigilant lookout might be the means of repelling an enemy there was also another consideration connected with this stockade an enemy would not be fond of trusting himself inside of it unless reasonably certain of carrying the citadel altogether inasmuch as it might serve as a prison to place him in the hands of the garrison to recross it under a fire from the loops would be an exploit so hazardous that few indians would think of undertaking it all this maud knew from her fathers conversations and she saw how much had been obtained in raising the gates then the stockade once properly closed afforded great security to those moving about within it the timbers would be apt to stop a bullet and were a perfect defence against a rush leaving time to the women and children to get into the court even allowing that the assailants succeeded in scaling the palisades  maud thought rapidly and well in the strait in which she was placed she understood most of the movements on both sides and she also saw the importance of her remaining where she could note all that passed if she intended to make an attempt at reaching the hut after dark this necessity determined her to continue at the rock so long as light remained she wondered she was not missed but rightly attributed the circumstance to the suddenness of the alarm and the crowd of other thoughts which would naturally press upon the minds of her friends at such a fearful moment i will stay where i am thought maud a little proudly and prove if i am not really the daughter of hugh willoughby that i am not altogether unworthy of his love and care i can even pass the night in the forest at this warm season without suffering  just as these thoughts crossed her mind in a sort of mental soliloquy a stone rolled from a path above her and fell over the rock on which the seat was placed a footstep was then heard and the girls heart beat quick with apprehension still she conceived it safest to remain perfectly quiet she scarce breathed in her anxiety to be motionless then it occurred to her that some one beside herself might be out from the hut and that a friend was near mike had been in the woods that very afternoon she knew for she had seen him and the truehearted fellow would indeed be a treasure to her at that awful moment this idea which rose almost to certainty as soon as it occurred induced her to spring forward when the appearance of a man whom she did not recognise dressed in a huntingshirt and otherwise attired for the woods carrying a short rifle in the hollow of his arm caused her to stop in motionless terror at first her presence was not observed but no sooner did the stranger catch a glimpse of her person than he stopped raised his hands in surprise laid his rifle against a tree and sprang forward the girl closing her eyes and sinking on the seat with bowed head expecting the blow of the deadly tomahawk  mauddearest dearest mauddo you not know me exclaimed one leaning over the pallid girl while he passed an arm round her slender waist with an affection so delicate and reserved that at another time it might have attracted attention look up dear girl and show that at least you fear not me  bob said the halfsenseless maud whence come youwhy do you come at this fearful instantwould to god your visit had been better timed  terror makes you say this my poor maud of all the family i had hoped for the warmest welcome from you we think alike about this warthen you are not so much terrified at the idea of my being found here but can hear reason why do you say this then my dearest maud  by this time maud had so far recovered as to be able to look up into the majors face with an expression in which alarm was blended with unutterable tenderness still she did not throw her arms around him as a sister would clasp a beloved brother but rather as he pressed her gently to his bosom repelled the embrace by a slight resistance extricating herself however she turned and pointed towards the valley  why do i say this see for yourselfthe savages have at length come and the whole dreadful picture is before you  young willoughbys military eye took in the scene at a glance the indians were still at the cliff and the people of the settlement were straining at the heavier gates of the hut having already got one of them into a position where it wanted only the proper application of a steady force to be hung he saw his father actively employed in giving directions and a few pertinent questions drew all the other circumstances from maud the enemy had now been in the valley more than an hour and the movements of the two parties were soon related  are you alone dearest maud are you shut out by this sudden inroad demanded the major with concern and surprise  so it would seem i can see no otherthough i did think michael might be somewhere near me in the woods here i at first mistook your footsteps for his  that is a mistakereturned willoughby levelling a small pocket spy glass at the hutmike is tugging at that gate upholding a part of it like a cornerstone i see most of the faces i know there and my dear father is as active and yet as cool as if at the head of a regiment  then i am aloneit is perhaps better that as many as possible should be in the house to defend it  not alone my sweet maud so long as i am with you do you still think my visit so illtimed  perhaps not after all heaven knows what i should have done by myself when it became dark  but are we safe on this seatmay we not be seen by the indians since we so plainly see them  i think not i have often remarked that when evert and beulah have been here their figures could not be perceived from the lawn owing i fancy to the dark background of rock my dress is not light and you are in green which is the colour of the leaves and not easily to be distinguished no other spot gives so good a view of what takes place in the valley we must risk a little exposure or act in the dark  you are a soldiers daughter maudthis was as true of major meredith as of captain willoughby and might therefore be freely said by even bobyou are a soldiers daughter and nature has clearly intended you to be a soldiers wife this is a coupdoeil not to be despised  i shall never be a wife at allmurmured maud scarce knowing what she said i may not live to be a soldiers daughter even much longer but why are you heresurely surely you can have no connection with those savagesi have heard of such horrors but you would not accompany them even though it were to protect the hut  ill not answer for that maud one would do a great deal to preserve his paternal dwelling from pillage and his fathers grey hairs from violence but i came alone that party and its objects being utterly strangers to me  and why do you come at all bob inquired the anxious girl looking up into his face with open affectionthe situation of the country is now such as to make your visits very hazardous  who could know the regular major in this huntingshirt and forest garb i have not an article about my person to betray me even were i before a court no fear for me then maud unless it be from these demons in human shape the savages even they do not seem to be very fiercely inclined as they appear at this moment more disposed to eat than to attack the hut look for yourself those fellows are certainly preparing to take their food the group that is just now coming over the cliffs is dragging a deer after it  maud took the glass though with an unsteady hand and she looked a moment at the savages the manner in which the instrument brought these wild beings nearer to her eye caused her to shudder and she was soon satisfied  that deer was killed this morning by the miller she said they have doubtless found it in or near his cabin we will be thankful however for this breathingtimeit may enable my dear father to get up the other gate look robert and see what progress they make  one side is just hung and much joy does it produce among them persevere my noble old father and you will soon be safe against your enemies what a calm and steady air he has amid it all ah maud hugh willoughby ought at this moment to be at the head of a brigade helping to suppress this accursed and unnatural rebellion nay more he may be there if he will only listen to reason and duty  and this is then your errand here bob asked his fair companion gazing earnestly at the major  it is maudand i hope you whose feelings i know to be right can encourage me to hope  i fear not it is now too late beulahs marriage with evert has strengthened his opinionsand then  what dearest maud you pause as if that then had a meaning you hesitated to express  maud coloured after which she smiled faintly and proceeded we should speak reverently of a fatherand such a father too but does it not seem probable to you bob that the many discussions he has with mr woods may have a tendency to confirm each in his notions  robert willoughby would have answered in the affirmative had not a sudden movement at the hut prevented      chapter xii    from flodden ridge   the scots beheld the english host   leave barmore wood their evening post   and heedful watched them as they crossed   the till by twisal bridge    scott  it was just at this instant that most of the women of the settlement rushed from the court and spread themselves within the stockade mrs willoughby and beulah being foremost in the movement the captain left the gate too and even the men who were just about to raise the last leaf suspended their toil it was quite apparent some new cause for uneasiness or alarm had suddenly awoke among them still the stack of arms remained untouched nor was there any new demonstration among the indians the major watched everything with intense attention through the glass  what is it dear bob demanded the anxious maud i see my dearest mothershe seems alarmed  was it known to her that you were about to quit the house when you came out on this walk  i rather think not she and beulah were in the nursery with little evert and my father was in the fields i came out without speaking to any person nor did i meet any before entering the forest  then you are now first missed yes that is itand no wonder maud it creates alarm merciful god how must they all feel at a moment like this  fire your rifle bobthat will draw their eyes in this direction and i will wave my handkerchiefperhaps that might be seen beulah has received such signals from me before  it would never do no we must remain concealed watching their movements in order to be able to aid them at the proper time it is painful to endure this suspense beyond a doubt but the pain must be borne in order to ensure the safety of one who is so very very precious to us all  notwithstanding the fearful situation in which she was placed maud felt soothed by these words the language of affection as coming from robert willoughby was very dear to her at all times and never more than at a moment when it appeared that even her life was suspended as it might be by a hair  it is as you say she answered gently giving him her hand with much of her ancient frankness of manner we should be betrayed and of course lostbut what means the movement at the hut  there was indeed a movement within the stockade mauds absence was now clearly ascertained and it is needless to describe the commotion the circumstance produced no one thought any longer of the half of the gate that still remained to be hung but every supposable part of the house and enclosure had been examined in quest of her who was missing our heroines last remark however was produced by certain indications of an intention to make a descent from one of the external windows of the common parlour a room it will be remembered that stood on the little cliff above the rivulet that wound beneath its base this cliff was about forty feet high and though it offered a formidable obstacle to any attempt to scale it there was no great difficulty in an active mans descending aided by a rope the spot too was completely concealed from the view of the party which still remained on the rock near the mill at a distance of quite half a mile from the gates of the stockade this fact greatly facilitated the little sortie since once in the bed of the rivulet which was fringed with bushes it would be very practicable by following its windings to gain the forest unseen the major levelled his glass at the windows and immediately saw the truth of all that has here been mentioned  they are preparing to send a party out he said and doubtless in quest of you maud the thing is very feasible provided the savages remain much longer in their present position it is matter of surprise to me that the last have not sent a force in the rear of the hut where the windows are at least exposed to fire and the forest is so close as to afford a cover to the assailants in front there is literally none but a few low fences which is the reason i presume that they keep so much aloof  it is not probable they know the valley with the exception of nick but few indians have ever visited us and that rarely those we have seen have all been of the most peaceable and friendly tribes not a true warrior as my father says ever having been found among them nick is the only one of them all that can thus be termed  is it possible that fellow has led this party i have never more than half confided in him and yet he is too old a friend of the family i should think to be guilty of such an act of baseness  my father thinks him a knave but i question if he has an opinion of him as bad as that besides he knows the valley and would have led the indians round into the rear of the house if it be a place so much more favourable for the attack as you suppose these wretches have come by the common paths all of which first strike the river as you know below the mills  that is true i lost my way a few miles from this the path being very blind on the eastern route which i travelled as having gone it last with nick and thinking it the safest fortunately i recognised the crest of this mountain above us by its shape or i might never have found my way although the streams when struck are certain guides to the woodsman as soon as i hit the cowpaths i knew they would lead me to the barns and sheds see a man is actually descending from a window  oh bob i hope it is not my father he is too oldit is risking too much to let him quit the house  i will tell you better when he reaches the ground unless mistaken ayit is the irishman ohearn  honest mike he is always foremost in everything though he so little knows how anything but digging ought to be done is there not another following himor am i deceived  there ishe has just reached the ground too this might be spared did they know how well you are guarded maud by one who would die cheerfully to prevent harm from reaching you  they little dream of that bob answered maud in a low tone not a human being in that valley fancies you nearer to him than the royal armies are at this moment but they do not send a thirdi am glad they weaken their own force no further  it is certainly best they should not the men had their rifles slung when they descended and they are now getting them ready for service it is joel strides who is with mike  i am sorry for it that is a man i little like bob and i should be sorry he knew of your being here  this was said quickly and with a degree of feeling that surprised the major who questioned maud earnestly as to her meaning and its reasons the latter told him she scarce knew herself that she disliked the mans manner had long thought his principles bad and that mike in his extraordinary way had said certain things to her to awaken distrust  mike speaks in hieroglyphics said the major laughing in spite of the serious situation in which he and his companion were placed and one must never be too sure of his meaning joel has now been many years with my father and he seems to enjoy his confidence  he makes himself useful and is very guarded in what he says at the hut stilli wish him not to know of your being here  it will not be easy to prevent it maud i should have come boldly into the valley but for this accidental meeting with you trusting that my father has no one about him so base as to betray his son  trust not joel strides ill answer for mike with my life but sorry indeed should i be that joel strides knew of your being among us it were better perhaps that most of the workmen should not be in the secret seethe two men are quitting the foot of the rocks  this was true and robert willoughby watched their movements with the glass as had been expected they first descended into the bed of the rivulet wading along its shore under the cover of the bushes until they soon became concealed even from the view of one placed on a height as elevated as that occupied by robert and maud it was sufficiently apparent however that their intention was to reach the forest in this manner when they would probably commence their search for the missing young lady nor was it long before robert and maud plainly saw the two adventurers quit the bed of the stream and bury themselves in the forest the question now seriously arose as to the best course for the major and his companion to pursue under ordinary circumstances it would have been wisest perhaps to descend at once and meet the messengers who might soon be found at some of the usual haunts of the girl but against this the latter so earnestly protested and that in a manner so soothing to the young mans feelings that he scarce knew how to oppose her wishes she implored him not to confide in joel strides too hastily at least it might be time enough when there was no alternative until the true character of the party then in the valley was known it would be premature nothing was easier than to conceal himself until it was dark when he might approach the hut and be admitted without his presence being known to any but those on whom the family could certainly rely the major urged the impossibility of his quitting maud until she was joined by the two men sent in quest of her and then it would be too late as he must be seen although he might escape immediate recognition in his present dress the presence of a stranger would excite suspicions and compel an explanation to this maud replied in the following manner her customary places of resort when in the woods were well known more especially to michael who was frequently employed in their vicinity these were a little waterfall that was situated a hundred rods up the rivulet to which a path had been made expressly and where an arbour seat and little table had been arranged for the purposes of working reading or taking refreshments to this spot the men would unquestionably proceed first then there was a deep ravine some distance farther that was often visited for its savage beauty and whither she more frequently went perhaps than to any other place thither michael would be certain to lead his companion these two places visited they might infallibly expect to see the men at the rock where the two were then seated as the last spot in which maud might naturally be expected to be found it would require an hour to visit the two places first named and to examine the surrounding woods and by that time not only would the sun be set but the twilight would be disappearing until that moment then the major might remain at her side and on the sound of the approaching footsteps of the messengers he had only to retire behind a projection of the rocks and afterwards follow towards the knoll at a safe distance  this plan was too plausible to be rejected and giving robert an hour of uninterrupted discourse with his companion it struck him as having more advantages than any other mentioned the party near the mills too remaining perfectly quiet there was less occasion for any change of their own than might otherwise have been the case so far indeed from appearing to entertain any hostile intention not a cabin had been injured if approached and the smoke of the conflagration which had been expected to rise from the mills and the habitations in the glen did not make its appearance if any such ruthless acts as applying the brand and assaulting the people were in contemplation they were at least delayed until night should veil them in a fitting darkness  it is always a great relief to the mind in moments of trial to have decided on a course of future action so the major and maud now found for taking his seat by her side he began to converse with his companion more connectedly and with greater calmness than either had yet been able to achieve many questions were asked and answers given concerning the state of the family that of his father and mother and dear beulah and her infant the latter being as yet quite a stranger to the young soldier  is he like his rebel of a father asked the royal officer smiling but as his companion fancied painfully or has he more of the look of the willoughbys beekman is a goodlooking dutchman yet i would rather have the boy resemble the good old english stock after all  the sweet little fellow resembles both father and mother though the first the most to beulahs great delight papa says he is true hollands come of as they call it though neither mamma nor i will allow of any such thing colonel beekman is a very worthy man bob and a most affectionate and attentive husband beulah but for this war could not be happier  then i forgive him onehalf of his treasonfor the remainder let him take his luck now i am an uncle my heart begins to melt a little towards the rebel and you maud how do the honours of an aunt sit upon your feelings but women are all heart and would love a rat  maud smiled but she answered not though beulahs child were almost as dear to her as one of her own could have been she remembered that she was not its aunt in fact and though she knew not why in that company and even at that grave moment the obtrusive thought summoned a bright flush to her cheeks the major probably did not notice this change of countenance since after a short pause he continued the conversation naturally  the child is called evert is it not aunt maud he asked laying an emphasis on aunt  maud wished this word had not been used and yet robert willoughby could the truth have been known had adverted to it with an association in his own mind that would have distressed her just then still more aunt maud was the name that others however were most fond of adopting since the birth of the child and remembering this our heroine smiled  that is what beulah has called me these six months she saidor ever since evert was born i became an aunt the day he became a nephew and dear good beulah has not once called me sister since i think  these little creatures introduce new ties into families answered the major thoughtfully they take the places of the generations before them and edge us out of our hold on the affections as in the end they supplant us in our stations in life if beulah love me only as an uncle however she may look to it ill be supplanted by no dutchmans child that was ever born  you bob cried maud starting you are its real uncle beulah must ever remember you and love you as her own brother  mauds voice became suddenly hushed like one who feared she had said too much the major gazed at her intently but he spoke not nor did his companion see his look her own eyes being cast meekly and tremblingly on the earth at her feet a considerable pause succeeded and then the conversation reverted to what was going on in the valley  the sun was now set and the shadows of evening began to render objects a little indistinct beneath them still it was apparent that much anxiety prevailed in and about the hut doubtless on account of our heroines absence so great was it indeed as entirely to supersede the hanging of the remaining leaf of the gate which stood in the gap where it belonged stayed by pieces of timber but unhung the major thought some disposition had been made however by which the inmates might pass and repass by the half that was suspended making a tolerable defence when all was closed  hist whispered maud whose faculties were quickened by the danger of her companion i hear the voice of michael and they approach no sense of danger can repress poor ohearns eloquence his ideas seeming to flow from his tongue very much as they rise to his thoughts chance directing which shall appear first  it is true dear girl and as you seem so strongly to wish it i will withdraw depend on my keeping near you and on my presence should it be required  you will not forget to come beneath the windows bob said maud anxiously but in great haste for the footsteps of the men drew rapidly near at the very spot where the others descended  the major bent forward and kissed a cheek that was chilled with apprehension but which the act caused to burn like fire then he disappeared behind the projection of rock he had himself pointed out as for maud she sat in seeming composure awaiting the approach of those who drew near  the divil burrn me and all the injins in ameriky along wid me said mike scrambling up the ascent by a short cut but i think well find the young missus here or i dont think well be finding her the night its a cursed counthry to live in misther strides where a young lady of the loveliness and pithiful beauty of miss maud can be lost in the woods as it might be a sheep or a stray baste that was for tasting the neighbours pastures  you speak too loud mike and you speak foolishness into the bargain returned the wary joel  is it i you mane och dont think ye re goin to set me a rowin a boat once more agin my inclinations and edication as ye did in ould times ive rung ye into yer matin and out of yer matin too twenty times too often to be catched in that same trap twice its miss maud i wants and miss maud ill find or  lord bless her swate face and morals and her charackter and all belonging to her isnt that now a prathy composure for the likes of her and the savages at the mill and the missus in tears and the masther mighty unasy and all of us bothered see how she sits on that bit of a sate that i puts there for her wid my own hands as a laddy should looking jist what she is the quane of the woods and the delight of our eyes  maud was too much accustomed to the rhapsodies of the county leitrim man to think much of this commencement but resolute to act her part with discretion she rose to meet him speaking with great apparent selfpossession  is it possible you are in quest of me she saidwhy has this happenedi usually return about this hour  hoors is it dont talk of hoors beauthiful young laddy when a single quarther may be too late answered mike dogmatically its your own mother thats not happy at yer being in the woods the night and yer ould father that has moore unasiness than hell confess long life to the church in which confession is held to be right and dacent and accorthing to the gospel of st luke and the whole calender in the bargain yell not be frightened miss maud but take what ive to tell ye jist as if ye didnt belave a worrd of it but divil burrn me if there arnt injins enough on the rocks forenent the mill to scalp a whole province and a county along wid it if yell give em time and knives enough  i understand you michael but am not in the least alarmed answered maud with an air of great steadiness such indeed as would have delighted the captain something of what has been passing below have i seen but by being calm and reasonable we shall escape the danger tell me only that all is safe in the hutthat my dear mother and sister are well  is it the missus och shes as valiant as a peacock only strick down and overcome about your own self as for miss beuly wheres the likes of her to be found unless its on this same bit of a rock and its agraable to see the captain looking for all the worrld like a commanderinchaif of six or eight rijiments ordering one thisaway and another thatawayby st patrick young laddy i only hopes them vagabonds will come on as soon as yourself is inside the sticks jist to give the ould jontleman a better occasion to play souldier on em should they happen to climb over the sticks ive got the prattiest bit of a shillaleh ready that mortal eyes iver adorned twould break a head and niver a hat harmeda thousands the pities them chaps wears no hats howsever well see  thank you mike for the courage you show and the interest you take in all our welfaresis it not too soon to venture down upon the flats joel i must trust to you as a guide  i think miss maud would do full as well if she did mike must be told too not to talk so much and above all not to speak so loud he may be heard sometimes a dozen rods  tould exclaimed the county leitrimman in heatand isnt tould ive been twenty times already by your own smooth conversation wheres the occasion to tell a thing over and over agin when a man is not wanting in ears its the likes of you that loves to convarse  well mike for my sake you will be silent i hope said maud remember i am not fitted for a battle and the first thing is to get safely into the house the sooner we are down the hill perhaps the better it may be lead the way then joel and i will follow michael will go next to you in readiness for any enemy and i will bring up the rear it will be better for all to keep a dead silence until it be necessary to speak  this arrangement was made and the party proceeded maud remaining a little behind in order that the major might catch glimpses of her person in the sombre light of the hour and the forest and not miss the road a few minutes brought them all upon the level land where joel instead of entering the open fields inclined more into the woods always keeping one of the many paths his object was to cross the rivulet under cover a suitable place offering a short distance from the point where the stream glided out of the forest towards this spot joel quietly held his way occasionally stopping to listen if any movement of importance had occurred on the flats as for maud her eyes were frequently cast behind her for she was fearful robert willoughby might miss the path having so little acquaintance with the thousand sinuosities he encountered she caught glimpses of his person however in the distance and saw that he was on the right track her chief concern therefore soon became an anxiety that he should not be seen by her companions as they kept a little in advance and the underbrush was somewhat thick she had strong hopes that this evil would be avoided  the path being very circuitous it took some time to reach the spot joel sought here he mike and maud crossed the rivulet on a tree that had been felled expressly to answer the purposes of a rustic foot bridge a common expedient of the american forest as our heroine had often performed this exploit when alone she required no assistance and she felt as if half the danger of her critical situation had vanished when she found herself on the same side of the stream as the hut joel nothing suspecting and keeping all his faculties on the sounds and sights that might occur in front led the way diligently and soon reached the verge of the woods here he paused for his companions to join him  twilight had by this time nearly disappeared still enough remained to enable maud to perceive that many were watching for her either at the windows above the cliff or through different parts of the stockades the distance was so small that it might have been possible by raising the voice even to converse but this would be an experiment too hazardous as some hostile scouts at that hour might very well be fearfully near  i see nothing miss maud observed joel after taking a good look around him by keeping the path that follows the edge of the brook though it is so crooked we shall be certain of good walking and shall be half hid by the bushes its best to walk quick and to be silent  maud bade him go on waiting herself behind a tree to let the two men precede her a short distance this was done and the major stole up to her side unseen a few words of explanation passed when the young lady ran after her guides leaving robert willoughby seated on a log it was a breathless moment to maud that in which she was passing this bit of open land but the distance was so short that it was soon gotten over and the three found themselves beneath the cliff here they passed the spring and following a path which led from it turned the edge of the rocks and ascended to the foot of the stockades it remained to turn these also in order to reach the so recently suspended gates as maud passed swiftly along almost brushing the timbers with her dress she saw in the dim light fifty faces looking at her and thrust between the timbers but she paused not spoke notscarcely breathed a profound stillness reigned on the knoll but when joel arrived at the gate it was instantly opened and he glided in not so with mike who stopped and waited until she he had been in quest of entered before him and was in safety  maud found herself in her mothers arms the instant the gate was passed mrs willoughby had been at the angle of the cliff had followed her child in her swift progress round the stockade and was ready to receive her the moment she entered beulah came next and then the captain embraced kissed wept over and scolded his little favourite  no reproaches now hughsaid the more considerate wife and gentle womanmaud has done no more than has long been her custom and no one could have foreseen what has happened  motherfathersaid maud almost gasping for breathlet us bless god for my safety and for the safety of all that are dear to usthank you dear mr woodsthere is a kiss to thank younow let us go into the house i have much to tell youcome dear sircome dearest mother do not lose a moment let us all go to the library  as this was the room in which the family devotions were usually held the auditors fancied the excited girl wished to return her thanks in that mode one not unfrequent in that regulated family and all followed her who dared with tender sympathy in her feelings and profoundly grateful for her safety as soon as in the room maud carefully shut the door and went from one to another in order to ascertain who were present finding none but her father mother sister and the chaplain she instantly related all that had passed and pointed out the spot where the major was at that moment waiting for the signal to approach it is unnecessary to dwell on the astonishment and delight mingled with concern that this intelligence produced  maud then rapidly recounted her plan and implored her father to see it executed the captain had none of her apprehensions on the subject of his peoples fidelity but he yielded to the girls earnest entreaties mrs willoughby was so agitated with all the unlookedfor events of the day that she joined her daughter in the request and maud was told to proceed with the affair in her own way  a lamp was brought and placed by maud in a pantry that was lighted by a single long narrow external window at the angle of the building next the offices and the door was closed on it this lamp was the signal for the major to approach and with beating hearts the females bent forward from the windows secure of not being seen in the night which had now fairly closed on the valley to listen to his approaching footsteps beneath they did not wait long ere he was not only heard but dimly seen though totally out of the line of sight from all in the hut with the exception of those above his head captain willoughby had prepared a rope one end of which was dropped and fastened by the major himself around his body a jerk let those above know when he was ready  what shall we do next asked the captain in a sort of despair woods and i can never drag that tall heavy fellow up such a distance he is six feet and weighs a hundred and eighty if he weighs a pound  peace halfwhispered maud from a window all will be right in a moment then drawing in her body the pale but earnest girl begged her father to have patience i have thought of all mike and the blacks may be trusted with our livesi will call them  this was done and the county leitrimman and the two plinys were soon in the room  ohearn said maud inquiringlyi think you are my friend  am i my ownis it yees is the question well jist wish for a tooth and ye may take all in my head for the asking och i d be a baste else id ate the remain of my days wid noting but a spoon to obleege ye  as for you pliny and your son here you have known us from children not a word must pass the lips of either as to what you seenow pull but with great care lest the rope break  the men did as ordered raising their load from the ground a foot or two at a time in this manner the burthen approached yard after yard until it was evidently drawing near the window  its the captain hoisting up the big baste of a hog for provisioning the hoose agin a saige whispered mike to the negroes who grinned as they tugged and when the cratur squails see to it that ye do not squail yerselves  at that moment the head and shoulders of a man appeared at the window mike let go the rope seized a chair and was about to knock the intruder on the head but the captain arrested the blow  its one of the vagabond injins that has undermined the hog and coome up in its stead roared mike  its my sonanswered the captain mildlysee that you are silent and secret      chapter xiii    and glory long has made the sages smile   tis something nothing words illusion wind   depending more upon the historians style   than on the name a person leaves behind   troy owes to homer what whist owes to hoyle   the present century was growing blind   to the great marlboroughs skill in giving knocks   until his late life by archdeacon coxe    byron  major willoughbys feet were scarcely on the library floor when he was clasped in his mothers arms from these he soon passed into beulahs nor did his father hesitate about giving him an embrace nearly as warm as for maud she stood by weeping in sympathy and in silence  and you too old man said robert willoughby dashing the tears from his eyes and turning to the elder black holding out a handthis is not the first time by many old pliny that you have had me between heaven and earth your son was my old playfellow and we must shake hands also as for ohearn steel is not truer and we are friends for life  the negroes were delighted to see their young master for in that day the slaves exulted in the honour appearance importance and dignity of their owners far more than their liberated descendants do now in their own the major had been their friend when a boy and he was at present their pride and glory in their view of the matter the english army did not contain his equal in looks courage military skill or experience and it was treason per se to fight against a cause that he upheld the captain had laughingly related to his wife a conversation to this effect he had not long before overheard between the two plinys  well miss beuly do a pretty wellobserved the elder but den he alle better if he no get merican mission what you call raal colonel eh have e paper from e king like masser bob and wear a rigimental like a head of a turkey cock so dat bein an up and down officer  prhaps miss beuly bring a colonel round and take off a blue coat and put on a scarlet answered the younger  nebbernebber see dat plin in a rebbleushun dis got to be a rebbleushun and when dat begin in arnest gib up all idee of mendment rebbleushuns look all one waynebber see two side any more dan coloured man see two side in a redskin  as we have not been able to trace the thought to antiquity this expression may have been the original of the celebrated axiom of napoleon which tells us that revolutions never go backwards at all events such was the notion of pliny willoughby sen as the namesake of the great roman styled himself and it was greatly admired by pliny willoughby jun to say nothing of the opinions of big smash and little smash both of whom were listeners to the discourse  well i wish a colonel beekmanto this name the fellow gave the true doric sound of bakemani wish a colonel beekman only corprul in kings troops for miss beulys sake better be sarjun dere dan briggerdeerginral in merikan company dat i know  what a briggerdeer mean plin inquired little smash with interest who he keep company wid and what he do tell a body doso many officer in e army one nebber know all he name  mericans cant hab em too poor for dat briggerdeer great gentleum and wear a red coat ole time see em in hundreds come to visit masser and missus and play wid masser bob oh no rebbleushun in dem days but ebbery body know he own business and do it too  this will serve to show the political sentiments of the plinys and may also indicate the bias that the smashes were likely to imbibe in such company as a matter of course the major was gladly welcomed by these devoted admirers and when maud again whispered to them the necessity of secresy each shut his mouth no trifling operation in itself as if it were to be henceforth hermetically sealed  the assistants were now dismissed and the major was left alone with his family again and again mrs willoughby embraced her son nor had her new ties at all lessened beulahs interest in her brother even the captain kissed his boy anew while mr woods shook hands once more with his old pupil and blessed him maud alone was passive in this scene of feeling and joy  now bob let us to business said the captain as soon as tranquillity was a little restored you have not made this difficult and perilous journey without an object and as we are somewhat critically situated ourselves the sooner we know what it is the less will be the danger of its not producing its proper effect  heaven send dear sir that it fail not in its effect indeed answered the son but is not this movement in the valley pressing and have i not come opportunely to take a part in the defence of the house  that will be seen a few hours later perhaps everything is quiet now and will probably so remain until near morning or indian tactics have undergone a change the fellows have lighted campfires on their rocks and seem disposed to rest for the present at least nor do i know that they are bent on war at all we have no indians near us who would be likely to dig up the hatchet and these fellows profess peace by a messenger they have sent me  are they not in their warpaint sir i remember to have seen warriors when a boy and my glass has given these men the appearance of being on what they call a warpath  some of them are certainly in that guise though he who came to the knoll was not he pretended that they were a party travelling towards the hudson in order to learn the true causes of the difficulties between their great english and their great american fathers he asked for meal and meat to feed his young men with this was the whole purport of his errand  and your answer sir is it peace or war between you  peace in professions but i much fear war in reality still one cannot know an old frontier garrisonman like myself is not apt to put much reliance on indian faith we are now god be praised all within the stockade and having plenty of arms and ammunition are not likely to be easily stormed a siege is out of the question we are too well provisioned to dread that  but you leave the mills the growing grain the barns even the cabins of your workmen altogether at the mercy of these wretches  that cannot well be avoided unless we go out and drive them off in open battle for the last they are too strong to say nothing of the odds of risking fathers of families against mere vagabonds as i suspect these savages to be i have told them to help themselves to meal or grain of which they will find plenty in the mill pork can be got in the houses and they have made way with a deer already that i had expected the pleasure of dissecting myself the cattle roam the woods at this season and are tolerably safe but they can burn the barns and other buildings should they see fit in this respect we are at their mercy if they ask for rum or cider that may bring matters to a head for refusing may exasperate them and granting either in any quantity will certainly cause them all to get intoxicated  why would not that be good policy willoughby exclaimed the chaplain if fairly disguised once our people might steal out upon them and take away all their arms drunken men sleep very profoundly  it would be a canonical mode of warfare perhaps woods returned the chaplain smiling but not exactly a military i think it safer that they should continue sober for as yet they manifest no great intentions of hostility but of this we can speak hereafter why are you here my son and in this guise  the motive may as well be told now as at another time answered the major giving his mother and sisters chairs while the others imitated their example in being seated sir william howe has permitted me to come out to see youi might almost say ordered me out for matters have now reached a pass when we think every loyal gentleman in america must feel disposed to take sides with the crown  a general movement among his auditors told the major the extent of the interest they felt in what was expected to follow he paused an instant to survey the darklooking group that was clustering around him for no lights were in the room on account of the open windows and he spoke in a low voice from motives of prudence then he proceeded  i should infer from the little that passed between maud and myself he said that you are ignorant of the two most important events that have yet occurred in this unhappy conflict  we learn little here answered the father i have heard that my lord howe and his brother sir william have been named commissioners by his majesty to heal all the differences i knew them both when young men and their elder brother before them black dick as we used to call the admiral is a discreet wellmeaning man though i fear both of them owe their appointments more to their affinity to the sovereign than to the qualities that might best fit them to deal with the americans  little is known of the affinity of which you speak and less said in the army returned the major but i fear there is no hope of the object of the commissions being effected the american congress has declared the colonies altogether independent of england and so far as this country is concerned the war is carried on as between nation and nation all allegiance even in name is openly cast aside     the mother of the three lords howe so well known in american   history viz george killed before ticonderoga in the war of   56 richard the celebrated admiral and the hero of the 1st   june and sir william for several years commanderinchief in   this country and the 5th and last viscount was a mademoiselle   kilmansegge who was supposed to be a natural daughter of george i   this would make these three officers and george ii firstcousins   and george iii their greatnephew a la mode de bretagne   walpole and various other english writers speak openly not only of   the connection but of the family resemblance indeed most of the   gossiping writers of that age seem to allow that lord howe was a   grandson of the first english sovereign of the house of brunswick  you astonish me bob i did not think it could ever come to this  i thought your native attachments would hardly endure as strong a measure as this has got to be answered the major not a little satisfied with the strength of feeling manifested by his father yet has this been done sir and done in a way that it will not be easy to recall those who now resist us resist for the sake of throwing off all connection with england  has france any agency in this bobi own it startles me and has a french look  it has driven many of the most respectable of our enemies into our arms sir we have never considered you a direct enemy though unhappily inclining too much against us but this will determine sir hugh said the commanderinchief in our closing interviewi suppose you know my dear father that all your old friends knowing what has happened insist on calling you sir hugh i assure you i never open my lips on the subject and yet lord howe drank to the health of sir hugh willoughby openly at his own table the last time i had the honour to dine with him  then the next time he favours you with an invitation bob be kind enough to thank him i want no empty baronetcy nor do i ever think of returning to england to live were all i had on earth drummed together it would barely make out a respectable competency for a private gentleman in that extravagant state of society and what is a mere name to one in such circumstances i wish it were transferable my dear boy in the old scotch mode and you should be sir bob before you slept  but willoughby it may be useful to robert and why should he not have the title since neither you nor i care for it asked the considerate mother  so he may my dear though he must wait for an event that i fancy you are not very impatient to witnessmy death when i am gone let him be sir robert in welcome but bobfor plain honest bob must you remain till then unless indeed you earn your spurs in this unhappy warhave you any military tidings for us we have heard nothing since the arrival of the fleet on the coast  we are in new york after routing washington on long island the rebelsthe major spoke a little more confidently than had been his wontthe rebels have retreated into the high country near the borders of connecticut where they have inveterate nests of the disaffected in their rear  and has all this been done without bloodshed washington had staff in him in the old french business  his stuff is not doubted sir but his men make miserable work of it really i am sometimes ashamed of having been born in the country these yankees fight like wrangling women rather than soldiers  hows thisyou spoke honestly of the affair at lexington and wrote us a frank account of the murderous work at bunker hill have their natures changed with the change of season  to own the truth sir they did wonders on the hill and not badly in the other affair but all their spirit seems gone i am quite ashamed of them perhaps this declaration of independence as it is called has damped their ardour  no my sonthe change if change there is depends on a general and natural law nothing but discipline and long training can carry men with credit through a campaign in the open field fathers and husbands and brothers and lovers make formidable enemies in sight of their own chimneytops but the most flogging regiments we used to say were the best fighting regiments for a long pull but have a care bob you are now of a rank that may well get you a separate command and do not despise your enemy i know these yankees wellyou are one yourself though only halfblooded but i know them well and have often seen them tried they are very apt to be badly commanded heaven cursing them for their sins in this form more than any other but get them fairly at work and the guards will have as much as they can wish to get along with woods will swear to that  objecting to the mode of corroboration my dear sir i can support its substance inclined as i am to uphold c√¶sar and to do honour to the lords anointed i will not deny my countrymens courage though i think willoughby now i recall old times it was rather the fashion of our officers to treat it somewhat disrespectfully  it was indeed answered the captain thoughtfullyand a silly thing it was they mistook the nature of a mild and pacific people totally without the glitter and habits of military life for a timid people and i have often heard the new hands in the colonies speak of their inhabitants with contempt on this very head braddock had that failing to a great degree and yet this very major washington saved his army from annihilation when it came to truly desperate work mark the words of a much older soldier than yourself bob you may have more of the bravery of apparel and present a more military aspect may even gain advantages over them by means of higher discipline better arms and more accurate combinations but when you meet them fairly depend on it you will meet dangerous foes and men capable of being sooner drilled into good soldiers than any nation i have met with their great curse is and probably will be in selecting too many of their officers from classes not embued with proper military pride and altogether without the collaterals of a good military education  to all this the major had nothing very material to object and remembering that the silent but thoughtful beulah had a husband in what he called the rebel ranks he changed the subject arrangements were now made for the comfort and privacy of the unlookedfor guest adjoining the library a room with no direct communication with the court by means of either door or window was a small and retired apartment containing a cotbed to which the captain was accustomed to retire in the cases of indisposition when mrs willoughby wished to have either of her daughters with herself on their account or on her own this room was now given to the major and in it he would be perfectly free from every sort of intrusion he might eat in the library if necessary though all the windows of that wing of the house opening outward there was little danger of being seen by any but the regular domestics of the family all of whom were to be let into the secret of his presence and all of whom were rightly judged to be perfectly trustworthy  as the evening promised to be dark it was determined among the gentlemen that the major should disguise himself still more than he was already and venture outside of the building in company with his father and the chaplain as soon as the people who were now crowded into the vacant rooms in the empty part of the house had taken possession of their respective quarters for the night in the meantime a hearty supper was provided for the traveller in the library the bulletproof windowshutters of which room and indeed of all the others on that side of the building having first been closed in order that lights might be used without drawing a shot from the adjoining forest  we are very safe here observed the captain as his son appeased his hunger with the keen relish of a traveller even woods might stand a siege in a house built and stockaded like this every window has solid bulletproof shutters with fastenings not easily broken and the logs of the buildings might almost defy roundshot the gates are all up one leaf excepted and that leaf stands nearly in its place well propped and supported in the morning it shall be hung like the others then the stockade is complete and has not a speck of decay about it yet we shall keep a guard of twelve men up the whole night with three sentinels outside of the buildings and all of us will sleep in our clothes and on our arms my plan should an assault be made is to draw in the sentinels as soon as they have discharged their pieces to close the gate and man the loops the last are all open and spare arms are distributed at them i had a walk made within the ridge of the roofs this spring by which men can run round the whole hut in the event of an attempt to set fire to the shingles or fire over the ridge at an enemy at the stockades it is a great improvement bob and as it is well railed will make a capital station in a warm conflict before the enemy make their way within the stockade  we must endeavour not to let them get there sir answered the majorbut as soon as your people are housed i shall have an opportunity to reconnoitre open work is most to the taste of us regulars  not against an indian enemy you will be glad of such a fortress as this boy before the question of independence or no independence shall be finally settled did not washington entrench in the town  not much on that side of the water sir though he was reasonably well in the ground on long island there he had many thousands of men and works of some extent  and how did he get off the island demanded the captain turning round to look his son in the face the arm of the sea is quite halfa mile in width at that pointhow did he cross it in the face of a victorious armyor did he only save himself while you captured his troops  the major coloured a little and then he looked at beulah and smiled goodnaturedly  i am so surrounded by rebels here he said that it is not easy to answer all your questions sir beat him we did beyond a question and that with a heavy loss to his armyand out of new york we have driven him beyond a questionbuti will not increase beulahs conceit by stating any more  if you can tell me anything kind of evert bob you will act like a brother in so doing said the gentle wife  ay beekman did well too they said i heard some of our officers extolling a charge he made and to own the truth i was not sorry to be able to say he was my sisters husband since a fierce rebel she would marry all our news of him is to his credit and now i shall get a kiss for my pains  the major was not mistaken with a swelling heart but smiling countenance his sister threw herself into his arms when she kissed and was kissed until the tears streamed down her cheeks  it was of washington i intended to speak sir resumed the major dashing a tear or two from his own eyes as beulah resumed her chair his retreat from the island is spoken of as masterly and has gained him great credit he conducted it in person and did not lose a man i heard sir william mention it as masterly  then by heaven america will prevail in this contest exclaims i the captain striking his fist upon the table with a suddenness and force that caused all in the room to start if she has a general who can effect such a movement skilfully the reign of england is over here why woods xenophon never did a better thing the retreat of the ten thousand was boys play to getting across that water besides your victory could have been no great matter bob or it would never have been done  our victory was respectable sir while i acknowledge that the retreat was great no one among us denies it and washington is always named with respect in the army  in a minute more big smash came in under the pretence of removing the dishes but in reality to see master bob and to be noticed by him she was a woman of sixty the mother of little smash herself a respectable matron of forty and both had been born in the household of mrs willoughbys father and had rather more attachment for any one of her children than for all of their own though each had been reasonably prolific the sobriquets had passed into general use and the real names of bess and mari were nearly obsolete still the major thought it polite to use the latter on the present occasion  upon my word mrs bess he said shaking the old woman cordially by the hand though he instinctively shrunk back from the sight of a pair of lips that were quite ultra in the way of pouting which used often to salute him twenty years beforeupon my word mrs bess you improve in beauty everytime i see you old age and you seem to be total strangers to each other how do you manage to remain so comely and so young  god send e fus masser bob heabben be praise and a good conscience do e las i do wish you could make ole plin hear dat he nebber tink any good look nowaday in a ole wench  pliny is half blind but that is the way with most husbands smash they become blind to the charms of their spouses after a few years of matrimony  nebber get marry masser bob if dat be e way  then great smash gave such a laugh and such a swing of her unwieldy body that one might well have apprehended her downfall but no such thing she maintained the equilibrium for renowned as she had been all her life at producing havoc among plates and cups and bowls she was never known to be thrown off her own centre of gravity another hearty shake of the hand followed and the major quitted the table as was usual on all great and joyous occasions in the family when the emotions reached the kitchen that evening was remarkable for a smash in which half the crockery that had just been brought from the table fell an unresisting sacrifice this produced a hot discussion between the big and the little as to the offender which resulted as so often happens in these inquiries into the accidents of domestic life in the conclusion that nobody was alone to blame  how e tink he can come back and not a plate crack exclaimed little smash in a vindicatory tone she being the real delinquentget in e winder too lor dat enough to break all e dish in e house and in e mill too i do wish ebbery plate we got was an injinden you see fun can nebber like injin em so red and so sabbage  nebber talk of injin now answered the indignant motherbetter talk of plate dis make forty tousand dish you break mari sin you war a young woman spose you tink masser made of plate dat you break em up so dat what ole plin sayde nigger he say all men made of clay and plate made of clay toowell bot clay and bot break all on us wessels and all on us break to pieces some day and den deyll trow us away too  a general laugh succeeded this touch of morality great smash being a little addicted to ethical remarks of this nature after which the war was renewed on the subject of the broken crockery nor did it soon cease wrangling laughing singing toiling a lightheartedness that knew no serious cares and affection making up the sum of the everyday existence of these semicivilized beings the presence of the party in the valley however afforded the subject of an episode for a negro has quite as much of the de haut en bas in his manner of viewing the aborigines as the whites have in their speculations on his own race mingled with this contempt notwithstanding was a very active dread neither of the plinys nor of their amiable consorts in the least relishing the idea of being shorn of the wool with shears as penetrating as the scalpingknife after a good deal of discussion on this subject the kitchen arrived at the conclusion that the visit of the major was ordered by providence since it was out of all the rules of probability and practice to have a few halfclad savages get the better of masser bob who was born a soldier and had so recently been fighting for the king  on the latter subject we ought to have stated that the captains kitchen was ultraloyal the rude but simple beings it contained had a reverence for rank and power that even a rebbelushun could not disturb and which closely associated in their minds royal authority with divine power next to their own master they considered george iii as the greatest man of the age and there was no disposition in them to rob him of his rights or his honours  you seem thoughtful woods said the captain while his son had retired to his own room in order to assume a disguise less likely to attract attention in the garrison than a huntingshirt is it this unexpected visit of bobs that furnishes food for reflection  not so much his visit my dear willoughby as the news he brings us god knows what will befall the church should this rebellion make serious head the country is in a dreadful way already on the subject of religion but it will be far worse if these canters get the upper hand of the government  the captain was silent and thoughtful for a moment then he laughingly replied  fear nothing for the church chaplain it is of god and will outlast a hundred political revolutions  i dont know that willoughbyi dont know thatthe chaplain did not exactly mean what he saidtwouldnt surprise me if we had taking up collections sitting under preaching providentially happening exercised in mind and our zion finding their way into dictionaries  quite likely woodsreturned the captain smilingliberty is known to produce great changes in things why not in language  liberty indeed yes liberty in prayer is another of their phrases well captain willoughby if this rebellion should succeed we may give up all hopes for the church what sort of government shall we have do you imagine sir  republican of course answered the captain again becoming thoughtful as his mind reverted to the important results that were really dependent on the present state of things republicanit can be no other these colonies have always had a strong bias in that direction and they want the elements necessary to a monarchy new york has a landed gentry it is true and so has maryland and virginia and the carolinas but they are not strong enough to set up a political aristocracy or to prop a throne and then this gentry will probably be much weakened by the struggle half the principal families are known to be with the crown as it is and new men will force them out of place in a revolution no woods if this revolution prosper the monarchy is done in america for at least a century  and the prayers for the king and royal familywhat will become of them  i should think they must cease also i question if a people will continue long to pray for authorities that they refuse to obey  i shall stick to the rubrics as long as i have a tongue in my head i trust willoughby you will not stop these prayers in your settlement  it is the last mode in which i should choose to show hostility still you must allow it is a little too much to ask a congregation to pray that the king shall overcome his enemies when they are among those very enemies the question presents a dilemma  and yet i have never failed to read that prayer as well as all the rest you have not objected hitherto  i have not for i have considered the war as being waged with parliament and the ministers whereas it is now clearly with the king this paper is certainly a plain and forcible document  and what is that paper not the westminster confession of faith or the saybrook platform i hope one of which will certainly supersede the thirtynine articles in all our churches if this rebellion prosper  it is the manifesto issued by congress to justify their declaration of independence bob has brought it with him as a proof how far matters have been carried but really it seems to be a creditable document and is eloquently reasoned  i see how it is willoughbyi see how it is we shall find you a rebel general yet and i expect to live to hear you talk about our zion and providential accidents  neither woods for the first i am too old and for the last i have too much taste i trust whether i shall always pray for the king is another matter but here is the major ready for his sortie upon my word his masquerade is so complete i hardly know him myself      chapter xiv    he could not rest he could not stay   within his tent to wait for day   but walked him forth along the sand   where thousand sleepers strewed the strand    siege of corinth  it was now so late that most of the men of the hut and all the women and children were housed for the night provided no alarm occurred there was consequently little risk in the majors venturing forth disguised as he was should care be taken not to approach a light the great number of the latter streaming through the windows of the western wing of the building showed how many were now collected within the walls and gave an unusual appearance of life and animation to the place still the court was clear the men seeking their pallets in readiness for their coming watches while the women were occupied with those great concerns of female life the care of children  the captain major and chaplain each carrying a rifle and the two former pistols moved rapidly across the court and passed the gate the moveable leaf of the latter was left unbarred it being the orders of the captain to the sentinels without on the approach of an enemy to retire within the court and then to secure the fastenings  the night was starlight and it was cool as is common to this region of country there being neither lamp nor candle on the exterior of the house even the loops being darkened there was little danger in moving about within the stockades the sentinels were directed to take their posts so near the palisades as to command views of the open lawn without a precaution that would effectually prevent the usual stealthy approach of an enemy without discovery as the alarm had been very decided these irregular guardians of the house were all at their posts and exceedingly watchful a circumstance that enabled the captain to avoid them and thus further remove the danger of his sons being recognised he accordingly held himself aloof from the men keeping within the shadows of the sides of the hut  as a matter of course the first object to which our two soldiers directed their eyes was the rock above the mill the indians had lighted fires and were now apparently bivouacked at no great distance from them having brought boards from below with that especial object why they chose to remain in this precise position and why they neglected the better accommodations afforded by some fifteen or twenty logcabins that skirted the western side of the valley in particular were subjects of conjecture that they were near the fires the board shanties proved and that they were to the last degree careless of the proximity of the people of the place would seem also to be apparent in the fact that they had not posted so far as could be ascertained even a solitary sentinel  this is altogether surprising for indian tactics observed the captain in a low voice for everything that was uttered that night without the building was said in very guarded tones i have never before known the savages to cover themselves in that manner nor is it usual with them to light fires to point out the positions they occupy as these fellows seem to have done  is it not all seeming sir returned the major to me that camp if camp it can be called has an air of being deserted  there is a look about it of premeditated preparation that one ought always to distrust in war  is it not unmilitary sir for two soldiers like ourselves to remain in doubt on such a point my professional pride revolts at such a state of things and with your leave i will go outside and set the matter at rest by reconnoitring  professional pride is a good thing bob rightly understood and rightly practised but the highest point of honour with the really good soldier is to do that for which he was precisely intended some men fancy armies were got together just to maintain certain exaggerated notions of military honour whereas military honour is nothing but a moral expedient to aid in effecting the objects for which they are really raised i have known men so blinded as to assert that a soldier is bound to maintain his honour at the expense of the law and this in face of the fact that in a free country a soldier is in truth nothing but one of the props of the law in the last resort so with us we are here to defend this house and those it contains and our military honour is far more concerned in doing that effectually and by right means than in running the risk of not doing it at all in order to satisfy an abstract and untenable notion of a false code let us do what is right my son and feel no concern that our honour suffer  captain willoughby said this because he fancied it a fault in his sons character sometimes to confound the end with the means in appreciating the ethics of his profession this is not an uncommon error among those who bear arms instances not being wanting in which bodies of men that are the mere creatures of authority have not hesitated to trample the power that brought them into existence under foot rather than submit to mortify the feelings of a purely conventional and exaggerated pride the major was rebuked rather than convinced it not being the natural vocation of youth to perceive the justice of all the admonitions of age  but if one can be made auxiliary to the other sir the son remarked then you will allow that professional esprit and professional prudence may very well march hand in hand  of that there can be no doubt though i think it far wiser and more soldierlike even to use all proper precautions to guard this house under our actual circumstances than to risk anything material in order to satisfy our doubts concerning the state of that camp  but the cabins and all the property that lies exposed to fire and other accidents including the mills is it not worth your while to let me make a little excursion in order to ascertain the state of things as connected with them  perhaps it would bobreturned the father after a little reflection it would be a great point gained to send a man to look after the buildings and the horses the poor beasts may be suffering for water and as you say the first thing will be to ascertain where our wild visiters really are and what they are actually bent on woods go with us to the gate and let us out i rely on your saying nothing of our absence except to explain to the two nearest sentinels who we are and to be on the lookout for us against the moment we may return  will it not be very hazardous to be moving in front of the stockade in the dark some of our own people may fire upon you  you will tell them to be cautious and we shall use great circumspection in our turn i had better give you a signal by which we shall be known  this was done and the party moved from under the shadows of the hut down to the gate here the two soldiers halted for several minutes taking a deliberate and as thorough a survey of the scene without as the darkness permitted then the chaplain opened the gate and they issued forth moving with great caution down the lawn towards the fleets as a matter of course captain willoughby was perfectly familiar with all the lanes ditches bridges and fields of his beautiful possessions the alluvial soil that lay spread around him was principally the result of ages of deposit while the place was covered with water but as the overflowing of the water had been produced by a regular dam the latter once removed the meadows were free from the excessive moisture which generally saturates drained lands still there were two or three large open ditches to collect the water that came down the adjacent mountains or bubbled up from springs near the margin of the woods across these ditches the roads led by bridges and the whole valley was laid out in this manner equally with a view to convenience and rural beauty a knowledge of all the windings was of great use on the present occasion even on the advance while on the retreat it might clearly be the means of preserving the lives or liberties of the two adventurers  the captain did not proceed by the principal road which led from the hut to the mills the great thoroughfare of the valley since it might be watched in order to prevent a hostile sortie against the camp but he inclined to the right or to the westward in order to visit the cabins and barns in that quarter it struck him his invaders might have quietly taken possession of the houses or even have stolen his horses and decamped in this direction then he and his son proceeded using the greatest caution in their movements and occasionally stopping to examine the waning fires at the rock or to throw a glance behind them at the stockade everything remained in the quiet which renders a forest settlement so solemn and imposing after the daily movements of man have ceased the deepest and most breathless attention could not catch an unaccustomed sound even the bark of a dog was not heard all those useful animals having followed their masters into the hut as if conscious that their principal care now lay in that direction each of the sentinels had one of these animals near him crouched under the stockade in the expectation of their giving the alarm should any strange footstep approach in this manner most of the distance between the knoll and the forest was crossed when the major suddenly laid a hand on his fathers arm  here is something stirring on our left whispered the formerit seems too to be crouching under the fence  you have lost your familiarity with our rural life bob answered the father with a little more confidence of tone but still guardedly or this fragrant breath would tell you we are almost on a cow it is old whiteback i know her by her horns feel she is here in the lane with us and within reach of your hand a gentler animal is not in the settlement but stoppass your hand on her uddershe will not stir how is it full or not  if i can judge sir it is nothing remarkable in the way of size  i understand this better by jupiter boy that cow has been milked it is certain none of our people have left the house to do it since the alarm was first given this is ominous of neighbours  the major made no reply but he felt to ascertain if his arms were in a state for immediate service after a moments further pause the captain proceeded moving with increased caution not a word was now uttered for they were getting within the shadows of the orchard and indeed of the forest where objects could not well be distinguished at the distance of a very few yards a cabin was soon reached and it was found empty the fire reduced to a few embers and quite safe this was the residence of the man who had the care of the horses the stables standing directly behind it captain willoughby was a thoughtful and humane man and it struck him the animals might now be turned into a field that joined the barnyard where there was not only rich pasture but plenty of sweet running water this he determined to do at once the only danger being from the unbridled movements of cattle that must be impatient from unusual privation and a prolonged restraint  the major opened the gate of the field and stationed himself in a way to turn the animals in the desired direction while his father went into the stable to set them free the first horse came out with great deliberation being an old animal well cooled with toil at the plough and the major had merely to swing his arm to turn him into the field not so with the next however this was little better than a colt a creature in training for his masters saddle and no sooner was it released than it plunged into the yard then bounded into the field around which it galloped until it found the water the others imitated this bad example the clatter of hoofs though beaten on a rich turf soon resounding in the stillness of the night until it might be heard across the valley the captain then rejoined his son  this is a good deed somewhat clumsily done bob observed the father as he picked up his rifle and prepared to proceed an indian ear however will not fail to distinguish between the tramping of horses and a charge of foot  faith sir the noise may serve us a good turn yet let us take another look at the fires and see if this tramping has set any one in motion near them we can get a glimpse a little further ahead  the look was taken but nothing was seen while standing perfectly motionless beneath the shadows of an appletree however a sound was heard quite near them which resembled that of a guarded footstep both gentlemen drew up like sportsmen expecting the birds to rise in waiting for the sound to approach it did draw nearer and presently a human form was seen moving slowly forward in the path approaching the tree as if to get within its cover it was allowed to draw nearer and nearer until captain willoughby laid his hand from behind the trunk on the strangers shoulder demanding sternly but in a low voice who are you  the start the exclamation and the tremor that succeeded all denoted the extent of this mans surprise it was some little time even before he could recover from his alarm and then he let himself be known by his answer  massy exclaimed joel strides who ordinarily gave this doric sound to the word mercymassy captain is it you i should as soon thought of seeing a ghost what in natur has brought you out of the stockade sir  i think that is a question i might better ask you mr strides my orders were to keep the gate close and for no one to quit the court yard even until sent on post or called by an alarm  true sirquite truetrue as gospel but let us moderate a little captain and speak lower for the lord only knows whos in our neighbourhood whos that with you sirnot the rev mr woods is it  no matter who is with me he has the authority of my commands for being here whoever he may be while you are here in opposition to them you know me well enough joel to understand nothing but the simple truth will satisfy me  lord sir i am one of them that never wish to tell you anything but truth the captain has known me now long enough to understand my natur i should think so no more need be said about that  well sirgive me the reasonand see that it is given to me without reserve  yes sir the captain shall have it he knows we scrambled out of our houses this afternoon a little onthinkingly injin alarms being skeary matters it was an awful hurrying time well the captain understands too we dont work for him without receiving our wages and i have been laying up a little every year until ive scraped together a few hundred dollars in good halfjoes and i bethought me the money might be in danger should the savages begin to plunder and ive just came out to look ater the money  if this be true as i hope and can easily believe to be the case you must have the money about you joel to prove it  the man stretched forth his arm and let the captain feel a handkerchief in which sure enough there was a goodly quantity of coin this gave him credit for truth and removed all suspicion of his present excursion being made with any sinister intention the man was questioned as to his mode of passing the stockade when he confessed he had fairly clambered over it an exploit of no great difficulty from the inside as the captain had known joel too long to be ignorant of his love of money and the offence was very pardonable in itself he readily forgave the breach of orders this was the only man in the valley who did not trust his little hoard in the iron chest at the hut even the miller reposing that much confidence in the proprietor of the estate but joel was too conscious of dishonest intentions himself to put any unnecessary faith in others  all this time the major kept so far aloof as not to be recognised though joel once or twice betrayed symptoms of a desire to ascertain who he was maud had awakened suspicions that now became active in both father and son when circumstances so unexpectedly and inconveniently threw the man in their way it was consequently the wish of the former to get rid of his overseer as soon as possible previously to doing this however he saw fit to interrogate him a little further  have you seen anything of the indians since you left the stockade strides demanded the captain we can perceive no other traces of their presence than yonder fires though we think that some of them must have passed this way for whitebacks udder is empty  to own the truth captain i havent i some think that theyve left the valley though the lord only can tell when theyll be back agin such critturs be beyond calcilation they outdo arithmetic nohow as for the cow i milked her myself for being the crittur the captain has given to phoebe for her little dairy i thought it might hurt her not to be attended to the pail stands yonder under the fence and the women and children in the hut may be glad enough to see it in the morning  this was very characteristic of joel strides he did not hesitate about disobeying orders or even to risk his life in order to secure his money but determined to come out he had the forethought and care to bring a pail in order to supply the wants of those who were now crowded within the stockade and who were too much accustomed to this particular sort of food not to suffer from its absence if we add that in the midst of all this prudent attention to the wants of his companions joel had an eye to his personal popularity and what are called ulterior events and that he selected his own cow for the precise reason given the reader has certain distinctive traits of the man before him  this being the case returned the captain a good deal relieved at finding that the savages had not been the agents in this milking affair since it left the probability of their remaining stationarythis being the case joel you had better find the pail and go in as soon as day dawns however i recommend that all the cows be called up to the stockade and milked generally they are feeding in the lanes just now and will come readily if properly invited go then but say nothing of having met me and  who else did the captain say inquired joel curiously observing that the other paused  say nothing of having met us at all i tell you it is very important that my movements should be secret  the two gentlemen now moved on intending to pass in front of the cabins which lined this part of the valley by a lane which would bring them out at the general highway which led from the knoll to the mill the captain marched in front while his son brought up the rear at a distance of two or three paces each walked slowly and with caution carrying his rifle in the hollow of his arm in perfect readiness for service in this manner both had proceeded a few yards when robert willoughby felt his elbow touched and saw joels face within eighteen inches of his own as the fellow peered under his hat it was an action so sudden and unexpected that the major saw at once nothing but perfect coolness could avert his discovery  ist you danelso was the miller named what in natur has brought the old man on this tramp with the valley filled with injins whispered joel prolonging the speech in order to get a better view of a face and form that still baffled his conjectures lets know all about it  youll get me into trouble answered he major shaking off his unwelcome neighbour moving a step further from him and speaking also in a whisper the captains bent on a scout and you know hell not bear contradiction off with you then and dont forget the milk  as the major moved away and seemed determined to baffle him joel had no choice between complying and exposing his disobedience of orders to the captain he disliked doing the last for his cue was to seem respectful and attached and he was fain to submit never before however did joel strides suffer a man to slip through his fingers with so much reluctance he saw that the captains companion was not the miller while the disguise was too complete to enable him to distinguish the person or face in that day the different classes of society were strongly distinguished from each other by their ordinary attire and accustomed to see major willoughby only in the dress that belonged to his station he would not be likely to recognise him in his present guise had he even known of or suspected his visit as it was he was completely at fault satisfied it was not his friend daniel while unable to say who it was  in this doubting state of mind joel actually forgot the savages and the risks he might run from their proximity he walked as it might be mechanically to the place where he had left the pail and then proceeded slowly towards the knoll pondering at every step on what he had just seen he and the miller had secret communications with certain active agents of the revolutionists that put them in possession of facts notwithstanding their isolated position with which even their employer was totally unacquainted it is true these agents were of that low caste that never fail to attach themselves to all great political enterprises with a sole view to their own benefit still as they were active cunning and bold and had the sagacity to make themselves useful they passed in the throng of patriots created by the times and were enabled to impart to men of similar spirits much available information  it was through means like these that joel knew of the allimportant measure of the declaration of independence while it still remained a secret to captain willoughby the hope of confiscations was now active in the bosoms of all this set and many of them had even selected the portions of property that they intended should be the reward of their own love of freedom and patriotism it has been said that the english ministry precipitated the american revolution with a view to share among their favourites the estates that it was thought it would bring within the gift of the crown a motive so heinous as almost to defy credulity and which may certainly admit of rational doubts on the other hand however it is certain that individuals who will go down to posterity in company with the many justly illustrious names that the events of 1776 have committed to history were actuated by the most selfish inducements and in divers instances enriched themselves with the wrecks of estates that formerly belonged to their kinsmen or friends joel strides was of too low a class to get his name enrolled very high on the list of heroes nor was he at all ambitious of any such distinction but he was not so low that he could not and did not aspire to become the owner of the property of the hutted knoll in an ordinary state of society so high a flight would seem irrational in so low an aspirant but joel came of a people who seldom measure their pretensions by their merits and who imagine that to boldly aspire more especially in the way of money is the first great step to success the much talked of and little understood doctrine of political equality has this error to answer for in thousands of cases for nothing can be more hopeless in the nature of things than to convince a man of the necessity of possessing qualities of whose existence he has not even a faint perception ere he may justly pretend to be put on a level with the highminded the just the educated and the good joel therefore saw no other reason than the law against his becoming the great landlord as well as captain willoughby and could the law be so moulded as to answer his purposes he had discreetly resolved to care for no other considerations the thought of the consequences to mrs willoughby and her daughters gave him no concern whatever they had already possessed the advantages of their situation so long as to give phoebe and the millers wife a sort of moral claim to succeed them in a word joel in his yearnings after wealth had only faintly shadowed forth the modern favourite doctrine of rotation in office  the appearance of a stranger in company with captain willoughby could not fail therefore to give rise to many conjectures in the mind of a man whose daily and hourly thoughts were running on these important changes who can it be thought joel as he crawled along the lane bearing the milk and lifting one leg after the other as if lead were fastened to his feet danel it is notnor is it any one that i can consait on about the hut the captain is mightily strengthened by this marriage of his dater with colonel beekman thats sartain the colonel stands wonderful well with our folks and he ll not let all this firstrate land with such capital betterments go out of the family without an iffort i concludebut then i calcilate on his being killedthere must be a disperate lot on em shot afore the wars over and he is as likely to be among em as another danel thinks the colonel has the look of a shortlived man waal to morrow will bring about a knowledge of the name of the captains companion and then a body may calcilate with greater sartainty  this is but an outline of what passed through joels mind as he moved onward it will serve however to let the reader into the secret of his thoughts as well as into their ordinary train and is essentially connected with some of the succeeding events of our legend as the overseer approached the stockade his ideas were so abstracted that he forgot the risk he ran but walking carelessly towards the palisades the dogs barked and then he was saluted by a shot this effectually aroused joel who called out in his natural voice and probably saved his life by so doing the report of the rifle however produced an alarm and by the time the astounded overseer had staggered up to the gate the men were pouring out from the court armed and expecting an assault in the midst of this scene of confusion the chaplain admitted joel as much astonished as the man himself at the whole of the unexpected occurrence  it is unnecessary to say that many questions were asked joel got rid of them by simply stating that he had gone out to milk a cow by the captains private orders and that he had forgotten to arrange any signal by which his return might be known he ventured to name his employer because he knew he was not there to contradict him and mr woods being anxious to ascertain if his two friends had been seen sent the men back to their lairs without delay detaining the overseer at the gate for a minutes private discourse as the miller obeyed with the rest he asked for the pail with an eye to his own childrens comfort but on receiving it he found it empty the bullet had passed through it and the contents had escaped  did you see any thing or person strides demanded the chaplain as soon as the two were alone  lord mr woods i met the captainthe sight on him came over me amost as cruelly as the shot from the rifle for i no more expected it than i do to see you rise up to heaven in your clothes like elijah of old sure enough there was the captain himself andand  here joel sneezed repeating the word and several times in hopes the chaplain would supply the name he so much wished to hear  but you saw no savagesi know the captain is out and you will be careful not to mention it lest it get to mrs willoughbys ears and make her uneasy you saw nothing of the savages  not a bitthe critturs lie cluss enough if they havent actually tramped who did you say was with the captain mr woods  i said nothing about iti merely asked after the indians who as you say do keep themselves very close well joel go to your wife who must be getting anxious about you and be prudent  thus dismissed the overseer did not dare to hesitate but he entered the court still pondering on the late meeting  as for the two adventurers they pursued their march in silence as a matter of course they heard the report of the rifle and caught some faint sounds from the alarm that succeeded but readily comprehending the cause they produced no uneasiness the stillness which succeeded soon satisfying them that all was right by this time they were within a hundred yards of the flickering fires the major had kept a strict watch on the shanties at the report of the rifle but not a living thing was seen moving in their vicinity this induced him to think the place deserted and he whispered as much to his father  with any other enemy than an indian answered the latter you might be right enough bob but with these rascals one is never certain we must advance with a good deal of their own caution  this was done and the gentlemen approached the fires in the most guarded manner keeping the shantees between them and the light by this time however the flames were nearly out and there was no great difficulty in looking into the nearest shantee without much exposure it was deserted as proved to be the case with all the others on further examination major willoughby now moved about on the rock with greater confidence for naturally brave and accustomed to use his faculties with selfcommand in moments of trial he drew the just distinctions between real danger and unnecessary alarm the truest of all tests of courage  the captain feeling a husbands and a fathers responsibility was a little more guarded but success soon gave him more confidence and the spot was thoroughly explored the two then descended to the mills which together with the adjacent cabins they entered also and found uninjured and empty after this several other suspected points were looked at until the captain came to the conclusion that the party had retired for the night at least if not entirely making a circuit however he and his son visited the chapel and one or two dwellings on that side of the valley when they bent their steps towards the knoll  as the gentlemen approached the stockade the captain gave a loud hem and clapped his hands at the signal the gate flew open and they found themselves in company with their friend the chaplain once more a few words of explanation told all they had to say and then the three passed into the court and separated each taking the direction towards his own room the major fatigued with the toils of a long march was soon in a soldiers sleep but it was hours before his more thoughtful and still uneasy father could obtain the rest which nature so much requires      chapter xv    i could teach you   how to choose right but then i am forsworn   so will i never be so may you miss me   but if you do youll make me wish a sin   that i had been forsworn    portia  captain willoughby knew that the hour which preceded the return of light was that in which the soldier had the most to apprehend when in the field this is the moment when it is usual to attempt surprises and it was in particular the indians hour of blood orders had been left accordingly to call him at four oclock and to see that all the men of the hut were afoot and armed also notwithstanding the deserted appearance of the valley this experienced frontier warrior distrusted the signs of the times and he looked forward to the probability of an assault a little before the return of day with a degree of concern he would have been sorry to communicate to his wife and daughters  every emergency had been foreseen and such a disposition made of the forces as enabled the major to be useful in the event of an attack without exposing himself unnecessarily to the danger of being discovered he was to have charge of the defence of the rear of the hut or that part of the buildings where the windows opened outwards and michael and the two plinys were assigned him as assistants nor was the ward altogether a useless one though the cliff afforded a material safeguard to this portion of the defences it might be scaled and it will be remembered there was no stockade at all on this the northern end of the house  when the men assembled in the court therefore about an hour before the dawn robert willoughby collected his small force in the dining room the outer apartment of the suite where he examined their arms by lamplight inspected their accoutrements and directed them to remain until he issued fresh orders his father aided by serjeant joyce did the same in the court issuing out through the gate of the buildings with his whole force as soon as this duty was performed the call being general the women and children were all up also many of the former repairing to the loops while the least resolute or the less experienced of their number administered to the wants of the young or busied themselves with the concerns of the household in a word the hut at that early hour resembled a hive in activity though the different pursuits had not much affinity to the collection of honey  it is not to be supposed that mrs willoughby and her daughters still courted their pillows on an occasion like this they rose with the others the grandmother and beulah bestowing their first care on the little evert as if his life and safety were the considerations uppermost in their thoughts this seemed so natural that maud wondered she too could not feel all this absorbing interest in the child a being so totally dependent on the affection of its friends and relatives to provide for its wants and hazards in an emergency like the present  we will see to the child maud observed her mother ten or fifteen minutes after all were up and dressed do you go to your brother who will be solitary alone in his citadel he may wish too to send some message to his father go then dear girl and help to keep up poor bobs spirits  what a service for maud still she went without hesitation or delay for the habits of her whole infancy were not to be totally overcome by the natural and more engrossing sentiments of her later years she could not feel precisely the reserve and selfdistrust with one she had so long regarded as a brother as might have been the case with a stranger youth in whom she had begun to feel the interest she entertained for robert willoughby but maud did not hesitate about complying an order from her mother to her was law and she had no shame no reserves on the subject of contributing to bobs comfort or happiness  her presence was a great relief to the young man himself whom she found in the library his assistants were posted without as sentinels to keep off intruders a disposition that left him quite alone anxious and uneasy the only intercourse he could have with his father was by means of messages and the part of the building he occupied was absolutely without any communication with the court except by a single door near the offices at which he had stationed ohearn  this is kind and like yourself dearest maud exclaimed the young man taking the hand of his visiter and pressing it in both his own though he strangely neglected to kiss her cheek as he certainly would have done had it been beulahthis is kind and like yourself now i shall learn something of the state of the family how is my mother  it might have been native coyness or even coquetry that unconsciously to herself influenced mauds answer she knew not whyand yet she felt prompted to let it be understood she had not come of her own impulses  mother is well and not at all alarmed she said she and beulah are busy with little evert who crows and kicks his heels about as if he despised danger as becomes a soldiers son and has much amused even me though i am accused of insensibility to his perfections believing you might be solitary or might wish to communicate with some of us my mother desired me to come and inquire into your wants  was such a bidding required maud how long has an order been necessary to bring you to console me  that is a calculation i have never entered into bob answered maud slightly blushing and openly smiling and that in a way too to take all the sting out of her wordsas young ladies can have more suitable occupations one might think you will admit i guided you faithfully and skilfully into the hut last evening and such a service should suffice for the present but my mother tells me we have proper causes of complaint against you for having so thoughtlessly left the place of safety into which you were brought and for going strolling about the valley after we had retired in a very heedless and boyish manner  i went with my father surely i could not have been in better company  at his suggestion or at your own bob asked maud shaking her head  to own the truth it was in some degree at my own it seemed so very unmilitary for two old soldiers to allow themselves to be shut up in ignorance of what their enemies were at that i could not resist the desire to make a little sortie you must feel dear maud that our motive was your safetythe safety i mean of my mother and beulah and nil of you togetherand you ought to be the last to blame us  the tint on mauds cheek deepened as robert willoughby laid so heavy an emphasis on your safety but she could not smile on an act that risked so much more than was prudent  this is well enough as to motive she said after a pause but frightfully illjudged i should think as to the risks you do not remember the importance our dear father is to us allto my motherto beulaheven to me bob  even to you maudand why not as much to you as to any of us  maud could speak to beulah of her want of natural affinity to the family but it far exceeded her selfcommand to make a direct allusion to it to robert willoughby still it was now rarely absent from her mind the love she bore the captain and his wife and beulah and little evert coming to her heart through a more insidious and possibly tenderer tie than that of purely filial or sisterly affection it was indeed this everyday regard strangely deepened and enlivened by that collateral feeling we so freely bestow on them who are bound by natural ties to those who have the strongest holds on our hearts and which causes us to see with their eyes and to feel with their affections accordingly no reply was made to the question or rather it was answered by putting another  did you see anything after all to compensate for so much risk asked maud but not until a pause had betrayed her embarrassment  we ascertained that the savages had deserted their fires and had not entered any of the cabins whether this were done to mislead us or to make a retreat as sudden and unexpected as their inroad we are altogether in the dark my father apprehends treachery however while i confess to me it seems probable that the arrival and the departure may be altogether matters of accident the indians are in motion certainly for it is known that our agents are busy among them but it is by no means so clear that our indians would molest captain willoughbysir hugh willoughby as my father is altogether called at headquarters  have not the americans savages on their side to do us this ill office  i think not it is the interest of the rebels to keep the savages out of the struggle they have so much at risk that this species of warfare can scarcely be to their liking  and ought it to be to the liking of the kings generals or ministers either bob  perhaps not maud i do not defend it but i have seen enough of politics and war to know that results are looked to far more than principles honour and chivalry and humanity and virtue and right are freely used in terms but seldom do they produce much influence on facts victory is the end aimed at and the means are made to vary with the object  and where is all we have read togetheryes together bob for i owe you a great deal for having directed my studieswhere is all we have read about the glory and truth of the english name and cause  very much i fear maud where the glory and truth of the american name and cause will be as soon as this new nation shall fairly burst the shell and hatch its public morality there are men among us who believe in this public honesty but i do not  you are then engaged in a bad cause major willoughby and the sooner you abandon it the better  i would in a minute if i knew where to find a better rely on it dearest maud all causes are alike in this particular though one side may employ instruments as in the case of the savages that the other side finds it its interest to decry men as individuals may be and sometimes are reasonably uprightbut bodies of men i much fear never the latter escape responsibility by dividing it  still a good cause may elevate even bodies of men said maud thoughtfully  for a time perhaps but not in emergencies you and i think it a good cause my good and frowning maud to defend the rights of our sovereign lord the king beulah i have given up to the enemy but on you i have implicitly replied  beulah follows her heart perhaps as they say it is natural to women to do as for myself i am left free to follow my own opinion of my duties  and they lead you to espouse the cause of the king maud  they will be very apt to be influenced by the notions of a certain captain willoughby and wilhelmina his wife who have guided me aright on so many occasions that i shall not easily distrust their opinions on this  the major disliked this answer and yet when he came to reflect on it as reflect he did a good deal in the course of the day he was dissatisfied with himself at being so unreasonable as to expect a girl of twentyone not to think with her parents real or presumed in most matters at the moment however he did not wish further to press the point  i am glad to learn bob resumed maud looking more cheerful and smiling that you met with no one in your rash sortiefor rash i shall call it even though sanctioned by my father  i am wrong in saying that we did meet with one man and that was no less a person than your bugbear joel stridesas innocent though as meddling an overseer as one could wish to employ  robert willoughby what mean you does this man know of your presence at the knoll  i should hope notthink not here the major explained all that is known to the reader on this head when he continuedthe fellows curiosity brought his face within a few inches of mine yet i do not believe he recognised me this disguise is pretty thorough and what between his ignorance the darkness and the dress i must believe he was foiled  heaven be praised exclaimed maud breathing more freely i have long distrusted that man though he seems to possess the confidence of every one else neither my father nor my mother will see him as i see him yet to me his design to injure you is so clearso obviousi wonder often wonder that others cannot view it as i do even beulah is blind  and what do you see so clearly maud i have consented to keep myself incog in submission to your earnest request and yet to own the truth i can discover no particular reason why strides is to be distrusted more than any one else in the valleythan mike for instance  mike i would answer for his truth with my life he will never betray you bob  but why is joel so much the object of your distrustand why am i the particular subject of your apprehensions  maud felt the telltale blood flowing again to her cheeks since to give a simple and clear reason for her distrust exceeded her power it was nothing but the keen interest which she took in robert willoughbys safety that had betrayed to her the truth and as usually happens when anxiety leads the way in discoveries of this sort logical and plausible inferences are not always at command still maud not only thought herself right but in the main she was right and this she felt so strongly as to be enabled to induce others to act on her impressions  why i believe in strides sinister views is more than i may be able to explain to you in words bob she replied after a moments thought still i do believe in them as firmly as i believe in my existence his looks his questions his journeys and an occasional remark have all aided in influencing the belief nevertheless no one proof may be perfectly clear and satisfactory why you should be the subject of his plans however is simple enough since you are the only one among us he can seriously injure by betraying you he might gain some great advantage to himself  to whom can he betray me dear my father is the only person here in any authority and of him i have no cause to be afraid  yet you were so far alarmed when last here as to change your route back to boston if there were cause for apprehension then the same reason may now exist  that was when many strangers were in the valley and we knew not exactly where we stood i have submitted to your wishes however maud and shall lie perdu until there is a serious alarm then it is understood i am to be permitted to show myself in a moment of emergency my unexpected appearance among the men might have a dramatic effect and of itself give us a victory but tell me of my prospectsam i likely to succeed with my father will he be brought over to the royal cause  i think not all common inducements are lost on him his baronetcy for instance he will never assume that therefore cannot entice him then his feelings are with his adopted country which he thinks right and which he is much disposed to maintain more particularly since beulahs marriage and our late intercourse with all that set my mothers family too has much influence with him they you know are all whigs  dont prostitute the name maud whig does not mean rebel these misguided men are neither more nor less than rebels i had thought this declaration of independence would have brought my father at once to our side  i can see it has disturbed him as did the battle of bunkers hill but he will reflect a few days and decide now as he did then in favour of the americans he has english partialities bob as is natural to one born in that country but on this point his mind is very strongly american  the accursed knoll has done this had he lived in society as he ought to have done among his equals and the educated we should now see him at the headmaud i know i can confide in you  maud was pleased at this expression of confidence and she looked up in the majors face her full blue eyes expressing no small portion of the heartfelt satisfaction she experienced still she said nothing  you may well imagine the major continued that i have not made this journey entirely without an objecti mean some object more important even than to see you all the commanderinchief is empowered to raise several regiments in this country and it is thought useful to put men of influence in the colonies at their head old noll de lancey for instance so well known to us all is to have a brigade and i have a letter in my pocket offering to sir hugh willoughby one of his regiments one of the allens of pennsylvania who was actually serving against us has thrown up his commission from congress since this wicked declaration and has consented to take a battalion from the king what think you of all this will it not have weight with my father  it may cause him to reflect bob but it will not induce him to change his mind it may suit mr oliver de lancey to be a general for he has been a soldier his whole life but my father has retired and given up all thoughts of service he tells us he never liked it and has been happier here at the knoll than when he got his first commission mr allens change of opinion may be well enough he will say but i have no need of change i am here with my wife and daughters and have them to care for in these troubled times what think you he said bob in one of his conversations with us on this very subject  i am sure i cannot imaginethough i rather fear it was some wretched political stuff of the day  so far from this it was good natural feeling that belongs or ought to belong to all days and all ages answered maud her voice trembling a little as she proceeded there is my son he said one soldier is enough in a family like this he keeps all our hearts anxious and may cause them all to mourn  major willoughby was mute for quite a minute looking rebuked and thoughtful  i fear i do cause my parents concern he at length answered and why should i endeavour to increase that of my excellent mother by persuading her husband to return to the profession if this were ordinary service i could not think of it i do not know that i ought to think of it as it is  do not dear robert we are allthat is mother is often miserable on your account and why would you increase her sorrows remember that to tremble for one life is sufficient for a woman  my mother is miserable on my account answered the young man who was thinking of anything but his father at that instant does beulah never express concern for me or have her new ties completely driven her brother from her recollection i know she can scarce wish me success but she might still feel some uneasiness for an only brother we are but two  maud started as if some frightful object glared before her eyes then she sat in breathless silence resolute to hear what would come next but robert willoughby meant to pursue that idea no farther he had so accustomed himselfhad endeavoured even so to accustom himself to think of beulah as his only sister that the words escaped him unconsciously they were no sooner uttered however than the recollection of their possible effect on maud crossed his mind profoundly ignorant of the true nature of her feelings towards himself he had ever shrunk from a direct avowal of his own sentiments lest he might shock her as a sisters ear would naturally be wounded by a declaration of attachment from a brother and there were bitter moments when he fancied delicacy and honour would oblige him to carry his secret with him to the grave two minutes of frank communication might have dissipated all these scruples for ever but how to obtain those minutes or how to enter on the subject at all were obstacles that often appeared insurmountable to the young man as for maud she but imperfectly understood her own hearttrue she had conscious glimpses of its real state but it was through those sudden and ungovernable impulses that were so strangely mingled with her affections it was years indeed since she had ceased to think of robert willoughby as a brother and had begun to view him with different eyes still she struggled with her feelings as against a weakness the captain and his wife were her parents beulah her dearly dearly beloved sister little evert her nephew and even the collaterals in and about albany came in for a due share of her regard while bob though called bob as before though treated with a large portion of the confidence that was natural to the intimacy of her childhood though loved with a tenderness he would have given even his highprized commission to know was no longer thought of as a brother often did maud find herself thinking if never saying beulah may do that for beulah is his sister but it would be wrong in me i may write to him talk freely and even confidentially with him and be affectionate to him all this is right and i should be the most ungrateful creature on earth to act differently but i cannot sit on his knee as beulah sometimes does i cannot throw my arms around his neck when i kiss him as beulah does i cannot pat his cheek as beulah does when he says anything to laugh at nor can i pry into his secrets as beulah does or affects to do to tease him i should be more reserved with one who has not a drop of my blood in his veinsno not a single drop in this way indeed maud was rather fond of disclaiming any consanguinity with the family of willoughby even while she honoured and loved its two heads as parents the long pause that succeeded the majors broken sentence was only interrupted by himself  it is vexatious to be shut up here in the dark maud he said when every minute may bring an attack this side of the house might be defended by you and beulah aided and enlightened by the arm and counsels of that young son of liberty little evert whereas the stockade in front may really need the presence of men who have some knowledge of the noble art i wish there were a lookout to the front that one might at least see the danger as it approached  if your presence is not indispensable here i can lead you to my paintingroom where there is a loop directly opposite to the gate that half of the garrets has no one in it  the major accepted the proposal with joy and forthwith he proceeded to issue a few necessary orders to his subordinates before he followed maud when all was ready the latter led the way carrying a small silver lamp that she had brought with her on entering the library the reader already understands that the hut was built around a court the portion of the building in the rear or on the cliff alone having windows that opened outward this was as true of the roofs as of the perpendicular parts of the structure the only exceptions being in the loops that had been cut in the halfstory beneath the eaves of course the garrets were very extensive they were occupied in part however by small rooms with dormerwindows the latter of which opened on the court with the exception of those above the cliff it was on the roofs of these windows that captain willoughby had laid his platform or walk with a view to extinguish fires or to defend the place there were many rooms also that were lighted only by the loops and which of course were on the outer side of the buildings in addition to these arrangements the garret portions of the hut were divided into two great parts like the lower floor without any doors of communication thus below the apartments commenced at the gateway and extended along onehalf the front the whole of the east wing and the whole of the rear occupying fiveeighths of the entire structure this part contained all the rooms occupied by the family and the offices the corresponding threeeighths or the remaining half of the front and the whole of the west wing were given to visiters and were now in possession of the people of the valley as were all the rooms and garrets above them on the other hand captain willoughby with a view to keep his family to itself had excluded every one but the usual inmates from his own portion of the house garretrooms included  some of the garretrooms particularly those over the library drawing room and parlour were convenient and wellfurnished little apartments enjoying dormerwindows that opened on the meadows and forest and possessing a very tolerable elevation for rooms of that particular construction here mr woods lodged and had his study the access was by a convenient flight of steps placed in the vestibule that communicated with the court a private and narrower flight also ascended from the offices  maud now led the way up the principal stairs mike being on post at the outer door to keep off impertinent eyes followed by robert willoughby unlike most american houses the hut had few passages on its principal floor the rooms communicating en suite as a better arrangement where the buildings were so long and yet so narrow above however one side was left in open garret sometimes in front and sometimes in the rear as the light came from the court or from without into this garret then maud conducted the major passing a line of humble rooms on her right which belonged to the families of the plinys and the smashes with their connections until she reached the front range of the buildings here the order was changed along the half of the structure reserved to the use of the family the rooms being on the outer side lighted merely by the loops while opposite to them was an open garret with windows that overlooked the court  passing into the garret just mentioned maud soon reached the door of the little room she sought it was an apartment she had selected for painting on account of the light from the loop which in the morning was particularly favourable though somewhat low as she usually sat on a little stool however this difficulty was in some measure obviated and at all events the place was made to answer her purposes she kept the key herself and the room since beulahs marriage in particular was her sanctum no one entering it unless conducted by its mistress occasionally little smash was admitted with a broom though maud for reasons known to herself often preferred sweeping the small carpet that covered the centre of the floor with her own fair hands in preference to suffering another to intrude  the major was aware that maud had used this room for the last seven years it was here he had seen her handkerchief waving at the loop when he last departed and hundreds of times since had he thought of this act of watchful affection with doubts that led equally to pain or pleasure as images of merely sisterly care or of a tenderer feeling obtruded themselves these loops were four feet long cut in the usual bevelling manner through the massive timbers were glazed and had thick bulletproof inside shutters that in this room were divided in equal parts in order to give maud the proper use of the light she wanted all these shutters were now closed by command of the captain in order to conceal the lights that would be flickering through the different garrets and so far had caution become a habit that maud seldom exposed her person at night near the loop with the shutter open  on the present occasion she left the light without and threw open the upperhalf of her heavy shutter remarking as she did so that the day was just beginning to dawn  in a few minutes it will be light she added then we shall be able to see who is and who is not in the valley lookyou can perceive my father near the gate at this moment  i do to my shame maud he should not be there i am cooped up here behind timbers that are almost shotproof  it will be time for you to go to the front as you soldiers call it when there is an enemy to face you cannot think there is any danger of an attack upon the hut this morning  certainty not it is now too late if intended at all it would have been made before that streak of light appeared in the east  then close the shutter and i will bring in the lamp and show you some of my sketches we artists are thirsting always for praise and i know you have a taste bob that one might dread  this is kind of you dear maud answered the major closing the shutter for they tell me you are niggardly of bestowing such favours i hear you have got to likenesseslittle everts in particular      chapter xvi    anxious she hovers oer the web the while   reads as it grows thy figured story there   now she explains the texture with a smile   and now the woof interprets with a tear    fawcett  all mauds feelings were healthful and natural she had no exaggerated sentiments and scarcely art enough to control or to conceal any of the ordinary impulses of her heart we are not about to relate a scene therefore in which a longcherished but hidden miniature of the young man is to play a conspicuous part and to be the means of revealing to two lovers the state of their respective hearts but one of a very different character it is true maud had endeavoured to make from memory one or two sketches of bobs face but she had done it openly and under the cognizance of the whole family this she might very well do indeed in her usual character of a sister and excite no comments in these efforts her father and mother and beulah had uniformly pronounced her success to be far beyond their hopes but maud herself had thrown them all aside halffinished dissatisfied with her own labours like the author whose fertile imagination fancies pictures that defy his powers of description her pencil ever fell far short of the face that her memory kept so constantly in view this sketch wanted animation that gentleness another fire and a fourth candour in short had maud begun a thousand all would have been deficient in her eyes in some great essential of perfection still she had no secret about her efforts and halfadozen of these very sketches lay uppermost in her portfolio when she spread it and its contents before the eyes of the original  major willoughby thought maud had never appeared more beautiful than as she moved about making her little preparations for the exhibition pleasure heightened her colour and there was such a mixture of frank sisterly regard in every glance of her eye blended however with sensitive feeling and conscious womanly reserve as made her a thousand timesmeasuring amounts by the young mans sensationsmore interesting than he had ever seen her the lamp gave but an indifferent light for a gallery but it was sufficient to betray mauds smiles and blushes and each varying emotion of her charming countenance  now bob she said opening her portfolio with all her youthful frankness and confidence you know well enough i am not one of those old masters of whom you used to talk so much but your own pupilthe work of your own hands and if you find more faults than you have expected you will have the goodness to remember that the master has deserted his peaceful pursuits to go a campaigningtherethat is a caricature of your own countenance staring you in the face as a preface  this is like i should thinkwas it done from memory dear maud  how else should it be done all our entreaties have never been able to persuade you to send us even a miniature you are wrong in this bob by no accident did maud now ever call the major robert though beulah often did there was a desperate sort of familiarity in the bob that she could easily adopt but the robert had a family sound that she disliked and yet a more truly feminine creature than maud meredith did not existyou are wrong bob for mother actually pines to possess your picture in some shape or other it was this wish that induced me to attempt these things  and why has no one of them ever been finishedhere are six or eight beginnings and all more or less like i should think and not one of them more than half done why have i been treated so cavalierly miss maud  the fair artists colour deepened a little but her smile was quite as sweet as it was saucy as she replied  girlish caprice i suppose i like neither of them and of that which a woman dislikes she will have none to be candid however i hardly think there is one of them all that does you justice  nowhat fault have you to find with this this might be worked up to something very natural  it would be a natural thenit wants expression fearfully  and this which is still better that might be finished while i am here and i will give you some sittings  even mother dislikes thatthere is too much of the major of foot in it mr woods says it is a martial picture  and ought not a soldier to look like a soldier to me now that seems a capital beginning  it is not what mother or beulahor fatheror even any of us wants it is too full of bunkers hill your friends desire to see you as you appear to them not as you appear to your enemies  upon my word maud you have made great advances in the art this is a view of the knoll and the damand here is another of the mill and the waterfallall beautifully done and in watercolours too what is thishave you been attempting a sketch of yourselfthe glass must have been closely consulted my fair coquette to enable you to do this  the blood had rushed into mauds face covering it with a rich tell tale mantle when her companion first alluded to the halffinished miniature he held in his hand then her features resembled ivory as the revulsion of feeling that overcame her confusion followed for some little time she sate in breathless stillness with her looks cast upon the floor conscious that robert willoughby was glancing from her own face to the miniature and from the miniature to her face again making his observations and comparisons then she ventured to raise her eyes timidly towards his halfimploringly as if to beseech him to proceed to something else but the young man was too much engrossed with the exceedingly pretty sketch he held in his hand to understand her meaning or to comply with her wishes  this is yourself maud he criedthough in a strange sort of dresswhy have you spoilt so beautiful a thing by putting it in this masquerade  it is not myselfit is a copy ofa miniature i possess  a miniature you possessof whom can you possess so lovely a miniature and i never see it  a faint smile illumined the countenance of maud and the blood began to return to her cheeks she stretched her hand over to the sketch and gazed on it with intense feeling until the tears began to stream from her eyes  mauddear dearest maudhave i said that which pains youi do not understand all this but i confess there are secrets to which i can have no claim to be admitted  nay bob this is making too much of what after all must sooner or later be spoken of openly among us i believe that to be a copy of a miniature of my mother  of mother maudyou are beside yourselfit has neither her features expression nor the colour of her eyes it is the picture of a far handsomer woman though mother is still pretty and it is perfection  i mean of my motherof maud yeardley the wife of my father major meredith  this was said with a steadiness that surprised our heroine herself when she came to think over all that had passed and it brought the blood to her companions heart in a torrent  this is strange exclaimed willoughby after a short pause and my motherour mother has given you the original and told you this i did not believe she could muster the resolution necessary to such an act  she has not you know bob i am now of age and my father a month since put some papers in my hand with a request that i would read them they contain a marriage settlement and other things of that sort which show i am mistress of more money than i should know what to do with if it were not for dear little evertbut with such a precious being to love one never can have too much of anything with the papers were many trinkets which i suppose father never looked at this beautiful miniature was among the last and i feel certain from some remarks i ventured to make mother does not know of its existence  as maud spoke she drew the original from her bosom and placed it in robert willoughbys hands when this simple act was performed her mind seemed relieved and she waited with strong natural interest to hear robert willoughbys comments  this then maud was your ownyour real mother the young man said after studying the miniature with a thoughtful countenance for near a minute it is like herlike you  like her bobhow can you know anything or thati suppose it to be my mother because i think it like myself and because it is not easy to say who else it can be but you cannot know anything of this  you are mistaken maudi remember both your parents wellit could not be otherwise as they were the bosom friends of my own you will remember that i am now eightandtwenty and that i had seen seven of these years when you were born was my first effort in arms never spoken of in your presence  neverperhaps it was not a subject for me to hear if it were in any manner connected with my parents  you are rightthat must be the reason it has been kept from your ears  surely surely i am old enough to hear it nowyou will conceal nothing from me bob  if i would i could not now it is too late maud you know the manner in which major meredith died  he fell in battle i have suspected answered the daughter in a suppressed doubtful tonefor no one has ever directly told me even that  he did and i was at his side the french and savages made an assault on us about an hour earlier than this and our two fathers rushed to the pickets to repel iti was a reckless boy anxious even at that tender age to see a fray and was at their side your father was one of the first that fell but joyce and our father beat the indians back from his body and saved it from mutilation your mother was buried in the same grave and then you came to us where our have been ever since  mauds tears flowed fast and yet it was not so much in grief as in a gush of tenderness she could hardly explain to herself robert willoughby understood her emotions and perceived that he might proceed  i was old enough to remember both your parents welli was a favourite i believe with certainly was much petted by bothi remember your birth maud and was suffered to carry you in my arms ere you were a week old  then you have known me for an impostor from the beginning bobmust have often thought of me as such  i have known you for the daughter of lewellen meredith certainly and not for a world would i have you the real child of hugh willoughby  bob exclaimed maud her heart beating violently a rush of feeling nearly overcoming her in which alarm consciousness her own secret dread of something wrong and a confused glimpse of the truth were all so blended as nearly to deprive her for the moment of the use of her senses  it is not easy to say precisely what would have followed this tolerably explicit insight into the state of the young mans feelings had not an outcry on the lawn given the major notice that his presence was needed below with a few words of encouragement to maud first taking the precaution to extinguish the lamp lest its light should expose her to a shot in passing some of the open loops he sprang towards the stairs and was at his post again literally within a minute nor was he a moment too soon the alarm was general and it was understood an assault was momentarily expected  the situation of robert willoughby was now tantalizing in the extreme ignorant of what was going on in front he saw no enemy in the rear to oppose and was condemned to inaction at a moment when he felt that by training years affinity to the master of the place and all the usual considerations he ought to be in front opposed to the enemy it is probable he would have forgotten his many cautions to keep close had not maud appeared in the library and implored him to remain concealed at least until there was the certainty his presence was necessary elsewhere  at that instant every feeling but those connected with the danger was in a degree forgotten still willoughby had enough consideration for maud to insist on her joining her mother and beulah in the portion of the building where the absence of external windows rendered their security complete so long as the foe could be kept without the palisades in this he succeeded but not until he had promised again and again to be cautious in not exposing himself at any of the windows the day having now fairly dawned and particularly not to let it be known in the hut that he was present until it became indispensable  the major felt relieved when maud had left him for her he had no longer any immediate apprehensions and he turned all his faculties to the sounds of the assault which he supposed to be going on in front to his surprise however no discharges of firearms succeeded and even the cries and orders and calling from point to point that are a little apt to succeed an alarm in an irregular garrison had entirely ceased and it became doubtful whether the whole commotion did not proceed from a false alarm the smashes in particular whose vociferations for the first few minutes had been of a very decided kind were now mute and the exclamations of the women and children had ceased  major willoughby was too good a soldier to abandon his post without orders though bitterly did he regret the facility with which he had consented to accept so inconsiderable a command he so far disregarded his instructions however as to place his whole person before a window in order to reconnoitre for it was now broad daylight though the sun had not yet risen nothing rewarded this careless exposure and then it flashed upon his mind that as the commander of a separate detachment he had a perfect right to employ any of his immediate subordinates either as messengers or scouts his choice of an agent was somewhat limited it is true lying between mike and the plinys after a moment of reflection he determined to choose the former  mike was duly relieved from his station at the door the younger pliny being substituted for him and he was led into the library here he received hasty but clear orders from the major how he was to proceed and was thrust rather than conducted from the room in his superiors haste to hear the tidings three or four minutes might have elapsed when an irregular volley of musketry was heard in front then succeeded an answering discharge which sounded smothered and distant a single musket came from the garrison a minute later and then mike rushed into the library his eyes dilated with a sort of wild delight dragging rather than carrying his piece after him  the news exclaimed the major as soon as he got a glimpse of his messenger what mean these volleys and how comes on my father in front  is it what do they mane answered mike well theres but one maning to powther and ball and thats far more sarious than shillelah worr k if the rapscallions didnt fire a whole plathoon as serjeant joyce calls it right at the knoll my name is not michael ohearn or my nature one that dales in giving back as good as i get  but the volley came first from the housewhy did my father order his people to make the first discharge  for the same rason that he didnt och there was a big frown on his fatures when he heard the rifles and muskets and mr woods never prached more to the purpose than the serjeant himself agin that same but to think of them rapscallions answering a fire that was agin orders not a word did his honour say about shooting any of them and they just pulled their triggers on the house all the same as if it had been logs growing in senseless and uninhabited trees instead of a rational and well papled abode och arnt they vagabonds  if you do not wish to drive me mad man tell me clearly what has past that i may understand you  is it understand thats wantinglord yer honour if ye can understand that misther strhides thats yon yell be a wise man he calls hisself a son of the pooratins and poor ating it must have been in the counthry of his faders to have produced so lane and skinny a baste as that same the orders was as particlar as tongue of man could utter and what good will it all doyere not to fire says serjeant joyce till ye all hear the worrd and the divil of a worr d did they wait for but blaze away did they jist becaase a knot of savages comes on to them rocks agin where they had possession all yesterday afthernoon and sure it is common enough to breakfast where a man sups  you mean to say that the indians have reappeared on the rocks and that some of stridess men fired at them without ordersis that the history of the affair  its jist that majjor and little good or little harrm did it do joel and his pooratins blazed away at em as if they had been so many christiansand twould have done yer heart good to have heard the serjeant belabour them with hard worrds for their throuble theres none of the pooratin family in the serjeant whos a mighty man wid his tongue  and the savages returned the volleywhich explains the distant discharge i heard  anybody can see majjor that yere yer fathers son and a souldier borrn och who would of tought of that but one bred and borrn in the army yes the savages sent back as good as they got which was jist notin at all seem that no one is harrmd  and the single piece that followedthere was one discharge by itself  mike opened his mouth with a grin that might have put either of the plinys to shame it being rather a favourite theory with the descendants of the puritansor pooratins as the county leitrim man called joel and his setthat the irishman was more than a match for any son of ham at the knoll in the way of capacity about this portion of the human countenance the major saw that there was a good deal of selffelicitation in the expression of mikes visage and he demanded an explanation in more direct terms  twas i did it majjor and twas as well fired a piece as yeve ever hearrd in the kings sarvice divil burrn me if i lets joel get any such advantage over me as to have a whole battle to himself no noas soon as i smelt his yankee powther and could get my own musket cockd and pointed out of the forthifications i lets em have it as if it had been so much breakfast ready cooked to their hands twas well pointed too for im not the man to shoot into a frinds countenance  and you broke the orders for a reason no better than the fact that strides had broken them before  divil a bit majjorjoel had broken the orders ye see and that settled the matter the thing that is once broken is broken and worrds cant mend it any more than for bearin to fire a gun will mend it  by dint of crossquestioning robert willoughby finally succeeded in getting something like an outline of the truth from mike the simple facts were that the indians had taken possession of their old bivouac as soon as the day dawned and had commenced their preparations for breakfast when joel the miller and a few of that set in a paroxysm of valour had discharged a harmless volley at them the distance rendering the attempt futile this fire had been partially returned the whole concluding with the finale from the irishmans gun as has been related as it was now too light to apprehend a surprise and the ground in front of the palisade had no very dangerous covers robert willoughby was emboldened to send one of the plinys to request an interview with his father in a few minutes the latter appeared accompanied by mr woods  the same party has reappeared and seems disposed to occupy its old position near the mill said the captain in answer to his sons inquiries it is difficult to say what the fellows have in view and there are moments when i think there are more or less whites among them i suggested as much to strides chaplain and i thought the fellow appeared to receive the notion as if he thought it might be true  joel is a little of an enigma to me captain willoughby returned the chaplain sometimes seizing an idea like a cat pouncing upon a rat and then coquetting with it as the same cat will play with a mouse when it has no appetite for food  och hes a precious pooratin growled mike from his corner of the room  if whites are among the savages why should they not make themselves known demanded robert willoughby your character sir is no secret and they must be acquainted with their own errand here  i will send for strides and get his opinion a little more freely answered the captain after a moment of deliberation you will withdraw bob though by leaving your door a little ajar the conversation will reach you and prevent the necessity of a repetition  as robert willoughby was not unwilling to hear what the overseer might have to say in the present state of things he did not hesitate about complying withdrawing into his own room as requested and leaving the door ajar in a way to prevent suspicion of his presence as far as possible but joel strides like all bad men ever suspected the worst the innocent and pure of mind alone are without distrust while one constituted morally like the overseer never permitted his thoughts to remain in the tranquillity that is a fruit of confidence conscious of his own evil intentions his very nature put on armour against the same species of machinations in others as the hedgehog rolls himself into a ball and thrusts out his quills at the sight of the dog had not captain willoughby been one of those who are slow to see evil he might have detected something wrong in joels feelings by the very first glance he cast about him on entering the library  in point of fact strides thoughts had not been idle since the rencontre of the previous night inquisitive and under none of the usual restraints of delicacy he had already probed all he dared approach on the subject and by this time had become perfectly assured that there was some mystery about the unknown individual whom he had met in his masters company to own the truth joel did not suspect that major willoughby had again ventured so far into the lions den but he fancied that some secret agent of the crown was at the hut and that the circumstance offered a fair opening for helping the captain down the ladder of public favour and to push himself up a few of its rounds he was not sorry therefore to be summoned to this conference hoping it might lead to some opening for farther discoveries  sit down stridessaid captain willoughby motioning towards a chair so distant from the open door of the bedroom and so placed as to remove the danger of too close a proximitysit downi wish to consult you about the state of things towards the mills to me it seems as if there were more palefaces than redskins among our visitors  thats not onlikely captainthe people has got to be greatly given to paintin and imitatin sin the hatchet has been dug up agin the british the teaboys were all in indian fashion  true but why should white men assume such a disguise to come to the knoll i am not conscious of having an enemy on earth who could meditate harm to me or mine  alas poor captain that a man at sixty should yet have to learn that the honest and fairdealing and plaindealing and affluentfor captain willoughby was affluent in the eyes of those around himthat such a man should imagine he was without enemies was to infer that the spirit of darkness had ceased to exercise his functions among men joel knew better though he did not perceive any necessity just then for letting the fact reach the ears of the party principally concerned  a body might spose the captain was poplar if any man is poplar answered the overseer nor do i know that visiters in paint betoken onpopularity to a person in these times more than another may i ask why the captain consaits these injins ant injins to me they have a desperate savage look though i ant much accustomed to red skin usages  their movements are too open and yet too uncertain for warriors of the tribes i think a savage by this time would have made up his mind to act as friend or foe  joel seemed struck with the idea and the expression of his countenance which on entering had been wily distrustful and prying suddenly changed to that of deep reflection  has the captain seen anything else particlar to confirm this idee he asked  their encampment careless manner of moving and unguarded exposure of their persons are all against their being indians  the messenger they sent across the meadow yesterday seemed to me to be a mohawk  he was of his being a real redskin there can be no question but he could neither speak nor understand english the little that passed between us was in low dutch our dialogue was short for apprehensive of treachery i brought it to a close sooner than i might otherwise have done  yes treachery is a cruel thing observed the conscientious joel a man cant be too strongly on his guard agin it does the captain raally calcilate on defending the house should a serious attempt be brought forward for the day  do i that is an extraordinary question mr strides why have i built in this mode if i have no such intentionwhy palisadedwhy armed and garrisoned if not in earnest  i sposed all this might have been done to prevent a surprise but not in any hope of standin a siege i should be sorry to see all our women and children shut up under one roof if the inimy came agin us in airnest with fire and sword  and i should be sorry to see them anywhere else but this is losing time my object in sending for you joel was to learn your opinion about the true character of our visiters have you any opinion or information to give me on that point  joel placed his elbow on his knee and his chin in the palm of his hand and pondered on what had been suggested with seeming goodwill and great earnestness  if any one could be found venturesome enough to go out with a flag he at length remarked the whole truth might be come at in a few minutes  and who shall i employ cheerfully would i go myself were such a step military or at all excusable in one in my situation  if the likes of myself will sarve yer honours turn put in mike promptly and yet with sufficient diffidence as regarded his views of his own qualificationstherell be nobody to gainsay that same and it isnt wilcome that i nade tell you yell be to use me as ye would yer own property  i hardly think mike would answer observed joel not altogether without a sneer he scurce knows an indian from a white man when it comes to the paint it would throw him into dreadful confusion  if ye thinks that i am to be made to believe in any more ould nicks misther strhides then yere making a mistake in my nature let but the captain say the word and ill go to the mill and bring in a grist of them same or lave my own body for toll  i do not doubt you in the least mike captain willoughby mildly observed but there will be no occasion just now of your running any such risks i shall be able to find other trucebearers  it seems the captain has his man in view joel said keenly eyeing his master perhaps tis the same i saw out with him last night thats a reliable person i do spose  you have hit the nail on the head it was the man who was out last night at the same time i was out myself and his name is joel strides  the captains a little musical this morningwaalif go i must as there was two on us out let us go to these savages together i saw enough of that man to know he is reliable and if hell go ill go  agreedsaid robert willoughby stepping into the libraryi take you at your word mr strides you and i will run what risks there may be in order to relieve this family from its present alarming state  the captain was astounded though he knew not whether to be displeased or to rejoice as for mike his countenance expressed great dissatisfaction for he ever fancied things were going wrong so long as joel obtained his wishes strides himself threw a keen glance at the stranger recognised him at a glance and had sufficient selfcommand to conceal his discovery though taken completely by surprise the presence of the major however immediately removed all his objections to the proposed expedition since should the party prove friendly to the americans he would be safe on his own account or should it prove the reverse a kings officer could not fail to be a sufficient protection  the gentlemans a total stranger to me joel hypocritically resumed but as the captain has belief in him i must have the same i am ready to do the arnd therefore as soon as it is agreeable  this is well captain willoughby put in the major in order to anticipate any objections from his father and the sooner a thing of this sort is done the better will it be for all concerned i am ready to proceed this instant and i take it this worthy mani think you called him stridesis quite as willing  joel signified his assent and the captain perceiving no means of retreat was fain to yield he took the major into the bedroom however and held a minutes private discourse when he returned and bade the two go forth together  your companion has his instructions joel the captain observed as they left the library together and you will follow his advice show the white flag as soon as you quit the gate if they are true warriors it must be respected  robert willoughby was too intent on business and too fearful of the reappearance and reproachful looks of maud to delay he had passed the court and was at the outer gate before any of the garrison even noted his appearance among them here indeed the fathers heart felt a pang and but for his military pride the captain would gladly have recalled his consent it was too late however and squeezing his hand he suffered his son to pass outward joel followed steadily as to appearances though not without misgivings as to what might be the consequences to himself and his growing family      chapter xvii    i worship not the sun at noon   the wandering stars the changing moon   the wind the flood the flame   i will not bow the votive knee   to wisdom virtue liberty   there is no god but god for me   jehovah is his name    montgomery  so sudden and unexpected had been the passage of robert willoughby through the court and among the men on post without the inner gates that no one recognised his person a few saw that a stranger was in their midst but under his disguise no one was quick enough of eye and thought to ascertain who that stranger was the little white flag that they displayed denoted the errand of the messengers the rest was left to conjecture  as soon as captain willoughby ascertained that the alarm of the morning was not likely to lead to any immediate results he had dismissed all the men with the exception of a small guard that was stationed near the outer gait under the immediate orders of serjeant joyce the latter was one of those soldiers who view the details of the profession as forming its great essentials and when he saw his commander about to direct a sortie it formed his pride not to ask questions and to seem to know nothing about it to this jamie allen who composed one of the guard quietly assented but it was a great privation to the three or four new englandmen to be commanded not to inquire into the why and wherefore  wait for orders men wait for orders observed the serjeant by way of quieting an impatience that was very apparent if his honour the captain wished us to be acquainted with his movements he would direct a general parade and lay the matter before us as you know he always does on proper occasions tis a flag going out as you can see and should a truce follow well lay aside our muskets and seize the ploughshares should it be a capitulationi know our brave old commander too well to suppose it possiblebut should it be even that well ground arms like men and make the best of it  and should joel and the other man who is a stranger to me be scalped demanded one of the party  then well avenge their scalps that was the way with us when my lord howe fellavenge his death cried our colonel and on we pushed until near two thousand of us fell before the frenchmens trenches oh that was a sight worth seeing and a day to talk of  yes but you were threshed soundly serjeant as ive heard from many that were there  what of that sir we obeyed orders avenge his death was the cry and on we pushed in obedience until there were not men enough left in our battalion to carry the wounded to the rear  and what did you do with them asked a youth who regarded the serjeant as another c√¶sarnapoleon not having come into notice in 1776  we let them lie where they fell young man war teaches us all the wholesome lesson that impossibilities are impossible to be done war is the great schoolmaster of the human race and a learned man is he who has made nineteen or twenty campaigns  if he live to turn his lessons to accountremarked the first speaker with a sneer  if a man is to die in battle sir he had better die with his mind stored with knowledge than be shot like a dog that has outlived his usefulness every pitched battle carries out of the world learning upon learning that has been got in the field here comes his honour who will confirm all i tell you men i was letting these men sir understand that the army and the field are the best schools on earth every old soldier will stick to that your honour  we are apt to think so joycehave the arms been inspected this morning  as soon as it was light i did that myself sir  flints cartridgeboxes and bayonets i hope  each and all sir does your honour remember the morning we had the affair near fort du quesne  you mean braddocks defeat i suppose joyce  i call nothing a defeat captain willoughby we were roughly handled that day sir but i am not satisfied it was a defeat it is true we fell back and lost some arms and stores but in the main we stuck to our colours considering it was in the woods no sir i do not call that a defeat by any means  you will at least own we were hard pressed and might have fared worse than we did had it not been for a certain colonial corps that manfully withstood the savages  yes sir that i allow i remember the corps and its commander a colonel washington with your honours permission  it was indeed joyce and do you happen to know what has became of this same colonel washington  it never crossed my mind to inquire sir as he was a provincial i dare say he may have a regimentor even a brigade by this time and good use would he make of either  you have fallen far behind his fortunes joyce the man is a commanderinchiefa captaingeneral  your honour is jestingsince many of his seniors are still living  this is the man who leads the american armies in the war with england  well sir in that way he may indeed get a quick step or two i make no doubt sir so good a soldier will know how to obey orders  from which i infer you think him right in the cause he has espoused  bless your honour sir i think nothing about it and care nothing about it if the gentleman has taken service with congress as they call the new headquarters why he ought to obey congress and if he serve the king his majestys orders should be attended to  and in this crisis serjeant may i ask in what particular service you conceive yourself to be just at the present moment  captain willoughbys late of his majestys th regiment of foot at your honours command  if all act in the same spirit joyce we shall do well enough at the knoll though twice as many savages brave us as are to be seen on yon rocks returned the captain smiling  and why should they no demanded jamie allen earnestly yere laird here and weve no the time nor the grace to study and understand the orthodoxy and heterodoxy of the quarrel atween the house of hanover and the houses of these americans so while we astand up for the house and household of our old maister the lord will smile on our efforts and lead us to victory  divil burrn me now jamie said mike who having seen the major to the gate now followed his father in readiness to do him any good turn that might offerdivil burrn me now jamie if ye could have said it better had ye just aised yer conscience to a proper praist and were talking on a clane breast stick up for the captain says i and the lord will be of our side  the serjeant nodded approbation of this sentiment and the younger pliny who happened also to be within hearing uttered the sententious word gosh and clenched his fist which was taken as proof of assent also on his part but the americans of the guard all of whom were the tools of joels and the millers arts manifested a coldness that even exceeded the usual cold manner of their class these men meant right but they had been deluded by the falsehoods machinations and frauds of a demagogue and were no longer masters of their own opinions or acts it struck the captain that something was wrong but a foreigner by birth himself he had early observed and long known the peculiar exterior and phlegm of the people of the country which so nearly resemble the stoicism of the aborigines as to induce many writers to attribute both alike to a cause connected with climate the present was not a moment however nor was the impression strong enough to induce the master of the place to enter into any inquiries turning his eyes in the direction of the two bearers of the flag he there beheld matter for new interest completely diverting his thoughts from what had just passed  i see they have sent two men to meet our messengers serjeant he saidthis looks as if they understood the laws of war  quite true your honour they should now blindfold our party and lead them within their own works before they suffer them to see at all though there would be no great advantage in it as strides is as well acquainted with every inch of that rock as i am with the manual exercise  which would seem to supersede the necessity of the ceremony you have mentioned  one never knows your honour blindfolding is according to the rules and i should blindfold a flag before i let him approach though the hostile ranks stood drawn up one on each side of a parade ground much is gained while nothing is ever lost by sticking to the rules of a trade  the captain smiled as did all the americans of the guard the last having too much sagacity not to perceive that a thing might be overdone as well as too little attended to as for jamie and mike they both received the serjeants opinions as law the one from having tried the troops of the line at culloden and the other on account of divers experiences through which he had gone at sundry fairs in his own green island by this time however all were too curious in watching the result of the meeting to continue the discourse  robert willoughby and joel had moved along the lane towards the rocks without hesitating keeping their little flag flying it did not appear that their approach produced any change among the savages who were now preparing their breakfasts until they had got within two hundred yards of the encampment when two of the redmen having first laid aside their arms advanced to meet their visiters this was the interview which attracted the attention of those at the hut and its progress was noted with the deepest interest  the meeting appeared to be friendly after a short conference in which signs seemed to be a material agent in the communications the four moved on in company walking deliberately towards the rocks captain willoughby had sent for his fieldglass and could easily perceive much that occuired in the camp on the arrival of his son the majors movements were calm and steady and a feeling of pride passed over the fathers heart as he noted this amid a scene that was well adapted to disturbing the equilibrium of the firmest mind joel certainly betrayed nervousness though he kept close at his companions side and together they proceeded into the very centre of the party of strangers  the captain observed also that this arrival caused no visible sensation among the redmen even those the major almost touched in passing did not look up to note his appearance while no one seemed to speak or in any manner to heed him the cooking and other preparations for the breakfast proceeded precisely as if no one had entered the camp the two who had gone forth to meet the flag alone attended its bearers whom they led through the centre of the entire party stopping only on the side opposite to the hut where there was an open space of flat rock which it had not suited the savages to occupy  here the four halted the major turning and looking back like a soldier who was examining his ground nor did any one appear disposed to interrupt him in an employment that serjeant joyce pronounced to be both bold and against the usages of war to permit the captain thought the stoicism of the savages amounted to exaggeration and it renewed his distrust of the real characters of his visiters in a minute or two however some three or four of the redmen were seen consulting together apart after which they approached the bearers of the flag and some communications passed between the two sides the nature of these communications could not be known of course though the conference appeared to be amicable after two or three minutes of conversation robert willoughby strides the two men who had advanced to meet them and the four chiefs who had joined the group left the summit of the rock in company taking a footpath that descended in the direction of the mills in a short time they all disappeared in a body  the distance was not so great but these movements could easily be seen by the naked eye though the glass was necessary to discover some of the details captain willoughby had planted the instrument among the palisades and he kept his gaze riveted on the retiring group as long as it was visible then indeed he looked at his companions as if to read their opinions in their countenances joyce understood the expression of his face and saluting in the usual military manner he presumed to speak in the way of reply  it seems all right your honour the bandage excepted said the serjeant the flag has been met at the outposts and led into the camp there the officer of the day or some savage who does the duty has heard his errand and no doubt they have all now gone to head quarters to report  i desired my son joyce  whom your honour  the general movement told the captain how completely his auditors were taken by surprise at this unlookedfor announcement of the presence of the major at the knoll it was too late to recall the words however and there was so little prospect of roberts escaping the penetration of joel the father saw no use in attempting further concealment  i say i desired my son major willoughby who is the bearer of that flag the captain steadily resumed to raise his hat in a particular manner if all seemed right or to make a certain gesture with his left arm did he see anything that required us to be more than usually on our guard  and which notice has he given to the garrison if it be your honours pleasure to let us know  neither i thought he manifested an intention to make the signal with the hat when the chiefs first joined him but he hesitated and lowered his hand without doing as i had expected then again just as he disappeared behind the rocks the left arm was in motion though not in a way to complete the signal  did he seem hurried your honour as if prevented from communicating by the enemy  not at all joyce irresolution appeared to be at the bottom of it so far as i could judge  pardon me your honour uncertainty would be a better word as applied to so good a soldier has major willoughby quitted the kings service that he is among us sir just at his moment  i will tell you his errand another time serjeant at present i can think only of the risk he runs these indians are lawless wretches one is never sure of then faith  they are bad enough sir but no man can well be so bad as to disregard the rights of a flag answered the serjeant in a grave and slightly important manner even the french your honour have always respected our flags  that is true and yet i wish we could overlook that position at the mill its a great advantage to them joyce that they can place themselves behind such a cover when they choose  the serjeant looked at the encampment a moment then his eye followed the woods and the mountain sides that skirted the little plain until his back was fairly turned upon the supposed enemy and he faced the forest in the rear of the hut  if it be agreeable to your honour a detachment can be detailed to make a demonstrationjoyce did not exactly understand this word but it sounded militaryin the following manner i can lead out the party by the rear of the house using the brook as a coveredway once in the woods it will be easy enough to make a flank movement upon the enemys position after which the detachment can be guided by circumstances  this was very martial in sound and the captain felt well assured that joyce was the man to attempt carrying out his own plan but he made no answer sighing and shaking his head as he walked away towards the house the chaplain followed leaving the rest to observe the savages  yere proposition serjeant no seems to give his honour much satisfaction said the mason as soon as his superior was out of hearing still it was military as i know by what i saw mysal in the fortyfive flainking and surprising and obsairving and demonstrating and such devices are the soul of war and are a on the great highway to victory had chairlies men obsairved and particularised mair there might have been a different family on the throne an the prince wad ha got his ain agin i like your idea much serjaint and gin ye gang oot to practise it i trust ye ll no forget that yeve an auld frind here willing to be of the pairty  i didnt think the captain much relished the notion of being questioned about his sons feelins and visit up here at a time like this put in one of the americans  theres bowels in the mans body cried mike and it isnt the likes of him that has no falin ye dont know what it is to be a father or yed groan in spirit to see a child of yer own in the grip of fiery divils like them same isnt he a pratty man and wouldnt i be sorrowful to hear that he had come to harrm yeve niver asked serjeant how the majjor got into the house and ye a military sentry in the bargain  i suppose he came by command michael and it is not the duty of the noncommissioned officers to question their superiors about anything that has happened out of the common way i take things as i find them and obey orders i only hope that the son as a fieldofficer will not outrank the father which would be unbecoming though date of commissions and superiority must be respected  i rather think if a major in the kings service was to undertake to use authority here said the spokesman of the americans a little stiffly he wouldnt find many disposed to follow at his heels  mutiny would not fare well did it dare to lift its head in this garrisonanswered the serjeant with a dignity that might better have suited the messroom of a regular regiment than the situation in which he was actually placed both captain willoughby and myself have seen mutiny attempted but neither has ever seen it succeed  do you look on us as lawful enlisted soldiers demanded one of the labourers who had a sufficient smattering of the law to understand the difference between a mercenary and a volunteer if im regimented i should at least like to know in whose service it is  yere overquick at yer objections and sentiments said jamie allen coolly like most youths who see only their ain experience in the airth and the providence o the lord enlisted we are a of us even to michael here and its in the sairvice of our good master his honour captain willoughby whom with his kith and kin may the lord presairve from this and all other dangers  the word master would of itself be very likely to create a revolt to day in such a corps as it was the fortune of our captain to command though to that of boss there would not he raised the slightest objection but the english language had not undergone half of its present mutations in the year 1776 and no one winced in admitting that he served a master though the gorges of several rose at the idea of being engaged in the service of any one considered in a military point of view it is likely the suggestion of the mason would have led to a hot discussion had not a stir among the savages just at that instant called off the attention of all present to matters of more importance than even an angry argument  the movement seemed to be general and joyce ordered his men to stand to their arms still he hesitated about giving the alarm instead of advancing towards the hut however the indians raised a general yell and went over the cliffs disappearing in the direction of the mill like a flock of birds taking wing together after waiting half an hour in vain to ascertain if any signs of the return of the indians were to be seen the serjeant went himself to report the state of things to his commander  captain willoughby had withdrawn to make his toilet for the day when he saw the last of his son and the overseer while thus employed he had communicated to his wife all that had occurred and mrs willoughby in her turn had told the same to her daughters maud was much the most distressed her suspicions of joel being by far the most active and the most serious from the instant she learned what had passed she began to anticipate grave consequences to robert willoughby though she had sufficient fortitude and sufficient consideration for others to keep most of her apprehensions to herself  when joyce demanded his audience the family was at breakfast though little was eaten and less was said the serjeant was admitted and he told his story with military precision  this has a suspicious air joyce observed the captain after musing a little to me it seems like an attempt to induce us to follow and to draw us into an ambuscade  it may be that your honour or it may be a good honest retreat two prisoners is a considerable exploit for savages to achieve i have known them count one a victory  be not uneasy wilhelmina bobs rank will secure him good treatment his exchange being far more important to his captors if captors they be than his death it is too soon to decide on such a point serjeant after all the indians may be at the mills in council on a warpath all the young men are usually consulted before any important step is taken then it may be the wish of the chiefs to impress our flag bearers with an idea of their force  all that is military your honour and quite possible still to me the movement seems as if a retreat was intended in fact or that the appearance of one was in view  i will soon know the truth cried the chaplain i a man of peace can surely go forth and ascertain who these people are and what is their object  you woods my dear fellow do you imagine a tribe of bloodthirsty savages will respect you or your sacred office you have a sufficient task with the kings forces letting his enemies alone you are no missionary to still a warcry  i beg pardon sirput in the serjeanthis reverence is more than half righthere the chaplain rose and quitted the room in haste unobserved by the two colloquiststhere is scarce a tribe in the colony your honour that has not some knowledge of our priesthood and i know of no instance in which the savages have ever illtreated a divine  poh poh joyce this is much too sentimental for your mohawks and oneidas and onondagas and tuscaroras they will care no more for little woods than they care for the great woods through which they journey on their infernal errands  one cannot know hughobserved the anxious motherour dear robert is in their hands and should mr woods be really disposed to go on this mission of mercy does it comport with our duty as parents to oppose it  a mother is all mothermurmured the captain who rose from table kissed his wifes cheek affectionately and left the room beckoning to the serjeant to follow  captain willoughby had not been gone many minutes when the chaplain made his appearance attired in his surplice and wearing his best wig an appliance that all elderly gentlemen in that day fancied necessary to the dignity and gravity of their appearance mrs willoughby to own the truth was delighted if this excellent woman was ever unjust it was in behalf of her children solicitude for whom sometimes induced her to overlook the rigid construction of the laws of equality  we will see which best understands the influence of the sacred office captain willoughby or myself observed the chaplain with a little more importance of manner than it was usual for one so simple to assume i do not believe the ministry was instituted to be browbeaten by tribes of savages any more than it is to be silenced by the unbeliever or schismatic  it was very evident that the rev mr woods was considerably excited and this was a condition of mind so unusual with him as to create a species of awe in the observers as for the two young women deeply as they were interested in the result and keenly as maud in particular felt everything which touched the fortunes of robert willoughby neither would presume to interfere when they saw one whom they had been taught to reverence from childhood acting in a way that so little conformed to his ordinary manner as for mrs willoughby her own feelings were so much awakened that never had mr woods seemed so evangelical and like a saint as at that very moment and it would not have been difficult to persuade her that he was acting under something very like righteous superhuman impulses  such however was far from being the case the worthy priest had an exalted idea of his office and to fancy it might favorably impress even savages was little more than carrying out his everyday notions of its authority he conscientiously believed that he himself a regularly ordained presbyter would be more likely to succeed in the undertaking before him than a mere deacon were a bishop present he would cheerfully have submitted to his superior claims to sanctity and success as for archbishops archdeacons deans rural deans and all the other worldly machinery which has been superadded to the church the truth compels us to add that our divine felt no especial reverence since he considered them as so much clerical surplusage of very questionable authority and of doubtful use he adhered strictly to the orders of divine institution to these he attached so much weight as to be entirely willing in his own person to demonstrate how little was to be apprehended when their power was put forth even against indians in humility and faith  i shall take this sprig of laurel in my hand in lieu of the olive branch said the excited chaplain as the symbol of peace it is not probable that savages can tell one plant from the other and if they could it will be easy to explain that olives do not grow in america it is an eastern tree ladies and furnishes the pleasant oil we use on our salads i carry with me notwithstanding the oil which proves a balm to many sorrows that will be sufficient  you will bid them let robert return to us without delay said mrs willoughby earnestly  i shall bid them respect god and their consciences i cannot now stop to rehearse to you the mode of proceeding i shall adopt but it is all arranged in my own mind it will be necessary to call the deity the great spirit or manitouand to use many poetical images but this can i do on an emergency extempore preaching is far from agreeable to me in general nor do i look upon it in this age of the world as exactly canonical nevertheless it shall be seen i know how to submit even to that when there is a suitable necessity  it was so seldom mr woods used such magnificent ideas or assumed a manner in the least distinguishable from one of the utmost simplicity that his listeners now felt really awed and when he turned to bless them as he did with solemnity and affection the two daughters knelt to receive his benedictions these delivered he walked out of the room crossed the court and proceeded straightway to the outer gate  it was perhaps fortunate to the design of the rev mr woods that neither the captain nor the serjeant was in the way to arrest it this the former would certainly have done out of regard to his friend and the last out of regard to orders but these military personages were in the library in deep consultation concerning the next step necessary to take this left the coast clear no one belonging to the guard conceiving himself of sufficient authority to stop the chaplain more especially when he appeared in his wig and surplice jamie allen was a corporal by courtesy and at the first summons he caused the outer gate to be unlocked and unbarred permitting the chaplain to make his egress attended by his own respectful bows this jamie did out of reverence to religion generally though the surplice ever excited his disgust and as for the liturgy he deemed it to be a species of solemn mockery of worship  the captain did not reappear outside of the court until the chaplain who had made the best of his way towards the rocks was actually stalking like a ghost among ruins through the deserted shantees of the late encampment  what in the name of indian artifice is the white animal that i see moving about on the rocks demanded the captain whose look was first turned in the direction of the camp  it seems an indian wrapped up in a shirt your honouras i live sir it has a cocked hat on its head  nanainterrupted jamie yell no be guessing the truth this time without the aid of a little profane revelation the chiel ye see yan yer honour is just chaplain woods  woodsthe devil  nanayer honour its the reverend gentleman hissel and no the deil at a hes in his white frockthough why he didnt wear his black gairment is more than i can tell yebut there he is walking about amang the indian dwellings all the same as if they were so many pews in his ain kirk  and how came you to let him pass the gate against orders  well and it is aboot the orders of the priesthood that he so often preaches and seeing him in the white gairment and knowing yeve so many fastdays and christmas in the kirk o england i fancied it might be a bit matter o prayer he wished to offer up yan in the house on the flat and so i een thought church prayers better than no prayers at all in such a strait  as it was useless to complain the captain was fain to submit even beginning to hope some good might come of the adventure when he saw mr woods walking unmolested through the deserted camp the glass was levelled and the result was watched in intense interest  the chaplain first explored every shantee fearlessly and with diligence then he descended the rocks and was lost to view like those who had preceded him a feverish hour passed without any symptom of human life appearing in the direction of the mills sometimes those who watched fancied they beheld a smoke beginning to steal up over the brow of the rocks the precursor of the expected conflagration but a few moments dispersed the apprehension and the fancied smoke together the day advanced and yet the genius of solitude reigned over the mysterious glen not a sound emerged from it not a human form was seen near it not a sign of a hostile assault or of a friendly return could be detected all in that direction lay buried in silence as if the ravine had swallowed its tenants in imitation of the grave      chapter xviii    to deck my list by nature were designd   such shining expletives of human kind   who want while through blank life they dream along   sense to be right and passion to be wrong    young  the disappearance of mr woods occasioned no uneasiness at first an hour elapsed before the captain thought it necessary to relate the occurrence to his family when a general panic prevailed among the females even maud had hoped the savages would respect the sacred character of the divine though she knew not why and here was one of her principal grounds of hope as connected with robert willoughby slid from beneath her feet  what can we do willoughby asked the affectionate mother almost reduced to despair i will go myself in search of my sonthey will respect me a woman and a mother  you little know the enemy we have to deal with wilhelmina or so rash a thought could not have crossed your mind we will not be precipitate a few hours may bring some change to direct us one thing i learn from woods delay the indians cannot be far off and he must be with them or in their hands else would he return alter having visited the mills and the houses beneath the cliffs  this sounded probable and all felt there was a relief in fancying that their friends were still near them and were not traversing the wilderness as captives  i feel less apprehension than any of you observed beulah in her placid manner if bob is in the hands of an american party the brotherinlaw of evert beekman cannot come to much harm with british indians he will be respected for his own sake as soon as he can make himself known  i have thought of all this my childanswered the father musingand there is reason in it it will be difficult however for bob to make his real character certain in his present circumstances he does not appear the man he is and should there even be a white among his captors who can read he has not a paper with him to sustain his word  but he promised me faithfully to use everts name did he ever fall into american handsresumed beulah earnestlyand evert has said again and again that my brother could never be his enemy  heaven help us all dear child answered the captain kissing his daughterit is indeed a cruel war when such aids are to be called in for our protection we will endeavour to be cheerful notwithstanding for we know of nothing yet that ought to alarm us out of reason all may come right before the sun set  the captain looked at his family and endeavoured to smile but he met no answering gleam of happiness on either face nor was his own effort very successful as for his wife she was never known to be aught but miserable while any she loved were in doubtful safety she lived entirely out of herself and altogether for her husband children and friends a woman less selfish or one more devoted to the affections never existing then beulah with all her reliance on the magic of everts name and with the deep feelings that had been awakened within her as a wife and a mother still loved her brother as tenderly as ever as for maud the agony she endured was increased by her efforts to keep it from breaking out in some paroxysm that might betray her secret and her features were getting an expression of stern resolution which blended with her beauty gave them a grandeur her father had never before seen in her bright countenance  this child suffers on bobs account more than any of usobserved the captain drawing his pet towards him placing her kindly on his knee and folding her to his bosom she has no husband yet to divide her heart all her love centres in her brother  the look which beulah cast upon her father was not reproachful for that was an expression she would not have indulged with him but it was one in which pain and mortification were so obvious as to induce the mother to receive her into her own arms  hugh you are unjust to beulahsaid the anxious mothernothing can ever cause this dear girl either to forget to feel for any of us  the captains ready explanation and affectionate kiss brought a smile again to beulahs face though it shone amid tears all was however immediately forgotten for the parties understood each other and maud profited by the scene to escape from the room this flight broke up the conference and the captain after exhorting his wife and daughter to set an example of fortitude to the rest of the females left the house to look after his duties among the men  the absence of joel cast a shade of doubt over the minds of the disaffected these last were comparatively numerous comprising most of the native americans in the hut the blacks and joyce excepted strides had been enabled to effect his purposes more easily with his own countrymen by working on their good qualities as well as on their bad many of these menmost of them indeedmeant well but their attachment to the cause of their native land laid them open to assaults against which mike and jamie allen were insensible captain willoughby was an englishman in the first place he was an old army officer in the next and he had an only son who was confessedly in open arms against the independence of america it is easy to see how a demagogue like joel who had free access to the ears of his comrades could improve circumstances like these to his own particular objects nevertheless he had difficulties to contend with if it were true that parson woods still insisted on praying for the king it was known that the captain laughed at him for his reverence for c√¶sar if robert willoughby were a major in the royal forces evert beekman was a colonel in the continentals if the owner of the manor were born in england his wife and children were born in america and he himself was often heard to express his convictions of the justice of most of that for which the provincials were contendingall the worthy captain had not yet made up his mind to concede to them  then most of the americans in the hut entertained none of the selfish and narrow views of joel and the miller their wish was to do right in the main and though obnoxious to the charge of entertaining certain prejudices that rendered them peculiarly liable to become the dupes of a demagogue they submitted to many of the better impulses and were indisposed to be guilty of any act of downright injustice the perfect integrity with which they had ever been treated too had its influence nor was the habitual kindness of mrs willoughby to their wives and children forgotten nor the gentleness of beulah or the beauty spirit and generous impulses of maud in a word the captain when he went forth to review his men who were now all assembled under arms within the palisades for that purpose went to meet a wavering rather than a positively disaffected or rebellious body  attention cried joyce as his commanding officer came in front of a line which contained men of different colours statures ages dresses countries habits and physiognomies making it a sort of epitome of the population of the whole colony as it existed in that dayattention present arms  the captain pulled off his hat complacently in return to this salute though he was obliged to smile at the array which met his eyes every one of the dutchmen had got his musket to an order following a sort of fugleman of their own while mike had invented a motion that would have puzzled any one but himself to account for the butt of the piece was projected towards the captain quite out of line while the barrel rested on his own shoulder still as his arms were extended to the utmost the county leitrimman fancied he was performing much better than common jamie had correct notions of the perpendicular from having used the plumbbob so much though even he made the trifling mistake of presenting arms with the lock outwards as for the yankees they were all tolerably exact in everything but time and the line bringing their pieces down one after another much as they were in the practice of following their leaders in matters of opinion the negroes defied description nor was it surprising they failed each of them thrusting his head forward to see how the motions looked in a way that prevented any particular attention to his own part of the duty the serjeant had the good sense to see that his drill had not yet produced perfection and he brought his men to a shoulder again as soon as possible in this he succeeded perfectly with the exception that just half of the arms were brought to the right and the other half to the left shoulders  we shall do better your honour as we get a little more drillsaid joyce with an apologetic salutecorporal strides has a tolerable idea of the manual and he usually acts as our fugleman when he gets back we shall improve  when he gets back serjeantcan you or any other man tell when that will be  yes yer honour sputtered mike with the eagerness of a boy ise the man to tell yees that same  youwhat can you know that is not known to all of us my good michael  i knows what i sees and if yon isnt misther strhides then i am not acquainted with his sthraddle  sure enough joel appeared at the gate as mike concluded his assertions how he got there no one knew for a good lookout had been kept in the direction of the mill and yet here was the overseer applying for admission as if he had fallen from the clouds of course the application was not denied though made in a manner so unexpected and joel stood in front of his old comrades at the hoe and plough if not in arms in less than a minute his return was proclaimed through the house in an incredibly short space of time by the aid of the children and all the females came pouring out from the court to learn the tidings led by mrs strides and her young brood  have you anything to communicate to me in private strides the captain demanded maintaining an appearance of sang froid that he was far from feelingor can your report be made here before the whole settlement  its just as the captain pleases answered the wily demagogue though to my notion the people have a right to know all in an affair that touches the common interest  attention mencried the serjeantby platoons to the right  no matter joyce interrupted the captain waving his handlet the men remain you have held communications with our visiters i know strides  we have captain willoughby and a desperate sort of visiters be they a more ugly set of mohawks and onondagas i never laid eyes on  as for their appearance it is matter of indifference to mewhat is the object of their visit  i mean ugly behaved and they deserve all i say of em their arnd according to their own tell is to seize the captain and his family in behalf of the colonies  as joel uttered this he cast a glance along the line of faces paraded before him in order to read the effect it might produce that it was not lost on some was as evident as that it was on others the captain however appeared unmoved and there was a slight air of incredulity in the smile that curled his lip  this then you report as being the business of the party in coming to this place he said quietly  i do sir and an ugly arnd it is in times like these  is there any person in authority in a party that pretends to move about the colony with such high duties  theres one or two white men among em if thats what the captain means they pretend to be duly authorised and appointed to act in behalf of the people  at each allusion to the people joel invariably looked towards his particular partisans in order to note the effect the use of the word might produce on the present occasion he even ventured to wink at the miller  if acting on authority why do they keep aloofi have no such character for resisting the laws that any who come clothed with its mantle need fear resistance  why i spose they reason in some such manner as this theres two laws in operation at this time the kings law and the peoples law i take it this party comes in virtue of the peoples law whereas it is likely the law the captain means is the kings law the difference is so great that one or tother carries the day just as the kings friends or the peoples friends happen to be the strongest these men dont like to trust to their law when the captain may think it safest to trust a little to hisn  and all this was told you strides in order to be repeated to me  not a word ont its all my own consait about the matter little passed between us  and now said the captain relieving his breast by a long sigh i presume i may inquire about your companion you probably have ascertained who he is  lord captain willoughby i was altogether dumbfounded when the truth came upon me of a sudden i never should have known the major in that dress in the world or out of the world either but he walks so like the captain that as i followed ater him i said to myself who can it beand then the walk came over me as it might be and then i remembered last night and the stranger that was out with the captain and how he occupied the room next to the library and them things and so when i come to look in his face there was the major sure enough  joel lied famously in this account but he believed himself safe as no one could very well contradict him  now you have explained the manner in which you recognised my son strides added the captain i will thank you to let me know what has become of him  hes with the savages having come so far to seize the father it wasnt in natur to let the son go free when he walked right into the lions den like  and how could the savages know he was my son did they too recognise the family walk  strides was taken aback at this question and he even had the grace to colour a little he saw that he was critically placed for in addition to the suggestions of conscience he understood the captain sufficiently to know he was a man who would not trifle in the event of his suspicions becoming active he knew he deserved the gallows and joyce was a man who would execute him in an instant did his commander order it the idea fairly made the traitor tremble in his shoes  ah ive got a little ahead of my story he said hastily but perhaps i had best tell everything as it happened  that will be the simplest and clearest course in order that there be no interruption we will go into my room where joyce will follow us as soon as he has dismissed his men  this was done and in a minute or two the captain and joel were seated in the library joyce respectfully standing the old soldier always declining to assume any familiarity with his superior we shall give the substance of most of joels report in our own language preferring it defective as it is to that of the overseers which was no bad representative of his cunning treacherous and low mind  it seems then that the bearers of the flag were amicably received by the indians the men towards whom they were led on the rocks were the chiefs of the party who treated them with proper respect the sudden movement was explained to them as connected with their meal and the chiefs accompanied by the major and strides proceeded to the house of the miller here by means of a white man for an interpreter the major had demanded the motive of the strangers in coming into the settlement the answer was a frank demand for the surrender of the hut and all it contained to the authorities of the continental congress the major had endeavoured to persuade a white man who professed to hold the legal authority for what was doing of the perfectly neutral disposition of his father when according to joels account to his own great astonishment the argument was met by the announcement of robert willoughbys true character and a sneering demand if it were likely a man who had a son in the royal army and who had kept that son secreted in his own house would be very indifferent to the success of the royal cause  theyve got a wonderful smart man there for a magistrate i can tell you added joel with emphasis and he raally bore as hard on the major as a lawyer before a court how he found out that the major was at the hut is a little strange seein that none of us knowd of it but theyve got extraornary means nowadays  and did major willoughby admit his true character when charged with being in the kings service  he didand like a gentleman he only insisted that his sole arnd out here was to see his folks and that he intended to go back to york the moment he had paid his visit  how did the person you mention receive his explanations  waal to own the truth he laughd at it like all natur i dont believe they put any great weight on a syllable the major told em i never see critturs with such onbelievin faces after talking as long as suited themselves they ordered the major to be shut up in a buttery with a warrior at the door for a sentinel ater which they took to examining me  joel then proceeded with an accounthis own account always be it rememberedof what passed between himself and the strangers they had questioned him closely touching the nature of the defences of the hut the strength of the garrison its disposition the number and quality of the arms and the amount of the ammunition  you may depend ont i gave a good account continued the overseer in a selfsatisfied way in the first place i told em the captain had a lieutenant with him that had sarved out the whull french war then i put the men up to fifty at once seein it was just as easy to say that as thirty or thirtythree as to the arms i told em more than half the pieces were doublebarrelled and that the captain in particular carried a rifle that had killed nine savages in one fight  you were much mistaken in that joel it is true that a celebrated chief once fell by this rifle even that is not a matter for boasting  waal them that told me ont said that two had fallen before it and i put it up to nine at once to make a good story better nine men had a more desperate sound than two and when you do begin to brag a man shouldnt be backward i thought howsever that they was most nonplussed when i told em of the fieldpiece  the fieldpiece strideswhy did you venture on an exaggeration that any forward movement of theirs must expose  well see to that captainwell see to that fieldpieces are desperate dampers to indian courage so i thought id just let em have a sixpounder by way of tryin their naturs they lookd like men goin to execution when i told em of the cannon and what a history it had gone through  and what may have been this history pray  i just told em it was the very gun the captain had took from the french about which weve all heern tell and that as everybody knows was a desperate piece havin killed more than a hundred reglars before the captain charged baggonet on it and carried it off  this was a very artful speech since it alluded to the most distinguished exploit of captain willoughbys military life one of which it would have been more than human had he not been a little proud all who knew him had heard of this adventure and joel cunningly turned it to account in the manner seen the allusion served to put to sleep for the moment at least certain very unpleasant suspicions that were getting to be active in his superiors mind  there was no necessity strides for saying anything about that affairthe captain modestly interposed it happened a long time since and might well be forgotten then you know we have no gun to support your account when our deficiency is ascertained it will all be set down to the true causea wish to conceal our real weakness  i beg your honours pardon put in joycei think strides has acted in a military manner in this affair it is according to the art of war for the besieged to pretend to but stronger than they are and even besiegers sometimes put a better face than the truth will warrant on their strength military accounts as your honour well knows never pass exactly for gospel unless it be with the raw hands  then added joel i knowd what i was about seem that we had a cannon ready for use as soon as it could be mounted  i think i understand strides your honour resumed the serjeant i have carved a quaker as an ornament for the gateway intending to saw it in two in the middle and place the pieces crosswise over the entrance as your honour has often seen such things in garrisonslike the brass ornaments on the artillery caps i mean your honour well this gun is finished and painted and i intended to split it and have it up this very week i suppose joel has had it in his mind quaker fashion  the serjeants right that piece looks as much like a real cannon as one of our cathechisms is like another the muzzle is more than a foot deep and has a plaguy gunpowder look  but this gun is not mounted even if it were it could only be set up for show observed the captain  put that cannon up once and ill answer for it that no injin faces it twill be as good as a dozen sentinels answered joel as for mountin i thought of that before i said a syllable about the crittur theres the new truckwheels in the court all ready to hold it and the carpenters can put the hinder part to the whull in an hour or two and that in a way no injin could tell the difference between it and a raal cannon at ten yards  this is plausible your honour said joyce respectfully and it shows that corporal stridesjoel insisted he was a serjeant but the real simon pure never gave him a title higher than that of corporaland it shows that corporal strides has an idea of war by mounting that piece and using it with discretionrefusing it at the right moment and showing it at anothera great deal might be done with it either in a siege or an assault if your honour will excuse the liberty i would respectfully suggest that it might be well to set the quaker on his legs and plant him at the gate as an exhorter  the captain reflected a moment and then desired the overseer to proceed in his account the rest of joels story was soon told he had mystified the strangers according to his own account of the matter so thoroughly by affecting to withhold nothing that they considered him as a sort of ally and did not put him in confinement at all it is true he was placed en surveillance but the duty was so carelessly performed that at the right moment he had passed down the ravine a direction in which a movement was not expected and buried himself in the woods so very effectually that it would have baffled pursuit had any been attempted after making a very long d√©tour that consumed hours he turned the entire valley and actually reached the hut under the cover of the rivulet and its bushes or precisely by the route in which he and mike had gone forth in quest of maud the evening of the majors arrival this latter fact however joel had reasons of his own for concealing  you have told us nothing of mr woods strides the captain observed when joels account was ended  mr woods i can tell the captain nothing of that gentleman i supposed he was here  the manner in which the chaplain had left the hut and his disappearance in the ravine were then explained to the overseer who evidently had quitted the mill on his return before the divine performed his exploit there was a sinister expression in joels eyes as he heard the account that might have given the alarm to men more suspicious than the two old soldiers but he had the address to conceal all he felt or thought  if mr woods has gone into the hands of the injins in his church shirt rejoined the overseer his case is hopeless so far as captivity is consarned one of the charges agin the captain is that the chaplain he keeps prays as regulairly for the king as he used to do when it was lawful and agreeable to public feelin  this you heard while under examination before the magistrate you have named demanded the captain  as good as that and something more to the same pint the squire complained awfully of a ministers prayin for the king and ryal family when the country was fightin em  in that the rev mr woods only obeys orders said the serjeant  but they say not the orders is gone out now they pretend for no man to pray for any on em  ayorders from the magistrates perhaps but the rev mr woods is a divine and has his own superiors in the church and they must issue the commands that he obeys i dare to say your honour if the archbishop of canterbury or the commanderinchief of the church whoever he may be should issue a general order directing all the parsons not to pray for king george the rev mr woods would have no scruple about obeying but its a different thing when a justice of the peace undertakes to stand fugleman for the clergy its like a navy captain undertaking to wheel a regiment  poor woods exclaimed the captainhad he been ruled by me he would have dropped those prayers and it would have been better for us both but he is of your opinion serjeant and thinks that a layman can have no authority over a gownsman  and isnt he right your honour think what a mess of it the militia officers make when they undertake to meddle with a regular corps some of our greatest difficulties in the last war came from such awkward hands attempting to manage machines of which they had no just notions as for praying your honour im no wise particular who i pray for or what i pray for so long as it be all set down in general orders that come from the right headquarters and i think the rev mr woods ought to be judged by the same rule  as the captain saw no use in prolonging the dialogue he dismissed his companions he then sought his wife in order to make her acquainted with the actual state of things this last was a painful duty though mrs willoughby and her daughters heard the truth with less of apprehension than the husband and father had anticipated they had suffered so much from uncertainty that there was a relief in learning the truth the mother did not think the authorities of the colony would hurt her son whom she fancied all men must in a degree love as she loved beulah thought of her own husband as bobs safeguard while maud felt it to be comparative happiness to know he was unharmed and still so near her  this unpleasant duty discharged the captain began to bethink him seriously of his military trust after some reflection and listening to a few more suggestions from joyce he consented to let the quaker be put on wheels the carpenters were immediately set at work to achieve this job which the serjeant volunteered to superintend in person as for joel his wife and children with the miller occupied most of the morning the day turning and even drawing towards its close ere he became visible as had formerly been his wont among the men of the settlement  all this time everything without the palisades lay in the silence of nature the sun cast its glories athwart the lovely scene as in one of the sabbaths of the woods but man was nowhere visible not a hostile indian or white exhibited himself and the captain began to suspect that satisfied with their captures the party had commenced its return towards the river postponing his own arrest for some other occasion so strong did this impression become towards the close of the day that he was actually engaged in writing to some friends of influence in albany and on the mohawk to interpose their names and characters in his sons behalf when the serjeant about nine oclock the hour when he had been ordered to parade the guard for the first half of the night presented himself at the door of his room to make an important report  what now joyce demanded the captain are any of our fellows sleepy and plead illness  worse than that your honour i greatly fear was the answer of the ten men your honour commanded me to detail for the guard five are missing i set them down as deserters  desertersthis is serious indeed let the signal be made for a general paradethe people cannot yet have gone to bed we will look into this  as joyce made it matter of religion to obey orders this command was immediately put in execution in five minutes a messenger came to summon the captain to the court where the garrison was under arms the serjeant stood in front of the little party with a lantern holding his musterroll in his hand the first glance told the captain that a serious reduction had taken place in his forces and he led the serjeant aside to hear his report  what is the result of your inquiries joyce he demanded with more uneasiness than he would have liked to betray openly  we have lost just half our men sir the miller most of the yankees and two of the dutchmen are not on parade neither is one of them to be found in his quarters they have either gone over to the enemy captain willoughby or disliking the appearance of things here they have taken to the woods for safety  and abandoned their wives and children serjeant men would scarcely do that  their wives and children have deserted too sir not a chick or child belonging to either of the runaways is to be found in the hut      chapter xix    for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead   are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled    richard iii  this was startling intelligence to receive just as night had shut in and under the other circumstances of the case touching the men who still remained captain willoughby conceived it prudent to inquire into their characters and names in order to ascertain the ground he stood on and to govern his future course accordingly he put the question to the serjeant therefore as soon as he could lead him far enough from the little array to be certain he was out of earshot  we have michael ohearn jamie allen the two carpenters the three niggers joel and the three dutchmen that last came into the settlement and the two lads that strides engaged at the beginning of the year left was the answer these counting your honour and myself make just fifteen men quite enough yet i should think to make good the house in case of an assaultthough i fear everything like an outwork must be abandoned  on the whole these are the best of our men returned the captain i mean the most trustworthy i count on mike jamie and the blacks as being as much to be relied on as we are ourselves joel too is a man of resources if he will but do his duty under fire  corporal strides is still an untried soldier your honour though recruits even sometimes do wonders of course i shall reduce the guard to half its former strength as the men must have some sleep sir  we must depend very much on your vigilance and mine tonight joyce you shall take the guard till one when i will stand it for the rest of the night i will speak to the men before you dismiss them an encouraging word just now may be worth a platoon to us  the serjeant seldom dissented from any suggestion of his commanding officer and the scheme was carried out on the spot the lantern was so placed as to permit the captain to see the heterogeneous row of countenances that was drawn up before him and he proceeded  it seems my friends he said that some of our people have been seized with a panic and have deserted these mistaken men have not only fled themselves but they have induced their wives and children to follow them a little reflection will show you to what distress all must be reduced by this illjudged flight fifty miles from another settlement of any size and more than thirty from even a single hut beyond the cabin of a hunter days must pass before they can reach a place of safety even should they escape the savage foe that we know to be scouring the woods the women and children will not have sufficient art to conceal their trail nor sufficient strength to hold out against hunger and fatigue many hours god forgive them for what they have done and guide them through the difficulties and pains by which they are menaced as for us we must determine to do our whole duty or at once to retire with the consent of each other if there is a man among you then who apprehends the consequences of standing to his arms and of defending this house let him confess it frankly he shall have leave to depart with all that belongs to him taking food and the means of subsistence and defence with him i wish no man to remain with me and mine but he who can do it cheerfully the night is now dark and by quitting the hut at an early hour such a start might be gained over any pursuers as to place him in comparative security before morning if any such man is here let him now speak out honestly and fear nothing the gate shall be opened for his march  the captain paused but not a soul answered a common sentiment of loyalty seemed to bind every one of the listeners to his duty the dark eyes of the negroes rolled along the short rank to see who would be the first to desert their master and grins of delight showed the satisfaction with which they noted the effect of the appeal as for mike he felt too strongly to keep silence and he muttered the passing impressions aloud  ochgrowled the county leitrimmanis it a good journey that i wish the runaways that it isnt nor many a good male either as they trudge alang trough the woods with their own consciences forenent their eyes pricking them up to come back like so many tieves of the worrld as they are every mothers son of em women and all id nivir do that no not if my head was all scalp down to the soles of my fut and an injin was at every inch of it to cut out his summer clothes of my own skin talk of religion amang sich crathureswhy there isnt enough moral in one of thim to carry him through the shortest prayer the lord allows a christian to utter divil burn em say i and thats my kindest wish in their behalf  the captain waited patiently for this soliloquy to terminate then he dismissed the men with a few more words of encouragement and his thanks for the fidelity they at least had shown by this time the night had got to be dark and the court was much more so on account of the shadows of the buildings than places in the open air as the captain turned aside to give his last instructions to joyce he discovered by the light of the lantern the latter held a figure standing at no great distance quite dimly seen on account of its proximity to the walls of the hut it was clearly a man and as all the males able to bear arms a single sentinel outside the court excepted were supposed to be in the group that had not yet separated the necessity of ascertaining the character of this unlookedfor visiter flashed on the minds of both the old soldiers at the same instant joyce raised the lantern as they moved quickly towards the motionless form and its light glanced athwart a pair of wild glowing dark eyes and the red visage of an indian  nick exclaimed the captain is that youwhat has brought you here again and how have you entered the palisadesdo you come as a friend to aid us or as an enemy  too much question capintoo much like squaw ask all togeder go to bookroom nick follow tell all he got to say  the captain whispered the serjeant to ascertain whether the watch without was vigilant when he led the way to the library where as he expected he found his wife and daughters anxiously waiting his appearance  oh hugh i trust it is not as bad as we feared cried the mother as the captain entered the room closely attended by the tuscarora our men cannot be so heartless as to desert us at such a moment  the captain kissed his wife said a word or two of encouragement and pointed to the indian  nick exclaimed all three of the females in a breath though the tones of their voices denoted very different sensations at the unexpected appearance of their old acquaintance mrs willoughbys exclamation was not without pleasure for she thought the man her friend beulahs was filled with alarm little evert and savage massacres suddenly crossing the sensitive mind of the young mother while mauds tone had much of the stern resolution that she had summoned to sustain her in a moment of such fearful trial  yes nicksassy nick repeated the indian in his guttural voiceole friendyou no glad see him  that will depend on your errand interposed the captain are you one of the party that is now lying at the millbut stop how did you get within the palisades first answer me that  come in tree no good to stop injin cant do it wid branches how do it widout want plenty of musket and plenty of soldier to do dat dis no garrison capin to make nick afeard always tell him too much hole to be tight  this is not answering my question fellow by what means did you pass the palisades  what meansinjin means sartain came like cat jump like deer slide like snake nick great tuscarora chief know well how warrior march when he dig up hatchet  and nick has been a great hangeron of garrisons and should know the use that i can make of his back you will remember tuscarora that i have had you flogged more than once in my day  this was said menacingly and with more warmth perhaps than was prudent it caused the listeners to start as if a sudden and new danger rose before their eyes and the anxious looks he encountered warned the captain that he was probably going too far as for nick himself the gathering thundercloud is not darker than his visage became at the words he heard it seemed by the moral writhing of his spirit as if every disgracing blow he had received was at that instant torturing his flesh anew blended with the keenest feelings of ignominy captain willoughby was startled at the effect he had produced but it was too late to change his course and he remained in dignified quiet awaiting the workings of the tuscaroras mind  it was more than a minute ere nick made any reply gradually but very slowly the expression of his visage changed it finally became as stoical in expression as severe training could render the human countenance and as unmoved as marble then he found the language he wanted  listen said the indian sternly capin ole man got a head like snow on rock he bold soldier but he no got wisdom enough for gray hair why he put he hand rough on place where whip strike wise man nebber do aat last winter he cold fire wanted to make him warm much ice much storm much snow world seem badfit only for bear and snake dat hide in rock well winter gone away ice gone away snow gone away storm gone away summer come in his place ebbery ting goodebbery ting pleasant why tink of winter when summer come and drive him away wid pleasant sky  in order to provide for its return he who never thought of the evil day in the hour of his prosperity would find that he has forgotten not only a duty but the course of wisdom  he not wise said nick sternly capin paleface chief he got garrison got soldier got musket well he flog warriors back make blood come dat bad enough worse to put finger on ole sore and make e pain and e shame come back agin  perhaps it would have been more generous nick to have said nothing about it but you see how i am situated an enemy without my men deserting a bad lookout and one finding his way into my very court yard and i ignorant of the means  nick tell capin all about means if redmen outside shoot em if garrison run away flog garrison if dont know larn but dont flog back agin on ole sore  well well say no more about it nick here is a dollar to keep you in rum and we will talk of other matters  nick heeded not the money though it was held before his eyes some little time to tempt him perceiving that the tuscarora was now acting as a warrior and a chief which nick would do and do well on occasion the captain pocketed the offering and regulated his own course accordingly  at all events i have a right to insist on knowing first by what means you entered the palisades and second what business has brought you here at night and so suddenly  ask nick capin all he right to ask but dont touch ole flog how i cross palisade where your sentinel to stop injin one at gate well none all round tother place get in up here down dere over yonder ten twenty tree spotspose him tree climb him spose him palisadeclimb him too what helpsoldier out at gate when nick get

well who crept in close by cannon open gate let palemen in great tuscarora do dat no flog denno talk of ole sore dat night  this is all true enough wyandott√©this was nicks loftiest appellation and a grim but faint smile crossed his visage as he heard it again in the mouth of one who had known him when its sound carried terror to the hearts of his enemiesthis is all true wyandott√© and i have even given you credit for it on that occasion you were bold as the lion and as cunning as a foxyou were much honoured for that exploit  no ole sore in dat um cried nick in a way so startling as to sicken mrs willoughby to the heart no call nick dog dat night he all warrior denall face no back  i have said you were honoured for your conduct nick and paid for it now let me know what has brought you here tonight and whence you come  there was another pause gradually the countenance of the indian became less and less fierce until it lost its expression of malignant resentment in one in which human emotions of a kinder nature predominated  squaw good he said even gently waving his hand towards mrs willoughbygot son love him like little baby nick come six two time before runner from her son  my son wyandott√© exclaimed the motherbring you any tidings now from my boy  no bring tidintoo heavy indian dont love to carry loadbring letter  the cry from the three females was now common each holding out her hand with an involuntary impulse to receive the note nick drew the missive from a fold of his garment and placed it in the hand of mrs willoughby with a quiet grace that a courtier might have wished to equal in vain  the note was short and had been written in pencil on a leaf torn from some book of coarse paper the handwriting however was at once recognised as robert willoughbys though there was no address nor any signature the paper merely contained the following  trust to your defences and to nothing else this party has many white men in it disguised as indians i am suspected if not known you will be tampered with but the wisest course is to be firm if nick is honest he can tell you more if false this note will be shown even though it be delivered secure the inner gates and depend more on the house itself than on the palisades fear nothing for memy life can be in no danger  this note was read by each in succession maud turning aside to conceal the tears that fell fast on the paper as she perused it she read it last and was enabled to retain it and precious to her heart was the boon at such a moment when nearly every sensation of her being centred in intense feeling in behalf of the captive  we are told to inquire the particulars of you nick observed the captain i hope you will tell us nothing but truth a lie is so unworthy a warriors mouth  nick didnt lie bout beaver dam capin no find him good as indian say  in that you dealt honestly and i give you credit for it has any one seen this letter but ourselves yourself and the person who wrote it  what for ask if nick say no capin tink he lie even fox tell trut some time why not injin nick say no  where did you leave my son and whenwhere is the party of redskins at this moment  all paleface in hurry ask ten one four question altogeder well answer him so down here at mill down dere at mill half an hour six two ten oclock  i understand you to say that major willoughby was at the mill when you saw him last and that this was only half an hour since  the tuscarora nodded his head in assent but made no other reply even as he did this his keen eyes rolled over the pallid faces of the females in a way to awaken the captains distrust and he resumed his questions in a tone that partook more of the military severity of his ancient habits than of the gentler manner he had been accustomed to use of late years  you know me nick he said sternly and ought to dread my displeasure  what capin mean now demanded the indian quietly  that the same whip is in this fort that i always kept in the other in which you knew me to dwell nor have i forgotten how to use it  the tuscarora gazed at the captain with a very puzzling expression though in the main his countenance appeared to be ironical rather than fierce  what for talk of whip now he said even yengeese genral hide whip when he see enemy soldier cant fight when back sore when battle near den all good friend when battle over den flog flog flog why talk socapin nebber strike wyandott√©  your memory must be short to say this i thought an indian kept a better record of what passed  no man dare strike wyandott√© exclaimed the indian with energy no manpaleface or redskin can give blow on back of wyandott√© and see sun set  wellwellnick we will not dispute on this point but let byegones be byegones what has happened has happened and i hope will never occur again  dat happen to nicksassy nickpoor drunken nickto wyandott√© nebber  i believe i begin to understand you now tuscarora and am glad i have a chief and a warrior in my house instead of a poor miserable outcast shall i have the pleasure of filling you a glass in honour of our old campaigns  nick alway drywyandott√© know no thirst nick beggarask for rumpray for rumtink of rum talk of rum laugh for rum cry for rum wyandott√© dont know rum when he see him wyandott√© beg notin no not his scalp  all this sounds well and i am both willing and glad chief to receive you in the character in which you give me to understand you have now come a warrior of wyandott√©s high name is too proud to carry a forked tongue in his mouth and i shall hear nothing but truth tell me then all you know about this party at the mill what has brought it here how you came to meet my son and what will be the next step of his captors answer the questions in the order in which i put them  wyandott√© not newspaper to tell ebbery ting at once let capin talk like one chief speaking to anoder  then tell me first what you know of this party at the mill are there many palefaces in it  put em in the river answered the indian sententiously water tell the trut  you think that there are many among them that would wash white  wyandott√© know so when did red warriors ever travel on their path like hogs in drove one redman there as great spirit make him by his side two redmen as paint make em this soon told on trail  you struck their trail then and joined their company in that manner  another nod indicated the assent of the indian perceiving that the tuscarora did not intend to speak the captain continued his interrogatories  and how did the trail betray this secret chief he asked  toe turn outstep too shorttrail too broadtrail too plainmarch too short  you must have followed them some distance wyandott√© to learn all this  follow from mohawkjoin em at mill tuscarora dont like too much travel with mohawk  but according to your account there cannot be a great many redskins in the party if the white men so much outnumber them  nick now raised his right hand showing all the fingers and the thumb at each exhibition four several times then he raised it once showing only the forefinger and thumb  this makes twentytwo nickdo you include yourself in the number  wyandott√© a tuscarorahe count mohawks  trueare there any other redmen among them  oneida soholding up four fingers only after which he held up a single finger addingonondaga so  twentytwo mohawks four oneidas and a single onondaga make twenty seven in all to these how many whites am i to addyou counted them also  the indian now showed both hands with all the fingers extended repeating the gestures four times then he showed one hand entire and two fingers on the other  fortyseven add these to the redskins and we get seventyfour for the total i had supposed them rather stronger than this wyandott√©  no strongerno weakerjust so good many ole womans too among palefaces  old womenyou are not speaking literally nick all that i have seen appear to be men  got beard but ole woman too talktalktalkdo notin dat what injin call ole woman party poor party capin beat em if he fight like ole time  well this is encouraging wilhelmina and nick seems to be dealing fairly with us  now inquire more about robert hughsaid the wife in whose maternal heart her children were always uppermost  you hear nick my wife is desirous of learning something about her son next  during the preceding dialogue there had been something equivocal in the expression of the indians face every word he uttered about the party its numbers and his own manner of falling in with it was true and his countenance indicated that he was dealing fairly still the captain fancied that he could detect a covert fierceness in his eye and air and he felt uneasiness even while he yielded him credence as soon as mrs willoughby however interposed the gleam of ferocity that passed so naturally and readily athwart the swarthy features of the savage melted into a look of gentleness and there were moments when it might be almost termed softness  good to have modersaid nick kindly wyandott√© got no squawwife dead moder dead sister deadall gone to land of spiritsbyemby chief follow no one throw stone on his grave been on deathpath long ago but capins squaw say stop nick little too soon now take medicine and get well squaw made to do good chief alway like e squaw when his mind not wild with war  and your mind wyandott√© is not wild with war now answered mrs willoughby earnestly you will help a mother then to get her son out of the hands of merciless enemies  why you tink merciless because paleface dress like injin and try to cheat  that may be one reason but i fear there are many others tell me wyandott√© how came you to discover that robert was a prisoner and by what means did he contrive to give you his letter  the indian assumed a look of pride a little blended with hauteur for he felt that he was manifesting the superiority of a redman over the paleface as he related the means through which he had made his discoveries  read book on ground nick answered gravely two book alway open before chief one in sky tother on ground book in sky tell weathersnow rain wind thunder lightning warbook on ground tell what happen  and what had this book on the ground to do with my son wyandott√©  tell all about him majors trail first seen at mill no moccasin much boot soldier boot like lettersay great deal in few word first tink it capin but it too short den know it major  this sounds very well nick interrupted the captain though you will excuse me if i say it is going a little too far it seems impossible that you should know that the print of the foot was that of my son how could you be certain of this  how could eh who follow trail from house here to hudson river tink nick blind and cant see tuscarora read his book well as paleface read bible here nick looked round him a moment raised his forefinger dropped his voice and added earnestlysee him at bunker hillknow him among ten six two tousand warrior know dat foot if meet him in happy hunting ground  and why my sons foot in particular the boot is often changed can never be exactly like its predecessor and one boot is so much like another that to me the thing seems impossible this account of the boot nick makes me distrust your whole story  what distrust demanded the indian like lightning  it means doubt uncertaintydistrust  dont believe ha  yes that is it substantially dont more than half believe perhaps would be nearer to the mark  why ole soldier alway distrust squaw nebber ask moderhayou tink nick dont know sons trailhandsome trail like young chiefs  i can readily believe nick might recognise bobs trail hugh expostulated mrs willoughby he has a foot in a thousandyou may remember how every one was accustomed to speak of his beautiful foot even when he was a boy as a man i think it still more remarkable  ay go on nick in this way and my wife will believe all you say there is no distrust in a mothers partiality certainly you are an old courtier and would make your way at st jamess  major nebber tell about foot asked nick earnestly  i remember nothing and had he spoken of any such thing i must have heard it but never mind the story now you saw the footprint and knew it for my sons did you ask to be admitted to his prison or was your intercourse secret  wyandott√© too wise to act like squaw or boy see him widout look talk widout speakhear widout ear major write letter nick take him all done by eye and hand notin done by tongue or at council fire mohawk blind like owl  may i believe you tuscarora or incited by demons do you come to deceive me  ole warrior look two time before he go tink ten time before he say yes all good nick no affronted do so himself and tink it right capin may believe all nick say  father cried maud with simple energy i will answer for the indians honesty he has guided robert so often and been with him in so many trying scenes he never can have the heart to betray him or us trust him then he may be of infinite service  even captain willoughby little disposed as he was to judge nick favourably was struck with the gleam of mamy kindness that shot across the dark face of the indian as he gazed at the glowing cheek and illuminated countenance of the ardent and beautiful girl  nick seems disposed to make a truce with you at least maud he said smiling and i shall now know where to look for a mediator whenever any trouble arises between us  i have known wyandott√© dear sir from childhood and he has ever been my friend he promised me in particular to be true to bob and i am happy to say he has ever kept his word  this was telling but half the story maud had made the indian many presents and most especially had she attended to his wants when it was known he was to be the majors guide the year previously on his return to boston nick had known her real father and was present at his death he was consequently acquainted with her actual position in the family of the hutted knoll and what was of far more consequence in present emergencies he had fathomed the depths of her heart in a way our heroine could hardly be said to have done herself off her guard with such a being mauds solicitude however had betrayed her and the penetrating tuscarora had discerned that which had escaped the observation of father and mother and sister had nick been a pale face of the class of those with whom he usually associated his discovery would have gone through the settlement with scoffings and exaggerations but this forest gentleman for such was wyandott√© in spite of his degradation and numerous failings had too much consideration to make a womans affections the subject of his coarseness and merriment the secrets of maud would not have been more sacred with her own brother had such a relative existed to become her confidant than it was with saucy nick  nick gals friend observed the indian quietly dat enough what nick say nick mean what nick mean he do come capin time to quit squaw and talk about war  at this hint which was too plain to be misunderstood captain willoughby bade the indian withdraw to the court promising to follow him as soon as he could hold a short conference with joyce who was now summoned to the council the subject of discussion was the manner in which the tuscarora had passed the stockade and the probability of his being true the serjeant was disposed to distrust all redmen and he advised putting nick under arrest and to keep him in durance until the return of light at least  i might almost say your honour that such are orders sir the advice to soldiers carrying on war with savages tells us that the best course is to pay off treachery with treachery and treachery is a redskins manual exercise there is ohearn will make a capital sentinel for the fellow is as true as the best steel in the army mr woods room is empty and it is so far out of the way that nothing will be easier than to keep the savage snug enough besides by a little management he might fancy we were doing him honour all the while  we will see serjeant answered the captain it has a bad appearance and yet it may be the wisest thing we can do let us first go the rounds taking nick with us for safety and determine afterwards      chapter xx    his hand was staydhe knew not why   twas a presence breathed around   a pleading from the deepblue sky   and up from the teeming ground   it told of the care that lavishd had been   in sunshine and in dew   of the many things that had wrought a screen   when peril round it grew    mrs seba smith  the desertions gave not only the captain but his great support and auxiliary the serjeant the gravest apprehensions a disposition of that nature is always contagious men abandoning a failing cause much as rats are known to quit a sinking ship it is not a matter of surprise therefore that the distrust which accompanied the unexpected appearance of the tuscarora became associated with this falling off in the loyalty of the garrison in the minds of the two old soldiers  i do think your honour said joyce as they entered the court together that we may depend on ohearn and jamie and strides the latter as a matter of course being a corporal or serjeant as he calls himself and the two first as men who have no ties but such as would be likely to keep them true to this family but here is the corporal to speak for himself  as this was said corporal strides as the serjeant persisted in terming joel on the ground that being but one step higher himself the overseer could justly claim no rank of greater pretension approached the captain taking care to make the military salute which joyce had never succeeded before in extracting from him notwithstanding a hundred admonitions on the subject  this is a distressing affair captain willoughby observed joel in his most jesuitical manner and to me it is altogether onaccountable it does seem to me agin natur for a man to desart his own household and hum joel meant home in the hour of trial if a fellow being wunt anglice wont stand by his wife and children he can hardly be expected to do any of his duties  quite true strides answered the confiding captain though these deserters are not altogether as bad as you represent since you will remember they have carried their wives and children with them  i believe they have siryes that must be allowed to be true and that it is which to me seems the most extrornary the very men that a person would calcilate on the most or the heads of families have desarted while them that remain behind are mostly single  if we single men have no wives and children of our own to fight for strides observed joyce with a little military stiffness we have the wife and children of captain willoughby no man who wishes to sell his life dearly need look for a better motive  thank you serjeant the captain said feelinglyon you i can rely as on myself so long as i have you and joel here and mike and the blacks and the rest of the brave fellows who have stood by me thus far i shall not despair we can make good the house against ten times our own number but it is time to look to the indians  i was going to speak to the captain about nick put in joel who had listened to the eulogium on his own fidelity with some qualms of conscience i cant say i like the manner he has passed between the two parties and that fellow has always seemed to me as if he owed the captain a mortal grudge when an injin does owe a grudge he is pretty sartain to pay it in full  this has passed over my mind too i will confess joel yet nick and i have been on reasonably good terms when one comes to remember his character on the one side and the fact that i have commanded a frontier garrison on the other if i have had occasion to flog him a few times i have also had occasion to give him more rum than has done him good with now and then a dollar  there i think the captain miscalcilates observed joel with a knowledge of human nature that would have been creditable to him had he practised on it himself no man is thankful for rum when the craving is off sin he knows he has been taking an inimy into his stomach and as for the money it was much the same as giving the liquor seem that it went for liquor as soon as he could trot down to the mill a man will seek his revenge for rum as soon as for anything else when he gets to feel injuries uppermost besides i spose the captain knows an injury will be remembered long ater a favour is forgotten  this may be true strides and certainly i shall keep my eyes on the indian can you mention any particular act that excites your suspicion  dont the captain think nick may have had suthin to do with the desartionsa dozen men would scarce desart all at once as it might be onless someone was at the bottom of it  this was true enough certainly though joel chose to keep out of view all his own machinations and arts on the subject the captain was struck by the suggestion and he determined to put his first intention in respect to nick in force immediately still it was necessary to proceed with caution the state of the hut rendering a proper watch and a suitable prison difficult to be obtained these circumstances were mentioned to the overseer who led the way to the part of the buildings occupied by his own family and throwing open the doors ostentatiously exhibited phoebe and her children in their customary beds at a moment when so many others had proved recreant his professed object was to offer a small closet in his own rooms as a prison for nick remarking he must be an ingenious savage indeed if he could escape the vigilance of as many watchful eyes as would then be on him  i believe you strides said the captain smiling as he walked away from the place if he can escape phoebe and her children the fellow must be made of quicksilver still i have a better prison in view i am glad to see this proof however of your own fidelity by finding all your family in their beds for those are not wanting who would have me suspect even you  mewell if the captain cant count on his own overseer i should like to ask such persons on whom he can count madam willoughby and the young ladies isnt more likely to remain true than i am myself i should thinkwhat in reason or natur or all lawful objects could make me  joel was about to run into that excess of vindication that is a little apt to mark guilt but the captain cut him short by telling him it was unnecessary recommending vigilance and walking away in search of nick  the indian was found standing beneath the arch of the gateway upright motionless and patient a lantern was kept burning here the place being used as a sort of guardhouse and by its light it was easy to perceive the state of the still unhung leaf of the passage this leaf however was propped in its place by strong timbers and on the whole many persons would think it the most secure half of the gate captain willoughby observed that the indian was studying this arrangement when he entered the place himself the circumstance caused him uneasiness and quickened his determination to secure the indian  well nick he said concealing his intention under an appearance of indifference you see our gates are well fastened and steady hands and quick eyes will do the rest it is getting late and i wish to have you comfortably lodged before i lie down myself follow me and i will show you to a place where you will be at your ease  the tuscarora understood the captains object the instant he spoke of giving him comfortable lodgings a bed being a thing that was virtually unknown to his habits but he raised no objections quietly treading in the others footsteps until both were in the bedroom of the absent mr woods the apartments of the chaplain were above the library and being in the part of the house that was fortified by the cliff they had dormer windows that looked toward the forest the height of these windows the captain thought would be a sufficient security against flight and by setting mike and one of the plinys on the lookout to relieve each other at intervals of four hours he thought the tuscarora might be kept until the return of light the hour when he most apprehended danger was that which just precedes the day sleep then pressing the heaviest on the sentinels eyelids and rest having refreshed the assailants  here wyandott√© i intend you shall pass the night said the captain assuming as much courtesy of manner as if he were doing the honours of his house to an invited and honoured guest i know you despise a bed but there are blankets and by spreading them on the floor you can make your own arrangements  nick made a gesture of assent looking cautiously around him carefully avoiding every appearance of curiosity at the same time more in pride of character however than in cunning nevertheless he took in the history of the locality at a glance  it is well he said a tuscarora chief no tink of sleep sleep come standing walking where he will when he will dog eats den lie down to sleep warrior always ready good bye capinto morrow see him agin  good night nick i have ordered your old friend mike the irishman to come and sit in your room lest you might want something in the night you are good friends with mike i believe i chose him on that account  the indian understood this too but not an angry gleam no smile nor any other sign betrayed his consciousness of the captains motives  mike good he answered with emphasis long tongueshort tink say much mean little heart sound like hard oakmind like spunkburn quick no too much strong  this sententious and accurate delineation of the county leitrimmans characteristics induced a smile in the captain but ohearn entering at the moment and possessing his entire confidence he saw no use in replying in another minute the two worthies were left in possession of the bedroom michael having received a most solemn injunction not to be tempted to drink  it was now so late the captain determined to let the regular watches of the night take their course he held a short consultation with joyce who took the first ward and then threw himself on a mattrass in his clothes his affectionate wife having done the same thing by the side of her daughters and grandson in an adjoining room in a short time the sounds of footsteps ceased in the hut and one unacquainted with the real state of the household might have fancied that the peace and security of one of its ancient midnights were reigning about the knoll  it was just two in the morning when the serjeant tapped lightly at the door of his commanding officers room the touch was sufficient to bring the captain to his feet and he instantly demanded the news  nothing but sentrygo your honour replied joyce i am as fresh as a regiment that is just marching out of barracks and can easily stand the guard till daylight still as it was orders to call your honour at two i could do no less you know sir  very well serjeanti will just wash my eyes and be with you in a minute how has the night gone  famously quiet sir not even an owl to trouble it the sentinels have kept their eyes wide open dread of the scalpingknife being a good wakener and no sign of any alarm has been seen i will wait for your honour in the court the moment of relieving guard being often chosen by a cunning enemy for the assault  yes sputtered the captain his face just emerging from the waterif he happen to know when that is  in another minute the two old soldiers were together in the court waiting the return of jamie allen with his report the mason having been sent round to the beds of the fresh men to call the guard it was not long however before the old man was seen hastening towards the spot where joyce had bid him come  the lord ha maircy on us and on a wretched sinners exclaimed jamie as soon as near enough to be heard without raising his voice on too high a keythere are just the beds of the three connecticut lads that were to come into the lairds guard as empty as a robins nest fra which the yang ha flown  do you mean jamie that the boys have deserted  its just that and no need of caing it by anither name the hoose o hanover wad seem to have put the deil in a the lads women and children included and to have raised up a spirit o disaffection that is fast leaving us to carry on this terrible warfare with our ain hearts and bodies  with your honours permission said the serjeant i would ask corporal allen if the deserters have gone off with their arms and accoutrements  airms ay and legs and a belonging to em with mair that is the lawfu property of the laird not so much as a flint is left behind  then we may count on seeing all the fellows in the enemys ranks the serjeant quietly remarked helping himself to the tobacco from which he had refrained throughout the previous hours of the night joyce being too much of a martinet to smoke or chew on duty its uphill work your honour when every deserter counts two in this manner the civil wars however are remarkable for this sort of wheeling and facing to the rightabout the same man often changing his colours two or three times in a campaign  captain willoughby received the news of this addition to his ill luck with an air of military stoicism though he felt in reality more like a father and a husband on the occasion than like a hero accustomed to selfcommand he succeeded in concealing the extent of his uneasiness while he immediately set about inquiring into the extent of the evil  joel is to join my watch he said and he may throw some light on this affair let us call him at once for a few minutes may prove of importance  even while speaking the captain crossed the court accompanied by the serjeant and mason and ceremony being little attended to on such occasions they all entered the quarters of strides in a body the place was empty man woman and children had abandoned the spot seemingly in a body and this too far from emptyhanded the manner in which the room had been stripped indeed was the first fact which induced the captain to believe that a man so much and so long trusted would desert him in a strait so serious there could be no mistake and for a moment the husband and father felt such a sinking of the heart as would be apt to follow the sudden conviction that his enemies must prevail  let us look further joyce he said and ascertain the extent of the evil at once  this is a very bad example your honour that corporal strides has set the men and we may expect to hear of more desertions a non commissioned officer should have had too much pride for this i have always remarked sir in the army that when a noncommissioned officer left his colours he was pretty certain to carry off a platoon with him  the search justified this opinion of the serjeant a complete examination of the quarters of all the men having been made it was ascertained that every white man in the hut the serjeant jamie allen and a young new england labourer of the name of blodget excepted had abandoned the place every man had carried off with him his arms and ammunition leaving the rooms as naked of defence as they had been before they were occupied women and children too were all gone proving that the flights had been made deliberately and with concert this left the hut to be defended by its owner the serjeant the two plinys and a young descendant of the same colour jamie allen blodget and mike who had not yet been relieved from his ward over the indian eight men in all who might possibly receive some assistance from the four black females in the kitchen  the captain examined this small array of force every man but mike being up and in the line with a saddened countenance for he remembered what a different appearance it made only the previous day when he had his gallant son too with him a host in himself it added mortification to regret also when he remembered that this great loss had been made without a single blow having been struck in defence of his precious family and his lawful rights  we must close the gate of the court and bar it at once joyce the captain said as soon as fully apprised of the true state of his force it will be quite sufficient if we make good the house with this handful of men giving up all hope of doing anything with the stockade it is the facility offered by the open gateway that has led to all this mischief  i dont know your honour when desertion once fairly gets into a mans mind its wonderful the means he will find to bring about his wishes corporal strides no doubt has passed his family and his kit through both gates for being in authority our people were hardly disciplined enough to understand the difference between a non commissioned officer on guard and one off guard but there were a hundred ways to mischief even had there been no gate jamie take one of the blacks and bar the inner gate what is your honours pleasure next  i wish my mind were at ease on the subject of the tuscarora with nicks assistance as a runner and spy and even as a sharpshooter we should be vastly stronger see to the gate yourself serjeant then follow me to mr woods room  this was done the captain waiting for his companion on the threshold of the outer door ascending the narrow stairs they were soon on the floor above and were happy to find the door of the tuscaroras prison fastened without as they had left it this precaution having been taken as a salutary assistance to ohearns sagacity undoing these fastenings the serjeant stepped aside to allow his superior to precede him as became their respective stations the captain advanced holding the lantern before him and found an empty room both nick and mike were gone though it was not easy to discover by what means they had quitted the place the door was secure the windows were down and the chimney was too small to allow of the passage of a human body the defection of the irishman caused the captain great pain while it produced surprise even in the serjeant mikes fidelity had been thought of proof and for an instant the master of the place was disposed to believe some evil spirit had been at work to corrupt his people  this is more than i could have expected joyce he said as much in sorrow as in anger i should have as soon looked for the desertion of old pliny as that of mike  it is extrornary sir but one is never safe without inandin discipline a drill a week and that only for an hour or two of a saturday afternoon captain willoughby may make a sort of country militia but it will do nothing for the field talk of enlisting men for a year serjeant joyce said old colonel flanker to me one day in the last warwhy it will take a year to teach a soldier how to eat your silly fellows in the provincial assemblies fancy because a man has teeth and a stomach and an appetite that he knows how to eat but eating is an art serjeant and military eating above all other branches of it and i maintain a soldier can no more learn how to eat as a soldier the colonel meant your honour than he can learn to plan a campaign by going through the manual exercise for my part captain willoughby i have always thought it took a man his first five years enlistment to learn how to obey orders  i had thought that irishmans heart in the right place joyce and counted as much on him as i did on you  on me captain willoughby answered the serjeant in a tone of mortification i should think your honour would have made some difference between your old orderlya man who had served thirty years in your own regiment and most of the time in your own company and a bit of a wild hibernian of only ten years acquaintance and he a man who never saw a battalion paraded for real service  i see my error now joyce but michael had so much blundering honesty about him or seemed to have that i have been his dupe it is too late however to repine the fellow is gone it only remains to ascertain the manner of his flight may not joel have undone the fastenings of the door and let him and the indian escape together in common with the rest of the deserters  i secured that door sir with my own hands in a military manner and know that it was found as i left it the rev mr woods bed seems to have been disturbed perhaps that may furnish a clue  a clue the bed did furnish and it solved the problem the bedcord was removed and both the sheets and one of the blankets were missing this directed the inquiry to the windows one of which was not closed entirely a chimney stood near the side of this window and by its aid it was not difficult to reach the ridge of the roof on the inner side of the roof was the staging or walk already mentioned and once on that a person could make the circuit of the entire roof in perfect safety joyce mounted to the ridge followed by the captain and gained the staging with a little effort whence they proceeded round the buildings to ascertain if the rope was not yet hanging over the exterior as a means of descent it was found as expected and withdrawn lest it might be used to introduce enemies within the house  these discoveries put the matter of michaels delinquency at rest he had clearly gone off with his prisoner and might next be looked for in the ranks of the besiegers the conviction of this truth gave the captain more than uneasiness it caused him pain for the county leitrimman had been a favourite with the whole family and most especially with his daughter maud  i do not think you and the blacks will leave me joyce he observed as the serjeant and himself descended by the common passage to the court on you i can rely as i would rely on my noble son were he with me at this moment  i beg your honours pardonfew words tell best for a man deeds being his dutybut if your honour will have the condescension just to issue your orders the manner in which they shall be obeyed will tell the whole story  i am satisfied of that serjeant we must put shoulder to shoulder and die in the breach should it be necessary before we give up the place  by this time the two old soldiers were again in the court where they found all their remaining force of the male sex the men being too uneasy indeed to think of going to their pallets until better assured of their safety captain willoughby ordered joyce to draw them up in line again when he addressed them once more in person  my friends the captain commenced there would be little use in attempting to conceal from you our real situation nor would it be strictly honest you see here every man on whom i can now depend for the defence of my fireside and family mike has gone with the rest and the indian has escaped in his company you can make up your own opinions of our chances of success but my resolution is formed before i open a gate to the merciless wretches without who are worse than the savages of the wilderness possessing all their bad and none of their redeeming qualities it is my determination to be buried under the ruins of this dwelling but you are not bound to imitate my example and if any man among you black or white regrets being here at this moment he shall still have arms and ammunition and food given him the gates shall be opened and he may go freely to seek his safety in the forest for gods sake let there be no more desertions he that wishes to quit me may now quit me unmolested but after this moment martial law will be enforced and i shall give orders to shoot down any man detected in treachery as i would shoot down a vicious dog  this address was heard in profound silence no man stirred nor did any man speak  blodget continued the captain you have been with me a shorter time than any other person present and cannot feel the same attachment to me and mine as the rest you are the only native american among us joyce exceptedfor we count the blacks as nothing in respect to countrymay feel that i am an englishman born as i fear has been the case with the rest of your friends perhaps i ought not to ask you to remain take your arms then and make the best of your way to the settlements should you reach albany you might even serve me essentially by delivering a letter i will confide to you and which will bring us effectual succour  the young man did not answer though his fingers worked on the barrel of his musket and he shifted his weight from leg to leg like one whose inward feelings were moved  i believe i understand you captain willoughby he said at length though i think you dont understand me i know you old country people think meanly of us new country people but i suppose thats in the nature of things then i allow joel strides conduct has been such as to give you reason to judge us harshly but there is a difference among us as well as among the english and some of uswont say i am such a man but actions speak louder than words and all will be known in the endbut some of us will be found true to our bargains as well as other men  bravely answered my lad cried the serjeant heartily and looking round at his commander with exultation to congratulate him on having such a followerthis is a man who will obey orders through thick and thin ill answer for it your honour little does he care whos king or whos governor so long as he knows his captain and his corps  there you are mistaken serjeant joyce the youth observed firmly im for my country and id quit this house in a minute did i believe captain willoughby meant to help the crown but i have lived long enough here to know he is at the most neutral though i think he rather favours the side of the colonies than that of the crown  you have judged rightly blodget observed the captain i do not quite like this declaration of independence though i can scarce blame congress for having made it of the two i think the americans nearest right and i now conceive myself to be more of an american than an englishman i wish this to be understood joyce  do you sirits just as your honour pleases i didnt know which side it was your pleasure to support nor does it make any great difference with most of us orders are orders let them come from king or colonies i would take the liberty of recommending your honour that this young man be promoted strides desertion has left a vacancy among the corporals and we shall want another for the guard it would hardly do to make a nigger a corporal  very well joyce have it as you wish interrupted the captain a little impatiently for he perceived he had a spirit to deal with in blodget that must hold such trifles at their true value let it be corporal allen and corporal blodget in future  do you hear menthese are general orders the relieved guard will fall out and try to get a little sleep as we shall parade again half an hour before day  alas the relieved guard like the relief itself consisted of only two men corporal blodget and pliny the younger old pliny in virtue of his household work being rated as an idler these five with the captain and the serjeant made the number of the garrison seven which was the whole male force that now remained  captain willoughby directed joyce and his two companions to go to their pallets notwithstanding assuming the charge of the lookout himself and profiting by the occasion to make himself better acquainted with the character of his new corporal than circumstances had hitherto permitted      chapter xxi   for thee they fought for thee they fell   and their oath was on thee laid   to thee the clarions raised their swell   and the dying warriors prayd    percival  the distaste for each other which existed between the people of new england and those of the adjoining colonies anterior to the war of the revolution is a matter of history it was this feeling that threw schuyler one of the ablest and best men in the service of his country into the shade a year later than the period of which we are writing this feeling was very naturally produced and under the circumstances was quite likely to be active in a revolution although new england and new york were contiguous territories a wide difference existed between their social conditions out of the larger towns there could scarcely be said to be a gentry at all in the former while the latter a conquered province had received the framework of the english system possessing lords of the manor and divers other of the fragments of the feudal system so great was the social equality throughout the interior of the new england provinces indeed as almost to remove the commoner distinctions of civilised associations bringing all classes surprisingly near the same level with the exceptions of the very low or some rare instance of an individual who was raised above his neighbours by unusual wealth aided perhaps by the accidents of birth and the advantages of education  the results of such a state of society are easily traced habit had taken the place of principles and a people accustomed to see even questions of domestic discipline referred either to the church or to public sentiment and who knew few or none of the ordinary distinctions of social intercourse submitted to the usages of other conditions of society with singular distaste and stubborn reluctance the native of new england deferred singularly to great wealth in 1776 as he is known to defer to it today but it was opposed to all his habits and prejudices to defer to social station unused to intercourse with what was then called the great world of the provinces he knew not how to appreciate its manners or opinions and as is usual with the provincial he affected to despise that which he neither practised nor understood this at once indisposed him to acknowledge the distinctions of classes and when accident threw him into the adjoining province he became marked at once for decrying the usages he encountered comparing them with singular selffelicitation to those he had left behind him sometimes with justice beyond a doubt but oftener in provincial ignorance and narrow bigotry  a similar state of things on a larger scale has been witnessed more especially in western new york since the peace of 83 the great inroads of emigrants from the new england states having almost converted that district of country into an eastern colony men of the world while they admit how much has been gained in activity available intelligence of the practical school and enterprise regret that the fusion has been quite so rapid and so complete it being apparently a law of nature that nothing precious that comes of man shall be enjoyed altogether without alloy  the condition in which captain willoughby was now placed might have been traced to causes connected with the feelings and habits above alluded to it was distasteful to joel strides and one or two of his associates to see a social chasm as wide as that which actually existed between the family of the proprietor of the knoll and his own growing no narrower and an active cupidity with the hopes of confiscations or an abandonment of the estate came in aid of this rankling jealousy of station the most uneasy as it is the meanest of all our vices utterly incapable of appreciating the width of that void which separates the gentleman from the man of coarse feelings and illiterate vulgarity he began to preach that doctrine of exaggerated and mistaken equality which says one man is as good as another a doctrine that is nowhere engrafted even on the most democratic of our institutions today since it would totally supersede the elections and leave us to draw lots for public trusts as men are drawn for juries on ordinary occasions the malignant machinations of strides would probably have led to no results but aided by the opinions and temper of the times he had no great difficulty in undermining his masters popularity by incessant and welldigested appeals to the envy and cupidity of his companions the probity liberality and manly sincerity of captain willoughby often counteracted his schemes it is true but as even the stone yields to constant attrition so did joel finally succeed in overcoming the influence of these high qualities by dint of perseverance and cunning not a little aided by certain auxiliaries freely obtained from the father of lies  as our tale proceeds joels connection with the late movement will become more apparent and we prefer leaving the remainder of the explanations to take their proper places in the course of the narrative  joyce was so completely a matter of drill that he was in a sound sleep three minutes after he had lain down the negro who belonged to his guard imitating his industry in this particular with equal coolness as for the thoughtful scotchman jamie allen sleep and he were strangers that night to own the truth the disaffection of mike not only surprised but it disappointed him he remained in the court therefore conversing on the subject with the laird after his companions had fallen asleep  i wad na hae thought that o michael he said for the man had an honest way with him and was so seeming valiant that i could na hae supposed him capable of proving a desairter monys the time that ive heard him swearfor michael was an awfu hand at that vice when his betters were no near to rebuke himbut often has he swore that madam and her winsome daughters were the pride of his een ay and their delight too  the poor fellow has yielded to my unlucky fortune jamie returned the captain and i sometimes think it were better had you all imitated his example  begging pairdon captain willoughby for the familiarity but yere just wrang fra beginning to end in the supposition no man with a hairt in his body wad desairt ye in a time like this and no mair s to be said in the matter nor do i think that luuk has had anything to do with michaels deficiency unless ye ca it luuk to be born and edicated in a misguiding religion michaels catholicity is at the bottom of his backsliding yell find if ye look closely into the maiter  i do not see how that is to be made out allen all sects of the christian religion i believe teaching us to abide by our engagements and to perform our duties  na doubtna doubt squire willoughbytheres a seeming desire to teach as much in a churches but yell no deny that the creatur o rome wears a mask and that catholicity is at the best but a wicked feature to enter into the worship of god  catholicism jamie means adherence to the catholic church  just thatjust thatinterrupted the scot eagerlyand its that o which i complain all protestantswather fully disposed or ainly halfdisposed as may be the case with the english kirkall protestants agree in condemning the varry word catholic which is a sign and a symbol of the foul woman o babylon  then jamie they agree in condemning what they dont understand i should be sorry to think i am not a member of the catholic church myself  yersalno captain willoughby yere no catholic though you are a bit akin to it perhaps i know that mr woods thats now in the hands o the savages prays for the catholics and professes to believe in what he cas the holy catholic kirk but then ive always supposed that was in the way o christian charity like for one is obleeged to use decent language yell be acknowledging sir in the pulpit if its only for appearances sake  wellwelljamie a more fitting occasion may occur for discussing matters of this nature and we will postpone the subject to another time i may have need of your services an hour or two hence and it will be well for every man to come to the work fresh and clearheaded go to your pallet then and expect an early call  the mason was not a man to oppose such an order coming from the laird and he withdrew leaving the captain standing in the centre of the court quite alone we say alone for young blodget had ascended to the gallery or staging that led around the inner sides of the roofs while the negro on guard was stationed at the gateway as the only point where the hut could be possibly carried by a coupdemain as the first of these positions commanded the best exterior view from the inside of the buildings the captain mounted the stairs he had so recently descended and joined the young rhode islander at his post  the night was starlight but the elevation at which the two watchers were placed was unfavourable to catching glimpses of any lurking enemy the height confounded objects with the ground on which they were placed though blodget told the captain he did not think a man could cross the palisades without his being seen by moving along the staging on the southern side of the quadrangle he could keep a tolerable look out on the front and two flanks at the same time still this duty could not be performed without considerable risk as the head and shoulders of a man moving along the ridge of the building would be almost certain to attract the eye of any indian without this was the first circumstance that the captain remarked on joining his companion and gratitude induced him to point it out in order that the other might in a degree at least avoid the danger  i suppose blodget this is the first of your service said captain willoughby and it is not easy to impress on a young man the importance of unceasing vigilance against savage artifices  i admit the truth of all you say sir answered blodget though i do not believe any attempt will be made on the house until the other side has sent in what the serjeant calls another flag  what reason have you for supposing this asked the captain in a little surprise  it seems unreasonable for men to risk their lives when an easier way to conquest may seem open to them that is all i meant captain willoughby  i believe i understand you blodget you think joel and his friends have succeeded so well in drawing off my men that they may be inclined to wait a little in order to ascertain if further advantages may not be obtained in the same way  blodget confessed that he had some such thoughts in his mind while at the same time he declared that he believed the disaffection would go no further  it is not easy for it to do so returned the captain smiling a little bitterly as he remembered how many who had eaten of his bread and had been cared for by him in sickness and adversity had deserted him in his need unless they persuade my wife and daughters to follow those who have led the way  respect kept blodget silent for a minute then uneasiness induced him to speak  i hope captain willoughby dont distrust any who now remain with him he said if so i know i must be the person  why you in particular young man with you surely have every reason to be satisfied  it cannot be serjeant joyce for he will stay until he get your orders to march the youth replied not altogether without humour in his manner and as for the scotchman he is old and men of his years are not apt to wait so long if they intend to be traitors the negroes all love you as if you were their father and there is no one but me left to betray you  i thank you for this short enumeration of my strength blodget since it gives me new assurance of my peoples fidelity you i will not distrust the others i cannot and there is a feeling of high confidencewhat do you seewhy do you lower your piece and stand at guard in this manner  that is a mans form sir on the right of the gate trying to climb the palisades i have had my eye on it for some time and i feel sure of my aim  hold an instant blodget let us be certain before we act  the young man lowered the butt of his piece waiting patiently and calmly for his superior to decide there was a human form visible sure enough and it was seen slowly and cautiously rising until it reached the summit of the stockade where it appeared to pause to reconnoitre whether it were a paleface or a redskin it was impossible to distinguish though the whole movement left little doubt that an assailant or a spy was attempting to pass the outer defences  we cannot spare that fellow said the captain with a little regret in his manner it is more than we can afford you must bring him down blodget the instant you have fired come to the other end of the stage where we will watch the result  this arranged the captain prudently passed away from the spot turning to note the proceedings of his companion the moment he was at the opposite angle of the gallery blodget was in no haste he waited until his aim was certain then the stillness of the valley was rudely broken by the sharp report of a rifle and a flash illumined its obscurity the figure fell outward like a bird shot from its perch lying in a ball at the foot of the stockade still no cry or groan gave evidence of nature surprised by keen and unexpected anguish at the next instant blodget was by captain willoughbys side his conduct was a pledge of fidelity that could not be mistaken and a warm squeeze of the hand assured the youth of his superiors approbation  it was necessary to be cautious however and to watch the result with ceaseless vigilance joyce and the men below had taken the alarm and the serjeant with his companions were ordered up on the stage immediately leaving the negro alone to watch the gate a message was also sent to the females to give them confidence and particularly to direct the blacks to arm and to repair to the loops  all this was done without confusion and with so little noise as to prevent those without from understanding what was in progress terror kept the negroes silent and discipline the others as every one had lain down in his or her clothes it was not a minute before every being in the hut was up and in motion it is unnecessary to speak of the mental prayers and conflicting emotions with which mrs willoughby and her daughters prepared themselves for the struggle and yet even the beautiful and delicate maud braced her nerves to meet the emergency of a frontier assault as for beulah gentle peaceful and forgiving as she was by nature the care of little evert aroused all the mother within her and something like a frown that betokened resolution was for a novelty seen on her usually placid face  a moment sufficed to let joyce and his companions into the state of affairs there now being four armed men on the stage one took each of the three exposed sides of the buildings to watch leaving the master of the house to move from post to post to listen to suggestions hear reports and communicate orders  the dark object that lay at the foot of the palisades was pointed out to the serjeant the instant he was on the stage and one of his offices was to observe it in order to ascertain if it moved or whether any attempts were made to carry off the body the american indians attach all the glory or shame of a battle to the acquisition or loss of scalps and one of their practices was to remove those who had fallen at every hazard in order to escape the customary mutilation some tribes even believed it disgrace to suffer a dead body to be struck by the enemy and many a warrior has lost his life in the effort to save the senseless corpse of a comrade from this fancied degradation  as soon as the little stir created in the hut by the mustering of the men was over a stillness as profound as that which had preceded the alarm reigned around the place no noise came from the direction of the mill no cry or call or signal of battle was heard everything lay in the quiet of midnight half an hour thus passed when the streak of light that appeared in the east announced the approach of day  the twenty minutes that succeeded were filled with intense anxiety the slow approach of light gradually brought out object after object in the little panorama awakening and removing alike conjectures and apprehensions at first the grey of the palisades became visible then the chapel in its sombre outlines the skirts of the woods the different cabins that lined them the cattle in the fields and the scattering trees as for joyce he kept his gaze fastened on the object at the foot of the stockade expecting every instant there would be an attempt to carry it off  at length the light became so strong as to allow the eye to take in the entire surface of the natural glacis without the defences bringing the assurance that no enemy was near as the ground was perfectly clear a few fruittrees and shrubs on the lawn excepted and by changing positions on the stage these last could now be examined on all sides nothing was easier than to make certain of this fact the fences too were light and open rendering it impossible for any ambush or advancing party to shelter itself behind them in a word daylight brought the comfortable assurance to those within the palisades that another night was passed without bringing an assault  we shall escape this morning i do believe joyce said the captain who had laid down his rifle and no longer felt it necessary to keep the upper portions of his body concealed behind the roofnothing can be seen that denotes an intention to attack and not an enemy is near  i will take one more thorough look your honour answered the serjeant mounting to the ridge of the building where he obtained the immaterial advantage of seeing more at the same time at the risk of exposing his whole person should any hostile rifle be in reach of a bulletthen we may be certain  joyce was a man who stood just six feet in his stockings and losing no part of this stature by his setting up a better object for a sharp shooter could not have been presented than he now offered the crack of a rifle soon saluted the ears of the garrison then followed the whizzing of the bullet as it came humming through the air towards the hut but the report was so distant as at once to announce that the piece was discharged from the margin of the forest a certain evidence of two important facts one that the enemy had fallen back to a cover the other that the house was narrowly watched  nothing tries the nerves of a young soldier more than the whizzing of a distant fire the slower a bullet or a shot approaches the more noise it makes and the sound continuing longer than is generally imagined the uninitiated are apt to imagine that the dangerous missile is travelling on an errand directly towards themselves space appears annihilated and raw hands are often seen to duck at a round shot that is possibly flying a hundred yards from them  on the present occasion the younger pliny fairly squatted below the root jamie thought it prudent to put some of his own masonry which was favourably placed in an adjacent chimney for such a purpose between him and the spot whence the report proceeded while even blodget looked up into the air as if he expected to see where the bullet was going captain willoughby had no thought of the missile he was looking for the smoke in the skirts of the woods to note the spot while joyce with folded arms stood at rest on the ridge actually examining the valley in another direction certain that a fire so distant could not be very dangerous  jamies calculation proved a good one the bullet struck against the chimney indented a brick and fell upon the shingles of the roof joyce descended at the next instant and he coolly picked up and kept tossing the flattened bit of lead in his hand for the next minute or two with the air of a man who seemed unconscious of having it at all  the enemy is besieging us your honour said joyce but he will not attack at present if i might presume to advise we shall do well to leave a single sentinel on this stage since no one can approach the palisades without being seen if the man keeps in motion  i was thinking of this myself serjeant we will first post blodget here we can trust him and as the day advances aless intelligent sentinel will answer at the same time he must be instructed to keep an eye in the rear of the hut danger often coming from the quarter least expected  all this was done and the remainder of the men descended to the court captain willoughby ordered the gate unbarred when he passed outside taking the direction towards the lifeless body which still lay where it had fallen at the foot of the stockades he was accompanied by joyce and jamie allen the latter carrying a spade it being the intention to inter the savage as the shortest means of getting rid of a disagreeable object our two old soldiers had none of the sensitiveness on the subject of exposure that is so apt to disturb the tyro in the art of war with sentinels properly posted they had no apprehensions of dangers that did not exist and they moved with confidence and steadily wherever duty called not only was the inner gate opened and passed but the outer also the simple precaution of stationing a man at the first being the only safeguard taken  when outside of the palisades the captain and his companions proceeded at once towards the body it was now sunrise and a rich light was illuminating the hilltops though the direct rays of the luminary had not yet descended to the valley there lay the indian precisely as he had fallen no warrior having interposed to save him from the scalping knife his head had reached the earth first and the legs and body were tumbled on it in a manner to render the form a confused pile of legs and blanket rather than a bold savage stretched in the repose of death  poor fellow exclaimed the captain as the three approached the spot it is to be hoped blodgets bullet did its commission faithfully else the fall must have hurt him sadly  by jove tis nothing but a stuffed soldier cried joyce rolling the ingeniously contrived bundle over with his foot and here the lads ball has passed directly through its head this is injin deviltry sir it has been tried in order to see whether our sentinels were or were not asleep  to me joyce it seems more like a white mans clumsiness the fellow has been made to resemble an indian but people of our own colour have had a hand in the affair  well sir let that be as it may it is lucky our youngster had so quick an eye and so nimble a finger see your honour here is the pole by which the effigy was raised to the top of the palisades and here is the trail on the grass yet by which his supporter has crept off the fellow seems to have scrambled along in a hurry his trail is as plain as that of a whole company  the captain examined the marks left on the grass and was of opinion that more than one man had been employed to set up the decoy figure a circumstance that seemed probable in itself when the weight of the image and the danger of exposure were rememberedlet that be as it might he was rejoiced on reflection that no one was hurt and he still retained the hope of being able to come to such an understanding with his invaders as to supersede the necessity of actual violence  at all events your honour i will carry the quaker in said joyce tossing the stuffed figure on a shoulder he do to man the quaker gun at least and may be of use in frightening some one of the other side more than he has yet frightened us  captain willoughby did not object though he reminded joyce that the desertions had probably put the enemy in possession of a minute statement of their defences and force including the history of the wooden gun if joel and his fellowdelinquents had joined the party at the mill the name age character and spirit of every man remaining in the garrison were probably known to its leaders and neither quakers nor paddies would count for much in opposing an assault  the captain came within the gate of the palisades last closing barring and locking it with his own hands when all immediate apprehensions from the enemy ceased he knew certainly that it would probably exceed his present means of resistance to withstand a vigorous assault but on the other hand he felt assured that indians would never approach a stockade in open day and expose themselves to the hazards of losing some fifteen or twenty of their numbers before they could carry the place this was opposed to all their notions of war neither honour nor advantage tempting them to adopt it as for the first agreeably to savage notions glory was to be measured by the number of scalps taken and lost and counting all the women left in the hut there would not be heads enough to supply a sufficient number to prove an offset to those which would probably be lost in the assault  all this did the captain discuss in few words with the serjeant when he proceeded to join his anxious and expecting wife and daughters  god has looked down upon us in mercy and protected us this night said the grateful mrs willoughby with streaming eyes as she received and returned her husbands warm embrace we cannot be too thankful when we look at these dear girls and our precious little evert if robert were only with us now i should be entirely happy  such is human nature my little maudanswered the captain drawing his darling towards himself and kissing her polished forehead the very thoughts of being in our actual strait would have made your mother as miserable as her worst enemy could wishif indeed there be such a monster on earth as her enemyand now she protests she is delighted because our throats were not all cut last night we are safe enough for the day i think and not another night shall one of you pass in the hut if i can have my way if there be such a thing as desertion there is such a thing as evacuation also  hughwhat can you do you mean remember we are surrounded by a wilderness  i know our position reasonably well wife of mine and intend to turn that knowledge to some account god willing and aiding i mean to place old hugh willoughby by the side of xenophon and washington and let the world see what a man is capable of on a retreat when he has such a wife two such daughters and a grandson like that on his hands as for bob i would not have him here on any account the young dog would run away with half the glory  the ladies were too delighted to find their father and husband in such spirits to be critical and all soon after sat down to an early breakfast to eat with what appetite they could      chapter xxii    yet i well remember   the favours of these men were they not mine   did they not sometimes cry all hail to me   so judas did to christ but he in twelve   found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none    richard ii  that which captain willoughby had said in seeming pleasantry he seriously meditated the idea of passing another night in the hut supported by only six men with more than ten times that number besieging him and with all the secrets of his defences known through the disaffection of his retainers was to the last degree painful to him had his own life alone been at risk military pride might have tempted him to remain but his charge was far too precious to be exposed on account of considerations so vain  no sooner therefore was the breakfast over than captain summoned joyce to a consultation on the contemplated movement the interview took place in the library whither the serjeant repaired on receiving his superiors orders as to the party without no apprehension was felt so long as the sentinels were even moderately vigilant and the day lasted  i suppose serjeant commenced captain willoughby a soldier of your experience is not to be taught what is the next resort of a commanding officer when he finds himself unable to make good his ground against his enemy in front  it is to retreat your honour the road that cannot be passed must be turned  you have judged rightly it is now my intention to evacuate the hut and to try our luck on a march to the rear a retreat skilfully executed is a creditable thing and any step appears preferable to exposing the dear beings in the other room to the dangers of a night assault  joyce appeared struck with the suggestion though if one might have judged from the expression of his countenance far from favourably he reflected a moment ere he answered  did your honour send for me he then inquired to issue orders for this retreat or was it your pleasure to hear anything i might have to say about it  the lasti shall give no orders until i know your opinion of the measure  it is as much the duty of an inferior to speak his mind freely when he is called for an opinion captain willoughby as it is to obey in silence when he gets nothing but orders according to my views of the matter we shall do better to stand our ground and try to make good the house against these vagabonds than to trust to the woods  of course you have your reasons for this opinion joyce  certainly your honour in the first place i suppose it to be against the rules of the art of war to evacuate a place that is well provisioned without standing an assault this we have not yet done it is true sir that our ranks are thinned by desertions but i never heard of a garrisoned town or a garrisoned house capitulating on account of a few deserters and i take it evacuation is only the next step before capitulation  but our desertions joyce have not been few but many three times as many have left us if we include our other losses as remain it matters not whence the loss proceeds so long as it is a loss  a retreat with women and baggage is always a ticklish operation your honour especially if an enemy is pressing your rear then we have a wilderness before us and the ladies could hardly hold out for so long a march as that from this place to the mohawk short of which river they will hardly be as safe as they are at present  i have had no such march in view joyce you know there is a comfortable hut only a mile from this very spot on the mountain side where we commenced a clearing for a sheeppasture only three summers since the field is in rich grass and could we once reach the cabin and manage to drive a cow or two up there we might remain a month in security as for provisions and clothes we could carry enough on our backs to serve us all several weeks especially if assisted by the cows  im glad your honour has thought of this idea said the serjeant his face brightening as he listened it will be a beautiful operation to fall back on that position when we can hold out no longer in this the want of some such arrangement has been my only objection to this post captain willoughby for we have always seemed to me out here in the wilderness like a regiment drawn up with a ravine or a swamp in its rear  i am glad to find you relishing the movement for any cause serjeant it is my intention at present to make the necessary arrangements to evacuate the hut while it is light and as soon as it is dark to retreat by the gates the palisades and the rivulethow now jamie you look as if there were news to communicate  jamie allen in truth had entered at that instant in so much haste as to have overlooked the customary ceremony of sending in his name or even of knocking  news repeated the mason with a sort of wondering smile and its just that ive come to bring wad ye think it baith gentlemen that our people are in their am cabins agin boiling their pots and frying their pork a the same as if the valley was in a state of tranquillity and we so many lairds waiting for them to come and do our pleasure  i do not understand you jamiewhom do you mean by our people  sure just the desairters joel and the miller and michael and the rest  and the cabinsand the potsand the porkit is gibberish to me  i hae what ye english ca an aiccent i know but in my judgment captain willoughby the words may be comprehended without a dictionary its just that joel strides and daniel the miller and the rest o them that fleed the past night have gane into their ain abodes and have lighted their fires and put over their pots and kettles and set up their domestic habitudes a the same as if this beaver dam was ain o the pairks o lonnon  the devil they have should this be the case serjeant our sortie may be made at an earlier hour than that mentioned i never will submit to such an insult  captain willoughby was too much aroused to waste many words and seizing his hat he proceeded forthwith to take a look for himself the stage or gallery on the roofs offering the best view in a minute he and his two companions were on it  there yell be seein a smoke in joels habitation with your own een and yon is anither in the dwelling of his cousin seth said jamie pointing in the direction he named  smoke there is of a certainty but the indians may have lighted fires in the kitchen to do their own cooking this looks like investing us serjeant rather more closely than the fellows have done before  i rather think not your honourjamie is right or my eyes do not know a man from a woman that is certainly a female in the garden of joel and ill engage its phoebe pulling onions for his craving stomach the scoundrel  captain willoughby never moved without his little glass and it was soon levelled at the object mentioned  by jupiter you are right joycehe cried it is phoebe though the hussy is coolly weeding not culling the onions ayand now i see joel himself the rascal is examining some hoes with as much philosophy as if he were master of them and all near them this is a most singular situation to be in  this last remark was altogether just the situation of those in the hut was now singular indeed further examination showed that every cabin had its tenant no one of the party that remained within the palisades being a householder by using the glass and pointing it in succession at the different dwellings the captain in due time detected the presence of nearly every one of the deserters not a man of them all in fact was missing mike alone excepted there they were with their wives and children in quiet possession of their different habitations nor was this all the business of the valley seemed as much on their minds as had been their practice for years cows were milked the swine were fed poultry was called and cared for and each household was also making the customary preparations for the morning meal  so absorbed was the captain with this extraordinary scene that he remained an hour on the staging watching the course of events the breakfasts were soon over having been later than common and a little hurried then commenced the more important occupations of the day a field was already half ploughed in preparation for a crop of winter grain thither joel himself proceeded with the necessary cattle accompanied by the labourers who usually aided him in that particular branch of husbandry three ploughs were soon at work with as much regularity and order as if nothing had occurred to disturb the tranquillity of the valley the axes of the woodchoppers were next heard coming out of the forest cutting fuel for the approaching winter and a halffinished ditch had its workmen also who were soon busy casting up the soil and fashioning their trench in a word all the suspended toil was renewed with perfect system and order  this beats the devil himself joyce said the captain after a half hour of total silence here are all these fellows at work as coolly as if i had just given them their tasks and twice as diligently their unusual industry is a bad symptom of itself  your honour will remark one circumstance not a rascal of them all comes within the fair range of a musket for as to throwing away ammunition at such distances it would be clearly unmilitary and might be altogether useless  i have half a mind to scatter them with a volleysaid the captain doubtingly bullets would take effect among those ploughmen could they only be made to hit  and amang the cattle too observed the scotsman who had an eye on the more economical part of the movement as well as on that which was military a ball would slay a horse as well as a man in such a skairmish  this is true enough jamie and it is not exactly the sort of warfare i could wish to be firing at men who were so lately my friends i do not see joyce that the rascals have any arms with them  not a musket sir i noticed that when joel first detailed his detachments can it be possible that the savages have retired  not they else would mr strides and his friends have gone with them no serjeant there is a deep plan to lead us into some sort of ambush in this affair and we will be on the lookout for them  joyce stood contemplating the scene for some time in profound silence when he approached the captain formally and made the usual military salute a ceremony he had punctiliously observed on all proper occasions since the garrison might be said to be placed under martial law  if its your honours pleasure he said i will detail a detachment and go out and bring in two or three of these deserters by which means we shall get into their secrets  a detachment joyce answered the captain eyeing his subordinate a little curiouslywhat troops do you propose to telloff for the service  why your honour theres corporal allen and old pliny off duty i think the thing might be done with them if your honour would have the condescension to order corporal blodget with the two other blacks to form as a supporting party under the cover of one of the fences  a disposition of my force that would leave captain willoughby for a garrison i thank you serjeant for your offer and gallantry but prudence will not permit it we may set down strides and his companions as so many knaves and  that may ye cried mikes wellknown voice from the scuttle that opened into the garrets directly in front of which the two old soldiers were conversingthat may ye and no harrm done the trut or justice or for that matther meself och if i had me will of the blackguards every rogue of em should be bound hand and fut and laid under that pratthy watherfall yon at the mill until his sins was washed out of him would there be confessions thenthat would there and sich letting out of sacrets as would satisfy the conscience of a hog  by the time mike had got through this sentiment he was on the staging where he stood hitching up his nether garment with a meaning grin on his face that gave a peculiar expression of heavy cunning to the massive jaw and capacious mouth blended with an honesty and good nature that the wellmeaning fellow was seldom without when he addressed any of the captains family joyce glanced at the captain expecting orders to seize the returned runaway but his superior read at once good faith in the expression of his old retainers countenance  you have occasioned us a good deal of surprise ohearn on more accounts than one observed the captain who thought it prudent to assume more sternness of manner than his feelings might have actually warranted you have not only gone off yourself but you have suffered your prisoner to escape with you then your manner of getting into the house requires an explanation i shall hear what you have to say before i make up my mind as to your conduct  is it spake i willthat will i and as long as it plase yer honour to listen och isnt that saucy nick a quare one divil burn me if i thinks the likes of him is to be found in all ameriky full as it is of injins and saucy fellies well now i suppose sarjeant yeve set me down as sin riding off with misther joel and his likes if ye was to open yer heart and spake yer thrue mind  you have been marked for a deserter ohearn and one too that deserted from post  post had i been that i shouldnt have stirred and yed be wanting in the news i bring ye from the majjor and mr woods and the savages and the rest of the varmints  my sonis this possible michael have you seen him or can you tell us anything of his state  mike now assumed a manner of mysterious importance laying a finger on his nose and pointing towards the sentinel and jamie  its the sarjeant that i considers as one of the family said the county leitrimman when his pantomime was through but it isnt dacent to be bawling out sacrets through a whole nighbourhood and then as for ould nickor saucy nick or whatever ye calls himoch isnt he a pratthy injin yell marrch trough ameriky and never see his aiquel  this will never do ohearn whatever you have to say must be said clearly and in the simplest manner follow to the library where i will hear your report joyce you will accompany us  let him come if he wishes to hear wonderful achaivements answered mike making way for the captain to descend the steps then following himself talking as he went hell niver brag of his campaigns agin to the likes of me seeing that ive outdone him tenay forty times and boot och that nicks a divil and no harrm said  in the first place ohearn resumed the captain as soon as the three were alone in the libraryyou must explain your own desertion  medesart sure it isnt run away from yer honour and the missus and miss beuly and pratthy miss maud and the child thats yer honours maning  this was said with so much nature and truth that the captain had not the heart to repeat the question though joyces more drilled feelings were less moved the first even felt a tear springing to his eye and he no longer distrusted the irishmans fidelity as unaccountable as his conduct did and must seem to his cooler judgment but mikes sensitiveness had taken the alarm and it was only to be appeased by explanations  yer honours not spaking when i questions ye on that same he resumed doubtingly  why mike to be sincere it did look a little suspicious when you not only went off yourself but you let the indian go off with you  did itsaid mike musngno i dont allow that seein that the intent and object was good and then i never took the injin wid me but twas i meself that went wid him  i rather think your honour said joyce smiling well put ohearns name in its old place on the roster and make no mark against him at payday  i think it will turn out so joyce we must have patience too and let mike tell his story in his own way  is it tell a story will i ahnicks the crature for that same see he has given me foor bits of sticks every one of which is to tell a story in its own way this is the first and it manes let the captain into the sacret of your retrait and how you got out of the windie and how you comes near to breaking yer neck by a fall becaase of the futs slipping and how ye wint down the roof by a rope the divil a bit fastening it to yer neck but houlding it in yer hand with sich a grip as if twere the fait of the church itself and how nick led ye to the hole out of which ye hot wint as if ye had been two cats going trough a door  mike stopped to grin and look wise as he recounted the manner of the escape the outlines of which however were sufficiently well known to his auditors before he began  throw away that stick now and let us know where this hole is and what you mean by it  noanswered mike looking at the stick in a doubting mannerill not trow it away wid yer honours lave till ive told ye how we got into the brook forenent the forest and waded up to the woods where we was all the same as if we had been two bits of clover tops hid in a haymow that nick is a crature at consailment  go on said the captain patiently knowing that there was no use in hurrying one of mikes peculiar mode of communicating his thoughts what came next  that will i and the rason comes next as is seen by this oder stick and so nick and meself was in the chaplains room all alone and nither of us had any mind to dhrink nick becaase he was a prisoner and felt crass and full of dignity like and meself becaase i was a sentinel and sarjeant joyce there had tould me the lord knows how often that if i did my duty well i might come to be a corporal which was next in rank to himself barring too that i was a sentinel and a drunken sentinel is a disgrace to a man sowl and body and musket  and so neither of you drankput in the captain by way of a reminder  for that same rason and one betther still as we had nothin to dhrink well says nickmike says heyou like capin and missus and miss beuly and miss maud and the babby divil burn ye nick says i why do ye ask so foolish a question is it likes ye would know wellthen just ask yerself if you likes yer own kith and kin and yeve got yer answer  and nick made his proposal on getting this answer interrupted the captain which was  here it is on the stick well says nick says herun away wid nick and see majjor bring back news nick capin friend but capin dont know itwont believefait i cant tell yer honour all nick said in his own manner and so wid yer pave ill just tell it in my own way  any way mike so that you do but tell it  nicks a crature his idee was for us two to get out of the windie and up on the platform and to take the bedcord and other things and slide down upon the groundand we did it as sure as yer honour and the sarjeant is there we did that same and no bones broke well says i nick yere here sure enough but how do you mane to get out of here is it climb the palisades ye will and be shot by a sentinelif there was one which there wasnt yer honour seeing that all had run awayor do ye mane to stay here says i and be taken a prisoner of war agin in which case yell be two prisoners seem that yeve been taken wonst already will ye nick says i so nick never spoke but he held up his finger and made a sign for me to follow as follow i did and we just crept through the palisade and a mhighty phratty walk we had of it alang the meadies and trough the lanes the rest of the way  you crept through the palisades mike there is no outlet of sufficient size  i admits the hole is a tight squaze but twill answer and then its just as good for an inlet as it is for an outlet seein that i came trough it this very marnin och nicks a crature and how dye think that hole comes there barring all oversights in setting up the sticks  it has not been made intentionally i should hope ohearn  twas made by joel and that by just sawing off a post and forcin out a pin or two so that the palisade works like a door och its nately contrived and it manes mischief  this must be looked to at once cried the captain lead the way mike and show us the spot  as the irishman was nothing loth all three were soon in the court whence mike led the way through the gate round to the point where the stockade came near the cliffs on the eastern side of the buildings this was the spot where the path that led down to the spring swept along the defences and was on the very route by which the captain contemplated retreating as well as on that by which maud had entered the hut the night of the invasion at a convenient place a palisade had been sawed off so low in the ground that the sods which had been cut and were moveable concealed the injury while the heads of the pins that ought to have bound the timber to the crosspiece were in their holes leaving everything apparently secure on removing the sods and pushing the timber aside the captain ascertained that a man might easily pass without the stockade as this corner was the most retired within the works there was no longer any doubt that the hole had been used by all the deserters including the women and children in what manner it became known to nick however still remained matter of conjecture  orders were about to be given to secure this passage when it occurred to the captain it might possibly be of use in effecting his own retreat with this object in view then he hastened away from the place lest any wandering eye without might detect his presence near it and conjecture the cause on returning to the library the examination of mike was resumed  as the reader must be greatly puzzled with the county leitrimmans manner of expressing himself we shall relate the substance of what he now uttered for the sake of brevity it would seem that nick had succeeded in persuading mike first that he the tuscarora was a fast friend of the captain and his family confined by the former in consequence of a misconception of the real state of the indians feelings much to the detriment of all their interests and that no better service could be rendered the willoughbys than to let nick depart and for the irishman to go with him mike however had not the slightest idea of desertion the motive which prevailed on him to quit the hut being a desire to see the major and if possible to help him escape as soon as this expectation was placed before his eyes mike became a convert to the indians wishes like all exceedingly zealous men the irishman had an itching propensity to be doing and he was filled with a sort of boyish delight at the prospect of effecting a great service to those whom he so well loved without their knowing it such was the history of michaels seeming desertion that of what occurred after he quitted the works remains to be related  the tuscarora led his companion out of the hut within half an hour after they had been left alone together in the room of mr woods as this was subsequently to joels flight nick in anticipation of this event chose to lie in ambush a short time in order to ascertain whether the defection was likely to go any further satisfied on this head he quietly retired towards the mill after making a sufficient d√™tour to avoid being seen from the house nick gave himself no trouble about getting into the woods or of practising any of the expedients of a time of real danger as had been done by all of the deserters but he walked leisurely across the meadows until he struck the highway along which he proceeded forthwith to the rocks all this was done in a way that showed he felt himself at home and that he had no apprehensions of falling into an ambush it might have arisen from his familiarity with the ground or it might have proceeded from the consciousness that he was approaching friends instead of enemies  at the rocks however nick did not deem it wise to lead mike any farther without some preliminary caution the white man was concealed in one of the clefts therefore while the indian pursued his way alone the latter was absent an hour at the end of that time he returned and after giving mike a great many cautions about silence and prudence he led him to the cabin of the miller in the buttery of which robert willoughby was confined to this buttery there was a window but as it was so small as to prevent escape no sentinel had been placed on the outside of the building for his own comfort too and in order to possess his narrow lodgings to himself the major had given a species of parole by which he was bound to remain in duresse until the rising of the next sun owing to these two causes nick had been enabled to approach the window and to hold communications with the prisoner this achieved he returned to the rocks and led mike to the same spot  major willoughby had not been able to write much in consequence of the darkness that which he communicated accordingly had to pass through the fiery ordeal of the irishmans brains as a matter of course it did not come with particular lucidity though mike did succeed in making his auditors comprehend this much  the major was substantially well treated though intimations had been given that he would be considered as a spy escape seemed next to impossible still he should not easily abandon the hope from all he had seen the party was one of that irresponsible character that would render capitulation exceedingly hazardous and he advised his father to hold out to the last in a military point of view he considered his captors as contemptible being without a head though many of the menthe savages in particularappeared to be ferocious and reckless the whole party was guarded in discourse and little was said in english though he was convinced that many more whites were present than he had at first believed mr woods he had not seen nor did he know anything of his arrest or detention  this much mike succeeded in making the captain comprehend though a great deal was lost through the singular confusion that prevailed in the mind of the messenger mike however had still another communication which we reserve for the ears of the person to whom it was especially sent  this news produced a pause in captain willoughbys determination some of the fire of youth awoke within him and he debated with himself on the possibility of making a sortie and of liberating his son as a step preliminary to victory or at least to a successful retreat acquainted with every foot of the ground which had singular facilities for a step so bold the project found favour in his eyes each minute and soon became fixed      chapter xxiii    yet i well remember   the favours of these men were they not mine   did they not sometimes cry all hail to me   so judas did to christ but he in twelve   found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none    willis  while the captain and joyce were digesting their plans mike proceeded on an errand of peculiar delicacy with which he had been entrusted by robert willoughby the report that he had returned flew through the dwellings and many were the hearty greetings and shakings of the hand that the honest fellow had to undergo from the plinys and smashes ere he was at liberty to set about the execution of this trust the wenches in particular having ascertained that mike had not broken his fast insisted on his having a comfortable meal in a sort of servants hall before they would consent to his quitting their sight as the county leitrimman was singularly ready with a knife and fork he made no very determined opposition and in a few minutes he was hard at work discussing a cold ham with the other collaterals of a substantial american breakfast  the blacks the smashes inclusive had been seriously alarmed at the appearance of the invading party between them and the whole family of redmen there existed a sort of innate dislike an antipathy that originated in colour and wool and habits and was in no degree lessened by apprehensions on the score of scalps  how you look ole plin widout wool big smash had reproachfully remarked not five minutes before mike made his appearance in the kitchen in answer to some apologetic observation of her husband as to the intentions of the savages being less hostile than he had at first imagined why you say dey no murder and steal and set fire when you know deys injin natur be natur and dat i hear dominie woods say tree time one sunday what e dominie say often he mean and dere no use in saying dey dont come to do harm  as great smash was an oracle in her own set there was no gainsaying her dogmas and pliny the elder was obliged to succumb but the presence of mike one who was understood to have been out near if not actually in the enemys camp and a great favourite in the bargain was a circumstance likely to revive the discourse in fact all the negroes crowded into the hall as soon as the irishman was seated at table one or two eager to talk the rest as eager to listen  how near you been to sabbage michael demanded big smash her two large coalblack eyes seeming to open in a degree proportioned to her interest in the answer  i wint as nigh as there was occasion smash and that was nigher than the likes of yer husband there would be thinking of travelling maybe twas as far as from my plate here to yon door maybe not quite so far they re a dhirty set and i wish to go no nearer  what dey look like in e dark inquired little smashawful as by daylight  its not meself that stopped to admire em nick and i had our business forenent us and when a man is hurried it isnt rasonable to suppose he can kape turning his head about to see sights  what dey do wid misser woodswhat sabbage want wid dominie  sure enough little one and the question is of yer own asking a praist even though he should be only a heretic can have no great call for his sarvices in sich a congregation and i dont think the fellows are blackguards enough to scalp a parson  then followed a flood of incoherent questions that were put by all the blacks in a body accompanied by divers looks ominous of the most serious disasters blended with bursts of laughter that broke out of their risible natures in a way to render the medley of sensations as ludicrous as it was strange mike soon found answering a task too difficult to be attempted and he philosophically came to a determination to confine his efforts to masticating  notwithstanding the terror that actually prevailed among the blacks it was not altogether unmixed with a resolution to die with arms in their hands in preference to yielding to savage clemency hatred in a measure supplied the place of courage though both sexes had insensibly imbibed some of that resolution which is the result of habit and of which a border life is certain to instil more or less into its subjects in a form suited to border emergencies nor was this feeling confined to the men the two smashes in particular being women capable of achieving acts that would be thought heroic under circumstances likely to arouse their feelings  now smashes said mike when by his own calculation he had about three minutes to the termination of his breakfast before him yell do what i tells ye and no questions asked yell find the laddies missus and miss beuly and miss maud and yell give my humble respects to em alldivil the bit now will ye be overlooking either of the tree but yell do yer errand genteely and like a laddy yerselfand yell give my jewty and respects to em all i tells ye and say that michael ohearn asks the honour of being allowed to wish em good morning  little smash screamed at this message yet she went forthwith and delivered it making reasonably free with michaels manner and gallantry in so doing  ohearn has something to tell us from robertsaid mrs willoughby who had been made acquainted with the irishmans exploits and return he must be suffered to come in as soon as he desires  with this reply little smash terminated her mission  and now laddies and gentlemen said mike with gravity as he rose to quit the servants hall my blessing and good wishes be wid ye a hearty male have i had at yer hands and yer cookery and good thanks it desarves as for the injins jist set yer hearts at rest as not one of ye will be scalpd the day seeing that the savages are all to be forenent the mill this morning houlding a great council as i knows from nick himself a comfortable time then ye may all enjoy wid yer heads on yer shoulters and yer wool on yer heads  mikes grin as he retreated showed that he meant to be facetious having all the pleasantry that attends a full stomach uppermost in his animal nature at that precise moment a shout rewarded this sally and the parties separated with mutual good humour and good feeling in this state of mind the county leitrimman was ushered into the presence of the ladies a few words of preliminary explanations were sufficient to put mike in the proper train when he came at once to his subject  the majjor is no way downhearted he said and he ordered me to give his jewty and riverence and obligations to his honoured mother and his sisters tell em mike says he says the majjor that i feels for em all the same as if i was their own fader and tell em says he to keep up their spirits and all will come right in the ind this is a throublesome worrld but they that does their jewties to god and man and the church will not fail in the long run to worrk their way trough purgatory even into paradise  surely my sonmy dear robertnever sent us such a message as this michael  every syllable of it and a quantity moor that has slipped my memory answered the irishman who was inventing but who fancied he was committing a very pious fraudtwould have done the missuses heart good to have listened to the majjor who spoke more in the charackter of a praist like than in that of a souldier  all three of the ladies looked a little abashed though there was a gleam of humour about the mouth of maud that showed she was not very far from appreciating the irishmans report at its just value as for mrs willoughby and beulah less acquainted with mikes habits they did not so readily penetrate his manner of substituting his own desultory thoughts for the ideas of others  as i am better acquainted with mikes language dear mother whispered maudperhaps it will be well if i take him into the library and question him a little between ourselves about what actually passed depend on it i shall get the truth  do my child for it really pains me to hear robert so much misrepresentedand as evert must now begin to have ideas i really do not like that his uncle should be so placed before the dear little fellows mind  maud did not even smile at this proof of a grandmothers weakness though she felt and saw all its absurdity heart was ever so much uppermost with the excellent matron that it was not easy for those she loved to regard anything but her virtues and least of all did her daughter presume to indulge in even a thought that was ludicrous at her expense profiting by the assent therefore maud quietly made a motion for mike to follow and proceeded at once to the room she had named  not a word was exchanged between the parties until both were in the library when maud carefully closed the door her face pale as marble and stood looking inquiringly at her companion the reader will understand that mr woods and joyce excepted not a soul at the hut out of the limits of the willoughby connection knew anything of our heroines actual relation to the captain and his family it is true some of the oldest of the blacks had once some vague notions on the subject but their recollections had become obscured by time and habit was truly second nature with all of the lighthearted race  that was mighty injanious of you miss maud mike commenced giving one of his expressive grins again and fairly winking it shows how frinds wants no spache but their own minds barrin mistakes and crassaccidents im sartain that michael ohearn can make himself understood any day by miss maud willoughby an niver a word said  your success then mike will be greater at dumbshow than it always is with your tongue answered the young lady the blood slowly returning to her cheek the accidental use of the name of willoughby removing the apprehension of anything immediately embarrassing what have you to tell me that you suppose i have anticipated  sure the like o yees neednt be tould miss maud that the majjor bad me spake to ye by yerself and say a word that was not to be overheerd by any one else  this is singularextraordinary evenbut let me know more though the messenger be altogether so much out of the common way  i tought ye d say that when ye come to know me is it meself that s a messenger and where is there another that can carry news widout spilling any by the way nicks a crature i allows but the majjor knowd a million times bhetter than to trust an injin wid sich a jewty as for joel and that set of vagabonds well grind em all in the mill before weve done wid em let em look for no favours if they wishes no disappintment  maud sickened at the thought of having any of those sacred feelings connected with robert willoughby that she had so long cherished in her inmost heart rudely probed by so unskilful a hand though her last conversation with the young soldier had told so much even while it left so much unsaid that she could almost kneel and implore mike to be explicit the reserve of a woman notwithstanding taught her how to preserve her sexs decorum and to maintain appearances  if major willoughby desired you to communicate anything to me in particular she said with seeming composure i am ready to hear it  divil the word did he desire miss maud for everything was in whispers between us but jist what im about to repait and heres my stick that nick tould me to kape as a reminderer it s far bhetter for me than a book as i cant read a syllable and now mike says the majjor says he conthrive to see phratty miss maud by herself  pretty miss maud interrupted the young lady involuntarily  och its meself that says that and sure there s plenty of rason for it so well agree its all right and properphratty miss maud by herself letting no mortal else know what you are about that was the majjors  it is very extraordinaryperhaps it will be better michael if you tell me nothing but what is strictly the majors a message should be delivered as nearly like the words that were actually sent as possible  worrdsand it isnt worrds at all that i have to give ye  if not a message in words in what else can it benot in sticks surely  in thatcried mike exultinglyand ill warrant when the trut comes out that very little bit of silver will be found as good as forty injin scalps  although mike put a small silver snuffbox that maud at once recognised as robert willoughbys property into the young ladys hand nothing was more apparent than the circumstance that he was profoundly ignorant of the true meaning of what he was doing the box was very beautiful and his mother and beulah had often laughed at the major for using an article that was then deemed de rigueur for a man of extreme ton when all his friends knew he never touched snuff so far from using the stimulant indeed he never would show how the box was opened a secret spring existing and he even manifested or betrayed shyness on the subject of suffering either of his sisters to search for the means of doing so  the moment maud saw the box her heart beat tumultuously she had a presentiment that her fate was about to be decided still she had sufficient selfcommand to make an effort to learn all her companion had to communicate  major willoughby gave you this box she said her voice trembling in spite of herself did he send any message with it recollect yourself the words may be very important  is it the worrds well its little of them that passed between us barrin that the injins was so near by that it was whisper we did and not a bit else  still there must have been some message  ye are as wise as a sarpent miss maud as father oloony used to tell us all of a sunday was it worrdsgive that to miss maud says the majjor says he and tell her she is now misthress of my sacret  did he say this michaelfor heavens sake be certain of what you tell me  irish mikemasser want you in monstrous hurry cried the youngest of the three black men thrusting his glistening lace into the door announcing the object of the intrusion and disappearing almost in the same instant  do not leave me ohearn said maud nearly gasping for breath do not leave me without an assurance there is no mistake  divil burrn me if i d brought the box or the message or anything like it phretty miss maud had i tought it would have done this har rm  michael ohearn called the serjeant from the court in his most authoritative military manner and that on a key that would not brook denial  mike did not dare delay in half a minute maud found herself standing alone in the centre of the library holding the wellknown snuffbox of robert willoughby in her little hand the renowned caskets of portia had scarcely excited more curiosity in their way than this little silver box of the majors had created in the mind of maud in addition to his playful evasions about letting her and beulah pry into its mysteries he had once said to herself in a grave and feeling manner when you get at the contents of this box dear girl you will learn the great secret of my life these words had made a deep impression at the timeit was in his visit of the past yearbut they had been temporarily forgotten in the variety of events and stronger sensations that had succeeded mikes message accompanied by the box itself however recalled them and maud fancied that the major considering himself to be in some dangerous emergency had sent her the bauble in order that she might learn what that secret was possibly he meant her to communicate it to others persons in our heroines situation feel more than they reason and it is possible maud might have come to some other conclusion had she been at leisure or in a state of mind to examine all the circumstances in a more logical manner  now she was in possession of this longcoveted boxcoveted at least so far as a look into its contents were concernedmaud not only found herself ignorant of the secret by which it was opened but she had scruples about using the means even had she been in possession of them at first she thought of carrying the thing to beulah and of asking if she knew any way of getting at the spring then she shrunk from the exposure that might possibly attend such a step the more she reflected the more she felt convinced that robert willoughby would not have sent her that particular box unless it were connected with herself in some way more than common and ever since the conversation in the paintingroom she had seen glimmerings of the truth in relation to his feelings these glimmerings too had aided her in better understanding her own heart and all her sentiments revolted at the thought of having a witness to any explanation that might relate to the subject in every event she determined after a few minutes of thought not to speak of the message or the present to a living soul  in this condition of mind filled with anxiety pleasing doubts apprehensions shame and hope all relieved however by the secret consciousness of perfect innocence and motives that angels might avow maud stood in the very spot where mike had left her turning the box in her hands when accidentally she touched the spring and the lid flew open to glance at the contents was an act so natural and involuntary as to anticipate reflection  nothing was visible but a piece of white paper neatly folded and compressed into the box in a way to fill its interior bob has written thought maudyet how could he do this he was in the dark and had not pen or paper another look rendered this conjecture still more improbable as it showed the gilt edge of paper of the quality used for notes an article equally unlikely to be found in the mill and in his own pocket yet it must be a note passed through her mind and of course it was written before he left the hutquite likely before he arrivedpossibly the year before when he spoke of the box as containing the evidence of the great secret of his life  maud now wished for mike incoherent unintelligible and blundering as he was that she might question him still further as to the precise words of the message possibly bob did not intend me to open thebox at all she thought and meant merely that i should keep it until he could return to claim it it contains a great secret and because he wishes to keep this secret from the indians it does not follow that he intends to reveal it to me i will shut the box again and guard his secret as i would one of my own  this was no sooner thought than it was done a pressure of the lid closed it and maud heard the snap of the spring with a start scarcely was the act performed ere she repented it bob would not have sent the box without some particular object she went on to imagine and had he intended it not to be opened he would have told as much to ohearn how easy would it have been for him to say and for mike to repeat tell her to keep the box till i ask for itit contains a secret and i wish my captors not to learn it no he has sent the box with the design that i should examine its contents his very life may depend on my doing so yes and on my doing so this minute  this last notion no sooner glanced athwart our heroines mind than she began diligently to search for the hidden spring perhaps curiosity had its influence on the eagerness to arrive at the secret which she now manifested possibly a tenderer and still more natural feeling lay concealed behind it all at any rate her pretty little fingers never were employed more nimbly and not a part of the exterior of the box escaped its pressure still the secret spring eluded her search the box had two or three bands of richly chased work on each side of the place of opening and amid these ornaments maud felt certain that the little projection she sought must lie concealed to examine these then she commenced in a regular and connected manner resolved that not a single raised point should be neglected accident however as before stood her friend and at a moment when she least expected it the lid flew back once more exposing the paper to view  maud had been too seriously alarmed about reopening the box to hesitate a moment now as to examining its contents the paper was removed and she began to unfold it slowly a slight tremor passing through her frame as she did so for a single instant she paused to scent the delightful and delicate perfume that seemed to render the interior sacred then her fingers resumed their office at each instant her eyes expected to meet robert willoughbys well known handwriting but the folds of the paper opened on a blank to mauds surprise and for a single exquisitely painful moment she saw that a lock of hair was all the box contained besides the paper in which it was enveloped her look became anxious and her face pale then the eyes brightened and a blush that might well be likened to the tints with which the approach of dawn illumines the sky suffused her cheeks as holding the hair to the light the long ringlets dropped at length and she recognised one of those beautiful tresses of which so many were falling at that very moment in rich profusion around her awn lovely face to unloosen her hair from the comb and to lay the secret of bob willoughby by its side in a way to compare the glossy shades was the act of only a moment it sufficed however to bring a perfect conviction of the truth it was a memorial of herself then that robert willoughby so prized had so long guarded with care and which he called the secret of his life  it was impossible for maud not to understand all this robert willoughby loved her he had taken this mode of telling his passion he had been on the point of doing this in words the very day before and now he availed himself of the only means that offered of completing the tale a flood of tenderness gushed to the heart of maud as she passed over all this in her mind and from that moment she ceased to feel shame at the recollection of her own attachment she might still have shrunk a little from avowing it to her father and mother and beulah but as to herself the world and the object of her affections she now stood perfectly vindicated in her own eyes  that was a precious halfhour which succeeded for the moment all present dangers were lost sight of in the glow of future hopes mauds imagination portrayed scenes of happiness in which domestic duties bob beloved almost worshipped and her father and mother happy in the felicity of their children were the prominent features while beulah and little evert filled the background of the picture in colours of pleasing softness but these were illusions that could not last for ever the fearful realities of her situation returning with the greater consciousness of existence still bob might now be loved without wounding any of the sensitiveness of her sexs opinions and dearly engrossingly passionately was he rewarded for the manner in which he had thought of letting her know the true state of his heart at a moment when he had so much reason to think only of himself  it was time for maud to return to her mother and sister the box was carefully concealed leaving the hair in its old envelope and she hurried to the nursery on entering the room she found that her father had just preceded her the captain was grave more thoughtful than usual and his wife accustomed to study his countenance for so much of her happiness saw at once that something lay heavy on his mind  has anything out of the way happened hugh she asked to give you uneasiness  captain willoughby drew a chair to the side of that of his wife seated himself and took her hand before he answered little evert who sat on her knee was played with for a moment as if to defer a disagreeable duty not till then did he even speak  you know dearest wilhelmina the captain finally commenced that there have never been any concealments between us on the score of danger even when i was a professed soldier and might be said to carry my life in my hand  you have ever found me reasonable i trust while feeling like a woman mindful of my duty as a wife  i have love this is the reason i have always dealt with you so frankly  we understand each other hugh now tell me the worst at once  i am not certain you will think there is any worst about it wilhelmina as bobs liberty is the object i intend to go out myself at the head of all the white men that remain in order to deliver him from the hands of his enemies this will leave you for a timesix or seven hours perhapsin the hut with only the three blacks as a guard and with the females you need have no apprehension of an assault however everything indicating a different intention on the part of our enemies on that score you may set your hearts at rest  all my apprehensions and prayers will be for you my husbandfor ourselves we care not  this i expected it is to lessen these very apprehensions that i have come to tell you my whole plan  captain willoughby now related with some minuteness the substance of mikes report and his own plan of the last of which we have already given an outline everything had been well matured in his mind and all promised success the men were apprised of the service on which they were to be employed and every one of them had manifested the best spirit they were then busy in equipping themselves in half an hour they would be ready to march  to all this mrs willoughby listened like a soldiers wife accustomed to the risks of a frontier warfare though she felt like a woman beulah pressed little evert to her heart while her pallid countenance was turned to her father with a look that seemed to devour every syllable as for maud a strange mixture of dread and wild delight were blended in her bosom to have bob liberated and restored to them was approaching perfect happiness though it surpassed her powers not to dread misfortunes nevertheless the captain was so clear in his explanations so calm in his manner and of a judgment so approved that his auditors felt far less concern than might naturally have been expected      chapter xxiv    marchmarchmarch   making sounds as they tread   hoho how they step   going down to the dead    coxe  the time maud consumed in her meditations over the box and its contents had been employed by the captain in preparations for his enterprise joyce young blodget jamie and mike led by their commander in person were to compose the whole force on the occasion and every man had been busy in getting his arms ammunition and provisions ready for the last halfhour when captain willoughby therefore had taken leave of his family he found the party in a condition to move  the first great desideratum was to quit the hut unseen joel and his followers were still at work in distant fields but they all carefully avoided that side of the knoll which would have brought them within reach of the musket and this left all behind the cliff unobserved unless indians were in the woods in that direction as mike had so recently passed in by that route however the probability was the whole party still remained in the neighbourhood of the mills where all accounts agreed in saying they mainly kept it was the intention of the captain therefore to sally by the rivulet and the rear of the house and to gain the woods under cover of the bushes on the banks of the former as had already been done by so many since the inroad  the great difficulty was to quit the house and reach the bed of the stream unseen this step however was a good deal facilitated by means of joels sallyport the overseer having taken himself all the precautions against detection of which the case well admitted nevertheless there was the distance between the palisades and the base of the rocks some forty or fifty yards which was entirely uncovered and had to be passed under the notice of any wandering eyes that might happen to be turned in that quarter after much reflection the captain and serjeant came to the conclusion to adopt the following mode of proceeding  blodget passed the hole by himself unarmed rolling down the declivity until he reached the stream here a thicket concealed him sufficiently the bushes extending along the base of the rocks following the curvature of the rivulet once within these bushes there was little danger of detection as soon as it was ascertained that the young man was beneath the most eastern of the outer windows of the northern wing the only one of the entire range that had bushes directly under it all the rifles were lowered down to him two at a time care being had that no one should appear at the window during the operation this was easily effected jerks of the rope sufficing for the necessary signals to haul in the line the ammunition succeeded and in this manner all the materials of offence and defence were soon collected on the margin of the stream  the next step was to send the men out one by one imitating the precautions taken by blodget each individual had his own provisions and most of the men carried some sort of arms such as a pistol or a knife about his person in half an hour the four men were armed and waited for the leader concealed by the bushes on the border of the brook it only remained for captain willoughby to give some instructions to those he left in the hut and to follow  pliny the elder in virtue of his years and some experience in indian warfare succeeded to the command of the garrison in the absence of its chief had there remained a male white at the knoll this trust never could have devolved on him it being thought contrary to the laws of nature for a negro to command one of the other colour but such was not the fact and pliny the elder succeeded pretty much as a matter of course notwithstanding he was to obey not only his particular old mistress but both his young mistresses who exercised an authority over him that was not to be disputed without doing violence to all the received notions of the day to him then the captain issued his final orders bidding him be vigilant and above all to keep the gates closed  as soon as this was done the husband and father went to his wife and children to take a last embrace anxious not to excite too strong apprehensions by his manner this was done affectionatelysolemnly perhapsbut with a manner so guarded as to effect his object  i shall look for no other signal or sign of success hugh said the weeping wife than your own return accompanied by our dearest boy when i can hold you both in my arms i shall be happy though all the indians of the continent were in the valley  do not miscalculate as to time wilhelmina that affectionate heart of yours sometimes travels over time and space in a way to give its owner unnecessary pain remember we shall have to proceed with great caution both in going and returning and it will require hours to make the d√™tour i have in view i hope to see you again before sunset but a delay may carry us into the night it may even become necessary to defer the final push until after dark  this was melancholy intelligence for the females but they listened to it with calmness and endeavoured to be as well as to seem resigned beulah received her fathers kiss and blessing with streaming eyes straining little evert to her heart as he left her maud was the last embraced he even led her by gentle violence to the court keeping her in discourse by the way exhorting her to support her mothers spirits by her own sense and steadiness  i shall have bob in the hut soon he added and this will repay us all for more than twice the risksall but you little vixen for your mother tells me you are getting through some caprice of that variable humour of your sex to be a little estranged from the poor fellow  father  o i know it is not very serious still even beulah tells me you once called him a major of foot  did i said maud trembling in her whole frame lest her secret had been prematurely betrayed by the very attempt to conceal it my tongue is not always my heart  i know it darling unless where i am concerned treat the son as you will maud i am certain that you will always love the father a pressure to the heart and kisses on the forehead eyes and cheeks followed you have all your own papers maud and can easily understand your own affairs when examined into it will be seen that every shilling of your fortune has gone to increase it and little hussy you are now become something like a great heiress  what does this mean dearest dearest father your words frighten me  they should not love danger is never increased by being prepared to meet it i have been a steward and wish it to be known that the duty has not been unfaithfully discharged that is all a hundredfold am i repaid by possessing so dutiful and sweet a child  maud fell on her fathers bosom and sobbed never before had he made so plain allusions to the true relations which existed between them the papers she possessed having spoken for themselves and having been given in silence nevertheless as he appeared disposed to proceed no further at present the poor girl struggled to command herself succeeded in part rose received her fathers benediction most solemnly and tenderly delivered and saw him depart with an air of calmness that subsequently astonished even herself  we must now quit the interesting group that was left behind in the hut and accompany the adventurers in their march  captain willoughby was obliged to imitate his men in the mode of quitting the palisades he had dressed himself in the american hunting shirt and trowsers for the occasion and this being an attire he now rarely used it greatly diminished the chances of his being recognised if seen joyce was in a similar garb though neither jamie nor mike could ever be persuaded to assume a style that both insisted so much resembled that of the indians as for blodget he was in the usual dress of a labourer  as soon as he had reached the bottom of the cliff the captain let the fact be known to old pliny by using his voice with caution though sufficiently loud to be heard on the staging of the roof directly above his head the black had been instructed to watch joel and his companions in order to ascertain if they betrayed in their movements any consciousness of what was in progress at the hut the report was favourable pliny assuring his master that all e men work sir just as afore joel hammer away at ploughhandle tinkerin just like heself not an eye turn dis away massa  encouraged by this assurance the whole party stole through the bushes that lined this part of the base of the cliffs until they entered the bed of the stream it was september and the water was so low as to enable the party to move along the margin of the rivulet dryshod occasionally stepping from stone to stone the latter expedient indeed was adopted wherever circumstances allowed with a view to leave as few traces of a trail as was practicable otherwise the cover was complete the winding of the rivulet preventing any distant view through its little reaches and the thick fringe of the bushes on each bank effectually concealing the men against any passing lateral glimpse of their movements  captain willoughby had from the first apprehended an assault from this quarter the house in its elevation however possessed an advantage that would not be enjoyed by an enemy on the ground and then the cliff offered very serious obstacles to anything like a surprise on that portion of the defences notwithstanding he now led his men keeping a look riveted on the narrow lane in his front far from certain that each turn might not bring him in presence of an advancing party of the enemy no such unpleasant encounter occurred and the margin of the forest was gained without any appearance of the foe and seemingly without discovery  just within the cover of the woods a short reach of the rivulet lay fairly in sight from the rear wing of the dwellings it formed a beautiful object in the view the ardent and tasteful maud having sketched the silvery ribbon of water as it was seen retiring within the recesses of the forest and often calling upon others to admire its loveliness and picturesque effect here the captain halted and made a signal to old pliny to let him know he waited for an answer the reply was favourable the negro showing the sign that all was still well this was no sooner done than the faithful old black hurried down to his mistress to communicate the intelligence that the party was safely in the forest while the adventurers turned ascended the bank of the stream and pursued their way on more solid ground  captain willoughby and his men were now fairly engaged in the expedition and every soul of them felt the importance and gravity of the duty he was on even mike was fain to obey the order to be silent as the sound of a voice indiscreetly used might betray the passage of the party to some outlying scouts of the enemy caution was even used in treading on dried sticks lest their cracking should produce the same effect  the sound of the axe was heard in the rear of the cabins coming from a piece of woodland the captain had ordered cleared with the double view of obtaining fuel and of increasing his orchards this little clearing was near a quarter of a mile from the flats the plan being still to retain a belt of forest round the latter and it might have covered halfadozen acres of land having now been used four or five years for the same purpose to pass between this clearing and the cabins would have been too hazardous and it became necessary to direct the march in a way to turn the former  the cowpaths answered as guides for quite a mile mike being thoroughly acquainted with all their sinuosities the captain and serjeant however each carried a pocket compass an instrument without which few ventured far into the forests then the blows of the axes served as sounds to let the adventurers know their relative position and as they circled the place whence they issued they gave the constant assurance of their own progress and probable security  the reader will probably comprehend the nature of the ground over which our party was now marching the flats proper or the site of the old beaver dam have already been described the valley towards the south terminated at the rocks of the mill changing its character below that point to a glen or vast ravine on the east were mountains of considerable height and of unlimited range to the north the level land extended miles though on a platform many feet higher than the level of the cleared meadows while to the west along the route the adventurers were marching broad slopes of rolling forest spread their richlywooded surfaces filled with fair promise for the future the highest swell of this undulating forest was that nearest to the hut and it was its elevation only that gave the homescene the character of a valley  captain willoughbys object was to gain the summit of this first ridge of land which would serve as a guide to his object since it terminated at the line of rocks that made the waterfall quite a mile however in the rear of the mills it would carry him also quite beyond the clearing of the woodchoppers and be effectually turning the whole of the enemys position once at the precipitous termination caused by the face of rock that had been thrown to the surface by some geological phenomenon he could not miss his way since these rugged marks must of themselves lead him directly to the station known to be occupied by the body of his foes  half an hour served to reach the desired ridge when the party changed its march pursuing a direction nearly south along its summit  those axes sound nearer and nearer serjeant captain willoughby observed after the march had lasted a long time in profound silence we must be coming up near the point where the men are at work  does your honour reflect at all on the reason why these fellows are so particularly industrious in a time like thisto me it has a very ambuscadish sort of look  it cannot be connected with an ambuscade joyce inasmuch as we are not supposed to be on a march there can be no ambuscade you will remember practised on a garrison  i ask your honours pardonmay not a sortie be ambushed as well as a march  in that sense perhaps you may be right and now you mention it i think it odd there should be so much industry at woodchopping in a moment like this we will halt as soon as the sounds are fairly abreast of us when you and i can reconnoitre the men and ascertain the appearance of things for ourselves  i remember sir when your honour led out two companies of ours with one of the royal irish a majors command of good rights to observe the left flank of the french the evening before we stormed the enemys works at ty  your memory is beginning to fail you joyce interrupted the captain smiling we were far from storming those works having lost two thousand men before them and failed of seeing their inside at all  i always look upon a soldierly attempt your honour the same as a thing that is done a more gallant stand than we made i never witnessed and though we were driven back i will allow yet i call that assault as good as storming  well have it your own way joycethe morning before your storming i remember to have led out three companies though it was more in advance than on either flank the object was to unmask a suspected ambush  thats just what i wanted to be at your honour the general sent you as an old captain with three companies to spring the trap before he should put his own foot into it  he certainly didand the movement had the desired effect  better and better siri remember we were fired on and lost some ten or fifteen men but i would not presume to say whether the march succeeded or not for nothing was said of the affair next day in general orders sir  next day we had other matters to occupy our minds it was a bloody and a mournful occasion for england and her colonies  well your honour that does not affect our movement which you say yourself was useful  very true joyce though the great calamity of the succeeding day prevented the little success of the preceding morning from being mentioned in general orders but to what does all this tend as i know it must lead to something  it was merely meant as a respectful hint your honour that the inferior should be sent out now according to our own ancient rules to reconnitre the clearing while the commanderinchief remain with the main body to cover the retreat  i thank you serjeant and shall not fail to employ you on all proper occasions at present it is my intention that we go together leaving the men to take breath in a suitable cover  this satisfied joyce who was content to wait for orders as soon as the sounds of the axes showed that the party were far enough in advance and the formation of the land assured the captain that he was precisely where he wished to be the men were halted and left secreted in a cover made by the top of a fallen tree this precaution was taken lest any wandering savage might get a glimpse of their persons if they stood lounging about in the more open forest during the captains absence  this disposition made the captain and serjeant first examining the priming of their pieces moved with the necessary caution towards the edge of the woodchoppers clearing the axe was a sufficient guide and ere they had proceeded far the light began to shine through the trees proof in itself that they were approaching an opening in the forest  let us incline to the left your honour said joyce respectfully there is a naked rock hereabouts that completely overlooks the clearing and where we can get even a peep at the hut i have often sat on it when out with the gun and wearied for the next thing to being at home is to see home  i remember the place serjeant and like your suggestion answered the captain with an eagerness that it was very unusual for him to betray i could march with a lighter heart after getting another look at the knoll and being certain of its security  the parties being both of a mind it is not surprising that each looked eagerly for the spot in question it was an isolated rock that rose some fifteen or twenty feet above the surface of the ground having a width and depth about double its heightone of those common excrescences of the forest that usually possess interest for no one but the geologist such an object was not difficult to find in an open wood and the search was soon rewarded by a discovery bending their steps that way our two soldiers were quickly at its base as is usual the summit of this fragment of rock was covered with bushes others shooting out also from the rich warm earth at its base or to speak more properly at its junction with the earth  joyce ascended first leaving his rifle in the captains charge the latter followed after having passed up his own and his companions arms neither being disposed to stir without having these important auxiliaries at command once on the rock both moved cautiously to its eastern brow care being had not to go beyond the cover here they stood side by side gazing on the scene that was outspread before them through openings in the bushes  to the captains astonishment he found himself within half musket shot of the bulk of the hostile party a regular bivouac had been formed round a spring in the centre of the clearing and bodies of trees had been thrown together so as to form a species of work which was rudely but effectually abbatied by the branches in a word one of those strong rough forest encampments had been made which are so difficult to carry without artillery more especially if well defended by being placed in the centre of the clearing an assault could not be made without expensing the assailants and the spring always assured to the garrison the great requisite water  there was a method and order in this arrangement that surprised both our old soldiers that indians had resorted to this expedient neither believed nor would the careless untaught and inexperienced whites of the mohawk be apt to adopt it without a suggestion from some person acquainted with the usages of frontier warfare such persons were not difficult to find it is true and it was a proof that those claiming to be in authority rightfully or not were present  there was something unlooked for also in the manner in which the party of strangers were lounging about at a moment like that seemingly doing nothing or preparing for no service joyce who was a man of method and was accustomed to telling off troops counted no less than fortynine of these idlers most of whom were lounging near the log entrenchment though a few were sauntering about the clearing conversing with the woodchoppers or making their observations listlessly and seemingly without any precise object in view  this is the most extrornary sight for a military expedition i have ever seen your honour whispered joyce after the two had stood examining the position for quite a minute in silence a tolerable good log breastwork i will allow sir and men enough to make it good against a sharp assault but nothing like a guard and not so much as a single sentinel this is an affront to the art captain willoughby and it is such an affront to us that i feel certain we might carry the post by surprise if all felt the insult as i do myself  this is no time for rash acts or excited feelings joyce though were my gallant boy with us i do think we might make a push at these fellows with very reasonable chances of success  yes your honour and without him too a close fire three cheers and a vigorous charge would drive every one of the rascals into the woods  where they would rally become the assailants in their turn surround us and either compel us to surrender or starve us out at all events nothing of the sort must be undertaken until we have carried out the plan for the rescue of major willoughby my hopes of success are greatly increased since i find the enemy has his principal post up here where he must be a long halfmile from the mill even in a straight line you have counted the enemy  there are just fortynine of them in sight and i should think some eight or ten more sleeping about under the logs as i occasionally discover a new one raising his headlook sir does your honour see that manoeuvre  do i see what serjeantthere is no visible change that i discover  only an indian chopping wood captain willoughby which is some such miracle as a white man painting  the reader will have understood that all the hostile party that was lounging about this clearing were in indian guise with faces and hands of the wellknown reddish colour that marks the american aborigines the two soldiers could discover many evidences that there was deception in these appearances though they thought it quite probable that real red men were mingled with the palefaces but so little did the invaders respect the necessity of appearances in their present position that one of these seeming savages had actually mounted a log taken the axe from the hands of its owner and begun to chop with a vigour and skill that soon threw off chips in a way that no man can successfully imitate but the expert axeman of the american interior  pretty well that sir for a redskin said joyce smiling if there isnt white blood ay and yankee blood in that chaps arm ill give him some of my own to help colour it step this way your honouronly a foot or twothere sir by looking through the opening just above the spot where that very makebelieve injin is scattering his chips as if they were so many kernels of corn that he was tossing to the chickens you will get a sight of the hut  the fact was so by altering his own position a little on the rock captain willoughby got a full view of the entire buildings of the knoll it is true he could not see the lawn without the works nor quite all of the stockade but the whole of the western wing or an entire sideview of the dwellings was obtained everything seemed as tranquil and secure in and around them as if they vegetated in a sabbath in the wilderness there was something imposing even in the solemn silence of their air and the captain now saw that if he had been struck and rendered uneasy by the mystery that accompanied the inaction and quiet of his invaders they in their turns might experience some such sensations as they gazed on the repose of the hut and the apparent security of its garrison but for joels desertion indeed and the information he had carried with him there could be little doubt that the stranger must have felt the influence of such doubts to a very material extent alas as things were it was not probable they could be long imposed on by any seeming calm  captain willoughby felt a reluctance to tear himself away from the spectacle of that dwelling which contained so many that were dear to him even joyce gazed at the house with pleasure for it had been his quarters now so many years and he had looked forward to the time when he should breathe his last in it connected with his old commander by a tie that was inseparable so far as human wishes could control human events it was impossible that the serjeant could go from the place where they had left so many precious beings almost in the keeping of providence at a moment like that altogether without emotion while each was thus occupied in mind there was a perfect stillness the men of the party had been so far drilled as to speak in low voices and nothing they said was audible on the rock the axes alone broke the silence of the woods and to ears so accustomed to their blows they offered no intrusion in the midst of this eloquent calm the bushes of the rock rustled as it might be with the passage of a squirrel or a serpent of the last the country had but few and they of the most innocent kind while the former abounded captain willoughby turned expecting to see one of these little restless beings when his gaze encountered a swarthy face and two glowing eyes almost within reach of his arm that this was a real indian was beyond dispute and the crisis admitting of no delay the old officer drew a dirk and had already raised his arm to strike when joyce arrested the blow  this is nick your honour said the serjeant inquiringlyis he friend or foe  what says he himself answered the captain lowering his hand in doubt let him speak to his own character  nick now advanced and stood calmly and fearlessly at the side of the two white men still there was ferocity in his look and an indecision in his movements he certainly might betray the adventurers at any instant and they felt all the insecurity of their situation but accident had brought nick directly in front of the opening through which was obtained the view of the hut in turning from one to the other of the two soldiers his quick eye took in this glimpse of the buildings and it became riveted there as by the charm of fascination gradually the ferocity left his countenance which grew human and soft  squaw in wigwamsaid

as if he fully entered into the necessity of remaining concealed from those who were in such a dangerous vicinity it served to inspire confidence inducing the two soldiers to believe him disposed to

a gleam of fierceness shooting across the swarthy face and a menacing gesture of the hand in the direction of a real savage who was standing indolently leaning against a tree at a distance so small as to allow those on the rock to distinguish his features the vacant expression of this mans countenance plainly denoted that he was totally unconscious of the vicinity of danger it expressed the listless vacancy of an indian in a state of perfect resthis stomach full his body at ease his mind peaceful  i thought nick was not here the captain quietly observed smiling on the tuscarora a little

superiorobey manitou and take scalp from enemy warpath alway open when enemy at tother end  this is no place to discuss such questions chief nor have we the time do you go with us  nick nodded an assent and signed for the other to quit the rocks the captain hesitated a moment during which he stood intently studying the scene in the clearing  what say you tuscarora the serjeant has proposed assaulting that breastwork  no good capin you fire halloo rush onwell kill four six tworest run away injin down at mill hear rifle follow smokewhere major den get major firsttink about enemy afterwards  as nick said this he repeated the gesture to descend and he was obeyed in silence the captain now led the way back to his party and soon rejoined it all were glad to see nick for he was known to have a sure rifle to be fearless as the turkeycock and to possess a sagacity in the woods that frequently amounted to a species of intuition  who lead capin or injin asked the tuscarora in his sententious manner  och nick yere a crature muttered mike divil burrrn me jamie but i tinks the fallie would crass the very threetops rather than miss the majjors habitation  not a syllable must be uttered said the captain raising a hand in remonstrance i will lead and wyandott√© will march by my side and give me his council in whispers joyce will bring up the rear blodget you will keep a sharp lookout to the left while jamie will do the same to the right as we approach the mills stragglers may be met in the woods and our march must be conducted with the greatest caution now follow and be silent  the captain and nick led and the whole party followed observing the silence which had been enjoined on them the usual manner of marching on a warpath in the woods was for the men to follow each other singly an order that has obtained the name of indian file the object being to diminish the trail and conceal the force of the expedition by each man treading in his leaders footsteps on the present occasion however the captain induced nick to walk at his side feeling an uneasiness on the subject of the tuscaroras fidelity that he could not entirely conquer the pretext given was very different as the reader will suppose by seeing the print of a moccasin in company with that of a boot any straggler that crossed the trail might be led to suppose it had been left by the passage of a party from the clearing or the mill nick quietly assented to this reasoning and fell in by the side of the captain without remonstrance  vigilant eyes were kept on all sides of the line of march though it was hoped and believed that the adventurers had struck upon a route too far west to be exposed to interruption a quarter of a mile nearer to the flats might have brought them within the range of stragglers but following the summit of the ridge there was a certain security in the indolence which would be apt to prevent mere idlers from sauntering up an ascent at all events no interruption occurred the party reaching in safety the rocks that were a continuation of the range which formed the precipice at the fallsthe sign that they had gone far enough to the south at this period the precipice was nearly lost in the rising of the lower land but its margin was sufficiently distinct to form a good mask  descending to the plateau beneath the captain and nick now inclined to the east the intention being to come in upon the mills from the rear as the buildings lay in the ravine this could only be done by making a rapid descent immediately in their vicinity a formation of the ground that rendered the march until within pistolshot of its termination reasonably secure nick also assured his companions that he had several times traversed this very plateau and that he had met no signs of footsteps on it from which he inferred that the invaders had not taken the trouble to ascend the rugged cliffs that bounded the western side of the glen  the approach to the summit of the cliff was made with caution though the left flank of the adventurers was well protected by the abrupt descent they had already made from the terrace above this left little more than the right flank and the front to be watched the falling away of the land forming also a species of cover for the rear it is not surprising then that the verge of the ravine or glen was attained and no discovery was made the spot being favourable the captain immediately led down a winding path that was densely fringed with bushes towards the level of the buildings  the glen of the mills was very narrow so much so as barely to leave sites for the buildings themselves and three or four cabins for the workmen the mills were placed in advance as near as possible to the course of the water while the habitations of the workmen were perched on shelves of the rocks or such level bits of bottomland as offered owing to this last circumstance the house of daniel the miller or that in which it was supposed the major was still confined stood by itself and fortunately at the very foot of the path by which the adventurers were descending all this was favourable and had been taken into the account as a material advantage by captain willoughby when he originally conceived the plan of the present sortie  when the chimney of the cabin was visible over the bushes captain willoughby halted his party and repeated his instruction to joyce in a voice very little raised above a whisper the serjeant was ordered to remain in his present position until he received a signal to advance as for the captain himself he intended to descend as near as might be to the buttery of the cabin and reconnoitre before he gave the final order this buttery was in a leanto as a small addition to the original building was called in the parlance of the country and the object being shade and coolness on account of the milk with which it was usually well stored at this season of the year it projected back to the very cliff where it was half hid in bushes and young trees it had but a single small window that was barred with wood to keep out cats and such wild vermin as affected milk nor was it either lathed or plastered these two last being luxuries not often known in the log tenements of the frontier still it was of solid logs chinked in with mortar and made a very effectual prison with the door properly guarded the captive being deprived of edged tools all this was also known to the father when he set forth to effect the liberation of his son and like the positions of the buildings themselves had been well weighed in his estimate of the probabilities and chances  as soon as his orders were given captain willoughby proceeded down the path accompanied only by nick he had announced his intention to send the tuscarora ahead to reconnoitre then to force himself among the bushes between the leanto and the rocks and there to open a communication with the major through the chinks of the logs after receiving nicks intelligence his plan was to be governed by circumstances and to act accordingly  god bless you joyce said the captain squeezing the serjeants hand as he was on the point of descending we are on ticklish service and require all our wits about us if anything happen to me remember that my wife and daughter will mainly depend on you for protection  i shall consider that as your honours orders sir and no more need be said to me captain willoughby  the captain smiled on his old follower and joyce thought that never had he seen the fine manly face of his superior beam with a calmer or sweeter expression than it did as he returned his own pressure of the hand the two adventurers were both careful and their descent was noiseless the men above listened in breathless silence but the stealthy approach of the cat upon the bird could not have been more still than that of these two experienced warriors  the place where joyce was left with the men might have been fifty feet above the roof of the cabin and almost perpendicularly over the narrow vacancy that was known to exist between the rocks and the leanto still the bushes and trees were so thick as to prevent the smallest glimpse at objects below had the shape of the cliff allowed it while they even intercepted sounds joyce fancied nevertheless that he heard the rustling bushes as the captain forced his way into the narrow space he was to occupy and he augured well of the fact since it proved that no opposition had been encountered half an hour of forest silence followed that was only interrupted by the tumbling of the waters over the natural dam at the end of that weary period a shout was heard in front of the mills and the party raised their pieces in a vague apprehension that some discovery had been made that was about to bring on a crisis nothing further occurred however to confirm this impression and an occasional burst of laughter that evidently came from white men rather served to allay the apprehension  another halfhour passed during which no interruption was heard by this time joyce became uneasy a state of things having arrived for which no provision had been made in his instructions he was about to leave his command under the charge of jamie and descend himself to reconnoitre when a footstep was heard coming up the path nothing but the deep attention and breathless stillness of the men could have rendered the sound of a tread so nearly noiseless audible but heard it was at a moment when every sense was wrought up to its greatest powers rifles were lowered in readiness to receive assailants but each was raised again as nick came slowly into view the tuscarora was calm in manner as if no incident had occurred to disconcert the arrangement though his eyes glanced around him like those of a man who searched for an absent person  where capinwhere major nick asked as soon as his glance had taken in the faces of all present  we must ask that of you nick returned joyce we have not seen the captain nor had any orders from him since he left us  this answer seemed to cause the indian more surprise than it was usual for him to betray and he pondered a moment in obvious uneasiness  cant stay here alway he muttered best go see byemby trouble come then too late  the serjeant was greatly averse to moving without orders he had his instructions how to act in every probable contingency but none that covered the case of absolute inaction on the part of those below nevertheless twice the time necessary to bring things to issue had gone by and neither signal shot nor alarm had reached his ears  do you know anything of the major nick the serjeant demanded determined to examine the case thoroughly ere he came to a decision  major deresee him at doorplenty sentinel all goodwhere capin  where did you leave himyou can give the last account of him  go in behind cupboardunder rockplenty bushesall rightson dere  this must be looked toperhaps his honour has fallen into a fitsuch things sometimes happenand a man who is fighting for his own child doesnt feel jamie all the same as one who fights on a general principle as it might be  naye re right sairjeant jyce and yell be doing the kind and prudent act to gang doon yersal and investigate the trainsaction with yer ain een  this joyce determined to do directing nick to accompany him as a guide the indian seemed glad to comply and there was no delay in proceeding it required but a minute to reach the narrow passage between the cliff and the leanto the bushes were carefully shoved aside and joyce entered he soon caught a glimpse of the hunting shirt and then he was about to withdraw believing that he was in error in anticipating orders but a short look at his commander removed all scruples for he observed that he was seated on a projection of the rocks with his body bowed forward apparently leaning on the logs of the building this seemed to corroborate the thought about a fit and the serjeant pressed eagerly forward to ascertain the truth  joyce touched his commanders arm but no sign of consciousness came from the latter he then raised his body upright placing the back in a reclining attitude against the rocks and started back himself when he caught a glimpse of the deathlike hue of the face at first the notion of the fit was strong with the serjeant but in changing his own position he caught a glimpse of a little pool of blood which at once announced that violence had been used  although the serjeant was a man of great steadiness of nerves and unchangeable method he fairly trembled as he ascertained the serious condition of his old and wellbeloved commander notwithstanding he was too much of a soldier to neglect anything that circumstances required on examination he discovered a deep and fatal wound between two of the ribs which had evidently been inflicted with a common knife the blow had passed into the heart and captain willoughby was out of all question dead he had breathed his last within six feet of his own gallant son who ignorant of all that passed was little dreaming of the proximity of one so dear to him as well as of his dire condition  joyce was a man of powerful frame and at that moment he felt he was master of a giants strength first assuring himself of the fact that the wounded man had certainly ceased to breathe he brought the arms over his own shoulders raised the body on his back and walked from the place with less attention to caution than on entering but with sufficient care to prevent exposure nick stood watching his movements with a wondering look and as soon as there was room he aided in supporting the corpse  in this manner the two went up the path bearing their senseless burden a gesture directed the party with jamie to precede the two who had been below and the serjeant did not pause even to breathe until he had fairly reached the summit of the cliff then he halted in a place removed from the danger of immediate discovery the body was laid reverently on the ground and joyce renewed his examination with greater ease and accuracy until perfectly satisfied that the captain must have ceased to breathe nearly an hour  this was a sad and fearful blow to the whole party no one at such a moment thought of inquiring into the manner in which their excellent master had received his deathblow but every thought was bent either on the extent of the calamity or on the means of getting back to the hut joyce was the soul of the party his rugged face assumed a stern commanding expression but every sign of weakness had disappeared he gave his orders promptly and the men even started when he spoke so bent on obtaining obedience did he appear to be  the rifles were converted into a bier the body was placed upon it and the four men then raised the burthen and began to retrace their footsteps in melancholy silence nick led the way pointing out the difficulties of the path with a sedulousness of attention and a gentleness of manner that none present had ever before witnessed in the tuscarora he even appeared to have become woman to use one of his own peculiar expressions  no one speaking and all the men working with good will the retreat notwithstanding the burthen with which it was encumbered was made with a rapidity greatly exceeding the advance nick led the way with an unerring eye even selecting better ground than that which the white men had been able to find on their march he had often traversed all the hills in the character of a hunter and to him the avenues of the forest were as familiar as the streets of his native town become to the burgher he made no offer to become one of the bearers this would have been opposed to his habits but in all else the indian manifested gentleness and solicitude his apprehension seemed to be and so he expressed it that the mohawks might get the scalp of the dead man a disgrace that he seemed as solicitous to avoid as joyce himself the serjeant however keeping in view the feelings of the survivors rather than any notions of military pride  notwithstanding the stern resolution that prevailed among the men that return march was long and weary the distance of itself exceeded two miles and there were the inequalities and obstacles of a forest to oppose them per severance and strength however overcame all difficulties and at the end of two hours the party approached the point where it became necessary to enter the bed of the rivulet or expose their sad procession by marching in open view of any who might be straggling in the rear of the hut a species of desperate determination had influenced the men in their return march rendering them reckless of discovery or its consequences a circumstance that had greatly favoured their object the adventurous and bold frequently encountering fewer difficulties in the affairs of war than the cautious and timid but an embarrassment now presented itself that was far more difficult to encounter than any which proceeded from personal risks the loving family of the deceased was to be met a wife and daughters apprised of the fearful loss that in the providence of god had suddenly alighted on their house  lower the body men and come to a halt said joyce using the manner of authority though his voice trembled we must consult together as to our next step  there was a brief and decent pause while the party placed the lifeless body on the grass face uppermost with the limbs laid in order and everything about it disposed of in a seemliness that betokened profound respect for the senseless clay even after the noble spirit had departed mike alone could not resist his strong native propensity to talk the honest fellow raised a hand of his late master and kissing it with strong affection soliloquized as follows in a tone that was more rebuked by feeling than any apprehension of consequences  little need had ye of a praist and extreme unction he said the likes of

departing with his corporeal part for the mansions of happiness the blessed mary have mercy on him whether here or therebut the captain was not the man to wish a faitful follower to afflict his own wife and so ill have notin to do with such a message at all at all  nick gosaid the indian calmlyused to carry messagecarry him for capin once more  well nick you may do it certainly if so disposed answered joyce who would have accepted the services of a chinese rather than undertake the office in person you will remember and speak to the ladies gently and not break the news too suddenly  yessquaw soft heartnick knowhad moderhad wife oncehad darter  very well this will be an advantage men as nick is the only married man among us and married men should best understand dealing with females  joyce then held a private communication with the tuscarora that lasted some five or six minutes when the last leaped nimbly into the bed of the stream and was soon concealed by the bushes of one of its reaches      chapter xxvi    heart leaps to heartthe sacred flood   that warms us is the same   that good old manhis honest blood   alike we fondly claim    sprague  although nick commenced his progress with so much seeming zeal and activity his speed abated the moment he found himself beyond the sight of those he had left in the woods before he reached the foot of the cliff his trot had degenerated to a walk and when he actually found he was at its base he seated himself on a stone apparently to reflect on the course he ought to pursue  the countenance of the tuscarora expressed a variety of emotions while he thus remained stationary at first it was fierce savage exulting then it became gentler soft perhaps repentant he drew his knife from its buckskin sheath and eyed the blade with a gaze expressive of uneasiness perceiving that a clot of blood had collected at the junction with the handle it was carefully removed by the use of water his look next passed over his whole person in order to ascertain if any more of these betrayers of his fearful secret remained after which he seemed more at ease  wyandott√©s back dont ache now he growled to himself ole sore heal up why capin touch him tink injin no got feelin good man sometime bad man sometime sometime live sometime die why tell wyandott√© he flog agin just as go to enemys camp no back feel well nownebber smart any more  when this soliloquy was ended nick arose cast a look up at the sun to ascertain how much of the day still remained glanced towards the hut as if examining the nature of its defences stretched himself like one who was weary and peeped out from behind the bushes in order to see how those who were afield still occupied themselves all this done with singular deliberation and steadiness he arranged his light dress and prepared to present himself before the wife and daughters of the man whom three hours before he had remorselessly murdered nick had often meditated this treacherous deed during the thirty years which had elapsed between his first flogging and the present period but circumstances had never placed its execution safely in his power the subsequent punishments had increased the desire for a few years but time had so far worn off the craving for revenge that it would never have been actively revived perhaps but for the unfortunate allusions of the victim himself to the subject captain willoughby had been an english soldier of the school of the last century he was naturally a humane and a just man but he believed in the military axiom that the most flogging regiments were the best fighting regiments and perhaps he was not in error as regards the lower english character it was a fatal error however to make in relation to an american savage one who had formerly exercised the functions and who had not lost all the feelings of a chief unhappily at a moment when everything depended on the fidelity of the tuscarora the captain had bethought him of his old expedient for insuring prompt obedience and by way of a reminder he made an allusion to his former mode of punishment as nick would have expressed it the old sores smarted the wavering purpose of thirty years was suddenly and fiercely revived and the knife passed into the heart of the victim with a rapidity that left no time for appeals to the tribunal of gods mercy in half a minute captain willoughby had ceased to breathe  such had been the act of the man who now passed through the opening of the palisade and entered the former habitation of his victim a profound stillness reigned in and around the hut and no one appeared to question the unexpected intruder nick passed with his noiseless step round to the gate which he found secured it was necessary to knock and this he did in a way effectually to bring a porter  who dere demanded the elder pliny from within  good friendopen gate come wid message from capin  the natural distaste to the indians which existed among the blacks of the knoll included the tuscarora this disgust was mingled with a degree of dread and it was difficult for beings so untutored and ignorant at all times to draw the proper distinctions between indian and indian in their wonderloving imaginations oneidas tuscaroras mohawks onondagas and iroquois were all jumbled together in inextricable confusion a red man being a red man and a savage a savage it is not surprising therefore that pliny the elder should hesitate about opening the gate and admitting one of the detested race though a man so well known to them all in the peculiar situation of the family luckily great smash happened to be near and her husband called her to the gate by one of the signals that was much practised between them  who you tink outdere asked pliny the elder of his consort with a very significant look  how you tink guess ole plinyou spose nigger wench like albonny wise woman dat she see trough a gate and know ebbery ting and little more  well dat

nodded assent placed his shoulders resolutely against the massive timbers and stood propping a defence that would have made a respectable resistance to a batteringram like another atlas upholding a world his duty was short however his lady soon returning with maud who was hastening breathlessly to learn the news  is it you nick called out the sweet voice of our heroine through the crevices of the timber  the tuscarora started as he so unexpectedly heard those familiar sounds for an instant his look was dark then the expression changed to pity and concern and his reply was given with less than usual of the abrupt guttural brevity that belonged to his habits  tis nicksassy nickwyandott√© flower of the woods for so the indian often termed maudgot newscapin send him meet party and go along nobody here only wyandott√© nick see major toosay someting to young squaw  this decided the matter the gate was unbarred and nick in the court in halfaminute great smash stole a glance without and beckoned pliny the elder to join her in order to see the extraordinary spectacle of joel and his associates toiling in the fields when they drew in their heads maud and her companion were already in the library the message from robert willoughby had induced our heroine to seek this room for placing little confidence in the delicacy of the messenger she recoiled from listening to his words in the presence of others  but nick was in no haste to speak he took the chair to which maud motioned and he sate looking at her in a way that soon excited her alarm  tell me if your heart has any mercy

gleamed before her imagination though it was necessarily veiled in the mist of uncertainty she became pale as death and pressed her hand upon her heart as if to still its beating then by a desperate effort she became more calm and obtained the power to speak  oh is it so nickcan it be so she said my father has fallen in this dreadful business  fader kill twenty year ago tell you dat how often answered the tuscarora angrily for in his anxiety to lessen the shock to maud for whom this wayward savage had a strange sentiment of affection that had grown out of her gentle kindnesses to himself on a hundred occasions he fancied if she knew that captain willoughby was not actually her father her grief at his loss would be less why you call dis fader when dat fader nick know fader and modermajor no broder  notwithstanding the sensations that nearly pressed her to the earth the telltale blood rushed to mauds cheeks again at this allusion and she bowed her face to her knees the action gave her time to rally her faculties and catching a glimpse of the vast importance to all for her maintaining selfcommand she was enabled to raise her face with something like the fortitude the indian hoped to see  trifle with me no longer wyandott√© but let me know the worst at once is my father deadby father i mean captain willoughby  mean wrong denno fader tell you why young quaw so much like mohawk  manis captain willoughby killed  nick gazed intently into mauds face for half a minute and then he nodded an assent notwithstanding all her resolutions to be steady our heroine nearly sank under the blow for ten minutes she spoke not but sat her head bowed to her knees in a confusion of thought that threatened a temporary loss of reason happily a flood of tears relieved her and she became more calm then the necessity of knowing more in order that she might act intelligently occurred to her mind and she questioned nick in a way to elicit all it suited the savage to reveal  mauds first impulse was to go out to meet the body of the captain and to ascertain for herself that there was actually no longer any hope nicks account had been so laconic as to leave much obscurity and the blow had been so sudden she could hardly credit the truth in its full extent still there remained the dreadful tidings to be communicated to those dear beings who while they feared so much had never anticipated a calamity like this even mrs willoughby sensitive as she was and wrapped up in those she loved so entirely as she was habitually had been so long accustomed to see and know of her husbands exposing himself with impunity as to begin to feel if not to think that he bore a charmed life all this customary confidence was to be overcome and the truth was to be said tell the fact to her mother maud felt that she could not then scarcely under any circumstances would she have consented to perform this melancholy office but so long as a shadow of doubt remained on the subject of her fathers actual decease it seemed cruel even to think of it her decision was to send for beulah and it was done by means of one of the negresses  so long as we feel that there are others to be sustained by our fortitude even the feeblest possess a firmness to which they might otherwise be strangers maud contrary to what her delicate but active frame and sweetness of disposition might seem to indicate was a young woman capable of the boldest exertions short of taking human life her frontier training had raised her above most of the ordinary weaknesses of her sex and so far as determination went few men were capable of higher resolution when circumstances called for its display her plan was now made up to go forth and meet the body and nothing short of a command from her mother could have stopped her in this frame of mind was our heroine when beulah made her appearance  maud exclaimed the youthful matron what has happenedwhy are you so palewhy send for me does nick bring us any tidings from the mill  the worst possible beulah my fathermy dear dear father is hurt they have borne him as far as the edge of the woods where they have halted in order not to take us by surprise i am going to meet theto meet the men and to bring father in you must prepare mother for the sad sad tidingsyes beulah for the worst as everything depends on the wisdom and goodness of god  oh maud this is dreadful exclaimed the sister sinking into a chairwhat will become of motherof little evertof us all  the providence of the ruler of heaven and earth will care for us kiss me dear sisterhow cold you arerouse yourself beulah for mothers sake think how much more she must feel than we possibly can and then be resolute  yes maudvery trueno woman can feel like a wifeunless it be a mother  here beulahs words were stopped by her fainting  you see smash said maud pointing to her sister with a strange resolution she must have air and a little waterand she has salts about her i know come nick we have no more time to wasteyou must be my guide  the tuscarora had been a silent observer of this scene and if it did not awaken remorse in his bosom it roused feelings that had never before been its inmates the sight of two such beings suffering under a blow that his own hand had struck was novel to him and he knew not which to encourage most a sentiment allied to regret or a fierce resentment that any should dare thus to reproach though it were only by yielding to the grief natural to their situation but maud had obtained a command over him that he knew not how to resist and he followed her from the room keeping his eyes riveted the while on the pallid face of beulah the last was recalled from her insensibility however in the course of a few minutes through the practised attentions of the negresses  maud waited for nothing motioning impatiently for the tuscarora to lead the way she glided after him with a rapidity that equalled his own loping movement she made no difficulties in passing the stockade though nick kept his eyes on the labourers and felt assured their exeunt was not noticed once by the path that led along the rivulet maud refused all precautions but passed swiftly over it partially concealed by its bushes her dress was dark and left little liability to exposure as for nick his forest attire like the hunting shirt of the whites was expressly regulated by the wish to go to and fro unseen  in less than three minutes after the indian and maud had passed the gate they were drawing near to the melancholy group that had halted in the forest our heroine was recognised as she approached and when she came rushing up to the spot all made way allowing her to fall upon her knees by the side of the lifeless body bathing the placid face of the dead with her tears and covering it with kisses  is there no hopeoh joyce she cried can it be possible that my father is actually dead  i fear miss maud that his honour has made his last march he has received orders to go hence and like a gallant soldier as he was he has obeyed without a murmur answered the serjeant endeavouring to appear firm and soldierlike himself we have lost a noble and humane commander and you a most excellent and tender father  no fadergrowled nick at the serjeants elbow twitching his sleeve at the same time to attract attention serjeant know her fader he by i by when iroquois shoot him  i do not understand you tuscarora nor do i think you altogether understand us the less you say therefore the better for all parties it is our duty miss maud to say gods will be done and the soldier who dies in the discharge of his duty is never to be pitied i sincerely wish that the rev mr woods was here he would tell you all this in a manner that would admit of no dispute as for myself i am a plain man miss maud and my tongue cannot utter one half that my heart feels at this instant  ah joyce what a friendwhat a parent has it pleased god to call to himself  yes miss maud that may be said with great justiceif his honour has left us in obedience to general orders it is to meet promotion in a service that will never weary and never end  so kind so true so gentle so just so affectionate said maud wringing her hands  and so brave young lady his honour captain willoughby wasnt one of them that is always talking and writing and boasting about fighting but when anything was to be done the colonel always knew whom to send on the duty the army couldnt have lost a braver gentleman had he remained in it  oh my fathermy fathercried maud in bitterness of sorrow throwing herself on the body and embracing it as had been her wont in childhoodwould that i could have died for you  why you let go on so grumbled nick again no her faderyou know dat serjeant  joyce was not in a state to answer his own feelings had been kept in subjection only by military pride but they now had become so nearly uncontrollable that he found himself obliged to step a little aside in order to conceal his weakness as it was large tears trickled down his rugged face like water flowing from the fissures of the riven oak jamie allens constitutional prudence however now became active admonishing the party of the necessity of their getting within the protection of the hut  death is at a times awfu said the mason but it must befall young and auld alike and the affleection it brings cometh fra the heart and is a submission to the la o nature nevertheless we a hae our duties so lang as we remain in the flesh and it is time to be thinking o carryin the body into some place o safety while we hae a prudent regard to our ain conditions also  maud had risen and hearing this appeal she drew back meekly assumed a manner of forced composure and signed to the men to proceed on this intimation the body was raised and the melancholy procession resumed its march  for the purpose of concealment joyce led the way into the bed of the stream leaving maud waiting their movements a little deeper within the forest as soon as he and his fellowbearers were in the water joyce turned and desired nick to escort the young lady in again on dry land or by the path along which she had come out this said the serjeant and his companions proceeded maud stood gazing on the sad spectacle like one entranced until she felt a sleeve pulled and perceived the tuscarora at her side  no go to hut said nick earnestly go wid wyandott√©  not follow my dear fathers remainsnot go to my beloved mother in her anguish you know not what you ask indianmove and let me proceed  no go homeno useno good capin deadwhat do widout commander come wid wyandott√©find majorden do some good  maud fairly started in her surprise there seemed something so truly useful so consoling so dear in this proposal that it instantly caught her ear  find the major she answered is that possible nick my poor father perished in making that attemptwhat hope can there be then for my success  plenty hopemuch as wantall want come wid wyandott√©he great chiefshow young squaw where to find broder  here was a touch of nicks consummate art he knew the female bosom so well that he avoided any allusion to his knowledge of the real relation between robert willoughby and maud though he had so recently urged her want of natural affinity to the family as a reason why she should not grieve by keeping the major before her eyes as a brother the chances of his own success were greatly increased as for maud a tumult of feeling came over her heart at this extraordinary proposal to liberate bob to lead him into the hut to offer his manly protection to her mother and beulah and little evert at such an instant caught her imagination and appealed to all her affections  can you do this tuscarorashe asked earnestly pressing her hand on her heart as if to quiet its throbbings can you really lead me to major willoughby so that i may have some hope of liberating him  sartainyou go he come i go he no come dont love nicktink all injin one injintink one injin all injin you go he comehe stay find more knife and die like capin young squaw follow wyandott√© and see  maud needed no more to save the life of bob her wellbeloved he who had so long been beloved in secret she would have gone with one far less known and trusted than the tuscarora she made an eager gesture for him to proceed and they were soon on their way to the mill threading the mazes of the forest  nick was far from observing the precautions that had been taken by the captain in his unfortunate march out acquainted with every inch of ground in the vicinity of the dam and an eyewitness of the dispositions of the invaders he had no occasion for making the long d√©tour already described but went to work in a much more direct manner instead of circling the valley and the clearing to the westward he turned short in the contrary direction crossed the rivulet on the fallen tree and led the way along the eastern margin of the flats on this side of the valley he knew there were no enemies and the position of the huts and barns enabled him to follow a path that was just deep enough in the forest to conceal his movements by taking this course besides having the advantage of a clear and beaten path most of the way the tuscarora brought the whole distance within a mile  as for maud she asked no questions solicited no pauses manifested no physical weakness actively as the indian moved among the trees she kept close in his footsteps and she had scarcely begun to reflect on the real nature of the undertaking in which she was engaged when the roar of the rivulet and the formation of the land told her they had reached the edge of the glen below the mills here nick told her to remain stationary a moment while he advanced to a covered point of the rocks to reconnoitre this was the place where the indian had made his first observations of the invaders of the valley ascertaining their real character before he trusted his person among them on the present occasion his object was to see if all remained in and about the mills as when he had last left the spot  comesaid nick signing for maud to follow himwe gofools sleep and eat and talk major prisoner now half an hour major free  this was enough for the ardent devoted generoushearted maud she descended the path before her as swiftly as her guide could lead and in five more minutes they reached the bank of the stream in the glen at a point where a curvature hid the rivulet from those at the mill here an enormous pine had been laid across the torrent and flattened on its upper surface it made a secure bridge for those who were sure of foot and steady of eye nick glanced back at his companion as he stepped upon this bridge to ascertain if she were equal to crossing it a single glance sufficing to tell him apprehensions were unnecessary half a minute placed both in safety on the western bank  good muttered the indian young squaw make wife for warrior  but maud heard neither the compliment nor the expression of countenance which accompanied it she merely made an impatient gesture to proceed nick gazed intently at the excited girl and there was an instant when he seemed to waver in his own purpose but the gesture repeated caused him to turn and lead the way up the glen  the progress of nick now necessarily became more guarded and slower he was soon obliged to quit the common path and to incline to the left more against the side of the cliff for the purposes of concealment from the time he had struck the simple bridge until he took this precaution his course had lain along what might have been termed the common highway on which there was always the danger of meeting some messenger travelling to or from the valley  but nick was at no loss for paths there were plenty of them and the one he took soon brought him out into that by which captain willoughby had descended to the leanto when the spot was reached where joyce had halted nick paused and first listening intently to catch the sound of noises if any might happen to be in dangerous proximity he addressed his companion  young squaw bold he said encouragingly now want heart of warrior  i can follow nickhaving come so far why distrust me now  cause he heredown derewoman love man man love womandat right but no show it when scalp in danger  perhaps i do not understand you tuscarorabut my trust is in god he is a support that can uphold any weakness  goodstay herenick come back in minute  nick now descended to the passage between the rocks and the leanto in order to make certain that the major still remained in his prison before he incurred any unnecessary risk with maud of this fact he was soon assured after which he took the precaution to conceal the pool of blood by covering it with earth and stones making his other observations with care and placing the saw and chisel with the other tools that had fallen from the captains hand when he received his deathwound in a position to be handy he ascended the path and rejoined maud no word passed between our heroine and her guide the latter motioned for her to follow then he led the way down to the cabin soon both had entered the narrow passage and maud in obedience to a sign from her companion seated herself on the precise spot where her father had been found and where the knife had passed into his heart to all this however nick manifested the utmost indifference everything like ferocity had left his face to use his own figurative language his sores smarted no longer and the expression of his eye was friendly and gentle still it showed no signs of compunction      chapter xxvii                     her pallid face displayed   something methought surpassing mortal beauty   she presently turnd round and fixed her large wild eyes   brimming with tears upon me fetchd a sigh   as from a riven heart and cried hes dead    hillhouse  maud had been so earnest and so much excited that the scarcely reflected on the singularity and novelty of her situation until she was seated as described at the close of the last chapter then indeed she began to think that she had embarked in an undertaking of questionable prudence and to wonder in what manner she was to be useful still her heart did not fail her or her hopes altogether sink she saw that nick was grave and occupied like a man who intended to effect his purpose at every hazard and that purpose she firmly believed was the liberation of robert willoughby  as for nick the instant his companion was seated and he had got a position to his mind he set about his business with great assiduity it has been said that the leanto like the cabin was built of logs a fact that constituted the security of the prisoner the logs of the leanto however were much smaller than those of the body of the house and both were of the common white pine of the country a wood of durable qualities used as it was here but which yielded easily to edged tools nick had a small saw a large chisel and his knife with the chisel he cautiously commenced opening a hole of communication with the interior by removing a little of the mortar that filled the interstices between the logs this occupied but a moment when effected nick applied an eye to the hole and took a look within he muttered the word good then withdrew his own eye and by a sign invited maud to apply one of hers this our heroine did and saw robert willoughby reading within a few feet of her with a calmness of air that at once announced his utter ignorance of the dire event that had so lately occurred almost within reach of his arm  squaw speak whispered nick voice sweet as wrengo to majors ear like song of birdsquaw speak music to young warrior  maud drew back her heart beat violently her breathing became difficult and the blood rushed to her temples but an earnest motion from nick reminded her this was no time for hesitation and she applied her mouth to the hole  robertdear robert she said in a loud whisper we are herehave come to release you  mauds impatience could wait no longer but her eye immediately succeeded her mouth that she was heard was evident from the circumstance that the book fell from the majors hand in a way to show how completely he was taken by surprise he knows even my whispers thought maud her heart beating still more violently as she observed the young soldier gazing around him with a bewildered air like one who fancied he had heard the whisperings of some ministering angel by this time nick had removed a long piece of the mortar and he too was looking into the buttery by way of bringing matters to an understanding the indian thrust the chisel through the opening and moving it he soon attracted willoughbys attention the latter instantly advanced and applied his own eye to the wide crack catching a view of the swarthy face of nick  willoughby knew that the presence of this indian at such a place and under such circumstances indicated the necessity of caution he did not speak therefore but first making a significant gesture towards the door of his narrow prison thus intimating the close proximity of sentinels he demanded the object of this visit in a whisper  come to set major free answered nick  can i trust you tuscarora sometimes you seem a friend sometimes an enemy i know that you appear to be on good terms with my captors  dat goodinjin know how to look two waywarrior must if great warrior  i wish i had some proof nick that you are dealing with me in good faith  call dat proof den growled the savage seizing mauds little land and passing it through the opening before the startled girl was fully aware of what he meant to do  willoughby knew the hand at a glance he would have recognised it in that forest solitude by its symmetry and whiteness its delicacy and its fullness but one of the taper fingers wore a ring that of late maud had much used being a diamond hoop that she had learned was a favourite ornament of her real mothers it is not surprising therefore that he seized the pledge that was thus strangely held forth and had covered it with kisses before maud had presence of mind sufficient or strength to reclaim it this she would not do however at such a moment without returning all the proofs of ardent affection that were lavished on her own hand by giving a gentle pressure to the one in which it was clasped  this is so strange maudso every way extraordinary that i know not what to think the young man whispered soon as he could get a glimpse of the face of the sweet girl why are you here beloved and in such company  you will trust me bobnick comes as your friend aid him all you can now and be silent when free then will be the time to learn all  a sign of assent succeeded and the major withdrew a step in order to ascertain the course nick meant to pursue by this time the indian was at work with his knife and he soon passed the chisel in to the prisoner who seized it and commenced cutting into the logs at a point opposite to that where the tuscarora was whittling away the wood the object was to introduce the saw and it required some labour to effect such a purpose by dint of application however and by cutting the log above as well as that below sufficient space was obtained in the course of a few minutes nick then passed the saw in through the opening it exceeding his skill to use such a tool with readiness  by this time willoughby was engaged with the earnestness and zeal of the captive who catches a glimpse of liberty notwithstanding he proceeded intelligently and with caution the blanket given him by his captors as a pallet was hanging from a nail and he took the precaution to draw this mil and to place it above the spot selected for the cut that he might suspend the blanket so as to conceal what he was at in the event of a visit from without when all was ready and the blanket was properly placed he began to make long heavy strokes with the tool in a way to deaden the sound this was a delicate operation but the works being done behind the blanket had some effect in lessening the noise as the work proceeded willoughbys hopes increased and he was soon delighted to hear from nick that it was time to insert the saw in another place success is apt to induce carelessness and as the task proceeded willoughbys arm worked with greater rapidity until a noise at the door gave the startling information that he was about to be visited there was just time to finish the last cut and to let the blanket fall before the door opened the sawdust and chips had all been carefully removed as the work proceeded and of these none were left to betray the secret  there might have been a quarter of a minute between the moment when willoughby seated himself with his book in his hand and that in which the door opened short as was this interval it sufficed for nick to remove the piece of log last cut and to take away the handle of the saw the latter change permitting the blanket to hang so close against the logs as completely to conceal the hole the sentinel who appeared was an indian in externals but a dull white countryman in fact and character  i thought i heard the sound of a saw major he said listlessly yet everything looks quiet and in its place here  where should i get such a tool willoughby coolly replied and what is there here to saw  twas as natral too as the carpenter himself could make it in sound  possibly the mill has been set in motion by some of your idlers and you have heard the large saw which at a distance may sound like a smaller one near by  the man looked incredulously at his prisoner for a moment then he drew to the door with the air of one who was determined to assure himself of the truth calling aloud as he did so to one of his companions to join him willoughby knew that no time was to be lost in halfa minute he had passed the hole dropped the blanket before it had circled the slender waist of maud with one arm and was shoving aside the bushes with the other as he followed nick from the straitened passage between the leanto and the rock the major seemed more bent on bearing maud from the spot than on saving himself her feet scarce touched the ground as he ascended to the place where joyce had halted here nick stood an instant with a finger raised in intense listening his practised ears caught the sound of voices in the leanto then scarce fifty feet distant men called to each other by name and then a voice directly beneath them proclaimed that a head was already thrust through the hole  here is your saw and here is its workmanship exclaimed this voice  and here is blood too said another see the ground has been a pool beneath those stones  maud shuddered as if the soul were leaving its earthly tenement and willoughby signed impatiently for nick to proceed but the savage for a brief instant seemed bewildered the danger below however increased and evidently drew so near that he turned and glided up the ascent presently the fugitives reached the descending path that diverged from the larger one they were on and by which nick and maud had so recently come diagonally up this cliff nick leaped into it and then the intervening bushes concealed their persons from any who might continue on the upward course there was an open space however a little lower down and the quickwitted savage came to a stand under a close cover believing flight to be useless should their pursuers actually follow on their heels  the halt had not been made halfadozen seconds when the voices of the party ascending in chase were heard above the fugitives willoughby felt an impulse to dash down the path bearing maud in his arms but nick interposed his own body to so rash a movement there was not time for a discussion and the sounds of voices speaking english too distinctly to pass for any but those of men of english birth or english origin were heard disputing about the course to be taken at the point of junction between the two paths  go by the lower called out one from the rear he will run down the stream and make for the settlements on the hudson once before he has done this as i know from strides himself  dn strides answered another more in front he is a sniveling scoundrel who loves liberty as a hog loves corn for the sake of good living i say go the upper which will carry him on the heights and bring him out near his fathers garrison  here are marks of feet on the upper observed a third though they seem to be coming down instead of going up the hill  it is the trail of the fellows who have helped him to escape push up the hill and we shall have them all in ten minutes push uppush up  this decided the matter it appeared to willoughby that at least a dozen men ran up the path above his head eager in the pursuit and anticipating success nick waited no longer but glided down the cliff and was soon in the broad path which led along the margin of the stream and was the ordinary thoroughfare in going to or from the knoll here the fugitives as on the advance were exposed to the danger of accidental meetings but fortunately no one was met or seen and the bridge was passed in safety turning short to the north nick plunged into the woods again following the cowpath by which he had so recently descended to the glen no pause was made even here willoughby had an arm round the waist of maud and bore her forward with a rapidity to which her own strength was altogether unequal in less than ten minutes from the time the prisoner had escaped the fugitives reached the level of the rock of the waterfall or that of the plain of the dam as it was reasonably certain that none of the invaders had passed to that side of the valley haste was no longer necessary and maud was permitted to pause for breath  the halt was short however our heroine herself now feeling as if the major could not be secure until he was fairly within the palisades in vain did willoughby try to pacify her fears and to assure her of his comparative safety mauds nerves were excited and then she had the dreadful tidings which still remained to be told pressing upon her spirits and quickening all her natural impulses and sentiments  nick soon made the signal to proceed and then the three began to circle the flats as mentioned in the advance of maud and her companion when they reached a favourable spot the indian once more directed a halt intimating his own intention to move to the margin of the woods in order to reconnoitre both his companions heard this announcement with satisfaction for willoughby was eager to say to maud directly that which he had so plainly indicated by means of the box and to extort from her a confession that she was not offended while maud herself felt the necessity of letting the major know the melancholy circumstance that yet remained to be told with these widely distinct feelings uppermost our two lovers saw nick quit them each impatient restless and uneasy  willoughby had found a seat for maud on a log and he now placed himself at her side and took her hand pressing it silently to his heart  nick has then been a true man dearest maud he said notwithstanding all my doubts and misgivings of him  yes he gave me to understand you would hardly trust him and that was the reason i was induced to accompany him we both thought bob you would confide in me  bless youbless youbeloved maudbut have you seen mikehas he had any interview with youin a word did he deliver you my box  mauds feelings had been so much excited that the declaration of willoughbys love precious as it was to her heart failed to produce the outward signs that are usually exhibited by the delicate and sensitive of her sex when they listen to the insinuating language for the first time her thoughts were engrossed with her dreadful secret and with the best and least shocking means of breaking it to the major the tint on her cheek therefore scarce deepened as this question was put to her while her eye full of earnest tenderness still remained riveted on the face of her companion  i have seen mike dear bob she answered with a steadiness that had its rise in her singleness of purposeand he has shown me given me the box  but have you understood me maudyou will remember that box contained the great secret of my life  this i well rememberyes the box contains the great secret of your life  butyou cannot have understood me maudelse would you not look so unconcernedso vacantlyi am not understood and am miserable  nononointerrupted maud hurriedlyi understand all you have wished to say and you have no cause to be mauds voice became choked for she recollected the force of the blow that she had in reserve  this is so strangealtogether so unlike your usual manner maud that there must be some mistake the box contained nothing but your own hair dearest  yes nothing else it was my hair i knew it the instant i saw it  and did it tell you no secretwhy was beulahs hair not with it why did i cherish your hair maud and yours alone you have not understood me  i have dear dear bobyou love meyou wished to say we are not brother and sister in truth that we have an affection that is far strongerone that will bind us together for life do not look so wretched bob i understand everything you wish to say  this is so very extraordinaryso unlike yourself maud i know not what to make of it i sent you that box beloved one to say that you had my whole heart that i thought of you day and night that you were the great object of my existence and that while misery would be certain without you felicity would be just as certain with you in a word that i love you maud and can never love another  yes so i understood you bobmaud spite of her concentration of feeling on the dreadful secret could not refrain from blushingit was too plain to be mistaken  and how was my declaration received tell me at once dear girl with your usual truth of character and franknesscan you will you love me in return  this was a home question and on another occasion it might have produced a scene of embarrassment and hesitation but maud was delighted with the idea that it was in her power to break the violence of the blow she was about to inflict by setting robert willoughbys mind at ease on this great point  i do love you bob she said with fervent affection beaming in every lineament of her angel facehave loved you for yearshow could it be otherwise i have scarce seen any other to love and how see you and refrain  blessed blessed maudbut this is so strangei fear you do not understand mei am not speaking of such affection as beulah bears me as brother and sister feel i speak of the love that my mother bore my fatherof the love of man and wife  a groan from maud stopped the vehement young man who received his companion in his arms as she bowed her head on his bosom half fainting  is this resentment dearest or is it consent he asked bewildered by all that passed  oh bobfatherfatherfather  my fatherwhat of him maud why has the allusion to him brought you to this state  they have killed him dearest dearest bob and you must now be father husband brother son all in one we have no one left but you  a long pause succeeded the shock was terrible to robert willoughby but he bore up against it like a man mauds incoherent and unnatural manner was now explained and while unutterable tenderness of mannera tenderness that was increased by what had just passedwas exhibited by each to the other no more was said of love a common grief appeared to bind their hearts closer together but it was unnecessary to dwell on their mutual affection in words robert willoughbys sorrow mingled with that of maud and as he folded her to his heart their faces were literally bathed in each others tears  it was some time before willoughby could ask or maud give an explanation then the latter briefly recounted all she knew her companion listening with the closest attention the son thought the occurrence as extraordinary as it was afflicting but there was not leisure for inquiry  it was perhaps fortunate for our lovers that nicks employment kept him away for nearly ten minutes longer did he continue absent then he returned slowly thoughtful and possibly a little disturbed at the sound of his footstep willoughby released maud from his arms and both assumed an air of as much tranquillity as the state of their feelings would allow  better marchsaid nick in his sententious mannermohawk very mad  do you see the signs of this asked the major scarce knowing what he said  alway make injin mad lose scalp prisoner run away carry scalp with him  i rather think nick you do my captors injustice so far from desiring anything so cruel they treated me well enough considering the circumstances and that we are in the woods  yes spare scalp cause tink rope ready nebber trust mohawkall bad injin  to own the truth one of the great failings of the savages of the american forests was to think of the neighbouring tribes as the englishman is known to think of the frenchman and vice versa as the german thinks of both and all think of the yankee in a word his own tribe contains everything that is excellent with the pawnee the osage and pottawattomie as paris contains all that is perfect in the eyes of the bourgeois london in those of the cockney and this virtuous republic in those of its own enlightened citizens while the hostile communities are remorselessly given up to the tender solicitude of those beings which lead nations as well as individuals into the sinks of perdition thus nick liberalized as his mind had comparatively become by intercourse with the whites still retained enough of the impressions of childhood to put the worst construction on the acts of all his competitors and the best on his own in this spirit then he warned his companions against placing any reliance on the mercy of the mohawks  major wilioughby however had now sufficient inducements to move without reference to the hostile intentions of his late captors that his escape would excite a malignant desire for vengeance he could easily believe but his mother his revered heartbroken mother and the patient afflicted beulah were constantly before him and gladly did he press on maud leaning on his arm the instant nick led the way to say that the lovely confiding being who clung to his side as the vine inclines to the tree was forgotten or that he did not retain a vivid recollection of all that she had so ingenuously avowed in his favour would not be rigidly accurate though the hopes thus created shone in the distance under the present causes of grief as the suns rays illumine the depths of the heavens while his immediate face is entirely hidden by an eclipse  did you see any signs of a movement against the house nick demanded the major when the three had been busily making their way for several minutes round the margin of the forest  the tuscarora turned nodded his head and glanced at maud  speak frankly wyandott√©  good interrupted the indian with emphasis assuming a dignity of manner the major had never before witnessed wyandott√© comenick gone away altogeder nebber see sassy nick agin at dam  i am glad to hear this tuscarora and as maud says you may speak plainly  tink den best be ready mohawk feel worse dan if he lose ten tree six scalp injin know injin feelin paleface cant stop red skin when blood get up  press on then wyandott√© for the sake of godlet me at least die in defence of my beloved mother  moder gooddoctor tuscarora when death grin in face she my moder too  this was said energetically and in a manner to assure his listeners that they had a firm ally in this warlike savage little did either dream at that instant that this same wayward beingthe creature of passion and the fierce avenger of all his own fancied griefs was the cause of the dreadful blow that had so recently fallen on them  the sun still wanted an hour of setting when nick brought his companions to the fallen tree by which they were again to cross the rivulet here he paused pointing to the roofs of the hut which were then just visible through the trees as much as to say that his duty as a guide was done  thank you wyandott√© said willoughby if it be the will of god to carry us safely through the crisis you shall be well rewarded for this service  wyandott√© chiefwant no dollar been injin runnernow be injin warrior major followsquaw followmohawk in hurry  this was enough nick passed out of the forest on a swift walkbut for the female it would have been his customary loping trotfollowed by willoughby his arm again circling the waist of maud whom he bore along scarce permitting her light form to touch the earth at this instant four or five conches sounded in the direction of the mills and along the western margin of the meadows blast seemed to echo blast then the infernal yell known as the warwhoop was heard all along the opposite face of the buildings judging from the sounds the meadows were alive with assailants pressing on for the palisades  at this appalling moment joyce appeared on the ridge of the roof shouting in a voice that might have been heard to the farthest point in the valley  stand to your arms my men he cried here the scoundrels come hold your fire until they attempt to cross the stockade  to own the truth there was a little bravado in this mingled with the stern courage that habit and nature had both contributed to lend the serjeant the veteran knew the feebleness of his garrison and fancied that warlike cries from himself might counterbalance the yells that were now rising from all the fields in front of the house  as for nick and the major they pressed forward too earnest and excited to speak the former measured the distance by his ear and thought there was still time to gain a cover if no moment was lost to reach the foot of the cliff took just a minute to ascend to the hole in the palisade half as much time and to pass it a quarter maud was dragged ahead as much as she ran and the period when the three were passing swiftly round to the gate was pregnant with imminent risk they were seen and fifty rifles were discharged as it might be at a command the bullets pattered against the logs of the hut and against the palisades but no one was hurt the voice of willoughby opened the gate and the next instant the three were within the shelter of the court      chapter xxviii    they have not perishdno   kind words remembered voices once so sweet   smiles radiant long ago   and features the great souls apparent seat    all shall come back each tie   of pure affection shall be knit again   alone shall evil die   and sorrow dwell a prisoner in thy reign    and then shall i behold   him by whose kind paternal side i sprung   and her who still and cold   fills the next gravethe beautiful and young    bryants past  the scene that followed passed like a hurricane sweeping over the valley joyce had remained on the ridge of the roof animating his little garrison and endeavouring to intimidate his enemies to the last moment the volley of bullets had reached the palisades and the buildings and he was still unharmed but the sound of the majors voice below and the cry that miss maud and nick were at the gate produced a sudden change in all his dispositions for the defence the serjeant ran below himself to report and receive his orders from the new commander while all the negroes females as well as males rushed down into the court to meet their young master and mistress  it is not easy to describe the minute that succeeded after willoughby and maud were surrounded by the blacks the delight of these untutored beings was in proportion to their recent sorrow the death of their master and the captivity of master bob and miss maud had appeared to them like a general downfall of the family of willoughby but here was a revival of its hopes that came as unexpectedly as its previous calamities amid the clamour cries tears lamentations and bursts of uncontrollable delight joyce could scarce find a moment in which to discharge his duty  i see how it is serjeant exclaimed willoughby the assault is now making and you desire orders  there is not an instant to lose major willoughby the enemy are at the palisades already and there is no one at his station but jamie and young blodget  to your posts mento your posts everybody the house shall be made good at all hazards for gods sake joyce give me arms i feel that my fathers wrongs are to be revenged  robertdear dear robert said maud throwing her arms on his shoulders this is no moment for such bitter feelings defend us as i know you will but defend us like a christian  one kiss was all that the time allowed and maud rushed into the house to seek her mother and beulah feeling as if the tidings of bobs return might prove some little alleviation to the dreadful blow under which they must be suffering  as for willoughby he had no time for pious efforts at consolation the hut was to be made good against a host of enemies and the cracking of rifles from the staging and the fields announced that the conflict had begun in earnest joyce handed him a rifle and together they ascended rapidly to the roofs here they found jamie allen and blodget loading and firing as fast as they could and were soon joined by all the negroes seven men were now collected on the staging and placing three in front and two on each wing the majors dispositions were made moving himself incessantly to whatever point circumstances called mike who knew little of the use of firearms was stationed at the gate as porter and warder  it was so unusual a thing for savages to attack by daylight unless they could resort to surprise that the assailants were themselves a little confused the assault was made under a sudden feeling of resentment at the escape of the prisoner and contrary to the wishes of the principal white men in the party though the latter were dragged in the train of events and had to seem to countenance that of which they really disapproved these sudden outbreakings were sufficiently common in indian warfare and often produced memorable disasters on the present occasion however the most that could occur was a repulse and to this the leaders demagogues who owed their authority to the excesses and necessities of the times were fain to submit should it happen  the onset had been fierce and too unguarded the moment the volley was fired at the major the assailants broke cover and the fields were alive with men this was the instant when the defence was left to allen and blodget else might the exposure have cost the enemy dear as it was the last brought down one of the boldest of the indians while the mason fired with good will though with less visible effect the yell that followed this demonstration of the apparent force of the garrison was a wild mixture of anger and exultation and the rush at the palisades was general and swift as willoughby posted his reinforcement the stockade was alive with men some ascending some firing from its summit some aiding others to climb and one falling within the enclosure a second victim to blodgets unerring aim  the volley that now came from the roofs staggered the savages most of whom fell outward and sought cover in their usual quick and dexterous manner three or four however thought it safer to fall within the palisades seeking safety immediately under the sides of the buildings the view of these men who were perfectly safe from the fire of the garrison so long as the latter made no sortie gave an idea to those without and produced what had hitherto been wanting something like order and concert in the attack the firing now became desultory and watchful on both sides the attacking party keeping themselves covered by the trees and fences as well as they could while the garrison only peered above the ridge of the roof as occasions required  the instant the outbreak occurred all the cidevant dependants of captain willoughby who had deserted abandoned their various occupations in the woods and fields collecting in and around the cabins in the midst of their wives and children joel alone was not to be seen he had sought his friends among the leaders of the party behind a stack of hay at a respectful distance from the house and to which there was a safe approach by means of the rivulet and its fringe of bushes the little council that was held at this spot took place just as the halfdozen assailants who had fallen within the palisades were seen clustering along under the walls of the buildings  natur gives you a hint how to conduct observed joel pointing out this circumstance to his principal companions as they all lay peering over the upper portions of the stack at the hut you see them men under the eavestheyre a plaguy sight safer up there than we be down here and if twerent for the look of the thing i wish i was with em that house will never be taken without a desperate sight of fightin for the captain is an old warrior and seems to like to snuff gunpowderthe reader will understand none knew of the veterans death but those in the houseand wont be for givin up while he has a charge left if i had twenty menno thirty would be better where these fellows be i think the place could be carried in a few minutes and then liberty would get its rights and your monarchymen would be put down as they all desarve  what do then demanded the leading mohawk in his abrupt guttural english no shootcant kill log  no chief thats reasonable an ongainsayable too but only one half the inner gate is hung and ive contrived matters so on purpose that the props of the half that isnt on the hinges can be undone all the same as onlatching the door if i only had the right man here now the business should be done and that speedily  go self answered the mohawk not without an expression of distrust and contempt  every man to his callin chief my trade is peace and politics and liberty while yours is war howsever i can put you and them that likes fightin on the trail and then well see how matters can be done mortality how them desperate devils on the roof do keep blazin away it wouldnt surprise me if they shot somebody or get hurt themselves  such were the deliberations of joel strides on a battle the indian leaders however gave some of their ordinary signals to bring their young men more under command and sending messengers with orders in different directions they left the haystack compelling joel to accompany them  the results of these movements were soon apparent the most daring of the mohawks made their way into the rivulet north of the buildings and were soon at the foot of the cliff a little reconnoitring told them that the hole which joel had pointed out had not been closed since the entrance of willoughby and his companions led by their chief the warriors stole up the ascent and began to crawl through the same inlet which had served as an outlet to so many deserters the previous night accompanied by their wives and children  the indians in front had been ordered to occupy the attention of the garrison while this movement was in the course of execution at a signal they raised a yell unmasked them fired one volley and seemed to make another rush at the works this was the instant chosen for the passage of the hole and the seven leading savages effected their entrance within the stockade with safety the eighth man was shot by blodget in the hole itself the body was instantly withdrawn by the legs and all in the rear fell back under the cover of the cliff  willoughby now understood the character of the assault stationing joyce with a party to command the hole he went himself into the library accompanied by jamie and blodget using a necessary degree of caution fortunately the windows were raised and a sudden volley routed all the indians who had taken shelter beneath the rocks these men however fled no further than the rivulet where they rallied under cover of the bushes keeping up a dropping fire at the windows for several minutes the combat was confined to this spot willoughby by often shifting from window to window along the rear of the house getting several volleys that told at the men under the cover  as yet all the loss had been on the side of the assailants though several of the garrison including both willoughby and joyce had divers exceedingly narrow escapes quite a dozen of the assailants had suffered though only four were killed outright by this time the assault had lasted an hour and the shades of evening were closing around the place daniel the miller had been sent by joel to spring the mine they had prepared together but making the mistake usual with the uninitiated he had hung back to let others pass the hole first and was consequently carried down in the crowd within the cover of the bushes of the rivulet  willoughby had a short consultation with joyce and then he set seriously about the preparations necessary for a light defence by a little management and some persona risk the bulletproof shutters of the north wing of the hut were all closed rendering the rear of the buildings virtually impregnable when this was done and the gates of the area were surely shut the place was like a ship in a gale under short canvass and hoveto the enemy within the palisades were powerless to all appearance the walls of stone preventing anything like an application of fire of the last however there was a little danger on the roof the indians frequently using arrows for this purpose and water was placed on the staging in readiness to be used on occasion  all these preparations occupied some time and it was quite dark ere they were completed then willoughby had a moment for reflection the firing having entirely ceased and nothing further remaining to do  we are safe for the present joyce the major observed as he and the serjeant stood together on the staging after having consulted on the present aspect of things and i have a solemn duty yet to perform my dear motherand the body of my father  yes sir i would not speak of either so long as it was your honours pleasure to remain silent on the subject madam willoughby is sorely cut down as you may imagine sir and as for my gallant old commander he died in his harness as a soldier should  where have you taken the bodyhas my mother seen it  lord bless you sir madam willoughby had his honour carried into her own room and there she and miss beulahso all of the hut still called the wife of evert beekmanshe and miss beulah kneel and pray and weep as you know sir ladies will whenever anything severe comes over their feelingsgod bless them both we all say and think ay and pray too in our turns sir  very well joyce even a soldier may drop a tear over the dead body of his own father god only knows what this night will bring forth and i may never have a moment as favourable as this for discharging so solemn a duty  yes your honourjoyce fancied that the major had succeeded to this appellation by the decease of the captainyes your honour the commandments that the rev mr woods used to read to us of a sunday tell us all about that and it is quite as much the duty of a christian to mind the commandments i do suppose as it is for a soldier to obey orders god bless you sir and carry you safe through the affair i had a touch of it with miss maud myself and know what it is its bad enough to lose an old commander in so sudden a way like without having to feel what has happened in company with so sweet ladies as these we have in the house as for these blackguards down inside the works let them give you no uneasiness it will be light work for us to keep them busy compared to what your honour has to do  it would seem by the saddened manner in which willoughby moved away that he was of the same way of thinking as the serjeant on this melancholy subject the moment however was favourable for the object and delay could not be afforded then willoughbys disposition was to console his mother even while he wept with her over the dead body of him they had lost  notwithstanding the wild uproar that had so prevailed not only without but within the place the portion of the house that was occupied by the widowed matron and her daughters was silent as the grave all the domestics were either on the staging or at the loops leaving the kitchens and offices deserted the major first entered a little antechamber that opened between a storeroom and the apartment usually occupied by his mother this being the ordinary means of approach to her room here he paused and listened quite a minute in the hope of catching some sound from within that might prepare him for the scene he was to meet not a whisper a moan or a sob could be heard and he ventured to tap lightly at the door this was unheeded waiting another minute as much in dread as in respect he raised the latch with some such awe as one would enter into a tomb of some beloved one a single lamp let him into the secrets of this solemn place  in the centre of the room lay stretched on a large table the manly form of the author of his being the face was uppermost and the limbs had been laid in decent order as is usual with the dead that have been cared for no change had been made in the dress however the captain lying in the huntingshirt in which he had sallied forth the crimson tint which disfigured one breast having been sedulously concealed by the attention of great smash the passage from life to eternity had been so sudden as to leave the usual benignant expression on the countenance of the corpse the paleness which had succeeded the fresh ruddy tint of nature alone denoting that the sleep was not a sweet repose but that of death  the body of his father was the first object that met the gaze of the major he advanced leaned forward kissed the marblelike forehead with reverence and groaned in the effort to suppress an unmanly outbreaking of sorrow then he turned to seek the other wellbeloved faces there sat beulah in a corner of the room as if to seek shelter for her infant folding that infant to her heart keeping her look riveted in anguish on the inanimate form that she had ever loved beyond a daughters love even the presence of her brother scarce drew a glance away from the sad spectacle though when it at length did the youthful matron bowed her face down to that of her child and wept convulsively she was nearest to the major who moved to her side and kissed the back of her neck with kind affection the meaning was understood and beulah while unable to look up extended a hand to meet the fraternal pressure it received  maud was near kneeling at the side of the bed her whole attitude denoted the abstraction of a mind absorbed in worship and solicitation though willoughbys heart yearned to raise her in his arms to console her and bid her lean on himself in future for her earthly support he too much respected her present occupation to break in upon it with any irreverent zeal of his own his eye turned from this loved object therefore and hurriedly looked for his mother  the form of mrs willoughby had escaped the first glances of her son in consequence of the position in which she had placed herself the stricken wife was in a corner of the room her person partly concealed by the drapery of a windowcurtain though this was evidently more the effect of accident than of design willoughby started as he caught the first glance of his beloved parents face and he felt a chill pass over his whole frame there she sat upright motionless tearless without any of the alleviating weaknesses of a less withering grief her mild countenance exposed to the light of the lamp and her eyes riveted on the face of the dead in this posture had she remained for hours no tender cares on the part of her daughters no attentions from her domestics no outbreaking of her own sorrows producing any change even the clamour of the assault had passed by her like the idle wind  my mothermy poordearheartbroken mother burst from willoughby at this sight and he stepped quickly forward and knelt at her feet  but bobthe darling bobhis mothers pride and joy was unheeded the heart which had so long beaten for others only which never seemed to feel a wish or a pulsation but in the service of the objects of its affection was not sufficiently firm to withstand the blow that had lighted on it so suddenly enough of life remained however to support the frame for a while and the will still exercised its power over the mere animal functions her son shut out the view of the body and she motioned him aside with an impatience of manner he had never before witnessed from the same quarter inexpressibly shocked the major took her hands by gentle compulsion covering them with kisses and literally bathing them in tears  oh motherdearest dearest mother he cried will you notdo you not know merobertbobyour muchindulged grateful affectionate son if father is gone into the immediate presence of the god he revered and served i am still left to be a support to your declining years lean on me mother next to your father in heaven  will he ever get up robert whispered the widowed mother you speak too loud and may rouse him before his time he promised me to bring you back and he ever kept his promises he had a long march and is weary see how sweetly he sleeps  robert willoughby bowed his head to his mothers knees and groaned aloud when he raised his face again he saw the arms of maud elevated towards heaven as if she would pluck down that consolation for her mother that her spirit was so fervently asking of the almighty then he gazed into the face of his mother again hoping to catch a gleam of some expression and recognition that denoted more of reason it was in vain the usual placidity the usual mild affection were there but both were blended with the unnatural halo of a mind excited to disease if not to madness a slight exclamation which sounded like alarm came from beulah and turning towards his sister willoughby saw that she was clasping evert still closer to her bosom with her eyes now bent on the door looking in the direction of the latter he perceived that nick had stealthily entered the room  the unexpected appearance of wyandott√© might well alarm the youthful mother he had applied his warpaint since entering the hut and this though it indicated an intention to fight in defence of the house left a picture of startling aspect there was nothing hostile intended by this visit however nick had come not only in amity but in a kind concern to see after the females of the family who had ever stood high in his friendship notwithstanding the tremendous blow he had struck against their happiness but he had been accustomed to see those close distinctions drawn between individuals and colours and the other proprieties admitted would not have hesitated about consoling the widow with the offer of his own hand major willoughby understanding from the manner of the indian the object of his visit suffered him to pursue his own course in the hope it might rouse his mother to a better consciousness of objects around her  nick walked calmly up to the table and gazed at the face of his victim with a coldness that proved he felt no compunction still he hesitated about touching the body actually raising his hand as if with that intent and then withdrawing it like one stung by conscience willoughby noted the act and for the first time a shadowy suspicion glanced on his mind maud had told him all she knew of the manner of his fathers death and old distrusts began to revive though so faintly as to produce no immediate results  as for the indian the hesitating gesture excepted the strictest scrutiny or the keenest suspicion could have detected no signs of feeling the senseless form before him was not less moved than he appeared to be so far as the human eye could penetrate wyandott√© was unmoved he believed that in curing the sores on his own back in this particular manner he had done what became a tuscarora warrior and a chief let not the selfstyled christians of civilized society affect horror at this instance of savage justice so long as they go the whole length of the law of their several communities in avenging their own fancied wrongs using the dagger of calumny instead of the scalpingknife and rending and tearing their victims by the agency of gold and power like so many beasts of the field in all the forms and modes that legal vindictiveness will either justify or tolerate often exceeding those broad limits indeed and seeking impunity behind perjuries and frauds  nicks examination of the body was neither hurried nor agitated when it was over he turned calmly to consider the daughters of the deceased  why you crywhy you feard he said approaching beulah and placing his swarthy hand on the head of her sleeping infantgood squawgood pappoose wyandott√© take care em in woods byemby go to paleface town and sleep quiet  this was rudely said but it was well meant beulah so received it and she endeavoured to smile her gratitude in the face of the very being from whom more than from all of earth she would have turned in horror could her mental vision have reached the fearful secret that lay buried in his own bosom the indian understood her look and making a gesture of encouragement he moved to the side of the woman whom his own hand had made a widow  the appearance of wyandott√© produced no change in the look or manner of the matron the indian took her hand and spoke  squaw berry good he said with emphasis why look so sorry capin gone to happy huntinground of his people all good derechief time come must go  the widow knew the voice and by some secret association it recalled the scenes of the past producing a momentary revival of her faculties  nick you are my friend she said earnestly go speak to him and see if you can wake him up  the indian fairly started as he heard this strange proposal the weakness lasted only for a moment however and he became as stoical in appearance at least as before  no he said squaw quit capin now warrior go on last path all aloneno want companionshe look at grave now and den and be happy  happy echoed the widow what is that nickwhat is happy my son it seems a dreami must have known what it was but i forget it all now oh it was cruel cruel cruel to stab a husband and a fatherwasnt it robertwhat say you nickshall i give you more medicineyoull die indian unless you take itmind what a christian woman tells you and be obedienthere let me hold the cupthere now youll live  nick recoiled an entire step and gazed at the still beautiful victim of his ruthless revenge in a manner no one had ever before noted in his mien his mixed habits left him in ignorance of no shade of the fearful picture before his eyes and he began better to comprehend the effects of the plow he had so hastily strucka blow meditated for years though given at length under a sudden and vehement impulse the widowed mother however was past noting these changes  nonononick she added hurriedly scarce speaking above a whisper do not awake him god will do that when he summons his blessed ones to the foot of his throne let us all lie down and sleep with him robert do you lie there at his side my noble noble boy beulah place little evert and yourself at the other side maud your place is by the head i will sleep at his feet while nick shall watch and let us know when it will be time to rise and pray  the general and intensealmost spellboundattention with which all in the room listened to these gentle but touching wanderings of a mind so single and pure was interrupted by yells so infernal and shrieks so wild and fearful that it seemed in sooth as if the last trump had sounded and men were passing forth from their graves to judgment willoughby almost leaped out of the room and maud followed to shut and bolt the door when her waist was encircled by the arm of nick and she found herself borne forward towards the din      chapter xxix    o time and death with certain pace   though still unequal hurrying on   oerturning in your awful race   the cot the palace and the throne    sands  maud had little leisure for reflection the yells and shrieks were followed by the cries of combatants and the crack of the rifle nick hurried her along at a rate so rapid that she had not breath to question or remonstrate until she found herself at the door of a small storeroom in which her mother was accustomed to keep articles of domestic economy that required but little space into this room nick thrust her and then she heard the key turn on her egress for a single moment wyandott√© stood hesitating whether he should endeavour to get mrs willoughby and her other daughter into the same place of security then judging of the futility of the attempt by the approach of the sounds within among which he heard the full manly voice of robert willoughby calling on the garrison to be firm he raised an answering yell to those of the mohawks the warwhoop of his tribe and plunged into the fray with the desperation of one who ran a muck and with the delight of a demon  in order to understand the cause of this sudden change it will be necessary to return a little in the order of time while willoughby was with his mother and sisters mike had charge of the gate the rest of the garrison was either at the loops or was stationed on the roofs as the darkness increased joel mustered sufficient courage to crawl through the hole and actually reached the gate without him it was found impossible to spring his mine and he had been prevailed on to risk this much on condition it should not be asked of him to do such violence to his feelings as to enter the court of a house in which he had seen so many happy days  the arrangement by which this traitor intended to throw a family upon the tender mercies of savages was exceedingly simple it will be remembered that only one leaf of the inner gate was hung the other being put in its place where it was sustained by a prop this prop consisted of a single piece of timber of which one end rested on the ground and the other on the centre of the gate the last being effectually prevented from slipping by pins of wood driven into the massive woodwork of the gate above its end the lower end of the prop rested against a fragment of rock that nature had placed at this particular spot as the work had been set up in a hurry it was found necessary to place wedges between the lower end of the prop and the rock in order to force the leaf properly into its groove without which it might have been canted to one side and of course easily overturned by the exercise of sufficient force from without  to all this arrangement joel had been a party and he knew as a matter of course its strong and its weak points seizing a favourable moment he had loosened the wedges leaving them in their places however but using the precaution to fasten a bit of small but strong cord to the most material one of the three which cord he buried in the dirt and led half round a stick driven into the earth quite near the wall and thence through a hole made by one of the hinges to the outer side of the leaf the whole had been done with so much care as to escape the vigilance of casual observers and expressly that the overseer might assist his friends in entering the place after he himself had provided for his own safety by flight the circumstance that no one trod on the side of the gateway where the unhung leaf stood prevented the halfburied cord from being disturbed by any casual footstep  as soon as joel reached the wall of the hut his first care was to ascertain if he were safe from missiles from the loops assured of this fact he stole round to the gate and had a consultation with the mohawk chief on the subject of springing the mine the cord was found in its place and hauling on it gently joel was soon certain that he had removed the wedge and that force might speedily throw down the unhung leaf still he proceeded with caution applying the point of a lever to the bottom of the leaf he hove it back sufficiently to be sure it would pass inside of its fellow and then he announced to the grave warrior who had watched the whole proceeding that the time was come to lend his aid  there were a dozen reckless whites in the cluster of savages collected at the gate and enough of these were placed at handspikes to effect the intended dislodgement the plan was this while poles were set against the upper portion of the leaf to force it within the line of the suspended part handspikes and crowbars of which a sufficiency had been provided by joels forethought were to be applied between the hinge edge and the wall to cast the whole over to the other side  unluckily mike had been left at the gate as the sentinel a more upfortunate selection could not have been made the truehearted fellow having so much selfconfidence and so little forethought as to believe the gates impregnable he had lighted a pipe and was smoking as tranquilly as he had ever done before in his daily indulgences of this character when the unhung leaf came tumbling in upon the side where he sat nothing saving his head but the upper edges lodging against the wall at the same moment a dozen indians leaped through the opening and sprang into the court raising the yells already described mike followed armed with his shillelah for his musket was abandoned in the surprise and he began to lay about him with an earnestness that in nowise lessened the clamour this was the moment when joyce nobly sustained by blodget and jamie allen poured a volley into the court from the roofs when the fray became general to this point had the combat reached when willoughby rushed into the open air followed a few instants later by nick  the scene that succeeded is not easily described it was a m√©l√©e in the dark illuminated at instants by the flashes of guns and rendered horrible by shrieks curses groans and whoops mike actually cleared the centre of the court where he was soon joined by willoughby when together they made a rush at a door and actually succeeded in gaining their own party on the roof it was not in nature for the young soldier to remain here however while his mother beulah and so far as he knew maud lay exposed to the savages below arnid a shower of bullets he collected his whole force and was on the point of charging into the court when the roll of a drum without brought everything to a stand young blodget who had displayed the ardour of a hero and the coolness of a veteran throughout the short fray sprang down the stairs unarmed at this sound passed through the astonished crowd in the court unnoticed and rushed to the outer gate he had barely time to unbar it when a body of troops marched through led by a tall manlylooking chief who was accompanied by one that the young man instantly recognised in spite of the darkness for mr woods in his surplice at the next moment the strangers had entered with military steadiness into the court to the number of at least fifty ranging themselves in order across its area  in the name of heaven who are you called out willoughby from a window speak at once or we fire  i am colonel beekman at the head of a regular force was the answer and if as i suspect you are major willoughby you know you are safe in the name of congress i command all good citizens to keep the peace or they will meet with punishment for their contumacy  this announcement ended the war beekman and willoughby grasping each others hands fervently at the next instant  oh beekman exclaimed the last at what a moment has god sent you hither heaven be praised notwithstanding all that has happened you will find your wife and child safe place sentinels at both gates for treachery has been at work here and i shall ask for rigid justice  softlysoftlymy good fellow answered beekman pressing his hand your own position is a little delicate and we must proceed with moderation i learned just in time that a party was coming hither bent on mischief and obtaining the necessary authority i hastened to the nearest garrison obtained a company and commenced my march as soon as possible had we not met with mr woods travelling for the settlements in quest of succour we might have been too late as it was god be praisedi think we have arrived in season  such were the facts the indians had repelled the zealous chaplain as a madman compelling him to take the route toward the settlements however their respect for this unfortunate class of beings rendering them averse to his rejoining their enemies he could and did impart enough to beekman to quicken his march and to bring him and his followers up to the gate at a time when a minute might have cost the entire garrison their lives  anxious as he was to seek beulah and his child beekman had a soldiers duties to perform and those he would not neglect the sentinels were posted and orders issued to light lanterns and to make a fire in the centre of the court so that the actual condition of the field of battle might be ascertained a surgeon had accompanied beekmans party and he was already at work so far as the darkness would allow many hands being employed and combustibles easy to be found ere long the desired light was gleaming on the terrible spectacle  a dozen bodies wexre stretched in the court of which three or four were fated never to rise again in life of the rest no less than four had fallen with broken heads inflicted by ohearns shillelah though these blows were not fatal they effectually put the warriors hors de combat of the garrison not one was among the slain in this part of the field on a later investigation however it was ascertained that the poor old scotch mason had received a mortal hurt through a window and this by the very last shot that had been fired on turning over the dead of the assailants too it was discovered that daniel the miller was of the number a few of the mohawks were seen with glowing eyes in corners of the court applying their own rude dressings to their various hurts succeeding on the whole in effecting the great purpose of the healing art about as well as those who were committed to the lights of science  surprisingly few uninjured members of the assaulting party however were to be found when the lanterns appeared some had slipped through the gate before the sentinels were posted others had found their way to the roof and thence by various means to the ground while a few lay concealed in the buildings until a favourable moment offered to escape among all those who remained not an individual was found who claimed to be in any authority in a word after five minutes of examination both beekman and willoughby were satisfied that there no longer existed a force to dispute with them the mastery of the hut  we have delayed too long relieving the apprehensions of those who are very dear to us major willoughby beekman at length observed if you will lead the way to the parts of the buildings where yourmy mother and wife are to be found i will now follow you  hold beekmanthere yet remains a melancholy tale to be toldnay start noti left our beulah and your boy in perfect health less than a quarter of an hour since but my honoured honourable revered beloved father has been killed in a most extraordinary manner and you will find his widow and daughters weeping over his body  this appalling intelligence produced a halt during which willoughby explained all he knew of the manner of his fathers death which was merely the little he had been enabled to glean from maud as soon as this duty was performed the gentlemen proceeded together to the apartment of the mourners each carrying a light  willoughby made an involuntary exclamation when he perceived that the door of his mothers room was open he had hoped maud would have had the presence of mind to close and lock it but here he found it yawning as if to invite the entrance of enemies the light within too was extinguished though by the aid of the lanterns he saw large traces of blood in the anteroom and the passages he was obliged to thread all this hastened his steps presently he stood in the chamber of death  short as had been the struggle the thirst for scalps had led some of the savages to this sanctuary the instant the indians had gained the court some of the most ferocious of their number had rushed into the building penetrating its recesses in a way to defile them with slaughter the first object that willoughby saw was one of these ruthless warriors stretched on the floor with a living indian bleeding at half a dozen wounds standing over him the eyeballs of the latter were glaring like the tigers that is suddenly confronted to a foe an involuntary motion was made towards the rifle he carried by the major but the next look told him that the living indian was nick then it was that he gazed more steadily about him and took in all the horrible truths of that fatal chamber  mrs willoughby was sealed in the chair where she had last been seen perfectly dead no mark of violence was ever found on her body however and there is no doubt that her constant spirit had followed that of her husband to the other world in submission to the blow which had separated them beulah had been shot not as was afterwards ascertained by any intentional aim but by one of those random bullets of which so many had been flying through the buildings the missile had passed through her heart and she lay pressing the little evert to her bosom with that air of steady and unerring affection which had marked every act of her innocent and feeling life the boy himself thanks to the tigerlike gallantry of nick had escaped unhurt the tuscarora had seen a party of six take the direction of this chamber and he followed with an instinct of their intentions when the leader entered the room and found three dead bodies he raised a yell that betokened his delight at the prospect of gaining so many scalps at the next instant while his fingers were actually entwined in the hair of captain willoughby he fell by a blow from wyandott√© nick next extinguished the lamp and then succeeded a scene which none of the actors themselves could have described another mohawk fell and the remainder ailer suffering horribly from the keen knife of nick as well as from blows received from each other dragged themselves away leaving the field to the tuscarora the latter met the almost bewildered gaze of the major with a smile of grim triumph as he pointed to the three bodies of the beloved ones and said  seeall got scalp deat nothinscalp ebbery ting  we shall not attempt to describe the outbreaking of anguish from the husband and brother it was a moment of wild grief that bore down all the usual restraints of manhood though it was such a moment as an american frontier residence has often witnessed the quiet but deep feeling nature of beekman received a shock that almost produced a dissolution of his earthly being he succeeded however in raising the still warm body of beulah from the floor and folding it to his heart happily for his reason a flood of tears such as women shed burst from his soul rather than from his eyes bedewing her still sweet and placid countenance  to say that robert willoughby did not feel the desolation which so suddenly alighted on a family that had often been quoted for its mutual affection and happiness would be to do him great injustice he even staggered under the blow yet his heart craved further information the indian was gazing intently on the sight of beekmans grief partly in wonder but more in sympathy when he felt an iron pressure of his arm  maudtuscarorathe major rather groaned than whispered in his ear know you anything of maud  nick made a gesture of assent then motioned for the other to follow he led the way to the storeroom produced the key and throwing open the door maud was weeping on robert willoughbys bosom in another instant he would not take her to the chamber of death but urged her by gentle violence to follow him to the library  god be praised for this mercy exclaimed the ardent girl raising her hands and streaming eyes to heaven i know not care not who is conqueror since you are safe  oh maudbeloved onewe must now be all in all to each other death has stricken the others  this was a sudden and involuntary announcement though it was best it should be so under the circumstances it was long before maud could hear an outline even of the details but she bore them better than willoughby could have hoped the excitement had been so high as to brace the mind to meet any human evil the sorrow that came afterwards though sweetened by so many tender recollections and chastened hopes was deep and enduring  our picture would not have been complete without relating the catastrophe that befell the hutted knoll but having discharged this painful duty we prefer to draw a veil over the remainder of that dreadful night the cries of the negresses when they learned the death of their old and young mistress disturbed the silence of the place for a few minutes and then a profound stillness settled on the buildings marking them distinctly as the house of mourning on further inquiry too it was ascertained that great smash after shooting an oneida had been slain and scalped pliny the younger also fell fighting like a wild beast to defend the entrance to his mistresses apartments  the following day when light had returned a more accurate idea was obtained of the real state of the valley all of the invading party the dead and wounded excepted had made a rapid retreat accompanied by most of the deserters and their families the name known influence and actual authority of colonel beekman had wrought this change the irregular powers that had set the expedition in motion preferring to conceal their agency in the transaction rather than make any hazardous attempt to claim the reward of patriotic service as is so often done in revolutions for merciless deeds and selfish acts there had been no real design on the part of the whites to injure any of the family in their persons but instigated by joel they had fancied the occasion favourable for illustrating their own public virtue while they placed themselves in the way of receiving fortunes favours the assault that actually occurred was one of those uncontrollable outbreakings of indian ferocity that have so often set at defiance the restraints of discipline  nick was not to be found either he had been last seen dressing his wounds with indian patience and indian skill preparing to apply herbs and roots in quest of which he went into the forest about midnight as he did not return willoughby feared that he might be suffering alone and determined to have a search made as soon as he had performed the last sad offices for the dead  two days occurred however before this melancholy duty was discharged the bodies of all the savages who had fallen were interred the morning after the assault but that of jamie allen with those of the principal persons of the family were kept for the pious purposes of affection until the time mentioned  the funeral was a touching sight the captain his wife and daughter were laid side by side near the chapel the first and last of their race that ever reposed in the wilds of america mr woods read the funeral service summoning all his spiritual powers to sustain him as he discharged this solemn office of the church willoughbys arm was around the waist of maud who endeavoured to reward his tender assiduities by a smile but could not colonel beekman held little evert in his arms and stood over the grave with the countenance of a resolute man stricken with griefone of the most touching spectacles of our nature  i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord sounded in the stillness of that valley like a voice from heaven pouring out consolation on the bruised spirits of the mourners maud raised her face from willoughbys shoulder and lifted her blue eyes to the cloudless vault above her soliciting mercy and offering resignation in the look the line of troops in the background moved as by a common impulse and then a breathless silence showed the desire of these rude beings not to lose a syllable  a round red spot formed on each of the cheeks of mr woods as he proceeded and his voice gathered strength until its lowest intonations came clear and distinct on every ear just as the bodies were about to be lowered into their two receptacles the captain his wife and daughter being laid in the same grave nick came with his noiseless step near the little group of mourners he had issued from the forest only a few minutes before and understanding the intention of the ceremony he approached the spot as fast as weakness and wounds would allow even he listened with profound attention to the chaplain never changing his eye from his face unless to glance at the coffins as they lay in their final restingplace  i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write from henceforth blessed are the dead who die in the lord even so saith the spirit for they rest from their labours continued the chaplain his voice beginning to betray a tremor then the gaze of the tuscarora became keen as the panthers glance at his discovered victim tears followed and for a moment the voice was choked  why you woman demanded nick fiercely save all e scalp  this strange interruption failed to produce any effect first beekman yielded maud and willoughby followed until mr woods himself unable to resist the double assaults of the power of sympathy and his own affection closed the book and wept like a child  it required minutes for the mourners to recover their selfcommand when the latter returned however all knelt on the grass the line of soldiers included and the closing prayers were raised to the throne of god  this act of devotion enabled the mourners to maintain an appearance of greater tranquillity until the graves were filled the troops advanced and fired three volleys over the captains grave when all retired towards the hut maud had caught little evert from the arms of his father and pressing him to her bosom the motherless babe seemed disposed to slumber there in this manner she walked away attended closely by the father who now cherished his boy as an only treasure  willoughby lingered the last at the grave nick alone remaining near him the indian had been struck by the exhibition of deep sorrow that he had witnessed and he felt an uneasiness that was a little unaccountable to himself it was one of the caprices of this strange nature of ours that he should feel a desire to console those whom he had so deeply injured himself he drew near to robert willoughby therefore and laying a hand on the latters arm drew his look in the direction of his own red and speaking face  why so sorry major he said warrior nebber die but once must die sometime  there lie my father my mother and my only sister indianis not that enough to make the stoutest heart bend you knew them too nick did you ever know better  squaw goodboth squaw goodnick see no paleface squaw he like so much  i thank you nick this rude tribute to the virtues of my mother and sister is far more grateful to me than the calculating and regulated condolence of the world  no squaw so good as ole oneshe all heartlove every body but self  this was so characteristic of his mother that willoughby was startled by the sagacity of the savage though reflection told him so long an acquaintance with the family must have made a dog familiar with this beautiful trait in his mother  and my father nick exclaimed the major with feelingmy noble just liberal gallant fatherhe too you knew well and must have loved  no so good as squaw answered the tuscarora sententiously and not altogether without disgust in his manner  we are seldom as good as our wives and mothers and sisters nick else should we be angels on earth but allowing for the infirmities of us men my father was just and gocd  too much floganswered the savage sternlymake injins back sore  this extraordinary speech struck the major less at the time than it did years afterwards when he came to reflect on all the events and dialogues of this teeming week such was also the case as to what followed  you are no flatterer tuscarora as i have always found in our intercourse if my father ever punished you with severity you will allow me at least to imagine it was merited  too much flog i say interrupted the savage fiercely no difference chief or not touch ole sore too rough good some bad some like weathernow shine now storm  this is no time to discuss these points nick you have fought nobly for us and i thank you without your aid these beloved ones would have been mutilated as well as slain and maudmy own blessed maud might now have been sleeping at their sides  nicks face was now all softness again and he returned the pressure of willoughbys hand with honest fervor here they separated the major hastened to the side of maud to fold her to his heart and console her with his love nick passed into the forest returning no more to the hut his path led him near the grave on the side where lay the body of mrs willoughby he threw a flower he had plucked in the meadow while he shook his finger menacingly at the other which hid the person of his enemy in this he was true to his nature which taught him never to forget a favour or forgive an injury      chapter xxx    i shall go on through all eternity   thank god i only am an embryo still   the small beginning of a glorious soul   an atom that shall fill immensity    coxe  a fortnight elapsed ere willoughby and his party could tear themselves from a scene that had witnessed so much domestic happiness but on which had fallen the blight of death during that time the future arrangements of the survivors were completed beekman was made acquainted with the state of feeling that existed between his brother inlaw and maud and he advised an immediate union  be happy while you can he said with bitter emphasis we live in troubled times and heaven knows when we shall see better maud has not a bloodrelation in all america unless there may happen to be some in the british army though we should all be happy to protect and cherish the dear girl she herself would probably prefer to be near those whom nature has appointed her friends to me she will always seem a sister as you must ever be a brother by uniting yourselves at once all appearances of impropriety will be avoided and in time god averting evil you can introduce your wife to her english connections  you forget beekman that you are giving this advice to one who is a prisoner on parole and one who may possibly be treated as a spy  nothat is impossible schuyler our noble commander is both just and a gentleman he will tolerate nothing of the sort your exchange can easily be effected and beyond your present difficulties i can pledge myself to be able to protect you  willoughby was not averse to following this advice and he urged it upon maud as the safest and most prudent course they could pursue our heroine however was so reluctant even to assuming the appearance of happiness so recently after the losses she had experienced that the lovers task of persuasion was by no means easy maud was totally free from affectation while she possessed the keenest sense of womanly propriety her intercourse with robert willoughby had been of the tenderest and most confidential nature above every pretence of concealment and was rendered sacred by the scenes through which they had passed her love her passionate engrossing attachment she did not scruple to avow but she could not become a bride while the stains of blood seemed so recent on the very hearth around which they were sitting she still saw the forms of the dead in their customary places heard their laughs the tones of their affectionate voices the maternal whisper the playful paternal reproof or beulahs gentle call  yet robert said maud for she could now call him by that name and drop the desperate familiarity of bobyet robert there would be a melancholy satisfaction in making our vows at the altar of the little chapel where we have so often worshipped togetherthe loved ones who are gone and we who alone remain  true dearest maud and there is another reason why we should quit this place only as man and wife beekman has owned that a question will probably be raised among the authorities at albany concerning the nature of my visit here it might relieve him from an appeal to more influence than would be altogether pleasant did i appear as a bridegroom rather than as a spy  the word spy settled the matter all ordinary considerations were lost sight of under the apprehensions it created and maud frankly consented to become a wife that very day the ceremony was performed by mr woods accordingly and the little chapel witnessed tears of bitter recollections mingling with the smiles with which the bride received the warm embrace of her husband after the benediction was pronounced still all felt that under the circumstances delay would have been unwise maud saw a species of holy solemnity in a ceremony so closely connected with scenes so sad  a day or two after the marriage all that remained of those who had so lately crowded the hut left the valley together the valuables were packed and transported to boats lying in the stream below the mills all the cattle hogs c were collected and driven towards the settlements and horses were prepared for maud and the females who were to thread the path that led to fort stanwix in a word the knoll was to be abandoned as a spot unfit to be occupied in such a war none but labourers indeed could or would remain and beekman thought it wisest to leave the spot entirely to nature for the few succeeding years  there had been some rumours of confiscations by the new state and willoughby had come to the conclusion that it would be safer to transfer this property to one who would be certain to escape such an infliction than to retain it in his own hands little evert was entitled to receive a portion of the captains estate by justice if not by law no will had been found and the son succeeded as heirat law a deed was accordingly drawn up by mr woods who understood such matters and being duly executed the beaver dam property was vested in fee in the child his own thirty thousand pounds the personals he inherited from his mother and mauds fortune to say nothing of the majors commission formed an ample support for the newmarried pair when all was settled and made productive indeed willoughby found himself the master of between three and four thousand sterling a year exclusively of his allowances from the british government an ample fortune for that day in looking over the accounts of mauds fortune he had reason to admire the rigid justice and freehanded liberality with which his father had managed her affairs every farthing of her income had been transferred to capital a long minority nearly doubling the original investment unknown to himself he had married one of the largest heiresses then to be found in the american colonies this was unknown to maud also though it gave her great delight on her husbands account when she came to learn the truth  albany was reached in due time though not without encountering the usual difficulties here the party separated the remaining plinys and smashes were all liberated handsome provisions made for their little wants and good places found for them in the connection of the family to which they had originally belonged mike announced his determination to enter a corps that was intended expressly to fight the indians he had a long score to settle and having no wife or children he thought he might amuse himself in this way during a revolution as well as in any other  if yer honour was going anywhere near the county leitrim he said in answer to willoughbys offer to keep him near himself i might travel in company seein that a man likes to look on ould faces now and then many thanks for this bag of gold which will sarve to buy scalps wid for divil burrn me if i dont carry on that trade for some time to come tree cuts wid a knife half a dozen pokes in the side and a bullet scraping the head makes a man mindful of what has happened to say nothing of the captain and madam willoughby and miss beulygod for ever bless and presarve em all treeand if there was such a thing as a bit of a church in this counthry wouldnt i use this gould for massesdat i would and let the scalps go to the divil  this was an epitome of the views of michael ohearn no arguments of willoughbys could change his resolution but he set forth determined to illustrate his career by procuring as many indian scalps as an atonement for the wrongs done madam willoughby and miss beuly as came within his reach  and you joyce said the major in an interview he had with the serjeant shortly after reaching albany i trust we are not to part thanks to colonel beekmans influence and zeal i am already exchanged and shall repair to new york next week you are a soldier and these are times in which a good soldier is of some account i think i can safely promise you a commission in one of the new provincial regiments about to be raised  i thank your honour but do not feel at liberty to accept the offer i took service with captain willoughby for life had he lived i would have followed wherever he led but that enlistment has expired and i am now like a recruit before he takes the bounty in such cases a man has always a right to pick his corps politics i do not much understand but when the question comes up of pulling a trigger for or against his country an unengaged man has a right to choose between the two meaning no reproach to yourself major willoughby who had regularly taken service with the other side before the war beganbut between the two i would rather fight an englishman than an american  you may possibly be right joyce though as you say my service is taken i hope you follow the dictates of conscience as i am certain i do myself we shall never meet in arms however if i can prevent it there is a negotiation for a lieutenantcolonelcy going on which if it succeed will carry me to england i shall never serve an hour longer against these colonies if it be in my power to avoid it  states with your permission major willoughby answered the serjeant a little stiffly i am glad to hear it sir for though i wish my enemies good soldiers i would rather not have the son of my old captain among them colonel beekman has offered to make me serjeantmajor of his own regiment and we both of us join next week  joyce was as good as his word he became serjeantmajor and in the end lieutenant and adjutant of the regiment he had mentioned he fought in most of the principal battles of the war and retired at the peace with an excellent character ten years later he fell in one of the murderous indian affairs that occurred during the first oresidential term a greyheaded captain of foot the manner of his death was not to be regretted perhaps as it was what he had always wished might happen but it was a singular fact that mike stood over his body and protected it from mutilation the county leitrimman having turned soldier by trade reenlisting regularly as soon as at liberty and laying up scalps on all suitable occasions  blodget too had followed joyce to the wars the readiness and intelligence of this young man united to a courage of proof soon brought him forward and he actually came out of the revolution a captain his mind manners and information advancing with himself he ended his career not many years since a prominent politician in one of the new states a general in the militiano great preferment by the way for one who had been a corporal at the hutand a legislator worse men have often acted in all these capacities among us and it was said with truth at the funeral of general blodget an accident that does not always occur on such occasions that another revolutionary hero is gone beekman was never seen to smile from the moment he first beheld the dead body of beulah lying with little evert in her arms he served faithfully until near the close of the war falling in battle only a few months previously to the peace his boy preceded him to the grave leaving as confiscations had gone out of fashion by that time his uncle heiratlaw again to the same property that he had conferred on himself  as for willoughby and maud they were safely conveyed to new york where the former rejoined his regiment our heroine here met her great uncle general meredith the first of her own blood relations whom she had seen since infancy her reception was grateful to her feelings and there being a resemblance in years appearance and manners she transferred much of that affection which she had thought interred for ever in the grave of her reputed father to this revered relative he became much attached to his lovely niece himself and ten years later willoughby found his income quite doubled by his decease  at the expiration of six months the gazette that arrived from england announced the promotion of sir robert willoughby bart late major in the th to be lieutenant colonel by purchase in his majestys th regiment of foot this enabled willoughby to quit america to which quarter of the world he had no occasion to be sent during the remainder of the war  of that war itself there is little occasion to speak its progress and termination have long been matters of history the independence of america was acknowledged by england in 1783 and immediately after the republicans commenced the conquest of their widespread domains by means of the arts of peace in 1785 the first great assaults were made on the wilderness in that mountainous region which has been the principal scene of our tale the indians had been driven off in a great measure by the events of the revolution and the owners of estates granted under the crown began to search for their lands in the untenanted woods such isolated families too as had taken refuge in the settlements now began to return to their deserted possessions and soon the smokes of clearings were obscuring the sun whitestown utica on the site of old fort stanwix cooperstown for years the seat of justice for several thousand square miles of territory all sprang into existence between the years 1785 and 1790 such places as oxford binghamton norwich sherburne hamilton and twenty more that now dot the region of which we have been writing did not then exist even in name for in that day the appellation and maps came after the place whereas now the former precede the last  the ten years that elapsed between 1785 and 1795 did wonders for all this mountain district more favourable lands lay spread in the great west but the want of roads and remoteness from the markets prevented their occupation for several years therefore the current of emigration which started out of the eastern states the instant peace was proclaimed poured its tide into the counties mentioned in our opening chaptercounties as they are today county ay and fragment of a county too as they were then  the new york gazette a journal that frequently related facts that actually occurred announced in its number of june 11th 1795 his majestys packet that has just arrivedit required half a century to teach the journalists of this country the propriety of saying his britannic majestys packet instead of his majestys a bit of good taste and of good sense that many of them have yet to learnhas brought out home would have been better among her passengers lieutenantgeneral sir robert willoughby and his lady both of whom are natives of this state we welcome them back to their land of nativity where we can assure them they will be cordially received notwithstanding old quarrels major willoughbys kindness to american prisoners is gratefully remembered nor is it forgotten that he desired to exchange to another regiment in order to avoid further service in this country  it will be conceded this was a very respectable puff for the year 1795 when something like moderation truth and propriety were observed upon such occasions the effect was to bring the english generals name into the mouths of the whole state a baronet causing a greater sensation then in america than a duke would produce today it had the effect however of bringing around general willoughby many of his fathers and his own old friends and he was as well received in new york twelve years after the termination of the conflict as if he had fought on the other side the occurrence of the french revolution and the spread of doctrines that were termed jacobinical early removed all the dissensions between a large portion of the whigs of america and the tories of england on this side of the water at least and providence only can tell what might have been the consequences had this feeling been thoroughly understood on the other  passing over all political questions however our narrative calls us to the relation of its closing scene the visit of sir robert and lady willoughby to the land of their birth was in part owing to feeling in part to a proper regard for the future provision of their children the baronet had bought the ancient paternal estate of his family in england and having two daughters besides an only son it occurred to him that the american property called the hutted knoll might prove a timely addition to the ready money he had been able to lay up from his income then both he and his wife had a deep desire to revisit those scenes where they had first learned to love each other and which still held the remains of so many who were dear to them  the cabin of a suitable sloop was therefore engaged and the party consisting of sir robert his wife a man and woman servant and a sort of american courier engaged for the trip embarked on the morning of the 25th of july on the afternoon of the 30th the sloop arrived in safety at albany where a carriage was hired to proceed the remainder of the way by land the route by old fort stanwix as utica was still generally called was taken our travellers reached it on the evening of the third day the sands which are now traversed in less than an hour then occupying more than half of the first day when at fort stanwix a passable country road was found by which the travellers journeyed until they reached a tavern that united many of the comforts of a coarse civilisation with frontier simplicity here they were given to understand they had only a dozen miles to go in order to reach the knoll  it was necessary to make the remainder of the journey on horseback a large untenanted estate lay between the highway and the valley across which no public road had yet been made footpaths however abounded and the rivulet was found without any difficulty it was perhaps fortunate for the privacy of the knoll that it lay in the line of no frequented route and squatters being rare in that day willoughby saw the instant he struck the path that followed the sinuosities of the stream that it had been seldom trodden in the interval of the nineteenyears which had occurred since he had last seen it himself the evidences of this fact increased as the stream was ascended until the travellers reached the mill when it was found that the spirit of destruction which so widely prevails in the loose state of society that exists in all new countries had been at work every one of the buildings at the falls had been burnt probably as much because it was in the power of some reckless wanderer to work mischief as for any other reason that the act was the result of some momentary impulse was evident in the circumstance that the mischief went no further some of the machinery had been carried away however to be set up in other places on a principle that is very widely extended through all border settlements which considers the temporary disuse of property as its virtual abandonment  it was a moment of pain and pleasure strangely mingled when willoughby and maud reached the rocks and got a first view of the ancient beaver dam all the buildings remained surprisingly little altered to the eye by the lapse of years the gates had been secured when they left the place in 1776 and the hut having no accessible external windows that dwelling remained positively intact it is true quite half the palisadoes were rotted down but the hut itself had resisted the ravages of time a fire had been kindled against its side but the stone walls had opposed an obstacle to its ravages and an attempt by throwing a brand upon the roof had failed of its object the shingles not igniting on examination the lock of the inner gate was still secure the key had been found and on its application an entrance was obtained into the court  what a moment was that when maud fresh from the luxuries of an english home entered this long and well remembered scene of her youth rank grasses were growing in the court but they soon disappeared before the scythes that had been brought in expectation of the circumstance then all was clear for an examination of the house the hut was exactly in the condition in which it had been left with the exception of a little and a very little dust collected by time  maud was still in the bloom of womanhood feminine beautiful full of feeling and as sincere as when she left these woods though her feelings were tempered a little by intercourse with the world she went from room to room hanging on willoughbys arm forbidding any to follow all the common furniture had been left in the house in expectation it would be inhabited again ere many years and this helped to preserve the identity the library was almost entire the bedrooms the parlours and even the paintingroom were found very much as they would have appeared after an absence of a few months tears flowed in streams down the cheeks of lady willoughby as she went through room after room and recalled to the mind of her husband the different events of which they had been the silent witnesses thus passed an hour or two of unutterable tenderness blended with a species of holy sorrow at the end of that time the attendants of whom many had been engaged had taken possession of the offices c and were bringing the hut once more into a habitable condition soon too a report was brought that the mowers who had been brought in anticipation of their services being wanted had cut a broad swathe to the ruins of the chapel and the graves of the family  it was now near the setting of the sun and the hour was favourable for the melancholy duty that remained for bidding any to follow willoughby proceeded with maud to the graves these had been dug within a little thicket of shrubs planted by poor jamie allen under mauds own directions she had then thought that the spot might one day be wanted these bushes lilacs and ceringos had grown to a vast size in that rich soil they completely concealed the space within an area of some fifty square feet from the observation of those without the grass had been cut over all however and an opening made by the mowers gave access to the graves on reaching this opening willoughby started at hearing voices within the inclosure he was about to reprove the intruders when maud pressed his arm and whispered  listen willoughbythose voices sound strangely to my ears we have heard them before  i tell ye nickould nicky or saucy nick or whatevers yer name said one within in a strong irish accent that jamie the mason that was is forenent ye at this minute under that bit of a sodand its his honour and missus and miss beuly that is buried here och yere a crature nick good at takin scalps but ye knows nothin of graves barrin the quhantity yeve helped to fill  goodanswered the indian capin here squaw here darter here where sonwhere tother gal  here answered willoughby leading maud within the hedge i am robert willoughby and this is maud meredith my wife  mike fairly started he even showed a disposition to seize a musket which lay on the grass as for the indian a tree in the forest could not have stood less unmoved than he was at this unexpected interruption then all four stood in silent admiration noting the changes which time had more or less wrought in all  willoughby was in the pride of manhood he had served with distinction and his countenance and frame both showed it though neither had suffered more than was necessary to give him a high military air and a look of robust vigour as for maud with her graceful form fully developed by her ridinghabit her soft lineaments and polished expression no one would have thought her more than thirty which was ten years less than her real age with mike and nick it was very different both had grown old not only in fact but in appearance the irishman was turned of sixty and his hard coarsefeatured face burnt as red as the sun in a fog by exposure and santa cruz was getting to be wrinkled and a little emaciated still his frame was robust and powerful his attire was none of the best and it was to be seen at a glance that it was more than half military in point of fact the poor fellow had been refused a reinlistment in the army on account of his infirmities and years and america was not then a country to provide retreats for her veterans still mike had an ample pension for wounds and could not be said to be in want he had suffered in the same battle with joyce in whose company he had actually been corporal ohearn though his gallant commander had not risen to fight again as had been the case with the subordinate  wyandott√© exhibited still greater changes he had seen his threescore and ten years and was fast falling into the sere and yellow leaf his hair was getting grey and his frame though still active and sinewy would have yielded under the extraordinary marches he had once made in dress there was nothing to remark his ordinary indian attire being in as good condition as was usual for the man willoughby thought however that his eye was less wild than when he knew him before and every symptom of intemperance had vanished not only from his countenance but his person  from the moment willoughby appeared a marked change came over the countenance of nick his dark eye which still retained much of its brightness turned in the direction of the neighbouring chapel and he seemed relieved when a rustling in the bushes announced a footstep there had not been another word spoken when the lilacs were shoved aside and mr woods a vigorous little man in a green old age entered the area willoughby had not seen the chaplain since they parted at albany and the greetings were as warm as they were unexpected  i have lived a sort of hermits life my dear bob since the death of your blessed parents said the divine clearing his eyes of tears now and then cheered by a precious letter from yourself and maudi call you both by the names i gave you both in baptismand it was i maud take thee robert when you stood before the altar in that little edificeyou will pardon me if i am too familiar with a general officer and his lady  familiar exclaimed both in a breathand mauds soft white hand was extended towards the chaplain with reproachful earnestnesswe who were made christians by you and who have so much reason to remember and love you always  well well i see you are robert and maud stilldashing streaming tears from his eyes now yes i did bring you both into gods visible church on earth and you were baptised by one who received his ordination from the archbishop of canterbury himselfmaud smiled a little archlyand who has never forgotten his ordination vows as he humbly trusts but you are not the only christians i have madei now rank nicholas among the number  nick interrupted sir robertwyandott√© added his wife with a more delicate tact  i call him nicholas now since he was christened by that namethere is no longer a wyandott√© or a saucy nick major willoughby i have a secret to communicatei beg pardon sir robertbut you will excuse old habitsif you will walk this way  willoughby was apart with the chaplain a full halfhour during which time maud wept over the graves the rest standing by in respectful silence as for nick a stone could scarcely have been more fixed than his attitude nevertheless his mien was rebuked his eye downcast even his bosom was singularly convulsed he knew that the chaplain was communicating to willoughby the manner in which he had slain his father at length the gentlemen returned slowly towards the graves the general agitated frowning and flushed as for mr woods he was placid and full of hope willoughby had yielded to his expostulations and arguments a forgiveness which came reluctantly and perhaps as much for the want of a suitable object for retaliation as from a sense of christian duty  nicholas said the chaplain i have told the general all  he know him cried the indian with startling energy  i do wyandott√© and sorry have i been to learn it you have made my heart bitter  nick was terribly agitated his youthful and former opinions maintained a fearful struggle with those which had come late in life the result being a wild admixture of his sense of indian justice and submission to the tenets of his new and imperfectlycomprehended faith for a moment the first prevailed advancing with a firm step to the general he put his own bright and keen tomahawk into the others hands folded his arms on his bosom bowed his head a little and said firmly  strikenick kill capinmajor kill nick  no tuscarora no answered sir robert willoughby his whole soul yielding before this act of humble submissionmay god in heaven forgive the deed as i now forgive you  there was a wild smile gleaming on the face of the indian he grasped both hands of willoughby in his own he then muttered the words god forgive his eye rolled upward at the clouds and he fell dead on the grave of his victim it was thought afterwards that agitation had accelerated the crisis of an incurable affection of the heart  a few minutes of confusion followed then mike bareheaded his old face flushed and angry dragged from his pockets a
