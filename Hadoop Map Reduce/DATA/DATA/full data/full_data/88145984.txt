grandfather into a latterday romance but i have thought it wiser to leave them as he wrote them albeit they contain some details not of interest to the general public to my notion it is such imperfections as these which lend to them the reality they bear certain it is when reading them i live his life over again  needless to say mr richard carvel never intended them for publication his first apology would be for his scotch and his only defence is that he was not a scotchman  the lively capital which once reflected the wit and fashion of europe has fallen into decay the silent streets no more echo with the rumble of coaches and gay chariots and grass grows where busy merchants trod stately ballrooms where beauty once reigned are cold and empty and mildewed and halls where laughter rang are silent time was when every widethroated chimney poured forth its cloud of smoke when every andiron held a generous logandirons which are now gone to decorate mr centennials home in new york or lie with a tag in the window of some curio shop the mantel carved in delicate wreaths is boarded up and an unsightly stove mocks the gilded ceiling children romp in that room with the silver doorknobs where my master and his lady were wont to sit at cards in silk and brocade while liveried blacks entered on tiptoe no marble cupids or tall dianas fill the niches in the staircase and the mahogany board round which has been gathered many a famous toast and wit is gone from the dining room  but mr carvels town house in annapolis stands today with its neighbours a mournful relic of a glory that is past  daniel clapsaddle carvel  calvert house pennsylvania december 21 1876     richard carvel     volume 1     chapter i lionel carvel of carvel hall  lionel carvel esq of carvel hall in the county of queen anne was no inconsiderable man in his lordships province of maryland and indeed he was not unknown in the colonial capitals from williamsburg to boston when his ships arrived out in may or june they made a goodly showing at the wharves and his captains were ever shrewd men of judgment who sniffed a frenchman on the horizon so that none of the carvel tobacco ever went in that way to gladden a gallic heart mr carvels acres were both rich and broad and his house wide for the stranger who might seek its shelter as with gods help so it ever shall be it has yet to be said of the carvels that their guests are hurried away or that one by reason of his worldly goods or position shall be more welcome than another  i take no shame in the pride with which i write of my grandfather albeit he took the part of his majesty and parliament against the colonies he was no palavering turncoat like my uncle grafton to cry god save the king again when an english fleet sailed up the bay mr carvels hand was large and his heart was large and he was respected and even loved by the patriots as a man above paltry subterfuge he was born at carvel hall in the year of our lord 1696 when the house was i am told but a small dwelling it was his father george carvel my greatgrandsire reared the present house in the year 1720 of brick brought from england as ballast for the empty ships he added on in the years following the wide wings containing the ballroom and the banquethall and the large library at the eastern end and the offices but it was my grandfather who built the great stables and the kennels where he kept his beagles and his fleeter hounds he dearly loved the saddle and the chase and taught me to love them too many the sharp winter day i have followed the fox with him over two counties and lain that night and a week after forsooth at the plantation of some kind friend who was only too glad to receive us often too have we stood together from early morning until dark night waist deep on the duck points i with a fowlingpiece i was all but too young to carry and brought back a hundred redheads or canvasbacks in our bags he went with unfailing regularity to the races at annapolis or chestertown or marlborough often to see his own horses run where the coaches of the gentry were fifty and sixty around the course where a negro or a hogshead of tobacco or a pipe of madeira was often staked at a single throw those times my children are not ours and i thought it not strange that mr carvel should delight in a good main between two cocks or a bullbaiting or a breaking of heads at the chestertown fair where he went to show his cattle and fling a guinea into the ring for the winner  but it must not be thought that lionel carvel your ancestor was wholly unlettered because he was a sportsman though it must be confessed that books occupied him only when the weather compelled or when on his back with the gout at times he would fain have me read to him as he lay in his great fourpost bed with the flowered counterpane from the spectator stopping me now and anon at some awakened memory of his youth he never forgave mr addison for killing stout old sir roger de coverley and would never listen to the butlers account of his death mr carvel too had walked in grays inn gardens and met adventure at fox hall and seen the great marlborough himself he had a fondness for mr congreves comedies many of which he had seen acted and was partial to mr gays trivia which brought him many a recollection he would also listen to pope but of the more modern poetry i think mr grays elegy pleased him best he would laugh over swifts gall and wormwood and would never be brought by my mother to acknowledge the defects in the deans character why he had once met the dean in a london drawingroom when my grandfather was a young spark at christ church oxford he never tired of relating that interview the hostess was a very great lady indeed and actually stood waiting for a word with his reverence whose whim it was rather to talk to the young provincial he was a forbidding figure in his black gown and periwig so my grandfather said with a piercing blue eye and shaggy brow he made the mighty to come to him while young carvel stood between laughter and fear of the great ladys displeasure  i knew of your father said the dean before he went to the colonies he had done better at home sir he was a man of parts  he has done indifferently well in maryland sir said mr carvel making his bow  he hath gained wealth forsooth says the dean wrathfully and might have had both wealth and fame had his love for king james not turned his head i have heard much of the colonies and have read that doggerel sot weed factor which tells of the gluttonous life of ease you lead in your own province you can have no men of mark from such conditions mr carvel tell me he adds contemptuously is genius honoured among you  faith it is honoured your reverence said my grandfather but never encouraged  this answer so pleased the dean that he bade mr carvel dine with him next day at buttons coffee house where they drank mulled wine and old sack for which young mr carvel paid on which occasion his reverence endeavoured to persuade the young man to remain in england and even went so far as to promise his influence to obtain him preferment but mr carvel chose rather wisely or not who can judge to come back to carvel hall and to the lands of which he was to be master and to play the country squire and provincial magnate rather than follow the varying fortunes of a political party at home and he was a man much looked up to in the province before the revolution and sat at the council board of his excellency the governor as his father had done before him and represented the crown in more matters than one when the french and savages were upon our frontiers  although a lover of good cheer mr carvel was never intemperate to the end of his days he enjoyed his bottle after dinner nay could scarce get along without it and mixed a punch or a posset as well as any in our colony he chose a good londonbrewed ale or porter and his ships brought madeira from that island by the pipe and sack from spain and portugal and red wine from france when there was peace and puncheons of rum from jamaica and the indies for his people holding that no gentleman ever drank rum in the raw though fairly supportable as punch  mr carvels house stands in marlborough street a dreary mansion enough praised be heaven that those who inherit it are not obliged to live there on the memory of what was in days gone by the heavy green shutters are closed the high steps though stoutly built are shaky after these years of disuse the host of faithful servants who kept its state are nearly all laid side by side at carvel hall harvey and chess and scipio are no more the kitchen whither a boyish hunger oft directed my eyes at twilight shines not with the welcoming gleam of yore chess no longer prepares the dainties which astonished mr carvels guests and which he alone could cook the coach still stands in the stables where harvey left it a lumbering relic of those lumbering times when methinks there was more of goodwill and less of haste in the world the great brass knocker once resplendent from scipios careful hand no longer fantastically reflects the guest as he beats his tattoo and mr peales portrait of my grandfather is gone from the diningroom wall adorning as you know our own drawingroom at calvert house  i shut my eyes and there comes to me unbidden that diningroom in marlborough street of a gray winters afternoon when i was but a lad i see my dear grandfather in his wig and silverlaced waistcoat and his blue velvet coat seated at the head of the table and the precise scipio has put down the dumbwaiter filled with shining cutglass at his left hand and his wine chest at his right and with solemn pomp driven his black assistants from the room scipio was mr carvels butler he was forbid to light the candles after dinner as dark grew on mr carvel liked the blazing logs for light and presently sets the decanter on the corner of the table and draws nearer the fire his guests following i recall well how jolly governor sharpe who was a frequent visitor with us was wont to display a comely calf in silk stocking and how captain daniel clapsaddle would spread his feet with his toes out and settle his long pipe between his teeth and there were besides a host of others who sat at that fire whose names have passed into marylands historywhig and tory alike and i remember a tall slip of a lad who sat listening by the deeprecessed windows on the street which somehow are always covered in these pictures with a fine rain then a coach passesa mahogany coach emblazoned with the mannerss coat of arms and mistress dorothy and her mother within and my young lady gives me one of those demure bows which ever set my heart agoing like a smiths hammer of a monday     chapter ii some memories of childhood  a traveller who has all but gained the last height of the great mistcovered mountain looks back over the painful crags he has mastered to where a light is shining on the first easy slope that light is ever visible for it is youth  after nigh fourscore and ten years of life that youth is nearer to me now than many things which befell me later i recall as yesterday the day captain clapsaddle rode to the hall his horse covered with sweat and the reluctant tidings of captain jack carvels death on his lips and strangely enough that day sticks in my memory as of delight rather than sadness when my poor mother had gone up the stairs on my grandfathers arm the strong soldier took me on his knee and drawing his pistol from his holster bade me snap the lock which i was barely able to do and he told me wonderful tales of the woods beyond the mountains and of the painted men who tracked them much wilder and fiercer they were than those stray nanticokes i had seen from time to time near carvel hall and when at last he would go i clung to him so he swung me to the back of his great horse ronald and i seized the bridle in my small hands the noble beast like his master loved a child well and he cantered off lightly at the captains whistle who cried bravo and ran by my side lest i should fall lifting me off at length he kissed me and bade me not to annoy my mother the tears in his eyes again and leaping on ronald was away for the ferry with never so much as a look behind leaving me standing in the road  and from that time i saw more of him and loved him better than any man save my grandfather he gave me a pony on my next birthday and a little hogskin saddle made especially by master wythe the london saddler in the town with a silvermounted bridle indeed rarely did the captain return from one of his long journeys without something for me and a handsome present for my mother mr carvel would have had him make his home with us when we were in town but this he would not do he lodged in church street over against the coffee house dining at that hostelry when not bidden out or when not with us he was much sought after i believe there was scarce a man of note in any of the colonies not numbered among his friends twas said he loved my mother and could never come to care for any other woman and he promised my father in the forests to look after her welfare and mine this promise you shall see he faithfully kept  though you have often heard from my lips the story of my mother i must for the sake of those who are to come after you set it down here as briefly as i may my grandfathers bark charming sally captain stanwix having set out from bristol on the 15th of april 1736 with a fair wind astern and a full cargo of english goods below near the madeiras fell in with foul weather which increased as she entered the trades captain stanwix being a prudent man shortened sail knowing the harbour of funchal to be but a shallow bight in the rock and worse than the open sea in a southeaster the third day he hove the sally to being a stout craft and not overladen she weathered the gale with the loss of a jib and was about making topsails again when a fullrigged ship was descried in the offing giving signals of distress night was coming on very fast and the sea was yet running too high for a boat to live but the gallant captain furled his topsails once more to await the morning it could be seen from her signals that the ship was living throughout the night but at dawn she foundered before the sallys boats could be put in the water one of them was ground to pieces on the falls out of the ships company and passengers they picked up but five souls four sailors and a little girl of two years or thereabouts the men knew nothing more of her than that she had come aboard at brest with her mother a quiet delicate lady who spoke little with the other passengers the ship was la favourite du roy bound for the french indies  captain stanwixs wife who was a good motherly person took charge of the little orphan and arriving at carvel hall delivered her to my grandfather who brought her up as his own daughter you may be sure the emblem of catholicism found upon her was destroyed and she was baptized straightway by doctor hilliard my grandfathers chaplain into the established church her clothes were of the finest quality and her little handkerchief had worked into the corner of it a coronet with the initials e de t beside it around her neck was that locket with the gold chain which i have so often shown you on one side of which is the miniature of the young officer in his most christian majestys uniform and on the other a yellowfaded slip of paper with these words elle est la mienne quoiquelle ne porte pas mou nom she is mine although she does not bear my name  my grandfather wrote to the owners of la favourite du roy and likewise directed his english agent to spare nothing in the search for some clew to the childs identity all that he found was that the mother had been entered on the passengerlist as madame la farge of paris and was bound for martinico of the father there was no trace whatever the name la farge the agent mr dix knew almost to a certainty was assumed and the coronet on the handkerchief implied that the child was of noble parentage the meaning conveyed by the paper in the locket which was plainly a clipping from a letter was such that mr carvel never showed it to my mother and would have destroyed it had he not felt that some day it might aid in solving the mystery so he kept it in his strongbox where he thought it safe from prying eyes but my uncle grafton ever a deceitful lad at length discovered the key and read the paper and afterwards used the knowledge he thus obtained as a reproach and a taunt against my mother i cannot even now write his name without repulsion  this new member of the household was renamed elizabeth carvel though they called her bess and of a course she was greatly petted and spoiled and ruled all those about her as she grew from childhood to womanhood her beauty became talked about and afterwards when mistress carvel went to the assembly a dozen young sparks would crowd about the door of her coach and older and more serious men lost their heads on her account  her devotion to mr carvel was such however that she seemed to care but little for the attention she received and she continued to grace his board and entertain his company he fairly worshipped her it was his delight to surprise her with presents from england with rich silks and brocades for gowns for he loved to see her bravely dressed the spinet he gave her inlaid with ivory we have still and he caused a chariot to be made for her in london and she had her own horses and her groom in the carvel livery  people said it was but natural that she should fall in love with captain jack my father he was the soldier of the family tall and straight and dashing he differed from his younger brother grafton as day from night captain jack was open and generous though a little given to rash enterprise and madcap adventure he loved my mother from a child his friend captain clapsaddle loved her too and likewise grafton but it soon became evident that she would marry captain jack or nobody he was my grandfathers favourite and though mr carvel had wished him more serious his joy when bess blushingly told him the news was a pleasure to see and grafton turned to revenge he went to mr carvel with the paper he had taken from the strongbox and claimed that my mother was of spurious birth and not fit to marry a carvel he afterwards spread the story secretly among the friends of the family by good fortune little harm arose therefrom since all who knew my mother loved her and were willing to give her credit for the doubt many indeed thought the story sprang from graftons jealousy and hatred then it was that mr carvel gave to grafton the estate in kent county and bade him shift for himself saying that he washed his hands of a son who had acted such a part  but captain clapsaddle came to the wedding in the long drawingroom at the hall and stood by captain jack when he was married and kissed the bride heartily and my mother cried about this afterwards and said that it grieved her sorely that she should have given pain to such a noble man  after the blow which left her a widow she continued to keep mr carvels home i recall her well chiefly as a sad and beautiful woman stately save when she kissed me with passion and said that i bore my fathers look she drooped like the flower she was and one spring day my grandfather led me to receive her blessing and to be folded for the last time in those dear arms with a smile on her lips she rose to heaven to meet my father and she lies buried with the rest of the carvels at the hall next to the brave captain her husband  and so i grew up with my grandfather spending the winters in town and the long summers on the eastern shore i loved the country best and the old house with its hundred feet of front standing on the gentle slope rising from the rivers mouth the green vines mr carvel had fetched from england all but hiding the brick and climbing to the angled roof and the velvet green lawn of silvery grass brought from england descending gently terrace by terrace to the waterside where lay our pungies and barges there was then a tiny pillared porch framing the front door for our ancestors never could be got to realize the maryland climate and would rarely build themselves wide verandas suitable to that colony at carvel hall we had to be sure the cool spring house under the willows for sultry days with its pool dished out for bathing and a trellised arbour and octagonal summer house with seats where my mother was wont to sit sewing while my grandfather dreamed over his pipe on the lawn stood the oaks and walnuts and sycamores which still cast their shade over it and under them of a summers evening mr carvel would have his tea alone save oftentimes when a barge would come swinging up the river with ten velvetcapped blacks at the oars and one of our friendly neighboursmr lloyd or mr bordley or perchance little mr mannerswould stop for a long evening with him they seldom came without their ladies and children what romps we youngsters had about the old place whilst our elders talked their politics  in childhood the season which delighted me the most was spring i would count the days until st taminas which as you knew falls on the first of may and the old custom was for the young men to deck themselves out as indian bucks and sweep down on the festivities around the maypole on the town green or at night to surprise the guests at a ball and force the gentlemen to pay down a shilling and sometimes a crown apiece and the host to give them a bowl of punch then came june my grandfather celebrated his majestys birthday in his own jolly fashion and i had my own birthday party on the tenth and on the fifteenth unless it chanced upon a sunday my grandfather never failed to embark in his pinnace at the annapolis dock for the hall once seated in the stern between mr carvels knees what rapture when at last we shot out into the blue waters of the bay and i thought of the long summer of joy before me scipio was generalissimo of these arrangements and was always at the dock punctually at ten to hand my grandfather in a ceremony in which he took great pride and to look his disapproval should we be late as he turned over the key of the town house he would walk away with a stern dignity to marshal the other servants in the horseboat  one fifteenth of june two children sat with bated breath in the pinnacedorothy manners and myself mistress dolly was then as mischievous a little baggage as ever she proved afterwards she was coming to pass a week at the hall her parents whose place was next to ours having gone to philadelphia on a visit we rounded kent island which lay green and beautiful in the flashing waters and at length caught sight of the old windmill with its great arms majestically turning and the cupola of carvel house shining white among the trees and of the upper spars of the shipping with sails neatly furled lying at the long wharves where the english wares mr carvel had commanded for the return trips were unloading scarce was the pinnace brought into the wind before i had leaped ashore and greeted with a shout the hall servants drawn up in a line on the green grinning a welcome dorothy and i scampered over the grass and into the cool wide house resting awhile on the easy sloping steps within hand in hand and then away for that grand tour of inspection we had been so long planning together how well i recall that sunny afternoon when the shadows of the great oaks were just beginning to lengthen through the greenhouses we marched monarchs of all we surveyed old porphery the gardener presenting mistress dolly with a crown of orange blossoms for which she thanked him with a pretty courtesy her governess had taught her were we not king and queen returned to our summer palace and spot and silver and song and knipe the wolfhound were our train though not as decorous as rigid etiquette demanded since they were forever running after the butterflies on we went through the stiff boxbordered walks of the garden past the weatherbeaten sundial and the spinninghouse and the smokehouse to the stables here old harvey who had taught me to ride captain daniels pony is equerry and young harvey our personal attendant old harvey smiles as we go in and out of the stalls rubbing the noses of our trusted friends and gives a gruff but kindly warning as to cassandras heels he recalls my father at the same age  jonas tree the carpenter sits sunning himself on his bench before the shop but mysteriously disappears when he sees us and returns presently with a little ship he has fashioned for me that winter all complete with spars and sails for jonas was a shipwright on the severn in the old country before he came as a kings passenger to the new dolly and i are off directly to the backwaters of the river where the new boat is launched with due ceremony as the conqueror his majestys latest shipoftheline jonas himself trims her sails and she sets off right gallantly across the shallows heeling to the breeze for all the world like a real manowar then the king would fain cruise at once against the french but queen dorothy must needs go with him his majesty points out that when fighting is to be done a ship of war is no place for a woman whereat her majesty stamps her little foot and throws her crown of orange blossoms from her and starts off for the milkhouse in high dudgeon vowing she will play no more  and it ends as it ever will end be the children young or old for the french pass from his majestys mind and he runs after his consort to implore forgiveness leaving poor jonas to take care of the conqueror  how short those summer days all too short for the girl and boy who had so much to do in them the sun rising over the forest often found us peeping through the blinds and when he sank into the bay at night we were still running tired but happy and begging patient hester for half an hour more  lawd marse dick i can hear her say you an miss dollys been on yo feet since de dawn and sos i honey  and so we had we would spend whole days on the wharves all bustle and excitement sometimes seated on the capstan of the sprightly bess or perched in the nettings of the oriole of which ship old stanwix was now captain he had grown gray in mr carvels service and good mrs stanwix was long since dead often we would mount together on the little horse captain daniel had given me dorothy on a pillion behind to go with my grandfather to inspect the farm mr starkie the overseer would ride beside us his fowlingpiece slung over his shoulder and his holster on his hip a kind man and capable and unlike mr evans my uncle graftons overseer was seldom known to use his firearms or the rawhide slung across his saddle the negroes in their linseywoolsey jackets and checked trousers would stand among the hills grinning at us children as we passed and there was not one of them nor of the white servants for that matter that i could not call by name  and all this time i was busily wooing mistress dolly but she little minx would give me no satisfaction i see her standing among the strawberries her black hair waving in the wind and her red lips redder still from the stain and the sound of her childish voice comes back to me now after all these years and this was my first proposal  dorothy when you grow up and i grow up you will marry me and i shall give you all these strawberries  i will marry none but a soldier says she and a great man  then will i be a soldier i cried and greater than the governor himself and i believed it  papa says i shall marry an earl retorts dorothy with a toss of her pretty head  there are no earls among us i exclaimed hotly for even then i had some of that sturdy republican spirit which prevailed among the younger generation our earls are those who have made their own way like my grandfather for i had lately heard captain clapsaddle say this and much more on the subject but dorothy turned up her nose  i shall go home when i am eighteenshe said and i shall meet his majesty the king  and to such an argument i found no logical answer  mr marmaduke manners and his lady came to fetch dorothy home he was a foppish little gentleman who thought more of the cut of his waistcoat than of the affairs of the province and would rather have been bidden to lead the assembly ball than to sit in council with his excellency the governor my first recollection of him is of contempt he must needs have his morning punch just so and complained whiningly of scipio if some perchance were spilled on the glass he must needs be taken abroad in a chair when it rained and though in the course of a summer he was often at carvel hall he never tarried long and came to see mr carvels guests rather than mr carvel he had little in common with my grandfather whose chief business and pleasure was to promote industry on his farm mr marmaduke was wont to rise at noon and knew not wheat from barley or good leaf from bad his hands he kept like a ladys rendering them almost useless by the long lace on the sleeves and his chief pastime was cardplaying it was but reasonable therefore when the troubles with the mother country began that he chose the kings side alike from indolence and contempt for things republican  of mrs manners i shall say more by and by  i took a mischievous delight in giving mr manners every annoyance my boyish fancy could conceive the evening of his arrival he and mr carvel set out for a stroll about the house mr marmaduke mincing his steps for it had rained that morning and presently they came upon the windmill with its long arms moving lazily in the light breeze near touching the ground as they passed for the mill was built in the dutch fashion i know not what moved me but hearing mr manners carelessly humming a minuet while my grandfather explained the usefulness of the mill i seized hold of one of the long arms as it swung by and before the gentlemen could prevent was carried slowly upwards dorothy screamed and her father stood stock still with amazement and fear mr carvel being the only one who kept his presence of mind hold on tight richard i heard him cry it was dizzy riding though the motion was not great and before i had reached the right angle i regretted my rashness i caught a glimpse of the bay with the red sun on it and as i turned saw far below me the white figure of ivie rawlinson the scotch miller who had run out o haith he shouted hand fast mr richardand so i clung tightly and came down without much inconvenience though indifferently glad to feel the ground again  mr marmaduke as i expected was in a great temper and swore he had not had such a fright for years he looked for mr carvel to cane me stoutly but ivie laughed heartily and said i wad yell gang far for anither laddie wi the spunk mr manners and with a sly look at my grandfather ilka day we hae some sic whigmeleery  i think mr carvel was not ill pleased with the feat or with mr marmadukes way of taking it for afterwards i overheard him telling the story to colonel lloyd and both gentlemen laughing over mr mannerss discomfiture     chapter iii caught by the tide  it is a nigh impossible task on the memory to trace those influences by which a lad is led to form his lifes opinions and for my part i hold that such things are bred into the bone and that events only serve to strengthen them in this way only can i account for my bitterness at a very early age against that king whom my seeming environment should have made me love for my grandfather was as stanch a royalist as ever held a cup to majestys health and children are most apt before they can reason for themselves to take the note from those of their elders who surround them it is true that many of mr carvels guests were of the opposite persuasion from him mr chase and mr carroll mr lloyd and mr bordley and many others including our friend captain clapsaddle and these gentlemen were frequently in argument but political discussion is greek to a lad  mr carvel as i have said was most of his life a member of the council a man from whom both governor sharpe and governor eden were glad to take advice because of his temperate judgment and deep knowledge of the people of the province at times when his council was scattered governor sharpe would consult mr carvel alone and often have i known my grandfather to embark in haste from the hall in response to a call from his excellency  twas in the latter part of august in the year 1765 made memorable by the stamp act that i first came in touch with the deepset feelings of the times then beginning and i count from that year the awakening of the sympathy which determined my career one sultry day i was wading in the shallows after crabs when the governors messenger came drifting in all impatience at the lack of wind he ran to the house to seek mr carvel and i after him with all a boys curiosity as fast as my small legs would carry me my grandfather hurried out to order his barge to be got ready at once so that i knew something important was at hand at first he refused me permission to go but afterwards relented and about eleven in the morning we pulled away strongly the ten blacks bending to the oars as if their lives were at stake  a wind arose before we sighted greensbury point and i saw a bark sailing in but thought nothing of this until mr carvel who had been silent and preoccupied called for his glass and swept her decks she soon shortened sail and went so leisurely that presently our light barge drew alongside and i perceived mr zachariah hood a merchant of the town returning from london hanging over her rail mr hood was very pale in spite of his seavoyage he flung up his cap at our boat but mr carvels salute in return was colder than he looked for as we came in view of the dock a fine rain was setting in and to my astonishment i beheld such a mass of people assembled as i had never seen and scarce standingroom on the wharves we were to have gone to the governors wharf in the severn but my grandfather changed his intention at once many of the crowd greeted him as we drew near them and having landed respectfully made room for him to pass through i followed him atremble with excitement and delight over such an unwonted experience we had barely gone ten paces however before mr carvel stopped abreast of mr claude mine host of the coffee house who cried  hast seen his majestys newest representative mr carvel  mr hood is on board the bark sir replied my grandfather i take it you mean mr hood  ay that i do mr zachariah hood come to lick stamps for his brothercolonists  after licking his majestys boots says a wag near by which brings a laugh from those about us i remembered that i had heard some talk as to how mr hood had sought and obtained from king george the office of stamp distributor for the province now my grandfather god rest him was as doughty an old gentleman as might well be and would not listen without protest to remarks which bordered sedition he had little fear of things below and none of a mob  my masters he shouted with a flourish of his stick so stoutly that people fell back from him know that ye are met against the law and endanger the peace of his lordships government  good enough mr carvel said claude who seemed to be the spokesman but how if we are stamped against law and his lordships government how then sir your honour well knows we have naught against either and are as peaceful a mob as ever assembled  this brought on a great laugh and they shouted from all sides how then mr carvel and my grandfather perceiving that he would lose dignity by argument and having done his duty by a protest was wisely content with that they opened wider the lane for him to pass through and he made his way erect and somewhat defiant to mr pryses the coachmaker opposite holding me by the hand the second storey of pryses shop had a little balcony standing out in front and here we established ourselves that we might watch what was going forward  the crowd below grew strangely silent as the bark came nearer and nearer until mr hood showed himself on the poop when there rose a storm of hisses mingled with shouts of derision how goes it at st james mr hood and have you tasted his majestys barley and some asked him if he was come as their member of parliament mr hood dropped a bow though what he said was drowned the bark came in prettily enough men in the crowd even catching her lines and making them fast to the piles a gangplank was thrown over come out mr hood they cried we are here to do you honour and to welcome you home again there were leather breeches with staves aplenty around that plank and faces that meant no trifling mcneir the rogue exclaimed mr carvel and that hulk of a tanner brown and i would know those smiths shoulders in a thousand right sir says pryse and twill serve them proper when the kings troops come among them for quartering pryse being the gentrys patron shaped his politics according to the company he was in he could ill be expected to seize one of his own ash spokes and join the resistance just then i caught a glimpse of captain clapsaddle on the skirts of the crowd and with him mr swain and some of the dissenting gentry and my boyish wrath burst forth against that man smirking and smiling on the decks of the bark so that i shouted shrilly mr hood will be cudgelled and tarred as he deserves and shook my little fist at him so that many under us laughed and cheered me mr carvel pushed me back into the window and out of their sight  the crew of the bark had assembled on the quarterdeck stout english tars every man of them armed with pikes and belayingpins and at a word from the mate they rushed in a body over the plank some were thrust off into the water but so fierce was their onset that others gained the wharf laying sharply about them in all directions but getting full as many knocks as they gave for a space there was a very bedlam of cries and broken heads those behind in the mob surging forward to reach the scrimmage forcing their own comrades over the edge mcneir had his thigh broken by a pike and was dragged back after the first rush was over and the mate of the bark was near to drowning being rescued indeed by graham the tanner mr hood stood white in the gangway dodging a missile now and then waiting his chance which never came for many of the sailors were captured and carried bodily to the rose and crown and the three blue balls where they became properly drunk on jamaica rum others made good their escape on board and at length the bark cast off again amidst jeers and threats and onethird of her crew missing and drifted slowly back to the roads  from the dock after all was quiet mr carvel stepped into his barge and rowed to the governors whose house was prettily situated near hanover street with ground running down to the severn his excellency appeared much relieved to see my grandfather mr daniel dulany was with him and the three gentlemen at once repaired to the governors writingcloset for consultation  mr carvels town house being closed we stopped with his excellency there were indeed scarce any of the gentry in town at that season save a few of the whig persuasion excitement ran very high farmers flocked in every day from the country round about to take part in the demonstration against the act mr hoods storehouse was burned to the ground mr hood getting ashore by stealth came however unmolested to annapolis and offered at a low price the goods he had brought out in the bark thinking thus to propitiate his enemies this step but inflamed them the more  my grandfather having much business to look to i was left to my own devices and the devices of an impetuous lad of twelve are not always such as his elders would choose for him i was continually burning with a desire to see what was proceeding in the town and hearing one day a great clamour and tolling of bells i ran out of the governors gate and down northwest street to the circle where a strange sight met my eyes a crowd like that i had seen on the dock had collected there mr swain and mr hammond and other barristers holding them in check mounted on a onehorse cart was a stuffed figure of the detested mr hood mr hammond made a speech but for the laughter and cheering i could not catch a word of it i pushed through the people as a boy will diving between legs to get a better view when i felt a hand upon my shoulder bringing me up suddenly and i recognized mr matthias tilghman and with him was mr samuel chase  does your grandfather know you are here lad said mr tilghman  i paused a moment for breath before i answered he attended the rally at the dock himself sir and i believe enjoyed it  both gentlemen smiled and mr chase remarked that if all the other party were like mr carvel troubles would soon cease i mean not grafton says he with a wink at mr tilghman  ill warrant richard your uncle would be but ill pleased to see you in such company  nay sir i replied for i never feared to speak up there are you wrong i think it would please my uncle mightily  the lad hath indifferent penetration said mr tilghman laughing and adding more soberly if you never do worse than this richard maryland may some day be proud of you  mr hammond having finished his speech a paper was placed in the hand of the effigy and the crowd bore it shouting and singing to the hill where mr john shaw the city carpenter had made a gibbet there nine and thirty lashes were bestowed on the unfortunate image the people crying out that this was the mosaic law and i cried as loud as any though i knew not the meaning of the words they hung mr hood to the gibbet and set fire to a tar barrel under him and so left him  the town wore a holiday look that day and i was loth to go back to the governors house good patriots shops were closed their owners parading as on sunday in their best pausing in knots at every corner to discuss the affair with which the town simmered i encountered old farris the clockmaker in his brown coat besprinkled behind with powder from his queue how now master richard says he merrily this is no place for young gentlemen of your persuasion  next i came upon young dr courtenay the wit of the tuesday club of whom i shall have more to say hereafter he was taking the air with mr james fotheringay wills eldest brother but lately back from oxford and the temple  the doctor wore fivepound ruffles and a tenpound wig was dressed in cherry silk and carried a long clouded cane his hat had the latest cock for he was our macaroni of annapolis  egad richard he cries you are the only other loyalist i have seen abroad today  i remember swelling with indignation at the affront i call them tories sir i flashed back and i am none such no tory says he nudging mr fotheringay who was with him i had as lief believe your grandfather hated king george i astonished them both by retorting that mr carvel might think as he pleased that being every mans right but that i chose to be a whig i would tell you as a friend young man replied the doctor that thy politics are not over politic and they left me puzzling laughing with much relish over some catch in the doctors words as for me i could perceive no humour in them  it was now near six of the clock but instead of going direct to the governors i made my way down church street toward the water near the dock i saw many people gathered in the street in front of the ship tavern a timehonoured resort much patronized by sailors my curiosity led me to halt there also the ship had stood in that place nigh on to threescore years it was said its latticed windows were swung open and from within came snatches of tom bowling rule britannia and many songs scarce fit for a child to hear now and anon some one in the street would throw back a taunt to these british sentiments which went unheeded they be drunk as lords said weld the butchers apprentice and when they comes out well hev more than one broken head in this street the songs continuing he cried again come out dn ye weld had had more than his own portion of rum that day spying me seated on the gatepost opposite he shouted so ho master carvel the streets are not for his majestys supporters today other artisans who were there bade him leave me in peace saying that my grandfather was a good friend of the people the matter might have ended there had i been older and wiser but the excitement of the day had gone to my head like wine i am as stout a patriot as you weld i shouted back and flushed at the cheering that followed and weld ran up to me and though i was a good piece of a lad swung me lightly onto his shoulder harkee master richard he said i can get nothing out of the poltroons by shouting do you go in and say that weld will fight any mothers son of them singlehanded  for shame to send a lad into a tavern said old bobbins who had known my grandfather these many years but the desire for a row was so great among the rest that they silenced him weld set me down and i nothing loth ran through the open door  i had never before been in the ship nor indeed in any tavern save that of master dingley near carvel hall the ship was a bare place enough with low black beams and sanded floor and rough tables and chairs set about on that september evening it was stifling hot and the odours from the men and the spilled rum and tobacco smoke wellnigh overpowered me the room was filled with a motley gang of sailors mostly from the bark mr hood had come on and some from hms hawk then lying in the harbour  a strapping manowarsman sat near the door his jacket thrown open and his great chest bared and when he perceived me he was in the act of proposing a catch twas the great bell o lincoln i believe and he held a brimming cup of bumbo in his hand in his surprise he set it awkwardly down again thereby spilling full half of it avast says he with an oath whats this come among us and he looked me over with a comical eye a dd provincial he went on scornfully but a gentlemans son or jack balls a liar whereupon his companions rose from their seats and crowded round me more than one reeled against me and though i was somewhat awed by the strangeness of that dark illsmelling room and by the rough company in which i found myself i held my ground and spoke up as strongly as i might  weld the butchers apprentice bids me say he will fight any man among you singlehanded  so ho my little gamecock my little schooner with a swivel said he who had called himself jack ball and where can this valiant butcher be found  he waits in the street i answered more boldly  split me fore and aft if he waits long said jack draining the rest of his rum and picking me up as easily as did weld he rushed out of the door and after him as many of his mates as could walk or stagger thither  in the meantime the news had got abroad in the street that the butchers apprentice was to fight one of the hawks men and when i emerged from the tavern the crowd had doubled and people were running hither in all haste from both directions but that fight was never to be big jack ball had scarce set me down and shouted a loud defiance shaking his fist at weld who stood out opposite when a soldierly man on a great horse turned the corner and wheeled between the combatants i knew at a glance it was captain clapsaddle and guiltily wished myself at the governors the townspeople knew him likewise and many were slinking away even before he spoke as his charger stood pawing the ground  whats this i hear you villain said he to weld in his deep ringing voice that you have not only provoked a row with one of the kings sailors but have dared send a child into that tavern with your fools message  weld was awkward and sullen enough and no words came to him  your tongue you sot the captain went on drawing his sword in his anger is it true you have made use of a gentlemans son for your low purposes  but weld was still silent and not a sound came from either side until old robbins spoke up  there are many here can say i warned him your honour he said  warned him cried the captain mr carvel has just given you twenty pounds for your wife and you warned him  robbins said no more and the butchers apprentice hanging his head as well he might before the captain i was much moved to pity for him seeing that my forwardness had in some sense led him on  twas in truth my fault captain i cried out the captain looked at me and said nothing after that the butcher made bold to take up his mans defence  master carvel was indeed somewhat to blame sir said he and weld is in liquor  and ill have him to pay for his drunkenness said captain clapsaddle hotly get to your homes he cried ye are a lot of idle hounds who would make liberty the excuse for riot he waved his sword at the pack of them and they scattered like sheep until none but weld was left and as for you weld he continued youll rue this pretty business or daniel clapsaddle never punished a cutthroat and turning to jack ball he bade him lift me to the saddle and so i rode with him to the governors without a word for i knew better than to talk when he was in that mood  the captain was made to tarry and sup with his excellency and my grandfather and i sat perforce a fourth at the table scarce daring to conjecture as to the outcome of my escapade but as luck would have it the governor had been that day in such worry and perplexity and my grandfather also that my absence had passed unnoticed nor did my good friend the captain utter a word to them of what he knew but afterwards he called me to him and set me upon his knee how big and kind and strong he was and how i loved his bluff soldiers face and blunt ways and when at last he spoke his words burnt deep in my memory so that even now i can repeat them  richard he said i perceive you are like your father i love your spirit greatly but you have been overrash today remember this lad that you are a gentleman the son of the bravest and truest gentleman i have ever known save one and he is destined to high things i know now that he spoke of colonel washington and that your mother here his voice trembledyour mother was a lady every inch of her and too good for this world remember and seek no company therefore beyond that circle in which you were born fear not to be kind and generous as i know you ever will be but choose not intimates from the tavern here the captain cleared his throat and seemed to seek for words i fear there are times coming my lad he went on presently when every man must choose his side and stand arrayed in his own colours it is not for me to shape your way of thinking decide in your own mind that which is right and when you have so decidedhe drew his sword as was his habit when greatly moved and placed his broad hand upon my headknow then that god is with you and swerve not from thy course the width of this blade for any man  we sat upon a little bench in the governors garden in front of us the wide severn merging into the bay and glowing like molten gold in the setting sun and i was thrilled with a strange reverence such as i have sometimes since felt in the presence of heroes     chapter iv grafton would heal an old breach  doctor hilliard my grandfathers chaplain was as holy a man as ever wore a gown but i can remember none of his discourses which moved me as much by half as those simple words captain clapsaddle had used the worthy doctor who had baptized both my mother and father died suddenly at carvel hall the spring following of a cold contracted while visiting a poor man who dwelt across the river he would have lacked but three years of fourscore come whitsuntide he was universally loved and respected in that district where he had lived so long and ably by rich and poor alike and those of many creeds saw him to his last restingplace mr carroll of carrollton who was an ardent catholic stood bareheaded beside the grave  doctor hilliard was indeed a beacon in a time when his profession among us was all but darkness and when many of the scandals of the community might be laid at the door of those whose duty it was to prevent them the fault lay without doubt in his lordships charter which gave to the parishioners no voice in the choosing of their pastors this matter was left to lord baltimores whim hence it was that he sent among us so many foxhunting and gaming parsons who read the service ill and preached drowsy and illiterate sermons gaming and foxhunting did i say these are but charitable words to cover the real characters of those impostors in holy orders whose doings would often bring the blush of shame to your cheeks nay i have seen a clergyman drunk in the pulpit and even in those freer days their laxity and immorality were such that many flocked to hear the parsons of the methodists and lutherans whose simple and eloquent words and simpler lives were worthy of their cloth small wonder was it when every strolling adventurer and soldier out of employment took orders and found favour in his lordships eyes and were given the fattest livings in place of worthier men that the established church fell somewhat into disrepute far be it from me to say that there were not good men and true in that church but the wag who writ this verse which became a common saying in maryland was not far wrong for the great body of them         who is a monster of the first renown         a lettered sot a drunkard in a gown  my grandfather did not replace dr hilliard at the hall afterwards saying the prayers himself the doctor had been my tutor and in spite of my waywardness and lack of love for the classics had taught me no little latin and greek and early instilled into my mind those principles necessary for the souls salvation i have often thought with regret on the pranks i played him more than once at lessontime have i gone off with hugo and young harvey for a rabbit hunt stealing two dogs from the pack and thus committing a double offence you may be sure i was well thrashed by mr carvel who thought the more of the latter misdoing though obliged to emphasize the former the doctor would never raise his hand against me his study where i recited my daily tasks was that small sunny room on the water side of the east wing and i well recall him as he sat behind his desk of a morning after prayers his horn spectacles perched on his high nose and his quill over his ear and his inkpowder and pewter stand beside him his face would grow more serious as i scanned my virgil in a faltering voice and as he descanted on a passage my eye would wander out over the green trees and fields to the glistening water what cared i for arma virumque at such a time i was watching nebo afishing beyond the point and as he waded ashore the burden on his shoulders had a much keener interest for me than that aeneas carried out of troy  my uncle grafton came to dr hilliards funeral choosing this opportunity to become reconciled to my grandfather who he feared had not much longer to live albeit mr carvel was as stout and hale as ever none of the mourners at the doctors grave showed more sorrow than did grafton a thousand remembrances of the good old man returned to him and i heard him telling mr carroll and some other gentlemen with much emotion how he had loved his reverend preceptor from whom he had learned nothing but what was good how fortunate are you richard he once said to have had such a spiritual and intellectual teacher in your youth would that philip might have learned from such a one and i trust you can say my lad that you have made the best of your advantages though i fear you are of a wild nature as your father was before you and my uncle sighed and crossed his hands behind his back tis perhaps better that poor john is in his grave he said grafton had a word and a smile for every one about the old place but little else being as he said but a younger son and a poor man i was near to forgetting the shilling he gave scipio twas not so unostentatiously done but that mr carvel and i marked it and afterwards i made scipio give me the coin replacing it with another and flung it as far into the river as ever i could throw  as was but proper to show his sorrow at the death of the old chaplain he had loved so much grafton came to the hall drest entirely in black he would have had his lady and philip a lad near my own age clad likewise in sombre colours but my aunt caroline would none of them holding it to be the right of her sex to dress as became its charms her silks and laces went but ill with the low estate my uncle claimed for his purse and master philips wardrobe was twice the size of mine and the family travelled in a coach as grand as mr carvels own with panels wreathed in flowers and a footman and outrider in livery from which my aunt descended like a duchess she embraced my grandfather with much warmth and kissed me effusively on both cheeks  and this is dear richard she cried philip come at once and greet your cousin he has not the look of the carvels she continued volubly but more resembles his mother as i recall her  indeed madam my grandfather answered somewhat testily he has the carvel nose and mouth though his chin is more pronounced he has elizabeths eyes  but my aunt was a woman who flew from one subject to another and she had already ceased to think of me she was in the hall the dear old home she cries though she had been in it but once before regarding lovingly each object as her eye rested upon it nay caressingly when she came to the great punchbowl and the carved mahogany dresser and the peter lely over the broad fireplace what memories they must bring to your mind my dear she remarks to her husband tis cruel as i once said to dear papa that we cannot always live under the old rafters we loved so well as children and the good lady brushes away a tear with her embroidered pocketnapkin tears that will come in spite of us all but she brightens instantly and smiles at the line of servants drawn up to welcome them this is scipio my son who was with your grandfather when your father was born and before master philip nods graciously in response to scipios delighted bow and harvey my aunt rattles on have you any new mares to surprise us with this year harvey harvey not being as overcome with mrs graftons condescension as was proper she turns again to mr carvel  ah father i see you are in sore need of a womans hand about the old house what a difference a touch makes to be sure and she takes off her gloves and attacks the morning room setting an ornament here and another there and drawing back for the effect such a bachelors hall as you are keeping  we still have willis caroline remonstrates my grandfather gravely i have no fault to find with her housekeeping  of course not father men never notice aunt caroline replies in an aggrieved tone and when willis herself comes in auguring no good from this visit my aunt gives her the tips of her fingers and i imagine i see a spark fly between them  as for grafton he was more than willing to let bygones be bygones between his father and himself aunt caroline said with feeling that dr hilliards death was a blessing after all since it brought a longseparated father and son together once more grafton had been misjudged and illused and he called heaven to witness that the quarrel had never been of his seekinga statement which mr carvel was at no pains to prove perjury how attentive was mr grafton to his fathers every want he read his gazette to him of a thursday though the old gentlemans eyes are as good as ever if mr carvel walks out of an evening graftons arm is ever ready and my uncle and his worthy lady are eager to take a hand at cards before supper philip my dear says my aunt thy grandfathers slippers or philip my love thy grandfathers hat and cane but it is plain that master philip has not been brought up to wait on his elders he is curled with a novel in his grandfathers easy chair by the window there is dio mamma who has naught to do but serve grandpapa says he and gives a pull at the cord over his head which rings the bell about the servants ears in the hall below and dio the whites of his eyes showing comes running into the room  it is nothing diomedes says mr carvel master philip will fetch what i need master philips papa and mamma stare at each other in a surprise mingled with no little alarm master philip being to all appearances intent upon his book  philip says my grandfather gently i had more than once heard him speak thus and well knew what was coming  sir replies my cousin without looking up follow me sir said mr carvel in a voice so different that philip drops his book they went up the stairs together and what occurred there i leave to the imagination but when next philip was bidden to do an errand for mr carvel my grandfather said quietly i prefer that richard should go caroline and though my aunt and uncle much mortified begged him to give philip another chance he would never permit it  nevertheless a great effort was made to restore philip to his grandfathers good graces at breakfast one morning after my aunt had poured mr carvels tea and made her customary compliment to the blue and gold breakfast china my uncle grafton spoke up  now that dr hilliard is gone father what do you purpose concerning richards schooling  he shall go to king williams school in the autumn mr carvel replied  in the autumn cried my uncle i do not give philip even the short holiday of this visit he has his greek and his virgil every day  and can repeat the best passages my aunt chimes in philip my dear recite that one your father so delights in  however unwilling master philip had been to disturb himself for errands he was nothing loth to show his knowledge and recited glibly enough several lines of his virgil verbatim thereby pleasing his fond parents greatly and my grandfather not a little  i will add a crown to your savings philip says his father  and here is a pistole to spend as you will says mr carvel tossing him the piece  nay father i do not encourage the lad to be a spendthrift says grafton taking the pistole himself i will place this token of your appreciation in his strongbox you know we have a prodigal strain in the family sir and my uncle looks at me significantly  let it be as i say grafton persists mr carvel who liked not to be balked in any matter and was not overpleased at this reference to my father and he gave philip forthwith another pistole telling his father to add the first to his saving if he would  and richard must have his chance says my aunt caroline sweetly as she rises to leave the room  ay here is a crown for you richard says my uncle smiling let us hear your latin which should be purer than philips  my grandfather glanced uneasily at me across the table he saw clearly the trick grafton had played me i think but for once i was equal to my uncle and haply remembered a line dr hilliard had expounded which fitted the present case marvellously well with little ceremony i tossed back the crown and slowly repeated those words used to warn the trojans against accepting the grecian horse          timeo danaos et dona ferentes  egad cried mr carvel slapping his knee the lad bath beaten you on your own ground grafton and he laughed as my grandfather only could laugh until the dishes rattled on the table but my uncle thought it no matter for jesting  philip was also well versed in politics for a lad of his age and could discuss glibly the right of parliament to tax the colonies he denounced the seditious doings in annapolis and boston town with an air of easy familiarity for philip had the memory of a parrot and twas easy to perceive whence his knowledge sprang but when my fine master spoke disparagingly of the tradesmen as at the bottom of the trouble my grandfathers patience came to an end  and what think you lies beneath the wealth and power of england philip he asked  her nobility sir and the riches she draws from her colonies retorts master philip readily enough  not so mr carvel said gravely she owes her greatness to her merchants or tradesmen as you choose to call them and commerce must be at the backbone of every great nation tradesmen exclaimed my grandfather where would any of us be were it not for trade we sell our tobacco and our wheat and get money in return and your father makes a deal here and a deal there and so gets rich in spite of his pittance  my uncle grafton raised his hand to protest but mr carvel continued i know you grafton i know you when a lad it was your habit to lay aside the money i gave you and so pretend you had none  and twas well i learned then to be careful said my uncle losing for the instant his control for you loved the spendthrift best and i should be but a beggar now without my wisdom  i loved not johns carelessness with money but other qualities in him which you lacked answered mr carvel  grafton shot a swift glance at me and so much of malice and of hatred was conveyed in that look that with a sense of prophecy i shuddered to think that some day i should have to cope with such craft for he detested me threefold and combined the hate he bore my dead father and mother with the illwill he bore me for standing in his way and philips with my grandfathers property but so deftly could he hide his feelings that he was smiling again instantly to see once however the white belly of the shark flash on the surface of the blue water is sufficient  i beg of you not to jest of me before the lads father said grafton  god knows there was little jest in what i said replied mr carvell soberly and i care not who hears it your own son will one day know you well enough if he does not now do not imagine because i am old that i am grown so foolish as to believe that a black sheep can become white save by dye and dye will never deceive such as me and philip the shrewd old gentleman went on turning to my cousin do not let thy father or any other make thee believe there cannot be two sides to every question i recognize in your arguments that which smacks of his tongue despite what he says of your reading the public prints and of forming your own opinions and do not condemn the whigs many of whom are worthy men and true because they quarrel with what they deem an unjust method of taxation  grafton had given many of the old servants cause to remember him harvey in particular who had come from england early in the century with my grandfather spoke with bitterness of him on the subject of my uncle the old coachmans taciturnity gave way to torrents of reproach beware of him as has no use for horses master richard he would say for this trait in grafton in harveys mind lay at the bottom of all others at my uncles approach he would retire into his shell like an oyster nor could he be got to utter more than a monosyllable in his presence harveys face would twitch and his fingers clench of themselves as he touched his cap and with my aunt caroline he was the same he vouchsafed but a curt reply to all her questions nor did her raptures over the stud soften him in the least she would come tripping into the stable yard daintily holding up her skirts and crying oh harvey i have heard so much of tanglefoot i must see him before i go tanglefoot is led out begrudgingly enough and aunt caroline goes over his points missing the greater part of them and remarking on the depth of chest which is nothing notable in tanglefoot harvey winks slyly at me the while and never so much as offers a word of correction you must take philip to ride richard my dear says my aunt his father was never as fond of it as i could have wished i hold that every gentleman should ride to hounds  humph grunts harvey when she is gone to the house  master philip to hunt indeed foxes to hunt foxes and he gives vent to a dry laugh over his joke in which i cannot but join horsemen grows eh master richard there was captain jack who jumped from the cradle into the saddle and i never once seen a horse get the better o him and thats gods truth and he smooths out tanglefoots mane adding reflectively and you be just like him but there was scarce a horse in the stables what wouldnt lay back his ears at mr grafton and small blame to em say i he never dared go near em oh master philip comes by it honestly enough she thinks old harvey dont know a thoroughbred when he sees one sir but mrs graftons no thoroughbred i tell ee that though im saying nothing as to her points mark ye ive seen her sort in the old country and ive seen em here and its the same the world over in injy and chiny too fine trappings dont make the horse and they dont take thoroughbreds from a grocers cart a philadelphy grocer sniffs this old aristocrat id knowed her father was a grocer had i seen her in pall mall with a royal highness by her gait i may say thy mother was a thoroughbred master richard and ill tell ee another he goes on with a chuckle mistress dorothy manners is such another you dont mistake em with their high heads and patreeshan ways though her father be one of them accidents as will occur in every stock shes one to tame sir and i dont envy no young gentleman the task but this i knows says harvey not heeding my red cheeks that master philip with all his satin smallclothes will never do it  indeed it was no secret that my aunt caroline had been a miss flaven of philadelphia though she would have had the fashion of our province to believe that she belonged to the governors set there and she spoke in terms of easy familiarity of the first families of her native city deceiving no one save herself poor lady how fondly do we believe with the ostrich that our body is hidden when our head is tucked under our wing not a visitor in philadelphia but knew terence flaven mrs grafton carvels father who not many years since sold tea and spices and soap and glazed teapots over his own counter and still advertised his cargoes in the public prints he was a broad and charitableminded man enough and unassuming but gave way at last to the pressure brought upon him by his wife and daughter and bought a mansion in front street terence flaven never could be got to stay there save to sleep and preferred to spend his time in his shop which was grown greatly chatting with his customers and bowing the ladies to their chariots i need hardly say that this worthy man was on far better terms than his family with those personages whose society they strove so hard to attain  at the time of miss flavens marriage to my uncle twas a piece of gossip in every month that he had taken her for her dower which was not inconsiderable though to hear mr and mrs grafton talk they knew not whence the next months provender was to come they went to live in kent county as i have said spending some winters in philadelphia where mr grafton was thought to have interests though it never could be discovered what his investments were on hearing of his marriage which took place shortly before my fathers mr carvel expressed neither displeasure nor surprise but he would not hear of my mothers request to settle a portion upon his younger son  he has the kent estate bess said he which is by far too good for him never doubt but that the rogue can feather his own nest far better than can i as indeed he hath already done and by the lord cried mr carvel bringing his fist down upon the cardtable where they sat he shall never get another farthing of my money while i live nor afterwards if i can help it i would rather give it over to mr carroll to found a nunnery  and so that matter ended for mr carvel could not be moved from a purpose he had once made nor would he make any advances whatsoever to grafton or receive those hints which my uncle was forever dropping until at length he begged to be allowed to come to dr hilliards funeral a request my grandfather could not in decency refuse twas a pathetic letter in truth and served its purpose well though it was not as dust in the old gentlemans eyes he called me into his bedroom and told me that my uncle grafton was coming at last and seeing that i said nothing thereto he gave me a queer look and bade me treat them as civilly as i knew how i well know thy temper richard said he and i fear twill bring thee trouble enough in life try to control it my lad take an old mans advice and try to control it he was in one of his gentler moods and passed his arm about me and together we stood looking silently through the square panes out into the rain at the ducks paddling in the puddles until the darkness hid them  and god knows lad that i was i tried to be civil to them but my tongue rebelled at the very sight of my uncle twas bred into me i suppose and his fairest words seemed to me to contain a hidden sting once when he spoke in his innuendo of my father i ran from the room to restrain some act of violence i know not what i should have done and willis found me in the deserted study of the doctor where my hot tears had stained the flowered paper on the wall she did her best to calm me good soul though she had her own troubles with my lady caroline to think about at the time  i had one experience with master philip before our visitors betook themselves back to kent which unfortunate as it was i cannot but relate here my cousin would enter into none of those rough amusements in which i passed my time for fear i took it of spoiling his fine broadcloths or of losing a gold buckle he never could be got to wrestle though i challenged him more than once and he was a wellbuilt lad and might with a little practice have become skilled in that sport he laughed at the homespun i wore about the farm saying it was no costume for a gentlemans son and begged me sneeringly to don leather breeches he would have none of the company of those lads with whom i found pleasure young harvey and williss son who was being trained as mr starkies assistant nor indeed did i disdain to join in a game with hugo who had been given to me and other negro lads philip saw no sport in a wrestle or a fight between two of the boys from the quarters and marvelled that i could lower myself to bet with harvey the younger he took not a spark of interest in the gaming cocks we raised together to compete at the local contests and at the fair and knew not a gaff from a cockspur being one day at my wits end to amuse my cousin i proposed to him a game of quoits on the green beside the springhouse and thither we repaired followed by hugo and young harvey come to look on master philip not casting as well as he might cries out suddenly to hugo begone you black dog what business have you here watching a game between gentlemen  he is my servant cousin i said quietly and no dog if you please and he is under my orders not yours  but philip having scarcely scored a point was in a rage and ill not have him here he shouted giving poor hugo a cuff which sent him stumbling over the stake and turning to me continued insolently ever since we came here i have marked your manner toward us as though my father had no right in my grandfathers house  then could i no longer contain myself i heard young harvey laugh and remark tis all up with master philip now but philip whatever else he may have been was no coward and had squared off to face me by the time i had run the distance between the stakes he was heavier than i though not so tall and he parried my first blow and my second and many more having lively work of it however for i hit him as often as i was able to speak truth i had not looked for such resistance and seeing that i could not knock him down out of hand i grew more cool and began to study what i was doing  take off your macaroni coat said i i have no wish to ruin your clothes  but he only jeered in return take off thy woolsack and hugo getting to his feet cried out to me not to hurt marse philip that he had meant no harm but this only enraged philip the more and he swore a round oath at hugo and another at me and dealt a vicious blow at my stomach whereat harvey called out to him to fight fair he was more skilful at the science of boxing than i though i was the better fighter having i am sorry to say fought but too often before and presently when i had closed one of his eyes his skill went all to pieces and he made a mad rush at me as he went by i struck him so hard that he fell heavily and lay motionless  young harvey ran into the springhouse and filled his hat as i bent over my cousin i unbuttoned his waistcoat and felt his heart and rejoiced to find it beating we poured cold water over his face and wrists by then hugo who was badly frightened had told the news in the house and i saw my aunt caroline come running over the green as fast as her tight stays would permit crying out that i had killed her boy her dear philip and after her came my uncle grafton and my grandfather with all the servants who had been in hearing i was near to crying myself at the thought that i should grieve my grandfather and my aunt as she knelt over philip pushed me away and bade me not touch him but my cousin opened one of his eyes and raised his hand to his head  thank heaven he is not killed exclaims aunt caroline fervently  thank god indeed echoes my uncle and gives me a look as much as to say that i am not to be thanked for it i have often warned you sir he says to mr carvel that we do not inherit from stocks and stones and so much has come of our charity  i knew lad that i was that he spoke of my mother and my blood boiled within me  have a care sir with your veiled insults i cried or i will serve you as i have served your son  grafton threw up his hands  what have we harboured father says he but mr carvel seized him by the shoulder peace grafton before the servants he said and cease thy crying caroline the lad is not hurt and being a tall man six feet in his stockings and strong despite his age he raised philip from the grass and sternly bade him walk to the house which he did leaning on his mothers arm as for you richard my grandfather went on you will go into my study  into his study i went where presently he came also and i told him the affair in as few words as i might and he knowing my hatred of falsehood questioned me not at all but paced to and fro i following him with my eyes and truly sorry that i had given him pain and finally he dismissed me bidding me make it up with my cousin which i was nothing loth to do what he said to philip and his father i know not that evening we shook hands though philips face was much swollen and my uncle smiled and was even pleasanter than before saying that boys would be boys but i think my aunt caroline could never wholly hide the malice she bore me for what i had done that day  when at last the visitors were gone every face on the plantation wore a brighter look harvey said god bless their backs which is the only part i ever care to see of their honours and willis gave us a supper fit for a king mr lloyd and his lady were with us and mr carvel told his old stories of the time of the first george many of which i can even now repeat how he and two other collegians fought half a dozen mohocks in norfolk street and fairly beat them and how he discovered by chance a jacobite refugee in greenwich and what came of it nor did he forget that ofttold episode with dean swift and these he rehearsed in such merry spirit and new guise that we scarce recognized them and colonel lloyd so choked with laughter that more than once he had to be hit between the shoulders     chapter v if ladies be but young and fair  no boyhood could have been happier than mine and throughout it ever present with me were a shadow and a light the shadow was my uncle grafton i know not what strange intuition of the child made me think of him so constantly after that visit he paid us but often i would wake from my sleep with his name upon my lips and a dread at my heart the lightneed i saywas miss dorothy manners little miss dolly was often at the hall after that happy week we spent together and her home wilmot house was scarce three miles across wood and field by our plantation roads i was a stout little fellow enough and before i was twelve i had learned to follow to hounds my grandfathers guests on my pony and mr lloyd and mr carvel when they shot on the duck points ay and what may surprise you my dears i was given a weak little toddy off the noggin at night while the gentlemen stretched their limbs before the fire or played at whist or loo mr carvel would have no milksop so he said but he early impressed upon me that moderation was the mark of a true man even as excess was that of a weak one  and so it was no wonder that i frequently found my way to wilmot house alone there i often stayed the whole day long romping with dolly at games of our own invention and many the time i was sent home after dark by mrs manners with jim the groom about once in the week mr and mrs manners would bring dorothy over for dinner or tea at the hall she grew quicklyso quickly that i scarce realizedinto a tall slip of a girl who could be wilful and cruel laughing or forgiving shy or impudent in a breath she had as many moods as the sea i have heard her entertain mr lloyd and mr bordley and the ladies and my grandfather by the hour while i sat by silent and miserable but proud of her all the same boylike i had grown to think of her as my possession tho she gave me no reason whatever i believe i had held my hand over fire for her at a word and indeed i did many of her biddings to make me wonder now that i was not killed it used to please her ivie too to see me go the round of the windmill tho she would cry out after i left the ground and once when it was turning faster than common and ivie not there to prevent i near lost my hold at the top and was thrown at the bottom with such force that i lay stunned for a full minute i opened my eyes to find her bending over me with such a look of fright and remorse upon her face as i shall never forget again walking out on the bowsprit of the oriole while she stood watching me from the dock i lost my balance and fell into the water on another occasion i fought will fotheringay whose parents had come for a visit because he dared say he would marry her  she is to marry an earl i cried tho i had thrashed another lad for saying so mr manners is to take her home when she is grown to marry her to an earl  at least she will not marry you master richard sneered will and then i hit him  indeed even at that early day the girls beauty was enough to make her talked about and that foolish little fop her father had more than once declared before a company in our dining room that it was high time another title came into his family and that he meant to take dolly abroad when she was sixteen lad that i was i would mark with pain the blush on mrs mannerss cheek and clinch my fists as she tried to pass this off as a joke of her husbands but dolly who sat next me at a side table would make a wry little face at my angry one  you shall call me my lady richard and sometimes if you are good you shall ride inside my coroneted coach when you come home  ah that was the worst of it the vixen was conscious of her beauty but her airs were so natural that young and old bowed before her nothing but worship had she had from the cradle i would that mr peale had painted her in her girlhood as a type of our maryland lady of quality harvey was right when he called her a thoroughbred her nose was of patrician straightness and the curves of her mouth came from generations of proud ancestors and she had blue eyes to conquer and subdue with long lashes to hide them under when she chose and black hair with blue gloss upon it in the slanting lights i believe i loved her best in the ridinghabit that was the colour of the red holly in our maryland woods at christmastide when we came to the eastern shore we would gallop together through miles of country the farmers and servants tipping and staring after her as she laid her silverhandled whip upon her pony she knew not the meaning of fear and would take a fence or a ditch that a man might pause at and so i fell into the habit of leading her the easy way round for dread that she would be hurt  how those christmas times of childhood come sweeping back on my memory often and without warning my grandfather would say to me richard we shall celebrate at the hall this year and it rarely turned out that arrangements had not been made with the lloyds and the bordleys and the manners and other neighbours to go to the country for the holidays i have no occasion in these pages to mention my intimacy with the sons and daughters of those good friends of the carvels colonel lloyd and mr bordley some of them are dead now and the rest can thank god and look back upon worthy and useful lives and if any of these my old playmates could read this manuscript perchance they might feel a tingle of recollection of childrens day when maryland was a province we rarely had snow sometimes a crust upon the ground that was melted into paste by the noonday sun but more frequently so it seems to me a foggy drizzly christmas with the fires crackling in saloon and ladys chamber and when my grandfather and the ladies and gentlemen his guests came down the curving stairs there were the broadly smiling servants drawn up in the wide hallall who could gather thereand the rest on the lawn outside to wish merry chrismas to de quality the redemptioners in front headed by ivie and jonas tree tho they had long served their terms and with them old harvey and his son next the house blacks and the outside liveries and then the oldest slaves from the quarters this line reached the door which scipio would throw open at de qualitys appearance disclosing the rest of the field servants in brightcoloured gowns and the little negroes on the green then mr carvel would make them a little speech of thanks and of goodwill and whitehaired johnson of the senior quarters who had been with my greatgrandfather would start the carol in a quaver how clear and sweet the melody of those negro voices comes back to me through the generations and the picture of the hall loaded with holly and mistletoe even to the great arch that spanned it with the generous bowls of eggnog and punch on the mahogany by the wall and the ladies our guests in cap and apron joining in the swelling hymn ay and the men too and then after the breakfast of sweet ham and venison and hot bread and sausage made under mrs willis and tea and coffee and chocolate steaming in the silver and ale for the gentlemen if they preferred came the prayers and more carols in the big drawingroom and then music in the big house or perhaps a ride afield to greet the neighbours and fiddling and dancing in the two big quarters hanks and johnsons when the tables were cleared after the bountiful feast mr carvel was wont to give them there was no stint my dearsnaught but good cheer and praising god in sheer happiness at carvel hall  at night there was always a ball sometimes at wilmot house sometimes at colonel lloyds or mr bordleys and sometimes at carvel hall for my grandfather dearly loved the company of the young he himself would lead off the minuetsave when once or twice his excellency governor sharpe chanced to be presentand would draw his sword with the young gallants that the ladies might pass under and i have seen him join merrily in the country dances too to the clapping of hands of the company that was before dolly and i were let upon the floor we sat with the other children our mammies at our sides in the narrow gallery with the tiny rail that ran around the ballroom where the sweet odour of the green myrtleberry candles mixed with that of the powder and perfume of the dancers and when the beauty of the evening was led out dolly would lean over the rail and pout and smile by turns the mischievous little baggage could hardly wait for the conquering years to come  they came soon enough alack the season dorothy was fourteen we had a ball at the hall the last day of the year when she was that age she had near arrived at her growth and was full as tall as many young ladies of twenty i had cantered with her that morning from wilmot house to mr lloyds and thence to carvel hall where she was to stay to dinner the sun was shining warmly and after young harvey had taken our horses we strayed through the house where the servants were busy decorating and out into my grandfathers old english flower garden and took the seat by the sundial i remember that it gave no shadow we sat silent for a while dorothy toying with old knipe lying at our feet and humming gayly the burden of a minuet she had been flighty on the ride with scarce a word to say to me for the prospect of the dance had gone to her head  have you a new suit to wear tonight to see the new year in master sober she asked presently looking up i am to wear a brocade that came out this autumn from london and papa says i look like a duchess when i have my grandmothers pearls  always the ball cried i slapping my boots in a temper is it then such a matter of importance i am sure you have danced beforeat my birthdays in marlboro street and at your own and will fotheringays and i know not how many others  of course replies dolly sweetly but never with a real man boys like you and will and the lloyds do not count dr courtenay is at wilmot house and is coming tonight and he has asked me out think of it richard dr courtenay  a plague upon him he is a fop  a fop exclaimed dolly her humour bettering as mine went down oh no you are jealous he is more sought after than any gentleman at the assemblies and miss dulany vows his steps are ravishing theres for you my lad he may not be able to keep pace with you in the chase but he has writ the most delicate verses ever printed in maryland and no other man in the colony can turn a compliment with his grace shall i tell you more he sat with me for over an hour last night until mamma sent me off to bed and was very angry at you because i had engaged to ride with you today  and i suppose you wish you had stayed with him i flung back hotly he had spun you a score of fine speeches and a hundred empty compliments by now  he had been better company than you sir she laughed provokingly i never heard you turn a compliment in your life and you are now seventeen what headway do you expect to make at the assemblies  none i answered rather sadly than otherwise for she had touched me upon a sore spot but if i cannot win a woman save by compliments i added flaring up then may i pay a bachelors tax  my lady drew her whip across my knee  you must tell us we are beautiful richard said she in another tone  you have but to look in a pierglass i retorted and besides that is not sufficient you will want some rhyming couplet out of a mythology before you are content  she laughed again  sir answered she but you have wit if you can but be got angry  she leaned over the dials face and began to draw the latin numerals with her finger so arch withal that i forgot my illhumour  if you would but agree to stay angry for a day she went on in a low tone perhaps  perhaps  perhaps you would be better company said dorothy you would surely be more entertaining  dorothy i love you i said  to be sure i know that she replied i think you have said that before  i admitted it sadly but i should be a better husband than dr courtenay  la cried she i am not thinking of husbands i shall have a good time sir i promise you before i marry and then i should never marry you you are much too rough and too masterful and you would require obedience i shall never obey any man you would be too strict a master sir i can see it with your dogs and your servants and your friends too for you thrash any boy who does not agree with you i want no rough squire for a husband and then you are a whig i could never marry a whig you behaved disgracefully at king williams school last year dont deny it  deny it i cried warmly i would as soon deny that you are an arrant flirt dorothy manners and will be a worse one  yes i shall have my fling said the minx i shall begin tonight with you for an audience i shall make the doctor look to himself but there is the dressingbell and as we went into the house i believe my mother is a whig richard all the brices are  and yet you are a tory  i am a loyalist says my lady tossing her head proudly and we are one day to kiss her majestys hand and tell her so and if i were the queen she finished in a flash i would teach you surly gentlemen not to meddle  and she swept up the stairs so stately that scipio was moved to say slyly dems de kind of ladies marse richard i jes dotes t wait on  of the affair at king williams school i shall tell later  we had some dozen guests staying at the hall for the ball at dinner my grandfather and the gentlemen twitted her and laughed heartily at her apt retorts and even toasted her when she was gone the ladies shook their heads and nudged one another and no doubt each of the mothers had her notion of what she would do in mrs mannerss place but when my lady came down dressed for the ball in her pink brocade with the pearls around her neck fresh from the hands of nester and those of her own tremulous mammy mr carvel must needs go up to her and hold her at arms length in admiration and then kiss her on both her cheeks whereat she blushed right prettily  bless me says he and can this be richards little playmate grown upon my word miss dolly youll be the belle of the ball eh lloyd bless me bless me you must not mind a kiss from an old man the young ones may have their turn after a while he laughed as my grandfather only could laugh and turned to me who had reddened to my forehead and so richard she has outstripped you fair and square you are only an awkward lad and shewhy i faith in two years shell be beyond my protection come miss dolly says he ill show you the mistletoe that you may beware of it  and he led her off on his arm the old year and the new gentlemen he cried merrily as he passed the door with dollys mammy and nester simpering with pride on the landing  the company arrived in coach and saddle many having come so far that they were to stay the night young mr beall carried his bride on a pillion behind him her red ridingcloak flung over her ball dress mr bordley and family came in his barge mr marmaduke and his wife in coach and four with them was dr courtenay arrayed in peachcoloured coat and waistcoat with black satin breeches and white silk stockings and pinchbeck buckles asparkle on his shoes how i envied him as he descended the stairs stroking his ruffles and greeting the company with the indifferent ease that was then the fashion i fancied i saw his eyes wander among the ladies and not marking her he crossed over to where i stood disconsolate before the fireplace  why richard my lad says he you are quite grown since i saw you and the little girl that was your playmatemiss dolly i meanhas outstripped me egad she has become suddenly une belle demoiselle like a rose that blooms in a night  i answered nothing at all but i had given much to know whether my stolid manner disconcerted him unconsciously i sought the bluff face above the chimney depicted in all its ruggedness by the painter of king charless day and contrasted with the bundle of finery at my side dr courtenay certainly caught the look he opened his snuffbox took a pinch turned on his heel and sauntered off  what did you say richard asked mr lloyd coming up to me laughing for he had seen the incident  i looked merely at the man of marston moor sir and said nothing  faith twas a better answer than if you had used your tongue i think answered my friend but he teased me a deal that night when dolly danced with the doctor and my grandfather bade me look to my honours my young lady flung her head higher than ever and made a minuet as well as any dame upon the floor while i stood very glum at the thought of the prize slipping from my grasp now and then in the midst of a figure she would shoot me an arch glance as much as to say that her pinions were strong now but when it came to the country dances my lady comes up to me ever so prettily and asks the favour  tis a monstrous state indeed when i have to beg you for a reel says she  and so was i made happy     chapter vi i first suffer for the cause  in the eighteenth century the march of public events was much more eagerly followed than now by men and women of all stations and even children each citizen was ready nay forward in taking an active part in all political movements and the children mimicked their elders old william farris read his news of a morning before he began the mending of his watches and by evening had so well digested them that he was primed for discussion with pryse of the opposite persuasion at the rose and crown sol mogg the sexton of st annes had his beloved gazette in his pocket as he tolled the church bell of a thursday and would hold forth on the rights and liberties of man with the carpenter who mended the steeple mrs willard could talk of grenville and townshend as knowingly as her husband the rich factor and francie willard made many a speech to us younger sons of liberty on the steps of king williams school we younger sons indeed declared bitter war against the mothercountry long before our conservative old province ever dreamed of secession for maryland was well pleased with his lordships government  i fear that i got at king williams school learning of a far different sort than pleased my grandfather in those days the school stood upon the stadt house hill near school street not having moved to its present larger quarters mr isaac daaken was then master and had under him some eighty scholars after all these years mr daaken stands before me a prominent figure of the past in an illfitting suit of snuff colour how well i recall that schoolroom of a bright morning the suns rays shot hither and thither and split violet green and red by the bulging glass panes of the windows and by a strange irony it so chanced that where the dominie satand he moved not the whole morning long save to reach for his birchesthe crimson ray would often rest on the end of his long nose and the word rum be passed tittering along the benches for some men are born to the mill and others to the mitre and still others to the sceptre but mr daaken was born to the birch his long lanky legs were made for striding after culprits and his arms for caning them he taught among other things the classics of course the english language grammatically arithmetic in all its branches bookkeeping in the italian manner and the elements of algebra geometry and trigonometry with their applications to surveying and navigation he also wrote various sorts of hands fearful and marvellous to the uninitiated with which he was wont to decorate my monthly reports to my grandfather i can shut my eyes and see now that wonderful hyperbola in the c in carvel which after travelling around the paper ended in intricate curves and a flourish which surely must have broken the quill  the last day of every month would i fetch that scrolled note to mr carvel and he laid it beside his plate until dinner was over and then as sure as the sun rose that morning my flogging would come before it set this done with and another promised next month provided mr daaken wrote no better of me my grandfather and i renewed our customary footing of love and companionship  but mr daaken unwittingly or designedly taught other things than those i have mentioned above and though i never once heard a word of politics fall from his lips his school shortly became known to all good tories as a nursery of conspiracy and sedition there are other ways of teaching besides preaching and of that which the dominie taught best he spoke not a word he was credited you may well believe with calumnies against king george and once my uncle grafton and mr dulany were for clapping him in jail avowing that he taught treason to the young i can account for the tone of king williams school in no other way than to say that patriotism was in the very atmosphere and seemed to exude in some mysterious way from mr daakens person and most of us became infected with it  the dominie lived outside the town in a lonely little hamlet on the borders of the spa at two of the clock every afternoon he would dive through school street to the coffee house where the hostler would have his bony mare saddled and waiting mr daaken by no chance ever entered the tavern i recall one bright day in april when i played truant and had the temerity to go afishing on spa creek with will fotheringay the bass being plentiful there we had royal sport of it that morning and two oclock came and went with never a thought you may be sure and presently i get a pull which bends my english rod near to double and in my excitement plunge waist deep into the water will crying out directions from the shore when suddenly the head of mr daakens mare is thrust through the bushes followed by mr daaken himself will stood stock still from fright and i was for dropping my rod and cutting when i was arrested by the dominie calling out  have a care master carvel have a care sir you will lose him play him sir let him run a bit  and down he leaps from his horse and into the water after me and together we landed a threepound bass thereby drenching his snuffcoloured suit when the big fish lay shining in the basket the dominie smiled grimly at william and me as we stood sheepishly by and without a word he drew his clasp knife and cut a stout switch from the willow near and then and there he gave us such a thrashing as we remembered for many a day after and we both had another when we reached home  mr carvel said mr dulany to my grandfather i would strongly counsel you to take richard from that school pernicious doctrines sir are in the air and like diseases are early caught by the young twas but yesterday i saw richard at the head of a rabble of the sons of riffraff in green street and their treatment of mr fairbrother hath set the whole town by the ears  what mr dulany had said was true the lads of mr fairbrothers school being mostly of the unpopular party we of king williams had organized our cohorts and led them on to a signal victory we fell upon the enemy even as they were emerging from their stronghold the schoolhouse and smote them hip and thigh with the sheriff of anne arundel county a laughing spectator some of the tories for such we were pleased to call them took refuge behind mr fairbrothers skirts who shook his cane angrily enough but without avail others of the tory brood fought stoutly calling out god save the king and down with the traitors on our side francie willard fell and archie dennison raised a lump on my head the size of a goose egg but we fairly beat them and afterwards must needs attack the tory dominie himself he cried out lustily to the sheriff and spectators of whom there were many by this time for help but got little but laughter for his effort young lloyd and i being large lads for our age fairly pinioned the screeching master who cried out that he was being murdered and keeping his cane for a trophy thrust him bodily into his house of learning turned the great key upon him and so left him he made his escape by a window and sought my grandfather in the duke of marlboro street as fast as ever his indignant legs would carry him  of his interview with mr carvel i know nothing save that scipio was requested presently to show him the door and conclude therefrom that his language was but illchosen scipios patrician blood was wont to rise in the presence of those whom he deemed outside the pale of good society and i fear he ushered mr fairbrother to the street with little of that superior manner he used to the first families as for mr daaken i feel sure he was not illpleased at the discomfiture of his rival though it cost him five of his scholars  our schoolboy battle though lightly undertaken was fraught with no inconsiderable consequences for me i was duly chided and soundly whipped by my grandfather for the part i had played but he was inclined to pass the matter after that and set it down to the desire for fighting common to most boyish natures and he would have gone no farther than this had it not been that mr green of the maryland gazette could not refrain from printing the story in his paper that gentleman being a stout whig took great delight in pointing out that a grandson of mr carvel was a ringleader in the affair the story was indeed laughable enough and many a barristers wig nodded over it at the coffee house that day when i came home from school i found scipio beside my grandfathers empty seat in the diningroom and i learned that mr carvel was in the garden with my uncle grafton and the reverend bennett allen rector of st annes i well knew that something out of the common was in the wind to disturb my grandfathers dinner into the garden i went and under the black walnut tree i beheld mr carvel pacing up and down in great unrest his gazette in his hand while on the bench sat my uncle and the rector of st annes so occupied was each in his own thought that my coming was unperceived and i paused in my steps seized suddenly by an instinctive dread i know not of what the fear of mr carvels displeasure passed from my mind so that i cared not how soundly he thrashed me and my heart filled with a yearning born of the instant for that simple and brave old gentleman for the lad is nearer to nature than the man and the animal oft scents a danger the master cannot see i read plainly in mr allens handsome face flushed red with wine as it ever was and in my uncle graftons looks a snare to which i knew my grandfather was blind i never rightly understood how it was that mr carvel was deceived in mr allen perchance the secret lay in his bold manner and in the appearance of dignity and piety he wore as a cloak when on his guard i caught my breath sharply and took my way toward them resolved to make as brave a front as i might it was my uncle whose ear was ever open that first heard my footstep and turned upon me  here is richard now father he said  i gave him so square a look that he bent his head to the ground my grandfather stopped in his pacing and his eye rested upon me in sorrow rather than in anger i thought  richard he began and paused for the first time in my life i saw him irresolute he looked appealingly at the rector who rose mr allen was a man of good height and broad shoulders with piercing black eyes reminding one more of the smallsword than aught else i can think of and he spoke solemnly in a deep voice as though from the pulpit  i fear it is my duty richard to say what mr carvel cannot it grieves me to tell you sir that young as you are you have been guilty of treason against the king and of grave offence against his lordships government i cannot mitigate my words sir by your rashness richard and i pray it is such you have brought grief to your grandfather in his age and ridicule and reproach upon a family whose loyalty has hitherto been unstained  i scarce waited for him to finish his pompous words stung me like the lash of a whip and i gave no heed to his cloth as i answered  if i have grieved my grandfather sir i am heartily sorry and will answer to him for what i have done and i would have you know mr allen that i am as able as any to care for the carvel honour  i spoke with a vehemence for the thought carried me beyond myself that this upstart parson his lordship had but a year since sent among us should question our family reputation  remember that mr allen is of the church richard said my grandfather severely  i fear he has little respect for church or state sir grafton put in you are now reaping the fruits of your indulgence  i turned to my grandfather  you are my protector sir i cried and if it please you to tell me what i now stand accused of i submit most dutifully to your chastisement  very fair words indeed nephew richard said my uncle and i draw from them that you have yet to hear of your beating an honest schoolmaster without other provocation than that he was a loyal servant to the king and wantonly injuring the children of his school he drew from his pocket a copy of that gazette mr carvel held in his hand and added ironically here then are news which will doubtless surprise you sir and knowing you for a peaceful lad never having entertained such heresies as those with which it pleases mr green to credit you i dare swear he has drawn on his imagination  i took the paper in amaze not knowing why my grandfather who had ever been so jealous of others taking me to task should permit the rector and my uncle to chide me in his presence the account was in the main true enough and made sad sport of mr fairbrother  have i not been caned for this sir said i to my grandfather  these words seemed to touch mr carvel and i saw a tear glisten in his eye as he answered  you have richard and stoutly but your uncle and mr allen seem to think that your offence warrants more than a caning and to deem that you have been actuated by bad principles rather than by boyish spirits he paused to steady his voice and i realized then for the first time how sacred he held allegiance to the king tell me my lad said he tell me as you love god and the truth whether they are right  for the moment i shrank from speaking perceiving what a sad blow to mr carvel my words must be and then i spoke up boldly catching the exulting sneer on my uncle graftons face and the note of triumph reflected in mr allens  i have never deceived you sir i said and will not now hide from you that i believe the colonies to have a just cause against his majesty and parliament the words came ready to my lips we are none the less englishmen because we claim the rights of englishmen and saving your presence sir are as loyal as those who do not and if these principles be bad i added to my uncle then should we think with shame upon the magna charta  my grandfather stood astonished at such a speech from me whom he had thought a lad yet without a formed knowledge of public affairs but i was in fact supersaturated with that of which i spoke and could have given my hearers many able whig arguments to surprise them had the season befitted there was silence for a space after i had finished and then mr carvel sank right heavily upon the bench  a carvel against the king was all he said  had i been alone with him i should have cast myself at his feet for it hurt me sorely to see him so as it was i held my head high  the carvels ever did what they believed right sir i answered you would not have me to go against my conscience  to this he replied nothing  the evil has been done as i feared father said grafton presently we must now seek for the remedy  let me question the lad mr allen softly interposed tell me richard who has influenced you to this way of thinking  i saw his ruse and was not to be duped by it  men who have not feared to act bravely against oppression sir i said  thank god exclaimed my uncle with fervour that i have been more careful of philips associations and that he has not caught in the streets and taverns this noxious creed  there is no danger from philip he remembers his family name said the rector  no quoth mr carvel bitterly there is no danger from philip like his father he will ever believe that which best serves him  grafton needless to say did not pursue such an argument but rising remarked that this deplorable affair had kept him long past his dinner hour and that his services were as ever at his fathers disposal he refused to stay though my grandfather pressed him of course and with a low bow of filial respect and duty and a single glance at the rector my uncle was gone and then we walked slowly to the house and into the dining room mr carvel leading the procession and i an unwilling rear knowing that my fate would be decided between them i thought mr allens grace would never end and the meal likewise i ate but little while the two gentlemen discussed parish matters and when at last scipio had retired and the rector of st annes sat sipping the old madeira his countenance all gravity but with a relish he could not hide my grandfather spoke up and though he addressed himself to the guest i knew full well what he said was meant for me  as you see sir said he i am sore perplexed and troubled we carvels mr allen have ever been stanch to church and king my greatgrandsire fought at naseby and marston moor for charles and suffered exile in his name twas love for king james that sent my father hither though he swore allegiance to anne and the first george i can say with pride that he was no indifferent servant to either refusing honours from the pretender in 15 when he chanced to be at home an oath is an oath sir and we have yet to be false to ours and the king say i should next to god be loved and loyally served by his subjects and so i have served this george and his grandfather before him according to the talents which were given me  and ably sir permit me to say echoed the rector heartily too heartily methought and he carefully filled his pipe with choice leaf out of mr carvels inlaid box  be that as it may i have done my best as we must all do pardon me sir for speaking of myself but i have brought up this lad from a child mr allen said mr carvel his words coming slowly as if each gave him pain and have striven to be an example to him in all things he has few of those faults which i most fear god be thanked that he loves the truth for there is yet a chance of his correction a chance said i he cried his speech coming more rapid nay he shall be cured i little thought fool that i was that he would get this pox his father fought and died for the king and should trouble come which god forbid to know that richard stood against his majesty would kill me  and well it might mr carvel said the divine he was for the moment sobered as weak men must be in the presence of those of strong convictions my grandfather had half risen in his chair and the lines of his smoothshaven face deepened visibly with the pain of the feelings to which he gave utterance as for me i was wellnigh swept away by a bigness within me and torn between love and duty between pity and the reason left me and sadly tried to know whether my dear parents life and happiness should be weighed against what i felt to be right i strove to speak but could say nothing  he must be removed from the influences the rector ventured after a halt  that he must indeed said my grandfather why did i not send him to eton last fall but it is hard mr allen to part with the child of our old age i would take passage and go myself with him tomorrow were it not for my duties in the council  eton i would have sooner i believe wrought by the side of any rascally redemptioner in the iron mines of the patapsco than have gone to eton  but for the present sir i would counsel you to put the lads studies in the charge of some able and learned man that his mind may be turned from the disease which has fed upon it some one whose loyalty is beyond question  and who so fit as yourself mr allen returned my grandfather relief plain in his voice you have his lordships friendship and confidence and never has rector of st annes or of any other parish brought letters to his excellency to compare with yours and so i crave your help in this time of need  mr allen showed becoming hesitation  i fear you do me greater honour than i deserve mr carvel he answered a strain of the pomp coming back though my gracious patron is disposed to think well of me and i shall strive to hold his good opinion but i have duties of parish and glebe to attend and master philip carvel likewise in my charge  i held my breath for my grandfathers reply the rector however had read him and well knew that a show of reluctance would but inflame him the more  how now sir he exclaimed surely as you love the king you will not refuse me in this strait  mr allen rose and grasped him by the hand  nay sir said he and you put it thus i cannot refuse you  the thought of it was too much i ran to my grandfather crying not mr allen sir not mr allen any one else you pleasemr fairbrother even  the rector drew back haughtily it is clear mr carvel he said that richard has other preferences  and be damned to them shouted my grandfather am i to be ruled by this headstrong boy he has beat mr fairbrother and shall have no skimmedmilk supervision if i can help it  and so it was settled that i should be tutored by the rector of st annes and i took my seat beside my cousin philip in his study the very next day     chapter vii grafton has his chance  to add to my troubles my grandfather was shortly taken very ill with the first severe sickness he had ever in his life endured dr leiden came and went sometimes thrice daily and for a week he bore a look so grave as to frighten me dr evarts arrived by horse from philadelphia and the two physicians held long conversations in the morning room while i listened at the door and comprehended not a word of their talk save when they spoke of bleeding and after a very few consultations as is often the way in their profession they disagreed and quarrelled and dr evarts packed himself back to philadelphia in high dudgeon then mr carvel began to mend  there were many who came regularly to inquire of him and each afternoon i would see the broad shoulders and genial face of governor sharpe in the gateway completing his walk by way of marlboro street i loved and admired him for he had been a soldier himself before he came out to us and had known and esteemed my father his excellency should surely have been knighted for his services in the french war once he spied me at the window and shook his cane pleasantly and in he walks to the room where i sat reading of the victories of blenheim and malplaquet for chronicles of this sort i delighted in  aha richard says he taking up the book tis plain whither your tastes lead you marlboro was a great general and as sorry a scoundrel as ever led troops to battle truly says he musing the lord often makes queer choice in his instruments for good and he lowered himself into the easy chair and crossed his legs regarding me very comically whats this i hear of your joining the burghers and barristers and trouncing poor mr fairbrother and his flock and crying liberty forever in the very ears of the law he asks his majesty will have need of such lads as you i make no doubt and should such proceedings come to his ears i would not give a pipe for your chances  i could not but laugh confused as i was at his excellencys rally and this i may say that had it pleased providence to give me dealing with such men of the kings side as he perchance my fortunes had been altered  and in any good cause sir i replied i would willingly give my life to his majesty  so said his excellency raising his eyebrows i see clearly you are of the rascals but a lad must have his fancies and when your age i was hot for the exiled prince i acquired more sense as i grew older and better an active mind say i than a sluggard partisan  at this stage of our talk came in my uncle grafton and bowing low to the governor made apology that some of the elders of the family had not been there to entertain him he told his excellency that he had never left the house save for necessary business which was true for once my uncle having taken up his abode with us during that week but now thanking heaven and dr leiden and his own poor effort he could report his dear father to be out of danger  governor sharpe answered shortly that he had been happy to hear the good news from scipio faith says he i was well enough entertained for i have a liking for this lad and to speak truth i saw him here as i came up the walk  my uncle smiled deprecatingly and hid any vexation he might have had from this remark  i fear that richard lacks wisdom as yet your excellency said he and has many of his fathers headstrong qualities  which you most providentially escaped his excellency put in  grafton bit his lip necessity makes us all careful sir said he  necessity does more than that mr carvel returned the governor who was something of a wit necessity often makes us fools if we be not careful but give me ever a wanton fool rather than him of necessitys handiwork and as for the lad says he let him not trouble you such as he if twisted a little in the growth come out straight enough in the end  i think the governor little knew what wormwood was this to my uncle  tis heartily to be hoped sir he said for his folly has brought trouble enough behind it to those who have his education and his welfare in hand and i make no doubt is at the bottom of my fathers illness  at this injustice i could not but cry out for all the town knew and my grandfather himself best of all that the trouble from which he now suffered sprang from his gout and yet my heart was smitten at the thought that i might have hastened or aggravated the attack the governor rose he seized his stick aggressively and looked sharply at grafton  nonsense he exclaimed my friend mr carvel is far too wise to be upset by a boyish prank which deserves no notice save a caning and that my lad he added lightly i dare swear you got with interest and he called for a glass of the old madeira when scipio came with the tray and departed with a polite inquiry after my aunt carolines health and a prophecy that mr carvel would soon be taking the air again  there had been high doings indeed in marlboro street that miserable week my grandfather took to his bed of a saturday afternoon and bade me go down to mr aikmans the bookseller and fetch him the latest books and plays that night i became so alarmed that i sent diomedes for dr leiden who remained the night through sunday was well gone before the news reached york street when my aunt caroline came hurrying over in her chair and my uncle on foot they brushed past scipio at the door and were pushing up the long flight when they were stopped on the landing by dr leiden  how is my father sir grafton cried and why was i not informed at once of his illness i must see him  your vater can see no one mr carvel said the doctor quietly  what says my uncle you dare to refuse me  not so lout i bray you says the doctor i tare any ting vere life is concerned  but i will see him says grafton in a sort of helpless rage for the doctors manner baffled him i will see him before he dies and no man alive shall say me nay  then my aunt caroline gathered up her skirt and made shift to pass the doctor  i have come to nurse him said she imperiously and turning to where i stood near she added bid a servant fetch from york street what i shall have need of  the doctor smiled but stood firm he cared little for aught in heaven or earth did dr leiden and nothing whatever for mr and mrs grafton carvel  i peg you matam do not disturp yourself said he mr carvel is aply attended by an excellent voman mrs villis and he has no neet of you  what cried my aunt this is too much sir that i am thrust out of my fatherinlaws house and my place taken by a menial that woman able she fumed dropping suddenly her cloak of dignity mr carvels charity is all that keeps her here  then my uncle drew himself up dr leiden says he kindly oblige me by leaving my fathers house and consider your services here at an end and richard he goes on to me send my compliments to dr drake and request him to come at once  i was stepping forward to say that i would do nothing of the kind when the doctor stopped me by a signal as much as to say that the quarrel was wide enough without me he stood with his back against the great arched window flooded with the yellow light of the setting sun a little black figure in high relief with a face of parchment and he took a pinch of snuff before he spoke  i am here py mr carvels orters sir said he and py tose alone vill i leaf  and this is how the chippendale piece was broke which you my children and especially bess admire so extravagantly it stood that day behind the doctor and my uncle making a violent move to get by struck it and so it fell with a great crash lengthwise on the landing and the wonderful vases mr carroll had given my grandfather rolled down the stairs and lay crushed at the bottom withal he had spoken so quietly dr leiden possessed a temper drawn from his teutonic ancestors with his little face all puckered he swore so roundly at my uncle in some lingo he had got from his fatherhigh german or low germani know not what that grafton and his wife were glad enough to pick their way amongst the broken bits of glass and china to the hall again dr leiden shook his fist at their retreating persons saying that the sabbath was no day to do murder  i followed them with the pretence of picking up what was left of the ornaments what between anger against the doctor and mrs willis and fright and chagrin at the fall of the chippendale piece my aunt was in such a state of nervous flurry that she bade the ashy scipio call her chairmen and vowed in a trembling voice she would never again enter a house where that lowbred german was to be found but my uncle grafton was of a different nature he deemed defeat but a postponement of the object he wished to gain and settled himself in the library with a copy of miller on the distinction of ranks in society he appeared at supper suave as ever gravely concerned as to his fathers health which formed the chief topic between us he gave me to understand that he would take the green room until the old gentleman was past danger not a word mind you of dr leiden nor did my uncle express a wish to go into the sickroom from which even i was forbid nay the next morning he met the doctor in the hall and conversed with him at some length over the case as though nothing had occurred between them  while my uncle grafton was in the house i had opportunity of marking the intimacy which existed between him and the rector of st annes the latter swung each evening the muffled knocker and was ushered on tiptoe across the polished floor to the library where my uncle sat in state it was often after supper before the rector left and coming in upon them once i found wine between them and empty decanters on the board and they fell silent as i passed the doorway  our dear friend captain clapsaddle was away when my grandfather fell sick having been north for three months or more on some business known to few twas generally supposed he went to massachusetts to confer with the patriots of that colony hearing the news as he rode into town he came booted and spurred to marlboro street before going to his lodgings i ran out to meet him and he threw his arms about me on the street so that those who were passing smiled for all knew the captain and harvey who always came to take the captains horse swore that he was glad to see a friend of the family once again i told the captain very freely of my doings and showed him the clipping from the gazette which made him laugh heartily but a shade came upon his face when i rehearsed the scene we had with my uncle and mr allen in the garden  what says he mr carvel hath sent you to mr allen on your uncles advice  no i answered to do my uncle justice he said not a word to mr carvel about it  the captain turned the subject he asked me much concerning the rector and what he taught me and appeared but illpleased at that i had to tell him but he left me without so much as a word of comment or counsel for it was a principle with captain clapsaddle not to influence in any way the minds of the young and he would have deemed it unfair to mr carvel had he attempted to win my sympathies to his captain daniel was the first the old gentleman asked to see when visitors were permitted him and you may be sure the faithful soldier was below stairs waiting for the summons  i was some three weeks with my new tutor the rector before my grandfathers illness and went back again as soon as he began to mend i was not altogether unhappy owing to a certain grim pleasure i had in debating with him which i shall presently relate there was much to annoy and anger me too my cousin philip was forever carping and criticising my greek and latin and it was impossible not to feel his sneer at my back when i construed he had pat replies ready to correct me when called upon and twas only out of consideration for mr carvel that i kept my hands from him when we were dismissed  i think the rector disliked philip in his way as much as did i in mine the reverend bennett allen indeed might have been a very good fellow had providence placed him in a different setting he was one of those whom his excellency dubbed fools from necessity he should have been born with a fortune though i can think of none he would not have run through in a year or so but nature had given him aristocratic tastes with no other means toward their gratification than good looks convincing ways and a certain bold halfdefiant manner which went far with his lordship and those like him who thought mr allen excellent good company with the rector as with too many others holy orders were but a means to an end it was a sealed story what he had been before he came to governor sharpe with baltimores directions to give him the best in the colony but our rakes and wits and even our solid men like my grandfather received him with open arms he had ever a tale on his tongues end tempered to the ear of his listener  who had most influenced my way of thinking mr allen had well demanded the gentleman was none other than mr henry swain pattys father of her i shall speak later he was a rising barrister and man of note among our patriots and member of the lower house a diffident man in public with dark soulful eyes and a wide white brow who had declined a nomination to the congress of 65 at his fireside unknown to my grandfather and to mr allen i had learned the true principles of government before the house mr swain spoke only under extraordinary emotion and then he gained every ear he had been my friend since childhood but i never knew the meaning and the fire of oratory until curiosity brought me to the gallery of the assembly chamber in the stadt house where the barrister was on his feet at the time i well remember the tingle in my chest as i looked and listened and i went again and again until the house sat behind closed doors  and so when mr allen brought forth for my benefit those arguments of the kings party which were deemed their strength i would confront him with mr swains logic he had in me a tough subject for conversion i was put to very small pains to rout my instructor out of all his positions because indolence and lack of interest in the question and contempt for the americans had made him neglect the study of it and philip who entered at first glibly enough at the rectors side was soon drawn into depths far beyond him many a time was mr allen fain to laugh at his blunders i doubt not my cousin had the facts straight enough when he rose from the breakfast table at home but by the time he reached the rectory they were shaken up like so many parts of a puzzle in a bag and past all straightening  the rector was especially bitter toward the good people of boston town whom he dubbed puritan fanatics to him mr otis was but a meddling fool and mr adams a traitor whose head only remained on his shoulders by grace of the extreme clemency of his majesty which mr allen was at a loss to understand when beaten in argument he would laugh out some sneer that would set my blood simmering one morning he came in late for the lesson smelling strongly of wine and bade us bring our books out under the fruit trees in the garden he threw back his gown and tilted his cap and lighting his pipe began to speak of that act of townshends passed but the year before which afterwards proved the kings folly and englands ruin  principle exclaimed my fine clergyman at length blowing a great whiff among the white blossoms oons your americans worship his majesty stamped upon a golden coin and though he saved their tills from plunder from the french the miserly rogues are loth to pay for the service  i rose and taking a guineapiece from my pocket held it up before him  they care this much for gold sir and less for his majesty who cares nothing for them i said and walking to the well near by i dropped the piece carelessly into the clear water he was beside me before it left my hand and philip also in time to see the yellow coin edging this way and that toward the bottom the rector turned to me with a smile of cynical amusement playing over his features  such a spirit has brought more than one brave fellow to tyburn master carvel he said and then he added reflectively but if there were more like you we might well have cause for alarm     volume 2     chapter viii over the wall  dorothy treated me ill enough that spring since the minx had tasted power at carvel hall there was no accounting for her on returning to town dr courtenay had begged her mother to allow her at the assemblies a request which mrs manners most sensibly refused mr marmaduke had given his consent i believe for he was more impatient than dolly for the days when she would become the toast of the province but the doctor contrived to see her in spite of difficulties and will fotheringay was forever at her house and half a dozen other lads and many gentlemen of fashion like the doctor called ostensibly to visit mrs manners but in reality to see miss dorothy and my lady knew it she would be lingering in the drawingroom in her best bib and tucker or strolling in the garden as dr courtenay passed and i got but scant attention indeed i was but an awkward lad and an old playmate with no novelty about me  why richard she would say to me as i rode or walked beside her or sat at dinner in prince george street i know every twist and turn of your nature there is nothing you could do to surprise me and so sir you are very tiresome  you once found me useful enough to fetch and carry and amusing when i walked the orioles bowsprit i replied ruefully  why dont you make me jealous says she stamping her foot a score of pretty girls are languishing for a glimpse of youjennie and bess fotheringay and betty tayloe and heaven knows how many others they are actually accusing me of keeping you trailing la girls said i if you will but rid me of him for a day you shall have my lasting gratitude  and she turned to the spinet and began a lively air but the taunt struck deeper than she had any notion of that spring arrived out from london on the belle of the wye a box of fine clothes my grandfather had commanded for me from his own tailor and a word from a maid of fifteen did more to make me wear them than any amount of coaxing from mr allen and my uncle grafton my uncle seemed in particular anxious that i should make a good appearance and reminded me that i should dress as became the heir of the carvel house i took counsel with patty swain and then went to see betty tayloe and the fotheringay girls and the dulany girls near the governors and fie upon me i was not illpleased with the brave appearance i made i would show my mistress how little i cared but the worst of it was the baggage seemed to trouble less than i and had the effrontery to tell me how happy she was i had come out of my shell and broken loose from her apronstrings  indeed they would soon begin to think i meant to marry you richard says she at supper one sunday before a tableful and laughed with the rest  they do not credit you with such good sense my dear says her mother smiling kindly at me  and dolly bit her lip and did not join in that part of the merriment  i fled to patty swain for counsel nor was it the first time in my life i had done so some good women seem to have been put into this selfish world to comfort and advise after prince george street with its gilt and marbles and stately hedged gardens the lowbeamed vinecovered house in the duke of gloucester street was a home and a rest in my eyes there was not its equal in annapolis for beauty within and without mr swain had bought the dwelling from an aged man with a history dead some nine years back its furniture for the most part was of the restoration of simple and massive oak blackened by age which i ever fancied better than the frenchy baubles of tables and chairs with spindle legs and cabinets of glass and gold lacquer which were then making their way into the fine mansions of our town the house was full of twists and turns and steps up and down and nooks and passages and queer hidingplaces which we children knew and in parts queer leaded windows of bulging glass set high in the wall and older than the reign of hanover here was the shrine of cleanliness whose highpriestess was patty herself her floors were like satinwood and her brasses lights in themselves she had come honestly enough by her gifts her father having married the daughter of an able townsman of salem in the massachusetts colony when he had gone north after his first great success in court now the poor lady sat in a padded armchair from morning to night beside the hearth in winter and under the trees in summer by reason of a fall she had had there she knitted all the day long her placid face and quiet way come before me as i write  my friendship with patty had begun early one autumn day when i was a little lad of eight or nine my grandfather and i were driving back from whitehall in the big coach when we spied a little maid of six by the severns bank with her apron full of chestnuts she was trudging bravely through the dead leaves toward the town mr carvel pulled the cord to stop and asked her name patty swain and it please your honour the child answered without fear so you are the young barristers daughter says he smiling at something i did not understand she nodded and how is it you are so far from home and alone my little one asked mr carvel again for some time he could get nothing out of her but at length she explained with much coaxing that her big brother tom had deserted her my grandfather wished that tom were his brother that he might be punished as he deserved he commanded young harvey to lift the child into the coach chestnuts and all and there she sat primly between us she was not as pretty as dorothy so i thought but her clear gray eyes and simple ways impressed me by their very honesty as they did mr carvel what must he do but drive her home to green street where mr swain then lived in a little cottage mr carvel himself lifted her out and kissed her and handed her to her mother at the gate who was vastly overcome by the circumstance the good lady had not then received that fall which made her a cripple for life and will you not have my chestnuts sir for your kindness says little patty whereat my grandfather laughed and kissed her again for he loved children and wished to know if she would not be his daughter and come to live in marlboro street and told the story of tom for fear she would not he was silent as we drove away and i knew he was thinking of my own mother at that age  not long after this mr swain bought the house in the duke of gloucester street this as you know is back to back with marlboro to reach pattys garden i had but to climb the brick wall at the rear of our grounds and to make my way along the narrow green lane left there for perhaps a hundred paces of a lad to come to the gate in the wooden paling in return i used to hoist patty over the wall and we would play at childrens games under the fruit trees that skirted it some instinct kept her away from the house i often caught her gazing wistfully at its wings and gables she was not born to a mansion so she said  but your father is now rich i objected i had heard captain daniel say so he may have a mansion of his own and he chooses he can better afford it than many who are in debt for the fine show they make i was but repeating gossip  i should like to see the grand company come in when your grandfather has them to dine said the girl sometimes we have grand gentlemen come to see father in their coaches but they talk of nothing but politics we never have any fine ladies likelike your aunt caroline  i startled her by laughing derisively  and i pray you never may patty was all i said  i never told dolly of my intimacy with the barristers little girl over the wall this was not because i was ashamed of the friendship but arose from a fearwellfounded enoughthat she would make sport of it at twelve dolly had notions concerning the walks of life that most other children never dream of they were derived of course from mr marmaduke but the day of reckoning arrived patty and i were romping beside the back wall when suddenly a stiff little figure in a starched frock appeared through the trees in the direction of the house followed by master will fotheringay in his visiting clothes i laugh now when i think of that formal meeting between the two little ladies there was no time to hoist miss swain over the wall or to drive miss manners back upon the house patty stood blushing as though caught in a guilty act while she of the generations came proudly on will sniggering behind her  who is this richard asks miss manners pointing a small forefinger  patty swain if you must know i cried and added boylike and she is just as good as you or me and better i was quite red in the face and angry because of it this is dorothy manners patty and will fotheringay  the moment was a pregnant one but i was resolved to carry the matter out with a bold front will you join us at catch and swing i asked  will promptly declared that he would join for patty was good to look upon dolly glanced at her dress tossed her head and marched back alone  oh richard cried patty i shall never forgive myself i have made you quarrel with  his sweetheart said will wickedly  i dont care said i which was not so  patty felt no resentment for my misss haughty conduct but only a tearful penitence for having been the cause of a strife between us wills arguments and mine availed nothing i must lift her over the wall again and she went home when we reached the garden we found dolly seated beside her mother on my grandfathers bench from which stronghold our combined tactics were powerless to drag her  when dolly was gone i asked my grandfather in great indignation why patty did not play with the children i knew with dorothy and the fotheringays he shook his head dubiously when you are older richard you will understand that our social ranks are cropped close mr swain is an honest and an able man though he believes in things i do not i hear he is becoming wealthy and i have no doubt the shrewd old gentleman added that when patty grows up she will be going to the assemblies though it was not so in my time so liberal was he that he used to laugh at my lifting her across the wall and in his leisure delight to listen to my accounts of her childish housekeeping her life was indeed a contrast to dorothys she had all the solid qualities that my lady lacked in early years and yet i never wavered in my liking to the more brilliant and wayward of the two the week before my next birthday when mr carvel drew me to him and asked me what i wished for a present that year as was his custom i said promptly  i should like to have patty swain at my party sir  so you shall my lad he cried taking his snuff and eying me with pleasure i am glad to see richard that you have none of mr marmadukes nonsense about you she is a good girl i faith and more of a lady now than many who call themselves such and you shall have your present to boot harkee daniel said he to the captain if the child comes to my house the pollparrots and followmeups will be wanting her too  but the getting her to go was a matter of five days for patty was sensitive like her father and dreaded a slight not so with master tom who must needs be invited too he arrived half an hour ahead of time arrayed like solomon and without his sister i had to go for patty indeed after the party had begun and to get the key to the wicket in the wall to take her in that way so shy was she my dear grandfather showed her particular attention and miss dolly herself being in the humour taught her a minuet  after that she came to all my birthdays and lost some of her shyness and was invited to other great houses even as mr carvel had predicted but her chief pleasure seemed ever her duty whether or no such characters make them one and the same who can tell she became the light of her fathers house and used even to copy out his briefs at which task i often found her of an evening  as for tom that graceless scamp i never could stomach him i wondered then as i have since how he was the brother of such a sister he could scarce bide his time until mr swain should have a coach and a seat in the country with the gentry a barrister quoth he is as good as any one else and if my father came out a redemptioner and worked his way so had old mr dulany our family at home was the equal of his all of which was true and more he would deride patty for sewing and baking vowing that they had servants enough now to do the work twice over she bore with him with a patience to be marvelled at and i could never get it through my head why mr swain indulged him though he was the elder and his mothers favourite tom began to dress early his open admiration was dr courtenay his confessed hope to wear fivepound ruffles and gold sword knots he clung to will fotheringay with a tenacity that became proverbial among us boys and his boasts at king williams school were his fathers growing wealth and intimacy with the great men of the province  as i grew older i took the cue of political knowledge as i have said from mr swain rather than captain daniel who would tell me nothing i fell into the habit of taking supper in gloucester street the meal was early there and when the dishes were cleared away and the barristers pipe lit and patty and her mother had got their sewing he would talk by the hour on the legality of our resistance to the king and discuss the march of affairs in england and the other colonies he found me a ready listener and took pains to teach me clearly the right and wrong of the situation twas his religion even as loyalty to the king was my grandfathers and he did not think it wrong to spread it he likewise instilled into me in that way more of history than mr allen had ever taught me using it to throw light upon this point or that but i never knew his true power and eloquence until i followed him to the stadt house  patty was grown a girl of fifteen then glowing with health and had ample good looks of her own tis odd enough that i did not fall in love with her when dolly began to use me so outrageously but a lad of eighteen is scarce a rational creature i went and sat before my oracle upon the vinecovered porch under the eaves and poured out my complaint she laid down her needlework and laughed  you silly boy said she cant you see that she herself has prescribed for you she was right when she told you to show attention to jenny and if you dangle about miss dolly now you are in danger of losing her she knows it better than you  i had jenny to ride the very next day result my lady smiled on me more sweetly than ever when i went to prince george street and vowed jenny had never looked prettier than when she went past the house this left my victory in such considerable doubt that i climbed the back wall forthwith in my new topboots  so you looked for her to be angry said patty  most certainly said i  unreasoning vanity she cried for she knew how to speak plain by your confession to me you have done this to please her for she warned you at the beginning it would please her and now you complain of it i believe i know your dorothy better than you  and so i got but little comfort out of patty that time     chapter ix under false colours  and now i come to a circumstance in my life i would rather pass over quickly had i steered the straight course of my impulse i need never have deceived that dear gentleman whom i loved and honoured above any in this world and with whom i had always lived and dealt openly after my grandfather was pronounced to be mending i went back to mr allen until such time as we should be able to go to the country philip no longer shared my studies his hours having been changed from morning to afternoon i thought nothing of this being content with the rectors explanation that my uncle had a task for philip in the morning now that mr carvel was better and i was well content to be rid of philips company but as the days passed i began to mark an absence still stranger i had my horace and my ovid still but the two hours from eleven to one which he was wont to give up to history and what he was pleased to call instruction in loyalty were filled with other matter not a word now of politics from mr allen not even a comment from him concerning the spirited doings of our assembly with which the town was ringing that body had met but a while before primed to act on the circular drawn up by mr adams of massachusetts the governors message had not been so prompt as to forestall them and i am occupied scarce the time in the writing of this that it took our brave members to adopt the petition to his majesty and to pass resolutions of support to our sister colony of the north this being done and a most tart reply penned to his excellency they ended that sitting and passed in procession to the governors mansion to deliver it mr speaker lloyd at their head and a vast concourse of cheering people at their heels shutters were barred on the tory houses we passed and though mr allen spied me in the crowd he never mentioned the circumstance more than once i essayed to draw from him an opinion of mr adamss petition which was deemed a work of great moderation and merit and got nothing but evasion from my tutor that he had become suddenly an american in principle i could not believe at length i made bold to ask him why our discussions were now omitted he looked up from the new play he was reading on the study lounge with a glance of dark meaning i could not fathom  you are learning more than i can teach you in gloucester street and at the stadt house he said  in truth i was at a loss to understand his attitude until the day in june my grandfather and i went to carvel hall  the old gentleman was weak still so feeble that he had to be carried to his barge in a chair a vehicle he had ever held in scorn but he was cheerful and his spirit remained the same as of old but for that spirit i believe he had never again risen from his bed in marlboro street my uncle and the rector were among those who walked by his side to the dock and would have gone to the hall with him had he permitted them he was kind enough to say that my arm was sufficient to lean on  what peace there was sitting once again under the rustling trees on the lawn with the green river and the blue bay spread out before us and scipio standing by with my grandfathers punch mr carvel would have me rehearse again all that had passed in town and colony since his illness which i did with as much moderation as i was able and as we talked he reached out and took my hand for i sat near him and said  richard i have heard tidings of you that gladden my heart and they have done more than dr leidens physic for this old frame of mine i well knew a carvel could never go a wrong course lad and you least of any  tidings sir i said  ay tidings answered mr carvel such a note of relief and gladness there was in the words as i had not heard for months from him and a vague fear came upon me  scipio he said merrily a punch for mr richard and when the glass was brought my grandfather added may it be ever thus  i drained the toast not falling into his humour or comprehending his reference but dreading that aught i might say would disturb him held my peace and yet my apprehension increased he set down his glass and continued  i had no hope of this yet richard for you were ever slow to change your conversion does credit to mr allen as well as to you in short sir the rector gives me an excellent good account of your studies and adds that the king hath gained another loyal servant for which i thank god  i have no words to write of my feelings then my head swam and my hand trembled on my grandfathers and i saw dimly the old gentlemans face aglow with joy and pride and knew not what to say or do the answer i framed alas remained unspoken from his own lips i had heard how much the news had mended him and for once i lacked the heart nay the courage to speak the truth but mr carvel took no heed of my silence setting it down to another cause  and so my son he said there is no need of sending you to eton next fall i am not much longer for this earth and can ill spare you and mr allen kindly consents to prepare you for oxford  mr allen consents to that sir i gasped i think could i have laid hands on the rector then i would have thrashed him cloth and all within an inch of his life  and as if to crown my misery mr carvel rose and bearing heavily on my shoulder led me to the stable where harvey and one of the black grooms stood in livery to receive us harvey held by the bridle a blooded bay hunter and her like could scarce be found in the colony as she stood arching her neck and pawing the ground i all confusion and shame my grandfather said simply  richard this is firefly i have got her for you from mr randolph of virginia for you are now old enough to have a good mount of your own  all that night i lay awake trying to sift some motive for mr allens deceit for the life of me i could see no farther than a desire to keep me as his pupil since he was well paid for his tuition still the game did not seem worth the candle however he was safe in his lie shrewd rogue that he was he well knew that i would not risk the attack a disappointment might bring my grandfather  what troubled me most of all was the fear that grafton had reaped the advantage of the opportunity the illness gave him and by his insidious arts had worked himself back into the good graces of his father you must not draw from this my dears that i feared for the inheritance praised be god i never thought of that but i came by nature to hate and to fear my uncle as i hated and feared the devil i saw him with my fathers eyes and with my mothers and as my grandfather had seen him in the old days when he was strong instinct and reason alike made me loathe him as the months passed and letters in graftons scroll hand came from the kent estate or from annapolis my misgivings were confirmed by odd remarks that dropped from mr carvels lips at length arrived the revelation itself  i fear richard he had said querulously i fear that all these years i have done your uncle an injustice dear elizabeth was wont to plead for him before she died but i would never listen to her i was hearty and strong then and my heart was hard and a remembrance of many things was fresh in my mind he paused for breath as was his habit now and i said nothing but grafton has striven to wipe out the past sickness teaches us that we must condone and not condemn he has lived a reputable life and made the most of the little start i gave him he has supported his majesty and my lord in most trying times and his excellency tells me that the coming governor eden will surely reward him with a seat in the council  i thought of governor sharpes biting words to grafton the governor knew my uncle well and i was sure he had never sat at his council  a son is a son richard continued mr carvel you will one day find that out your uncle has atoned he hath been faithful during my illness despite my cold treatment and he hath convinced me that your welfare is at his heart i believe he is fond of you my lad  no greater sign of breaking health did i need than this that mr carvel should become blind to graftons hypocrisy forget his attempts to prevent my fathers marriage and to throw doubt upon my mothers birth the agony it gave me coming as it did on top of the cruel deception i shall not dwell upon and the thought bursting within me remained unspoken  i saw less of dorothy then than i had in any summer of my life before in spite of mrs manners the chrysalis had burst into the butterfly and wilmot house had never been so gay it must be remembered that there were times when young ladies made their entrance into the world at sixteen and for a beauty to be unmarried at twentytwo was rare indeed when i went to wilmot house to dine the table would be always full and mr marmaduke simpering at the head of it his air of importance doubled by his reflected glory  we see nothing of you my lad he would say you must not let these young gallants get ahead of you how does your grandfather i must pay my compliments tomorrow  of gallants there were enough to be sure dr courtenay of course with a nosegay on his coat striving to catch the beautys eye and mr worthington and mr dulany and mr fitzhugh and mr paca and i know not how many other young bachelors of birth and means and will fotheringay who spent some of his time with me at the hall silver and china with the manners coatofarms were laid out that had not seen the light for many along day and there were picnics and sailing parties and dances galore some of which i attended but heard of more it seemed to me that my lady was tiring of the doctors compliments and had transferred her fickle favour to young mr fitzhugh who was much more worthy by the way as for me i had troubles enough then and had become used in some sort to being shelved  one night in julytwas the very day mr carvel had spoken to me of graftoni had ridden over to wilmot house to supper i had little heart for going but good mrs manners herself had made me promise and i could not break my word i must have sat very silent and preoccupied at the table where all was wit and merriment and more than once i saw the laughter leave dorothys face and caught her eyes upon me with such a look as set my beast throbbing they would not meet my own but would turn away instantly i was heavy indeed that night and did not follow the company into the ballroom but made my excuses to mrs manners  the lawn lay bathed in moonlight and as i picked my way over it toward the stables for firefly i paused to look back at the house aglow with light the music of the fiddles and the sound of laughter floating out of the open windows even as i gaped a white figure was framed in the doorway paused a moment on the low stone step and then came on until it stood beside me  are you not well richard  yes i am well i answered i scarcely knew my own voice  is your grandfather worse  no dorothy he seems better today  she stood seemingly irresolute her eyes new lifted now falling before mine her slender arms bare save for the little puff at the shoulders her simple dress drawn a little above the waist then falling straight to the white slipper how real the ecstasy of that moment and the pain of it  why do you not coarse over as you used to she asked in a low tone  i am very busy i replied evasively mr carvel cannot attend to his affairs i longed to tell her the whole truth but the words would not come  i hear you are managing the estate all alone she said  there is no one else to do it  richard she cried drawing closer you are in trouble ii have seen it you are so silent andand you seem to have become older tell me is it your uncle grafton  so astonished was i at the question and because she had divined so surely that i did not answer  is it she asked again  yes i said yes in part  and then came voices calling from the house they had missed her  i am so sorry richard i shall tell no one  she laid her hand ever so lightly upon mine and was gone i stood staring after her until she disappeared in the door all the way home i marvelled my thoughts tumultuous my hopes rising and falling  but when next i saw her i thought she had forgotten  we had little company at the hall that year on account of mr carvel and i had been busy indeed i sought with all my might to master a business for which i had but little taste and my grandfather complimented me before the season was done upon my management i was wont to ride that summer at four of a morning to canter beside mr starkie afield and i came to know the yield of every patch to a hogshead and the pound price to a farthing i grew to understand as well as another the methods of curing the leaf and the wheat pest appearing that year i had the good fortune to discover some of the clusters in the sheaves and ground our oystershells in time to save the crop many a long evening i spent on the wharves with old stanwix now toothless and living on his pension with my eye on the glow of his pipe and my ear bent to his stories of the sea it was his fancy that the gift of prophecy had come to him with the years and at times when his look would wander to the black rigging in the twilight he would speak strangely enough  faith mr richard he would say tho your father was a soldier afore ye ye were born to the deck of a shipowar mark an old mans words sir  can you see the frigate stanwix i laughed once when he had repeated this with more than common solemnity  his reply rose above the singing of the locusts  ay sir that i can but shes no frigate sir devil knows what she is she looks like a big merchantman to me such as ive seed in the injy trade with a high poop in the old style and her piercins be not like a frigate he said this with a readiness to startle me and little enough superstition i had a light was on his seared face and his pipe lay neglected on the boards ay sir and there be a flag astern of her never yet seed on earth nor on the waters under the earth the tide is settin in the tide is settin in  these were words to set me thinking and many a time they came back to me when the old man was laid away in the spot reserved for those who sailed the seas for mr carvel  every week i drew up a report for my grandfather and thus i strove by shouldering labour and responsibility to ease my conscience of that load which troubled it for often as we walked together through the yellow fields of an evening it had been on my tongue to confess the lie mr allen had led me into but the sight of the old man trembling and tremulous aged by a single stroke his childlike trust in my strength and beliefs and above all his faith in a political creed which he nigh deemed needful for the souls salvationthese things still held me back was it worth while now i asked myself to disturb the peace of that mind  thus the summer wore on to early autumn and one day i was standing booted and spurred in the stables harvey putting the bridle upon firefly when my boy hugo comes running in  marse dick he cries marse satan he come in the pinnace and young marse satan and missis satan and marse satans pastor  what the devil do you mean hugo  young ebonys right sir chuckled harvey tis the devil and his following  do you mean mr grafton fellow i demanded the unwelcome truth coming over me  that he does remarked harvey laconically you wont be wanting her now your honour  hold my stirrup i cried for the news had put me in anger hold my stirrup sirrah  i believe i took firefly the best of thirty miles that afternoon and brought her back in the halflight my saddle discoloured with her sweat i clanked into the hall like a captain of horse the night was sharp with the first touch of autumn and a huge backlog lay on the irons around it in a comfortable halfcircle sat our guests grafton and mr allen and philip smoking and drinking for a whet against supper and mrs grafton in my grandfathers chair there was an easy air of possession about the party of them that they had never before assumed and the sight made me rattle again the big door behind me  a surprise for you my dear nephew grafton said gayly ill lay a puncheon you did not expect us  mr carvel woke with a start at the sound of the door and said querulously guests my lord and i have done my poor best to make them welcome in your absence  the sense of change in him stung me how different would his tone have been a year ago  he tattooed with his cane which was the sign he generally made when he was ready for bed toward night his speech would hurt him i assisted him up the stairs my uncle taking his arm on the other side and together with diomedes help we undressed him grafton talking in low tomes the while since this was an office i was wont to perform my temper was now overwhelming me but i kept my month closed at last he had had the simple meal dr leiden allowed him his candles were snuffed and my uncle and i made our way to the hall together there my aunt and mr allen were at picquet  supper is insupportably late says she with a yawn and rings the handbell scipio she cries why are we not served  i took a stride forward but my uncle raised a restraining hand  caroline remember that this is not our house says he reprovingly  there fell a deep silence the log cracking and just then the door swung on its hinges and mr starkie entered with the great bunch of keys in his hand  the buildings are all secure mr richard he said  very good starkie i replied i turned to scipio standing by the lowboy his teeth going like a castanet  you may serve at the usual hour scipio said i  supper began stiff as a state banquet my uncle was conciliatory with the manners of a crichton my aunt not having come from generations of silver and selfcontrol flatly in a bad humour mr allen talked from force of habit being used to pay in such kind for his meals but presently the madeira warmed these two into a better spirit i felt that i had victory on my side and was nothing loth to join them at whist philip and i against the rector and my aunt and won something like two pounds apiece from them grafton made it a rule never to play  the next morning when i returned from my inspection i found the rector and philip had decamped with two of our choice horses and that my uncle and aunt had commanded the barge and gone to mr lloyds i sent for scipio  fore de lawd marse richard he wailed twant scipios fault marse grafton is dry fambly this was scipios strongest argument i jes cant refuse one of de fambly marse dick and old marse he say he too old now for quarrellin  i saw that resistance was useless there was nothing for it but to bide any time and i busied myself with bills of cargo until i heard the horses on the drive mr allen and philip came swaggering in flushed with the exercise and calling for punch and i met them in the hall  a word with you mr allen i called out  a thousand mr richard if you like he said gayly as soon as this thirst of mine be quenched  i waited while he drained two glasses when he followed me into the library closing the door behind him  now sir i began though by a chance you are my mental and spiritual adviser i intend speaking plain for i know you to be one of the greatest rogues in the colony  i watched him narrowly the while for i had some notion he might run me through but i had misjudged him  speak plain by all means he replied but first let me ask for some tobacco  he filled the bowl of his pipe and sat him down by the window for the moment i was silent with sheer surprise  you know i cant call you out he went on surrounding himself with clouds of smoke a lad of eighteen or so and even if i could i doubt whether i should i like you richard said he you are straightspoken and commanding in brief sir you are the kind of lad i should have been had not fate pushed me into a corner and made me squirm for lifes luxuries i hate squirming as much as another this is prime tobacco richard  he had come near disarming me i was on the edge of a dangerous admiration for this man of the world and for the life of me i could not help liking him then he had a fine presence was undeniably handsome and his riding clothes were of the latest london cut  are there not better methods for obtaining what you wish than those you practise i asked curiously  no doubt he answered carelessly but these are well enough and shorter you were about to do me the honour of a communication  this brought me to my senses i had however lost much of my heat in the interval  i should like to know why you lied to mr carvel about my convictions mr allen i said i am not of the kings party now and never shall be and you know this better than another  those are strong words richard my lad said he bringing his eyebrows together  they are true words i retorted why did you lie i say  he said nothing for a while but his breath came heavily  i will pass it i will pass it he said at length but by god it is more than i have had to swallow in all my life before look at your grandfather sir he cried behold him on the very brink of the grave and ask me again why i lied to him his hope of heaven is scarce less sacred to him than his love of the king and both are so tightly wrapped about his heart that this knowledge of you would break it yes break his heart i say and he got to his legs and you would kill him for the sake of a boyish fancy  i knew he was acting as well as though he had climbed upon the table and said it and yet he had struck the very note of my own fears and hit upon the one reason why i had not confessed lung ago  there is more you might have said mr allen i remarked presently you have a cause for keeping me under your instruction and that is behind all  he gave me a strange look  you are too acute by far said he your imagination runs with you i have said i like you and i can teach you classics as well as another is it not enough to admit that the money i get for your instruction keeps me in champagne  no it is not enough i said stoutly  then you must guess again my lad he answered with a laugh and left the room with the easy grace that distinguished him  there was armed peace the rest of my uncles visit they departed on the third day my aunt caroline when she was not at picquet with mr allen or quarrelling with mrs willis or with grafton himself yawned without cessation she declared in one of her altercations with her lord and master that she would lose her wits were they to remain another day a threat that did not seem to move grafton greatly philip ever maintained the right to pitch it on the side of his own convenience and he chose in this instance to come to the rescue of his dear mamma and turned the scales in her favour he was pleased to characterize the hall as insupportable and vowed that his clothes would be out of fashion before they reached rousby hall their next stoppingplace to do philip justice he was more honest a rascal than his father though i am of the opinion that he had not the brain for great craft and he had drawn from his mother a love of baubles which kept his mind from scheming he had little to say to me and i less to him  grafton as may be supposed made me distinct advances before his departure perceiving the unwisdom of antagonizing me unnecessarily he had the imprudence once to ask of me the facts and figures of the estate and tho twas skilfully done by contrasting his own crops in kent you may be sure i was on my guard and that he got nothing  i was near forgetting an incident of their visit which i afterwards had good cause to remember the morning of my talk with mr allen i went to the stables to see how he had used cynthia and found old harvey wiping her down and rumbling the while like a crater  what think you of the rector as a representative of heaven harvey i asked  him a representative of heaven he snorted ive heard tell of rotten boroughs and im thinking mr allen will be standing for one what be him and mr grafton adoing here sir plotting all kinds o crime while the old gentlemans nigh on his back  plotting i said catching at the word  ay plotting repeated harvey casting his cloth away murder and all the crimes in the calendar i take it i hear him and mr grafton among the stalls this morning and when they sees me they look like knipe here caught with a fowl  and what were they saying i demanded  saying god only knows their wickedness i got the words upper marlboro and south river and next voyage and that profligate rector wanted to know as to how griggs was reliable  i thought no more of it at the time believing it to be some of the small rascalities they were forever at but that name of griggs why the powers only know stuck in my mind to turn up again     chapter x the red in the carvel blood  after that when we went back to annapolis for the winter there was no longer any disguise between my tutor and myself i was not of a mind to feign a situation that did not exist nor to permit him to do so i gave him to understand that tho i went to him for instruction twas through no fault of mine that i would learn what i pleased and do what pleased me and the rector a curse upon him seemed well content with that nor could i come at his devils reason far wanting me save for the money as he had declared there were days when he and i never touched a hook both being out of humour for study when he told me yarns of frederick of prussia and his giant guard of florence and of venice and of the court of his holiness of rome for he had drifted about the earth like a logend in the atlantic before his lordship gave him his present berth we passed too whole mornings at picquet i learning enough of horace to quote at the routs we both attended but a deal more of kings and deuces and as i may add that he got no more of my money than did i of his  the wonder of it was that we never became friends he was two men this rector of st annes half of him as lovable as any i ever encountered but trust him i never would always meeting him on the middle ground and there were times after his talks with grafton when his eyes were like a cats and i was conscious of a sinister note in his dealing which put me on my guard  you will say my dears that some change had come over me that i was no longer the same lad i have been telling you of  those days were not these yet i make no show of hiding or of palliation was it dorothys conduct that drove me not wholly a wild red was ever in the carvel blood in captain jack in lionel in the ancestor of king charless day who fought and bled and even gambled for his king and my grandfather knew this he warned me but he paid my debts and i thank heaven he felt that my heart was right  i was grown now certainly in stature and having managed one of the largest plantations in the province i felt the man as lads are wont after their first responsibilities i commanded my wine at the coffee house with the best of the bucks and was made a member of the south river and jockey clubs i wore the clothes that came out to me from london and vied in fashion with dr courtenay and other macaronies and i drove a carriage of mine own the carvel arms emblazoned thereon and hugo in the family livery  after a deal of thought upon the subject i decided for a while at least to show no political leanings at all and this was easier of accomplishment than you may believe for at that time in maryland tory and whig were amiable enough and the young gentlemen of the first families dressed alike and talked alike at the parties they both attended the nonimportation association had scarce made itself felt in the dress of society gentlemen of degree discussed differences amicably over their decanters and only on such occasions as mr hoods return and the procession of the lower house through the streets and the arrival of the good intent did high words arise among the quality and it was because class distinctions were so strongly marked that it took so long to bring loyalists and patriots of high rank to the swords point  i found time to manage such business affairs of mr carvels as he could not attend to himself grafton and his family dined in marlboro street twice in the week my uncles conduct toward me was the very soul of consideration and he compelled that likewise from his wife and his son so circumspect was he that he would have fooled one who knew him a whit less than i he questioned me closely upon my studies and in my grandfathers presence i was forced to answer and when the rector came to dine and read to mr carvel my uncle catechised him so searchingly on my progress that he was pushed to the last source of his ingenuity for replies more than once was i tempted to blurt out the whole wretched business for i well understood there was some deep game between him and grafton in my uncles absence my aunt never lost a chance for an illnatured remark upon patty whom she had seen that winter at the assemblies and elsewhere and she deplored the state our people of fashion were coming to that they allowed young girls without family to attend their balls  but we can expect little else father she would say to mr carvel nodding in his chair when some of our best families openly espouse the pernicious doctrines of republicanism they are gone half mad over that wilkes who should have been hung before this philip dear pour the wine for your grandfather  miss patty had been well received i took her to her first assembly where her simple and unassuming ways had made her an instant favourite and her face which had the beauty of dignity and repose even so early in life gained her ample attention i think she would have gone but little had not her father laughed her out of some of her domesticity no longer at sunday night supper in gloucester street was the guest seat empty there was more than one guest seat now and the honest barrister himself was the most pleased at the change as i took my accustomed place on the settle cushionpattys first embroideryhe would cry  heigho richard our little miss prim hath become a belle and i must have another clerk now to copy out my briefs and a housekeeper soon i faith  patty would never fail to flush up at the words and run to perch on her fathers knee and put her hand over his mouth  how can you mr swain says she how can you when tis you and mother and richard here who make me go into the world you know i would a thousand times rather bake your cakes and clean your silver but you will not hear of it  fie says the barrister listen to her richard and yet she will fly up the stairs to don a fine gown at the first rap of the knocker oh the wenches the wenches are they not all alike mother  they have changed none since i was a lass replies the quiet invalid with a smile and you should know what i was henry  i know cries he none better well i recall the salmon and white your mother gave you before i came to salem he sighed and then laughed at the recollection and when this strapping young singleton comes richard twould do you good to be hiding there in that cupboardand it would hold youand count the seconds until miss prim has her skirt in her hand and her foot on the lower step and yet how innocent is she now before you and me  here he would invariably be smothered  percy singleton says patty with a fine scorn twill be mr eglinton the curate next  this i know says her father slapping me on the shoulder this i know that you are content to see richard without primping  but i have known richard since i was six says she richard is one of the family there is no need of disguise from him  i thought ruefully enough that it seemed my fate to be one of the family everywhere i went  and just then as if in judgment the gate snapped and the knocker sounded and patty leaped down with a blush what said i say cries the barrister i have not seen human nature in court for naught run now says he pinching her cheek as she stood hesitating whether to fly or stay run and put on the new dress i have bought you and richard and i will have a cup of ale in the study  the visitor chanced to be will fotheringay that time he was not the only one worn out with the mad chase in prince george street and preferred a quiet evening with a quiet beauty to the crowded lists of miss manners will declared that the other gallants were fools over the rare touch of blue in the black hair give him miss swains quoth he lifting his glasshers was the colour of a new sovereign will was not the only one but i think percy singleton was the best of them all tho patty ridiculed himevery chance she got and even to his face so will the besthearted and soberest of women play the coquette singleton was rather a reserved young englishman of four and twenty who owned a large estate in talbot which he was laying out with great success of a whig family in the old country he had been drawn to that party in the new and so had made mr swains acquaintance the next step in his fortunes was to fall in love with patty which was natural enough many a night that winter i walked with him from gloucester street to the coffee house to sit an hour over a battle and there master tom and dr hamilton and other gay macaronies would sometimes join us singleton had a greater contempt for tom than i but bore with him for his sisters sake for tom in addition to his other follies was become an open loyalist and never missed his majestys health though he knew no better than my hugo the question at issue twas not zeal for king george however that made him drunk at one of the assemblies and forced his sister to leave in the midst of a dance for very shame  oh richard is there not something you can do she cried when i had got her back in the little parlour in gloucester street father has argued and pleaded and threatened in vain i thoughti thought perhaps you might help him  i think i am not one to preach or to boast i replied soberly  yes said she looking grave i know you are wilder than you used to be that you play more than you ought and higher than you ought  i was silent  and i suspect at whose door it lies said she  tis in the blood patty i answered  she glanced at me quickly  i know you better than you think she said but tom has not your excuse and if he had only your faults i would say nothing he does not care for those he should and he is forever in the greenroom of the theatre  i made haste to change the subject and to give her what comfort i might for she was sobbing before she finished and the next day i gave tom a round talkingto for having so little regard for his sister the hem of whose skirt he was not worthy to touch he took it meekly enough with a barrel of pat excuses to come after and he asked me to lend him my phaeton that he might go adriving with miss crane of the theatrical company to round bay  meanwhile i saw miss manners more frequently than was good for my peace of mind and had my turn as her partner at the balls but i could not bring myself to take third or fourth rank in the army that attended her i who had been her playmate would not become her courtier besides i had not the wit  was it strange that dr courtenay should pride himself upon the discovery of a new beauty and in the coffee house and in every drawingroom in town prophesy for her a career of conquest such as few could boast she was already launched upon that career and rumour had it that mr marmaduke was even then considering taking her home to london where the stage was larger and the triumph greater was it surprising that the gazette should contain a poem with the doctors wellknown earmarks upon it it set the town awagging and left no room for doubt as to who had inspired it         sweet pandora tho formed of clay         was fairer than the light of day         by venus learned in beautys arts         and destined thus to conquer hearts         a goddess of this town i ween         fair as pandora scarce sixteen         is destined een by joves command         to conquer all of maryland         oh bachelors play have a care         for she will all your hearts ensnare  so it ran i think if dear mrs manners could have had her way dolly would have passed that year at a certain young ladies school in new york but mr marmadukes pride in his daughters beauty got the better of her the strut in his gait became more marked the day that poem appeared and he went to the coffee house both morning and evening taking snuff to hide his emotions when miss manners was spoken of and he was perceived by many in church street arm in arm with dr courtenay himself  as you may have imagined before now the doctors profession was leisure not medicine he had known ambition once it was said and with reason for he had studied surgery in germany for the mere love of the science after which making the grand tour in france and italy he had taken up that art of being a gentleman in which men became so proficient in my young days he had learned to speak french like a parisian had hobnobbed with wit and wickedness from versailles to rome and then had come back to annapolis to set the fashions and to spend the fortune his uncle lately had left him he was our censor of beauty and passed judgment upon all young ladies as they stepped into the arena to be noticed by him meant success to be honoured in the gazette was to be crowned at once a reigning belle the chord of his approval once set avibrating all minor chords sang in harmony and it was the doctor who raised the first public toast to miss manners alas i might have known it would be so  but miss dorothy was not of a nature to remain dependent upon a censors favour the minx deported herself like any london belle of experience as tho she had known the world from her cradle she was not to be deceived by the face value of the ladies praises nor rebuffed unmercifully by my aunt caroline who had held the sceptre in the absence of a younger aspirant the first time these ladies clashed which was not long in coming my aunt met with a wit as sharp again as her own and never afterwards essayed an open tilt the homage of men dolly took as caesar received tribute as a matter of course the doctor himself rode to the races beside the manners coach leaning gallantly over the door my lady held court in her fathers box received and dismissed smiled and frowned with courtenay as her master of ceremonies mr dulany was one of the presidents of the jockey club that year and his horse winning the honours he presented her with his colours scarlet and white which she graciously wore the doctor swore he would import a horse the next season on the chance of the privilege my aunt was furious i have never mentioned her beauty because i never could see it twas a coarser type than attracted me she was then not greatly above six and thirty appearing young for that age and she knew the value of lead in judicious quantity at that meet gentlemen came to her box only to tally of miss manners to marvel that one so young could have the bel air to praise her beauty and addresse or to remark how well mr durlanys red and white became her with all of which mrs grafton was fain to agree and must even excel until her small stock of patience was exhausted to add to her chagrin my aunt lost a pretty sum to the rector by mr dulanys horse i came upon her after the race trying to coax her headdress through her coach door mr allen having tight hold of her hand the while  and so he thinks he has found a divinity does he i overheard her saying i for one am heartily sick of dr courtenays motions were he to choose a wench out of the kings passengers id warrant our macaronies to compose odes to her eyebrows and at that moment perceiving me she added why so disconsolate my dear nephew miss dolly is the craze now and will last about as long as another of the doctors whims and then you shall have her to yourself  a pretty woman is ever the fashion aunt caroline i said  hoitytoity returned my aunt who had by then succeeded in getting her headgear safe within the fashion yes until a prettier comes along  there is small danger of that for the present i said smiling surely you can find no fault with this choice  gadzooks if i were blind sir i think i might she cried unguardedly  i will not dispute that aunt caroline i answered  and as i rode off i heard her giving directions in no mild tone to the coachman through mr allen  perchance you did not know my dears that annapolis had the first theatre in all the colonies and if you care to search through the heap of maryland gazettes in the garret i make no doubt you will come across this announcement for a certain night in the spring of the year 1769         by permission of his excellency the governor           at the new theatre in annapolis       by the american company of comedians on monday     next being the 22nd of this instant will be performed                romeo and juliet        romeo by a young gentleman for his diversion             likewise the farce called                miss in her teens        to begin precisely at seven of the clock tickets     to be had at the printing office box 10s pit 1s 6d        no person to be admitted behind the scenes   the gentleman to perform romeo was none other than dr courtenay himself he had a gentlemanly passion for the stage as was the fashion in those days and had organized many private theatricals the town was in a ferment over the event boxes being taken a week ahead the doctor himself writ the epilogue to be recited by the beautiful mrs hallam who had inspired him the year before to compose that famous poem beginning            around her see the graces play           see venus wanton doves           and in her eyes pellucid ray           see little laughing loves           ye gods tis cythereas face   you may find that likewise in mr greens newspaper  the new theatre was finished in west street that spring the old one having proven too small for our gay capital twas then the best in the new world the censor having pronounced it far above any provincial playhouse he had seen abroad the scenes were very fine the boxes carved and gilded in excellent good taste and both pit and gallery commodious and we too had our fops alley where our macaronies ogled the fair and passed from box to box  for that night of nights when the doctor acted i received an invitation from dolly to mr marmadukes box and to supper afterward in prince george street when i arrived the playhouse was lit with myriad candlesto be snuffed save the footlights presentlyand the tiers were all brilliant with the costumes of ladies and gentlemen miss tayloe and miss dulany were of our party with fitzhugh and worthington and mr manners for propriety the little fop spent his evening by the way in a box opposite where my aunt caroline gabbled to him and mr allen during the whole performance my lady got more looks than any in the house she always drew admiration indeed but there had been much speculation of late whether she favoured dr courtenay or fitzhugh and some had it that the doctors acting would decide between the two  when romeo came upon the stage he was received with loud applause but my lady showed no interestnot she while the doctor fervently recited out of her favour where i am in love in the first orchard scene with the boldness of a practised lover he almost ignored mrs hallam in the balcony it seemed as though he cast his burning words and languishing glances at my lady in the box whereupon there was a deal of nudging round about miss asked for her smelling salts and declared the place was stifling but i think if the doctor had cherished a hope of her affections he lost it when he arrived at the lines she speaks yet she says nothing at that unhappy moment miss dorothy was deep in conversation with fitzhugh the audible titter in the audience arousing her how she reddened when she perceived the faces turned her way  what was it betty she demanded quickly  but betty was not spiteful and would not tell fitzhugh himself explained and to his sorrow for during the rest of the evening she would have nothing to do with him presently she turned to me glancing upward to where patty leaned on the rail between will fotheringay and singleton she whispered  i wonder you can sit here so quiet richard you are showing a deal of selfdenial  i am happy enough i answered surprised  i hear you have a rival says she  i know i have a dozen i answered  i saw percy singleton walking with her in mr galloways fields but yesterday said dolly and as they came out upon the road they looked as guilty as if i had surprised them arm in arm  now that she should think i cared for patty never entered my head i was thrown all in a heap  you need not be so disturbed whispers my lady singleton has a crooked mouth and i credit patty with ample sense to choose between you i adore her richard i wish i had her sweet ways  but i interrupted when i was somewhat recovered why should you think me in love with patty i have never been accused of that before  oh fie you deny her says dolly i did not think that of you richard  you should know better i replied with some bitterness  we were talking in low tones dolly with her head turned from the stage whence the doctor was flinging his impassioned speeches in vain and though the light fell not upon her face i seemed to feel her looking me through and through  you do not care for patty she whispered and i thought a quiver of earnestness was in her voice her face was so close to mine that her breath fanned my cheek  no i said why do you ask me have i ever been one to make pretences  she turned away  but you i said bending to her ear is it fitzhugh dorothy  i heard her laugh softly  no said she i thought you might divine sir  was it possible and yet she had played so much with me that i dared not risk the fire she had too many accomplished gallants at her feet to think of richard who had no novelty and no wit i sat still barely conscious of the rising and falling voices beyond the footlights feeling only her living presence at my side she spoke not another word until the playhouse servants had relighted the chandeliers and dr courtenay came in flushed with triumph for his mead of praise  and how went it miss manners says he very confident  why you fell over the orchard wall doctor retorts my lady la i believe i could have climbed it better myself  and all he got was a hearty laugh for his pains mr marmaduke joining in from the back of the box and the story was at the coffee house early on the morrow     chapter xi a festival and a parting  my grandfather and i were seated at table together it was early june the birds were singing in the garden and the sweet odours of the flowers were wafted into the room  richard says he when scipio had poured his claret my illness cheated you out of your festival last year i dare swear you deem yourself too old for birthdays now  i laughed  so it is with lads said mr carvel they will rush into manhood as heedless as you please take my counsel boy and remain young do not cross the bridge before you have to and i have been thinking that we shall have your fete this year albeit you are grown and miss dolly is the belle of the province tis like sunshine into my old heart to see the lads and lasses again and to hear the merry merry fiddling i will have his new excellency who seems a good and a kindly man and lloyd and tilghman and dulany and the rest with their ladies to sit with me and there will be plenty of punch and syllabub and sangaree i warrant and tarts and jellies and custards too for the misses ring for mrs willis my son  willis came with her curtsey to the old gentleman who gave his order then and there he never waited for a fancy of this kind to grow cold  we shall all be children again on that day mrs willis says he and i catch any old people about they shall be thrust straight in the town stocks i faith  willis made another curtsey  we missed it sorely last year please your honour says she and departs smiling  and you shall have your patty swain richard mr carvel continued do you mind how you once asked the favour of inviting her in the place of a present oons i loved you for that boy twas like a carvel and i love that lass whig or no whig pon my soul i do she hath demureness and dignity and suits me better than yon whimsical baggage you are all mad over ill have mr swain beside me too ill warrant id teach his daughter loyalty in a day and i had again your years and your spirit  i have but to close my eyes and my fancy takes me back to that birthday festival think of it my dears near threescore years are gone since then when this old man you call grandfather and somebless megreatgrandfather was a lusty lad like comyn here but his hand is steady as he writes these words and his head clear because he hath not greatly disabused that life which god has given him  how can i tho her face and form are painted on my memory tell you what fair pert miss dorothy was at that time ay i know what you would say that sir joshuas portrait hangs above executed but the year after and hung at the second exhibition of the royal academy as i look upon it now i say that no whit of its colour is overcharged and there is likewise mr peales portrait done much later i answer that these great masters have accomplished what poor human art can do but nature hath given us a better picture come hither bess yes truly you have dollys hair with the very gloss upon it but fashions have changed my child and that is not as dolly wore it whereupon bess goes to the portrait and presently comes back to give me a start and then we go hand in hand up the stairs of calvert house even to the garret where an old cedar chest is laid away under the eaves bess the minx well knows it and takes out a prim little gown with the white fading yellow and white silk mits without fingers and white stockings with clocks and a gauze cap with wings and streamers that sits saucily on the black locks and the lawnembroidered apron and such dainty highheeled slippers with the pearls still aglisten upon the buckles away she flies to put them on and then my heart gives a leap to see my dorothy back againback again as she was that june afternoon we went together to my last birthday party her girlish arms bare to the elbow and the lace about her slender throat yes bess hath the very tilt of her chin the regal grace of that slim figure and the deep blue eyes  grandfather dear you are crushing the gown  and so the fire is not yet gone out of this old frame  ah yes there they are again those unpaved streets of old annapolis arched with great trees on either side and here is dolly holding her skirt in one hand and her fan in the other and i in a brave blue coat and pumps with gold buttons and a cocked hat of the newest fashion i had met her leaning over the gate in prince george street and what was strange for her so deep in thought that she jumped when i spoke her name  dorothy i have come for you to walk to the party as we used when we were children  as we used when we were children cried she and flinging wide the gate stretched out her hand for me to take and you are eighteen years today it seems but last year when we skipped hand in hand to marlboro street with mammy lucy behind us are you coming mammy she called  yes mistis ise comin said a voice from behind the goldenrose bushes and out stepped aunt lucy in a new turban making a curtsey to me la marse richard said she to think youse growed to be a fine gemman taint but tother day you was kissin miss dolly on de plantation  it seems longer than that to me aunt lucy i answered laughing at dollys blushes  you have too good a memory mammy said my lady withdrawing her fingers from mine  bress you honey de ole woman doant forgit some things  and she fell back to a respectful six paces  those were happy times said dorothy then the little sigh became a laugh i mean to enjoy myself today richard but i fear i shall not see as much of you as i used you are old enough to play the host now  you shall see as much as you will  where have you been of late sir in gloucester street  tis your own fault dolly you are changeable as the skytoday sunny and tomorrow cold i am sure of my welcome in gloucester street  she tripped a step as we turned the corner and came closer to my side  you must learn to take me as you find me dear richard today i am in a holiday humour  some odd note in her tone troubled me and i glanced at her quickly she was a constant wonder and puzzle to me after that night at the theatre my hopes had risen for the hundredth time but i had gone to prince george street on the morrow to meet another rebuffand fitzhugh so i had learned to interpret her by other means than words and now her mood seemed reckless rather than merry  are you not happy dolly i asked abruptly  she laughed what a silly question she said why do you ask  because i believe you are not  in surprise she looked up at me and then down at the pearls upon her satin slippers  i am going with you to your birthday festival richard could we wish for more i am as happy as you  that may well be for i might be happier  again her eyes met mine and she hummed an air so we came to the gate beside which stood diomedes and hugo in the family claretred a coach was drawn up and another behind it and we went down the leafy walk in the midst of a bevy of guests  we have no such places nowadays my dears as was my grandfathers the ground between the street and the brick wall in the rear was a great stretch as ample in acreage as many a small countryplace we have in these times the house was on the high land in front hedged in by old trees and thence you descended by stately tiers until you came to the level which held the dancers beyond that and lower still a lilied pond widened out of the sluggish brook with a cool and rustic springhouse at one end the springhouse was thatched with windows looking out upon the water long after when i went to france i was reminded of the shy beauty of this part of my old home by the secluded pond of the little trianon so was it that king louiss versailles had spread its influence a thousand leagues to our youthful continent  my grandfather sat in his great chair on the sward beside the fiddlers his old friends gathering around him as in former years  and this is the miss that hath already broken half the bachelor hearts in town said he gayly what was my prediction miss dolly when you stepped your first dance at carvel hall  indeed you do me wrong mr carvel  and i were a buck you would not break mine i warrant unless it were tit for tat said my grandfather thereby putting me to more confusion than dolly who laughed with the rest  tis well to boast mr carvel when we are out of the battle cried mr lloyd  dolly was carried off immediately as i expected the doctor and worthington and fitzhugh were already there and waiting i stood by mr carvels chair receiving the guests and presently came mr swain and patty  heigho called mr carvel when he saw her here is the young lady that hath my old affections you are right welcome mr swain scipio another chair tis not over the wall any more miss patty with our flowered india silk but i vow i love you best with your etui  patty too was carried off for you may be sure that will fotheringay and singleton were standing on one foot and then the other waiting for mr carvel to have done next arrived my aunt in a wide calash and a wider hoop her stays laced so that she limped and her hair wonderfully and fearfully arranged by her frenchman neither she nor grafton was slow to shower congratulations upon my grandfather and myself mr marmaduke went through the ceremony after them dorothys mother drew me aside as long as i could remember her face had been one that revealed a lifes disappointment but today i thought it bore a trace of a deeper anxiety  how well i recall this day eighteen years ago richard she said and how proud your dear mother was that she had given a son to captain jack she had prayed for a son i hope you will always do your parents credit my dear boy they were both dear dear friends of mine  my aunt carolines harsher voice interrupted her  gadzooks maam she cried as she approached us i have never in my life laid eyes upon such beauty as your daughters you will have to take her home mrs manners to do her justice you owe it her maam come nephew off with you and head the minuet with miss dolly  my grandfather was giving the word to the fiddlers but whether a desire to cross my aunt held me back or a sense of duty to greet the guests not already come or a vague intuition of some impending news drawn from mrs manners and dorothy i know not mr fitzhugh was easily persuaded to take my place and presently i slipped unnoticed into a shaded seat on the side of the upper terrace whence i could see the changing figures on the green and i thought of the birthday festivals dolly and i had spent here almost since we were of an age to walk wet june days when the broad wings of the house rang with the sound of silver laughter and pattering feet and echoed with music from the hall and merry june days when the laughter rippled among the lilacs and pansies and poppies and sweet peas were outshone by bright gowns and brighter faces and then as if to complete the picture of the past my eye fell upon our mammies modestly seated behind the group of older people aunt hester and aunt lucy their honest black faces aglow with such unselfish enjoyment as they alone could feel  how easily i marked dorothy among the throng  other girls found it hard to compress the spirits of youth within the dignity of a minuet and thought of the childish romp of former years not so my lady long afterwards i saw her lead a ball with the first soldier and gentleman of the land but on that tuesday she carried herself full as well so well that his excellency and the gentlemen about him applauded heartily as the strains died away and the couples moved off among the privetlined paths i went slowly down the terrace dorothy had come up to speak to her mother dr courtenay lingering impatient at her side and though her colour glowed deeper and the wind had loosed a wisp of her hair she took his excellencys compliments undisturbed colonel sharpe our former governor who now made his home in the province sat beside him  now where adeuce were you richard said he you have missed as pleasing a sight as comes to a man in a lifetime why were you not here to see miss manners tread a minuet my word terpsichore herself could scarce have made it go better  i saw the dance sir from a safe distance i replied  ill warrant said he laughing while dolly shot me a wayward glance from under her long lashes ill warrant your eyes were fast on her from beginning to end come sir confess  his big frame shook with the fun of it for none in the colony could be jollier than he on holiday occasions and the group of ladies and gentlemen beside him caught the infection so that i was sore put to it  will your excellency confess likewise i demanded  so i will richard and make patent to all the world that she hath the remains of that shuttlecock my heart  up gets his excellency for so we still called him and makes dolly a low reverence kissing the tips of her white fingers my lady drops a mock curtsey in return  your excellency can do no less than sue for a dance drawled dr courtenay  and no more i fear sir not being so nimble as i once was i resign in your favour doctor said colonel sharpe  dr courtenay made his bow his hat tucked under his arm but he had much to learn of miss manners if he thought that even one who had been governor of the province could command her the music was just begun again and i making off in the direction of patty swain when i was brought up as suddenly as by a rope a curl was upon dorothys lips  the dance belongs to richard doctor she said  egad courtenay there you have a buffer cried colonel sharpe as the muchdiscomfited doctor bowed with a very ill grace while i in no small bewilderment walked off with dorothy and a parting shot of the delighted colonel brought the crimson to my face like the wind or april weather was my lady and her ways far beyond such a great simpleton as i  so i am ever forced to ask you to dance said dolly  what were you about moping off alone with a party in your honour sir  i was watching you as i told his excellency  oh fie she cried why dont you assert yourself richard there was a time when you gave me no peace  and then you rebuked me for dangling i retorted  up started the music the fiddlers bending over their bows with flushed faces having dipped into the cool punch in the interval away flung my lady to meet singleton while i swung patty who squeezed my hand in return and soon we were in the heat of itsober minuet no longer but romp and riot the screams of the lasses amingle with our own laughter as we spun them until they were dizzy my brain was awhirl as well and presently i awoke to find dolly pinching my arm  have you forgotten me richard she whispered my other hand sir it is i down the middle  down we flew between the laughing lines dolly tripping with her head high and then back under the clasped hands in the midst of a fire of raillery then the music stopped some strange exhilaration was in dorothy  do you remember the place where i used to play fairy godmother and wind the flowers into my hair said she  what need to ask  come she commanded decisively  with all my heart i exclaimed wondering at this new caprice  if we can but slip away unnoticed they will never find us there she said and led the way herself silent at length we came to the damp shade where the brook dived under the corner of the wall i stooped to gather the lilies of the valley and she wove them into her hair as of old suddenly she stopped the bunch poised in her hand  would you miss me if i went away richard she asked in a low voice  what do you mean dolly i cried my voice failing just that said she  i would miss you and sorely tho you give me trouble enough  soon i shall not be here to trouble you richard papa has decided that we sail next week on the annapolis for home  home i gasped england  i am going to make my bow to royalty replied she dropping a deep curtsey your majesty this is miss manners of the province of maryland  but next week i repeated with a blank face surely you cannot be ready for the annapolis  mcandrews has instructions to send our things after said she there you are the first person i have told you should feel honoured sir  i sat down upon the grass by the brook and for the moment the sap of life seemed to have left me dolly continued to twine the flowers through the trees sifted the voices and the music sounds of happiness far away when i looked up again she was gazing into the water  are you glad to go i asked  of course answered the minx readily i shall see the world and meet people of consequence  so you are going to england to meet people of consequence i cried bitterly  how provincial you are richard what people of consequence have we here the governor and the honourable members of his council forsooth there is not a title save his excellencys in our whole colony and virginia is scarce better provided  in spite of my feeling i was fain to laugh at this knowing well that she had culled it all from little mr marmaduke himself  all in good time said i we shall have no lack of noted men presently  mere twopenny heroes she retorted i know your great men such as mr henry and dr franklin and mr adams  i began pulling up the grass savagely by the roots  ill lay a hundred guineas you have no regrets at leaving any of us my fine miss i cried getting to my feet you would rather be a lady of fashion than have the love of an honest manyou who have the hearts of too many as it is  her eyes lighted but with mirth laughing she chose a little bunch of the lilies and worked them into my coat  richard you silly goose she said i dote upon seeing you in a temper  i stood between anger and god knows what other feelings now starting away now coming back to her but i always came back  you have ever said you would marry an earl dolly i said sadly i believe you do not care for any of us one little bit  she turned away so that for the moment i could not see her face then looked at me with exquisite archness over her shoulder the low tones of her voice were of a richness indescribable twas seldom she made use of them  you will be coming to oxford richard  i fear not dolly i replied soberly i fear not now mr carvel is too feeble for me to leave him  at that she turned to me another mood coming like a gust of wind on the chesapeake  oh how i wish they were all like you she cried with a stamp of her foot sometimes i despise gallantry i hate the smooth compliments of your macaronies i thank heaven you are big and honest and clumsy and  and what dorothy i asked bewildered  and stupid said she now take me back sir  we had not gone thirty paces before we heard a hearty bass voice singing         it was a lover and his lass         with a hey with a ho with a hey nonino  and there was colonel sharpe straying along among the privet hedges   and so the morning of her sailing came so full of sadness for me why not confess after nigh threescore years that break of day found me pacing the deserted dock at my back across the open space was the irregular line of quaint topheavy shops since passed away their sightless windows barred by solid shutters of oak the good ship annapolis which was to carry my playmate to broader scenes lay among the shipping in the gray roads just quickening with returning light how my heart ached that morning none shall ever know but as the sun shot a burning line across the water a new salt breeze sprang up and fanned a hope into flame twas the very breeze that was to blow dorothy down the bay sleepy apprentices took down the shutters and polished the windows until they shone again and chipper mr denton jacques who did such a thriving business opposite presently appeared to wish me a bright good morning  i knew that captain waring proposed to sail at ten of the clock but after breakfasting i was of two minds whether to see the last of miss dorothy foreseeing a levee in her honour upon the ship and so it proved i had scarce set out in a pungy from the dock when i perceived a dozen boats about the packet and when i thrust my shoulders through the gangway there was the company gathered at the mainmast they made a gay bit of colourdr courtenay in a green coat laced with fine mechlin fitzhugh in claret and silk stockings of a quaker gray and the other gentlemen as smartly drest the dulany girls and the fotheringay girls and i know not how many others were there to see their friend off for home  in the midst of them was dorothy in a crimson silk capuchin for we had had one of our changes of weather it was she who spied me as i was drawing down the ladder again  it is richard i heard her cry he has come at last  i gripped the rope tightly sprang to the deck and faced her as she came out of the group her lips parted and the red of her cheeks vying with the hood she wore i took her hand silently  i had given you over richard she said her eyes looking reproachfully into mine another ten minutes and i should not have seen you  indeed the topsails were already off the caps the captain on deck and the men gathered at the capstan  have you not enough to wish you goodby dolly i asked  there must be a score of them said my lady making a face but i wish to talk to you  mr marmaduke however had no notion of allowing a gathering in his daughters honour to be broken up it had been wickedly said of him when the news of his coming departure got around that he feared dorothy would fall in love with some provincial beau before he could get her within reach of a title when he observed me talking to her he hurried away from the friends come to see his wife he had none himself and seizing me by the arm implored me to take good care of my dear grandfather and to write them occasionally of the state of his health and likewise how i fared  i think dorothy will miss you more than any of them richard said he will you not my dear  but she was gone i too left him without ceremony to speak to mrs manners who was standing apart looking shoreward she started when i spoke and i saw that tears were in her eyes  are you coming back soon mrs manners i asked  oh richard i dont know she answered with a little choke in her voice i hope it will be no longer than a year for we are leaving all we hold dear for a very doubtful pleasure  she bade me write to them as mr marmaduke had only she was sincere then the mate came with his hand to his cap respectfully to inform visitors that the anchor was up and down albeit my spirits were low twas no small entertainment to watch the doctor and his rivals at their adieus courtenay had at his command an hundred subterfuges to outwit his fellows and so manoeuvred that he was the last of them over the side as for me luckily i was not worth a thought but as the doctor leaned over her hand i vowed in my heart that if dorothy was to be gained only in such a way i would not stoop to it and in my heart i doubted it i heard dr courtenay hint looking meaningly at her cloak that some of his flowers would not have appeared amiss there  why doctor says my lady aloud with a side glance at me the wisdom of solomon might not choose out of twenty baskets  and this was all the thanks he got for near a boatload of roses when at length the impatient mate had hurried him off dolly turned to me it was not in me to say more than  goodby dorothy and do not forget your old playmate he will never forget you  we stood within the gangway with a quick movement she threw open her cloak and pinned to her gown i saw a faded bunch of lilies of the valley  i had but the time to press her hand the boatswains pipe whistled and the big ship was already sliding in the water as i leaped into my pungy which hugo was holding to the ladder we pulled off to where the others waited  but the annapolis sailed away down the bay and never another glimpse we caught of my lady     chapter xii news from a far country  if perchance my dears there creeps into this chronicle too much of an old mans heart i know he will be forgiven what life ever worth living has been without its tender attachment because forsooth my hair is white now does bess flatter herself i do not know her secret or does comyn believe that these old eyes can see no farther than the spectacles before them were it not for the lovers my son satins and broadcloths had never been invented and were it not for the lovers what joys and sorrows would we lack in our lives  that was a long summer indeed and tho wilmot house was closed i often rode over of a morning when the dew was on the grass it cheered me to smoke a pipe with old mcandrews mr mannerss factor who loved to talk of miss dorothy near as much as i he had served her grandfather and people said that had it not been for mcandrews the manners fortune had long since been scattered since mr marmaduke knew nothing of anything that he should i could not hear from my lady until near the first of october and so i was fain to be content with memoriesmemories and hard work for i had complete charge of the plantation now  my uncle grafton came twice or thrice but without his family aunt caroline and philip having declared their independence my uncles manner to me was now of studied kindness and he was at greater pains than before to give me no excuse for offence i had little to say to him he spent his visits reading to mr carvel who sat in his chair all the day long mr allen came likewise to perform the same office  my contempt for the rector was grown more than ever on my grandfathers account however i refrained from quarrelling with him and when we were alone my plain speaking did not seem to anger him or affect him in any way others came too such was the affection mr carvels friends bore him that they did not desert him when he was no longer the companion he had been in former years we had more company than the summer before  in the autumn a strange thing happened when we had taken my grandfather to the hall in june his dotage seemed to settle upon him he became a trembling old man at times so peevish that we were obliged to summon with an effort what he had been he was suspicious and faultfinding with scipio and the other servants though they were never so busy for his wants mrs williss dainties were often untouched and he would frequently sit for hours between slumber and waking or mumble to himself as i read the prints but about the time of the equinoctial a great gale came out of the south so strongly that the water rose in the river over the boat landing and the roof was torn from one of the curingsheds the next morning dawned clear and brittle and blue to my great surprise mr carvel sent for me to walk with him about the place that he might see the damage with his own eyes a huge walnut had fallen across the drive and when he came upon it he stopped abruptly  old friend he cried have you succumbed after all these years have you dropped from the weight of a blow he passed his hand caressingly along the trunk and scarce ever had i seen him so affected in truth for the instant i thought him deranged he raised his cane above his shoulder and struck the bark so heavily that the silver head sunk deep into the wood look you richard he said the water coming into his eyes look you the heart of it is gone lad and when the heart is rotten tis time for us to go that walnut was a life friend my son we have grown together he continued turning from me to the giant and brushing his cheeks but by gods good will we shall not die so for my heart is still as young as the days when you were sprouting  and he walked back to the house more briskly than he had come refusing for the first time my arm and from that day i say he began to mend the lacing of red came again to his cheeks and before we went back to town he had walked with me to master dingleys tavern on the highroad and back  we moved into marlboro street the first part of november i had seen my lady off for england wearing my faded flowers the panniers of the fine gentleman in a neglected pile at her cabin door but not once had she deigned to write me it was mcandrews who told me of her safe arrival in annapolis rumours were aflying of conquests she had already made i found betty tayloe had had a letter filled with the fashion in caps and gowns and the mention of more than one noble name all of this being for unknown reasons sacred i was read only part of the postscript in which i figured the london season was done almost before we arrived so it ran we had but the opportunity to pay our humble respects to their majesties and appear at a few drummajors and garden fetes now we are off to brighthelmstone and thence so papa says to spa and the continent until the end of january i am pining for news of maryland dearest betty address me in care of mr ripley barrister of lincolns inn and bid richard carvel write me  which does not look as if she were coming back within the year said betty as she poured me a dish of tea  alas no but i did not write i tried and failed and then i tried to forget i was constant at all the gayeties gave every miss in town a share of my attention rode to hounds once a week at whitehall or the south river club with a dozen young beauties but cantering through the winter mists twas dolly in her red ridingcloak and white beaver i saw beside me none of them had her seat in the saddle and none of them her light hand on the reins and tho they lacked not fire and skill they had not my ladys dash and daring to follow over field and fallow stream and searing and be in at the death with heightened colour but never a look away  then came the first assembly of the year i got back from bentley manor where i had been avisiting the fotheringays just in time to call for patty in gloucester street  have you heard the news from abroad richard she asked as i handed her into my chariot  never a line i replied  pho exclaimed patty you tell me that where have you been hiding then you shall not have it from me  i had little trouble however in persuading her for news was a rare luxury in those days and patty was plainly uncomfortable until she should have it out  i would not give you the vapours tonight for all the world richard she exclaimed but if you mustdr courtenay has had a letter from mr manners who says that dolly is to marry his grace of chartersea there now  and i am not greatly disturbed i answered with a fine careless air  the lanthorn on the chariot was burning bright and i saw patty look at me and laugh  indeed says she what a sex is that to which you belong how ready are men to deny us at the first whisper and i thought you the most constant of all for my part i credit not a word of it tis one of mr marmadukes lies and vanities  and for my part i think it true as gospel i cried dolly always held a coronet above her colony and all her life has dreamed of a duke  nay answered patty more soberly nay you do her wrong you will discover one day that she is loyal to the core tho she has a fop of a father who would serve his graces chocolate we are all apt to talk my dear and to say what we do not mean as you are doing  were i to die tomorrow i would repeat it i exclaimed but i liked patty the better for what she had said  and there is more news of less import she continued as i was silent the thunderer dropped anchor in the roads today and her officers will be at the assembly and betty tells me there is a young lord among themla i have clean forgot the string of adjectives she usedbut she would have had me know he was as handsome as apollo and so dashing and diverting as to put courtenay and all our wits to shame she dined with him at the governors  i barely heard her tho i had seen the manowar in the harbour as i sailed in that afternoon  the assembly hall was filled when we arrived aglow with candles and atremble with music the powder already flying and the tables in the recesses at either end surrounded by those at the cards a lively scene those dances at the old stadt house but one i love best to recall with a presence that endeared it to me the ladies in flowered aprons and caps and brocades and trains and the gentlemen in brilliant coats trimmed with lace and stiffened with buckram that night as patty had predicted there was a smart sprinkling of uniforms from the thunderer one of those officers held my eye he was as wellformed a lad or man for he was both as it had ever been my lot to see he was neither tall nor short but of a good breadth his fair skin was tanned by the weather and he wore his own wavy hair powdered as was just become the fashion and tied with a ribbon behind  mercy richard that must be his lordship why his good looks are all betty claimed for them exclaimed patty mr lloyd who was standing by overheard her and was vastly amused at her downright way  i will fetch him directly miss swain said he as i have done for a dozen ladies before you and fetch him he did  miss swain this is my lord comyn said he your lordship one of the boasts of our province  patty grew red as the scarlet with which his lordships coat was lined she curtseyed while he made a profound bow  what another boast mr lloyd he cried miss swain is the tenth i have met but i vow they excel as they proceed  then you must meet no more my lord said patty laughing at mr lloyds predicament  egad then i will not declared comyn i protest i am satisfied  then i was presented he had won me on the instant with his open smile and frank boyish manner  and this is young mr carvel whom i hear wins every hunt in the colony said he  i fear you have been misinformed my lord i replied flashing with pleasure nevertheless  nay my lord mr lloyd struck in richard could ride down the devil himself and he were a fox you will see for yourself tomorrow  i pray we may not start the devil said his lordship or i shall be content to let mr carvel run him down  this comyn was a man after my own fancy as indeed he took the fancy of every one at the ball though a viscount in his own right he gave himself not half the airs over us provincials as did many of his messmates even mr jacques who was sour as last years cider over the doings of parliament lost his heart and asked why we were not favoured in america with more of his sort  by a great mischance lord comyn had fallen into the tender clutches of my aunt caroline it seemed she had known his uncle the honourable arthur comyn in new york and now she undertook to be responsible for his lordships pleasure at annapolis that he might meet only those of the first fashion seeing him talking to patty my aunt rose abruptly from her loo and made toward us all paint and powder and patches her chin in the air which barely enabled her to look over miss swains head  my lord she cries i will show you our colonial reel which is about to begin and i warrant you is gayer than any dance you have at home  your very devoted mrs carvel says his lordship with a bow but miss swain has done me the honour  o lud cries my aunt sweeping the room i vow i cannot keep pace with the misses nowadays is she here  she was but a moment since maam replied comyn instantly with a mischievous look at me while poor patty stood blushing not a yard distant  there were many who overheard and who used their fans and their napkins to hide their laughter at the very just snub mrs grafton had received and i wondered at the readiness with which he had read her character liking him all the better but my aunt was not to be disabled by thisnot she after the dance she got hold of him keeping him until certain designing ladies with daughters took him away their names charity forbids me to mention but in spite of them all he contrived to get patty for supper when i took betty tayloe and we were very merry at table together his lordship proved more than able to take care of himself and contrived to send philip about his business when he pulled up a chair beside us he drank a health to miss swain and another to miss tayloe and was on the point of filling a third glass to the ladies of maryland when he caught himself and brought his hand down on the table  gads life cried he but i think shes from maryland too  who demanded the young ladies in a breath  but i knew  who exclaimed comyn who but miss dorothy manners isnt she from maryland and marking our astonished nods he continued why she descended upon mayfair when they were so weary for something to worship and they went mad over her in a sennight i give you miss manners  and you know her exclaimed patty her voice quivering with excitement  faith said his lordship laughing for a whole month i was her most devoted as were we all at almacks i stayed until the last minute for a word with herwhich i never got by the wayand paid near a guinea a mile for a chaise to portsmouth as a consequence already she has had her choice from a thousand a year up and i tell you our english ladies are green with envy  i was stunned you may be sure and yet i might have expected it  if your lordship has left your heart in england said betty with a smile i give you warning you must not tell our ladies here of it  i care not who knows it miss tayloe he cried that fustian insincerity was certainly not one of his faults i care not who knows it to pass her chariot is to have your heart stolen and you must needs run after and beg mercy but ladies he added his eye twinkling having seen the women of your colony i marvel no longer at miss mannerss beauty  he set us all alaughing  i fear you were not born a diplomat sir says patty you agree that we are beautiful yet to hear that one of us is more so is small consolation  we men turn as naturally to miss manners as plants to the sun maam he replied impulsively yet none of us dare hope for alliance with so brilliant and distant an object i make small doubt those are mr carvels sentiments and still he seems popular enough with the ladies how now sir how now mr carvel you have yet to speak on so tender a subject  my eyes met pattys  i will be no more politic than you my lord i said boldly nor will i make a secret of it that i adore miss manners full as much  bravo richard cries patty and good cries his lordship while betty claps her hands and then comyn swung suddenly round in his chair  richard carvel says he by the seven chimes i have heard her mention your name the devil fetch my memory  my name i exclaimed in surprise and prodigiously upset  yes he answered with his hand to his head some such thought was in my mind this afternoon when i heard of your riding stay i have it i was at ampthill ossorys place just before i left some insupportable coxcomb was boasting a marvellous run with the hounds nigh across hertfordshire and miss manners brought him up with a round turn and a half hitch by relating one of your exploits richard carvel and take my word ont she got no small applause she told how you had followed a fox over one of your rough provincial counties which means three of hertfordshire with your arm broken by heaven and how they lifted you off at the death and mr carvel said my lord generously looking at my flushed face you must give me your hand for that  so dorothy in england had thought of me at least but what booted it if she were to marry a duke my thoughts began to whirl over all comyn had said of her so that i scarce heard a question miss tayloe had put  marry chartersea that profligate pig comyn was saying she would as soon marry a chairman or a chimneysweep im thinking why miss tayloe sir charles grandison himself would scarce suit her  good lack said betty i think sir charles would be the very last for dorothy     volume 3     chapter xiii mr allen shows his hand  so dorothys beauty had taken london by storm even as it had conquered annapolis however twas small consolation to me to hear his grace of chartersea called a pig and a profligate while better men danced her attendance in mayfair nor in spite of what his lordship had said was i quite easy on the score of the duke it was in truth no small honour to become a duchess if mr marmaduke had aught to say there was an end to hope she would have her coronet but in that hour of darkness i counted upon my ladys spirit  dr courtenay came to the assembly very late with a new fashion of pinchbeck buckles on his pumps and a new manner of taking snuff i caught fotheringay practising this by the stairs shortly after always an important man the doctors prominence had been increased that day by the letter he had received he was too thorough a courtier to profess any grief over miss mannerss match and went about avowing that he had always predicted a duke for miss dorothy and he drew a deal of pleasure from the curiosity of those who begged but one look at the letter show it indeed for no consideration a private communication from one gentleman to another must be respected will fotheringay swore the doctor was a sly dog and had his own reasons for keeping it to himself  the doctor paid his compliment to the captain of the thunderer and to his lordship hoped that he would see them at the meet on the morrow tho his gout forbade his riding to hounds he saluted me in the most friendly way for i played billiards with him at the coffee house now and he won my money he had pronounced my phaeton to be as well appointed as any equipage in town and had done me the honour to drive out with me on several occasions it was betty that brought him humiliation that evening  what do you think of the soar our pandora hath taken miss betty says he from a maryland manor to a ducal palace tis a fable egad no less  indeed i think it is retorted betty mark me doctor dorothy will not put up an instant with a roue and a brute  a roue cries he and a brute what the plague miss tayloe i vow i do not understand you  then ask my lord comyn who knows your duke of chartersea said betty  dr courtenays expression was worth a pistole  comyn know him he repeated  that he does replied betty laughing his lordship says chartersea is a pig and a profligate and i remember not what else and that dolly will not look at him and so little mr marmaduke may go ahunting for another title  no wonder i had little desire for dancing that night i wandered out of the assemblyroom and through the silent corridors of the stadt house turning over and over again what i had heard and picturing dorothy reigning over the macaronies of st jamess street she had said nothing of this in her letter to betty and had asked me to write to her but now with a duke to refuse or accept could she care to hear from her old playmate i took no thought of the time until suddenly my conscience told me i had neglected patty  as i entered the hall i saw her at the far end of it talking to mr allen this i thought strange for i knew she disliked him lord comyn and mr carroll the barrister and singleton were standing by listening by the time i was halfway across to them the rector turned away i remember thinking afterwards that he changed colour when he said your servant mr richard but i thought nothing of it at the time and went on to patty  i have come for a country dance before we go patty i said  then something in her mien struck me her eyes expressed a pain i had remarked in them before only when she spoke to me of tom and her lips were closed tightly she flushed and paled and looked from singleton to mr carroll they and his lordship remained silent  ii cannot richard i am going home she said in a low voice  i will see if the chariot is here i answered surprised but thinking of tom  she stopped me  i am going with mr carroll she said  i hope a carvel never has to be rebuffed twice nor to be humbled by craving an explanation before a company i was confounded that patty should treat me thus when i had done nothing to deserve it as i made for the door burning and indignant i felt as tho every eye in the room was upon me young harvey drove me that night  marlboro street mr richard said he  coffee house replied i that place coming first into my head  young harvey seldom took liberties but he looked down from the box  better home sir your pardon sir  dn it i cried drive where i bid you  i pulled down the foreglass though the night was cold and began to cast about for the cause of pattys action and then it was the rector came to my mind yes he had been with her just before i came up and i made sure on the instant that my worthy instructor was responsible for the trouble i remembered that i had quarrelled with him the morning before i had gone to bentley manor and threatened to confess his villany and my deceit to mr carvel he had answered me with a sneer and a dare i knew than patty put honour and honesty before all else in the world and that she would not have suffered my friendship for a day had she believed me to lack either but she who knew me so well was not likely to believe anything he might say without giving me the chance to clear myself and what could he have told her  i felt my anger growing big within me until i grew afraid of what i would do if i were tempted i had a long score and a heavy score against this rector of st annesa score that had been gathering these years and i felt that my uncle was somewhere behind him that the two of them were plotters against me even as harvey had declared albeit my uncle grafton was little seen in his company now and finally in a sinister flash of revelation came the thought that grafton himself was at the back of this deception of my grandfather as to my principles fool that i was it had never occurred to me before but how was he to gain by it did he hope that mr carvel in a fit of anger would disinherit me when he found i had deceived him yes and so had left the matter in abeyance near these two years that the shock might be the greater when it came i recalled now with a shudder that never since the spring of my grandfathers illness had my uncle questioned me upon my politics i was seized with a fit of fury i suspected that mr allen would be at the coffee house after the assembly and i determined to seize the chance at once and have it out with him then and there  the inn was ablaze but as yet deserted mr claude expectant he bowed me from my chariot door and would know what took me from the ball i threw him some short answer bade harvey go home saying that i would have some fellow light me to marlboro street when i thought proper and coming into the long room i flung aside my greatcoat and commanded a flask of mr stephen bordleys old sherry some of which mr claude had obtained at that bachelors demise  the wine was scarce opened before i heard some sort of stir at the front and two servants in a riding livery of scarlet and white hurried in to seek mr claude the sight of them sufficed mine host for he went out as fast as his legs would go giving the bell a sharp pull as he passed the door and presently i heard him complimenting two gentlemen into the house the voice of one i knewbeing no other than captain clapsaddles and him i had not seen for the past six months i was just risen to my feet when they came in at the door beside me  richard cried the captain and grasped my hand in both his own i returned his pressure too much pleased to speak then his eye was caught by my finery  so ho says he shaking his head at me for a sad rogue wine and women and fine clothes and not nineteen or i mistake me it was so with captain jack who blossomed in a week and few could vie with him i warrant you after he made his decision but bless me he went on drawing back the lad looks mature and a fair two inches broader than last spring but why are you not at the assembly richard  i have but now come from there sir i replied not caring in the presence of a stranger to enter into reasons  at my answer the captain turned from me to the gentleman behind him who had been regarding us both as we talked there are some few men in the world i thank god for it who bear their value on their countenance who stand unmistakably for qualities which command respect and admiration and love we seem to recognize such men and to wonder where we have seen them before in reality we recognize the virtues they represent so it was with him i saw in front of me and by his air and carriage i marked him then and there as a man born to great things you all know his face my dears and i pray god it may live in the sight of those who come after you for generation upon generation  colonel washington said the captain this is mr richard carvel the son of captain carvel  mr washington did not speak at once he stood regarding me a full minute his eye seeming to penetrate the secrets of my life and i take pride in saying it was an eye i could meet without flinching  your father was a brave man sir he said soberly and it seems you favour him i am happy in knowing the son  for a moment he stood debating whether he would go to the house of one of his many friends in annapolis knowing that they would be offended when they learned he had stopped at the inn he often came to town indeed but seldom tarried long and it had never been my fortune to see him being arrived unexpectedly and obliged to be away early on the morrow he decided to order rooms of mr claude sat down with me at the table and commenced supper they had ridden from alexandria i gathered from their conversation that they were on their way to philadelphia upon some private business the nature of which knowing captain daniels sentiments and those of colonel washington i went not far to guess the country was in a stir about the townshend duties and there being some rumour that all these were to be discharged save only that on tea anxiety prevailed in our middle colonies that the merchants of new york would abandon the association formed and begin importation it was of some mission to these merchants that i suspected them  as i sat beside colonel washington i found myself growing calmer and ashamed of my lack of selfcontrol unconsciously when we come in contact with the great of character we mould our minds to their qualities his very person seemed to exhale not sanctity but virility i felt that this man could command himself and others in his presence selfcommand came to me as a virtue gone out of him twas not his speech i would have you know that took hold of me he was by no means a brilliant talker and i had the good fortune to see him at his ease since he and the captain were old friends as they argued upon the questions of the day the colonel did not seek to impress by words or to fascinate by manner his opinions were calm and moderate and appeared to me so just as to admit of no appeal he scrupled not to use a forceful word when occasion demanded and yet now and then he had a lively way about him with all his dignity when he had finished his supper he bade mr claude bring another bottle of mr bordleys sherry having tested mine and addressed himself to me  he would know what my pursuits had been for my fathers sake what were my ambitions he questioned me about mr carvels plantation of which he had heard and appeared pleased with the answers i gave as to its management and methods captain daniel was no less so mr washington had agriculture at his finger ends and gave me some advice which he had found serviceable at mount vernon  tis a pity richard said he smiling thoughtfully at the captain tis a pity we have no service afield open to our young men one of your spirit and bearing should be of that profession captain jack was as brave and dashing an officer as i ever laid eyes on  i hesitated the tingling at the compliment  i begin to think i was born for the sea sir i answered at length  what cried the captain what news is this richard slife how has this come about  my anger subdued by mr washingtons presence a curious mood had taken its place a foolish mood i thought it but one of feeling things to come  i believe i shall one day take part in a great seafight i said and tho ashamed to speak of it i told him of stanwixs prophecy that i should pace the decks of a manowar  a pox on stanwix said the captain an artful old seadog i never yet knew one who did not think the sun rises and sets from poop to forecastle who did not wheedle with all the young blood to get them to follow a bowlegged profession  colonel washington laughed  judge not clapsaddle said he here are two of us trying to get the lad for our own bowlegged profession we are as hot as methodists to convert  small conversion he needed when i was here to watch him colonel and he rides with any trooper i ever laid eyes on why sir i myself threw him on a saddle before he could wellnigh walk and twere a waste of material to put him in the navy  but what this old man said of a flag not yet seen in heaven or earth interests me said colonel washington tell me he added with a penetration we both remarked tell me does your captain stanwix follow the times is he a man to read his prints and pamphlets in other words is he a man who might predict out of his own heated imagination  nay sir i answered he nods over his tobacco the day long and i will make bold to swear he has never heard of the stamp act  tis strange said the colonel musing i have heard of this second sighthave seen it among my own negroes but i heartily pray that this may be but the childish fancy of an old mariner how do you interpret it sir he added addressing himself to me  if a prophecy i can interpret it in but one way i began and there i stopped  to be sure said mr washington he studied me awhile as though weighing my judgment and went on needless to say richard that such a service if it comes will not be that of his majesty  and it were colonel i would not embark in it a step i cried  he laughed  the lad has his fathers impulse he said to captain daniel but i thought old mr carvel to be one of the warmest loyalists in the colonies  i bit my lip for since that unhappy deception of mr carvel i had not meant to be drawn into an avowal of my sentiments but i had alas inherited a hasty tongue  mr washington said the captain old mr carvel has ever been a good friend to me and though i could not but perceive which way the lad was tending i had held it but a poor return for friendship had i sought by word or deed to bring him to my way of thinking nor have i ever suffered his views in my presence  my dear sir i honour you for it put in the colonel warmly  it is naught to my credit returned the captain i would not for the sake of my party and beliefs embitter what remains of my old friends life  i drew a long breath and drained the full glass before me  captain daniel i cried you must hear me now i have been waiting your coming these months and if colonel washington gives me leave i will speak before him  the colonel bade me proceed avowing that captain carvels son should have his best assistance  with that i told them the whole story of mr allens villany how i had been sent to him because of my whig sentiments and for thrashing a tory schoolmaster and his flock this made the gentlemen laugh tho captain daniel had heard it before i went on to explain how mr carvel had fallen ill and was like to die and how mr allen taking advantage of his weakness when he rose from his bed had gone to him with the lie of having converted me but when i told of the scene between my grandfather and me at carvel hall of the tears of joy that the old gentleman shed and of how he had given me firefly as a reward the captain rose from his chair and looked out of the window into the blackness and swore a great oath all to himself and the expression i saw come into the colonels eyes i shall never forget  and you feared the consequences upon your grandfathers health he asked gravely  so help me god i answered i truly believe that to have undeceived him would have proved fatal  and so for the sake of the sum he receives for teaching you cried the captain with another oath this scoundrelly clergyman has betrayed you into a lie a scheme by gods life worthy of a machiavelli  i have seen too many of his type in our parishes said mr washington and yet the bishop of london seems powerless and so used have we become in these southern colonies to tippling and gaming parsons that i warrant his people accept him as nothing out of the common  he is more discreet than the run of them sir his parishioners dislike him not because of his irregularities but because he is attempting to obtain all saints from his lordship in addition to st annes he is thought too greedy  he was silent his brow a little furrowed and drummed with his fingers upon the table  but this i cannot reconcile said he presently that the reward is out of all proportion to the risk such a clever rascal must play for higher stakes  i was amazed at his insight and for the moment was impelled to make a clean breast of my suspicionsnay of my convictions of the whole devils plot but i had no proofs i remembered that to the colonel my uncle was a gentleman of respectability and of wealth and a member of his excellencys council that to accuse him of scheming for my inheritance would gain me nothing in mr washingtons esteem and i caught myself before i had said aught of mr allens conduct that evening  have you confronted this rector with his perfidy richard he asked  i have colonel at my first opportunity and i related how mr allen had come to the hall and what i had said to him and how he had behaved and finally told of the picquet we now had during lessons not caring to shield myself both listened intently until the captain broke out mr washingtons indignation was the stronger for being repressed  i will call him out cried captain daniel fingering his sword as was his wont when angered i will call him out despite his gown or else horse him publicly  no my dear sir you will do nothing of the kind said the colonel you would gain nothing by it for the lad and lose much such rascals walk in water and are not to be tracked he cannot be approached save through mr lionel carvel himself and that channel for mr carvels sake must be closed  but he must be shown up cried the captain  what good will you accomplish said mr washington lord baltimore is notorious and will not remove him nay sir you must find a way to get the lad from his influence and he asked me how was my grandfathers health at present  i said that he had mended beyond my hopes  and does he seem to rejoice that you are of the kings party  nay sir concerning politics he seems strangely apathetic which makes me fear he is not so well as he appears all his life he has felt strongly  then i beg you richard take pains to keep neutral nor let any passing event however great move you to speech or action  the captain shook his head doubtfully as tho questioning the ability of one of my temper to do this  i do not trust myself sir i answered  he rose declaring it was past his hour for bed and added some kind things which i shall cherish in my memory as he was leaving he laid his hand on my shoulder  one word of advice my lad he said if by any chance your convictions are to come to your grandfathers ears let him have them from your own lips and he bade me good night  the captain tarried but a moment longer  i have a notion who is to blame for this richard he said when i come back from new york we shall see what we shall see  i fear he is too slippery for a soldier to catch i answered  he went away to bed telling me to be prudent and mind the colonels counsel until he returned from the north     chapter xiv the volte coupe  i was of a serious mind to take the advice to prove this i called for my wraprascal and cane and for a fellow with a flambeau to light me but just then the party arrived from the assembly i was tempted and i sat down again in a corner of the room resolved to keep a check upon myself but to stay awhile  the rector was the first in humming a song and spied me  ho he cried will you drink richard or do i drink with you  he was already purple with wine  god save me from you and your kind i replied  sblood what a devils nest of fireworks he exclaimed as he went off down the room still humming to where the rest were gathered and they were soon between bottle and stopper and quips acoursing there was the captain of the thunderer collinson by name lord comyn and two brother officers will fotheringay my cousin philip openly pleased to be found in such a company and some dozen other toadeaters who had followed my lord achair and afoot from the ball and would have tracked him to perdition had he chosen to go and lastly tom swain leering and hiccoughing at the jokes in such a beastly state of drunkenness as i had rarely seen him his lordship recognized me and smiled and was pushing his chair back when something collinson said seemed to restrain him  i believe i was the butt of more than one jest for my aloofness though i could not hear distinctly for the noise they made i commanded some french cognac and kept my eye on the rector and the sight of him was making me dangerous  i forgot the advice i had received and remembered only the months he had goaded me and i was even beginning to speculate how i could best pick a quarrel with him on any issue but politics when an unexpected incident diverted me of a sudden the tall ungainly form of percy singleton filled the doorway wrapped in a greatcoat he swept the room at a glance and then strode rapidly toward the corner where i sat  i had thought to find you here he said and dropped into a chair beside me i offered him wine but he refused  now he went on what has patty done  what have i done that i should be publicly insulted i cried  insulted says he and did she insult you she said nothing of that  what brings you here then i demanded  not to talk richard he said quietly tis no time tonight i came to fetch you home patty sent me  patty sent him why had patty sent him but this i did not ask for i felt the devil within me  we must first finish this bottle said i offhand and then i have a little something to be done which i have set my heart upon after that i will go with you  richard richard will you never learn prudence what is it you speak of  i drew my sword and laid it upon the table  i mean to spit that eel of a rector said i or he will bear a slap in the face and you must see fair play  singleton seized my coat at the same time grasping the hilt of my sword with the other hand but neither my words nor my action had gone unnoticed by the other end of the room the company there fell silent awhile and then we heard captain collinson talking in even drawling tones  tis strange said he what hot sparks a man meets in these colonies they should be stamped out his majesty pampers these dd americans is too lenient by far gentlemen this is how i would indulge them he raised a closed fist and brought it down on the board  he spoke to tories but he forgot that tories were americans in those days only the meanest of the kings party would listen to such without protest from an englishman but some of the meaner sort were there philip and tom laughed and mr allen and my lords sycophants fotheringay and some others of sense shook their heads one to another comprehending that captain collinson was somewhat gone in wine for indeed he had not strayed far from the sideboard at the assembly comyn made a motion to rise  it is already past three bells sir and a hunt tomorrow he said  from bottle to saddle and from saddle to bottle my lord we must have our pleasure ashore and sleep at sea and the captain tipped his flask with a leer he turned his eye uncertainly first on me then on my lord we are lately from boston gentlemen that charnelhouse of treason and before we leave my lord i must tell them how mr robinson of the customs served that dog otis in the british coffee house gods word twas as good as a play  i know not how many got to their feet at that for the story of the cowardly beating of mr otis by robinson and the army officers had swept over the colonies burning like a flame all truehearted men tory and whig alike i wrested my sword from singletons hold and in a trice i had reached the captain over chairs and table tearing myself from fotheringay on the way i struck a blow that measured a man on the floor then i drew back amazed  i had hit lord comyn instead the captain stood a yard beyond me  the thing had been so deftly done by the rector of st annescomyn jostled at the proper moment between me and collinsonthat none save me guessed beyond an accident least of all my lord comyn himself he was up again directly and his sword drawn addressing me  bear witness my lord that i have no desire to fight with you said i with what coolness i could muster but there is one here i would give much for a chance to run through  and i made a step toward mr allen with such a purpose in my face and movements that he could not mistake i saw the blood go from his face yet he was no coward to physical violence but he or i was saved by the satans luck that followed him for my lord stepped in between us with a bow his cheek red where i had struck him  it is my quarrel now mr carvel he cried  as you please my lord said i  it boots not who crosses with him captain collinson put in his lordship uses the sword better than any here but it boots not so that he is opposed by a loyal servant of the king  i wheeled on him for this  i would have you know that loyalty does not consist in outrage and murder sir i answered nor in the ridiculing of them and brutes cannot be loyal save through interest  he was angered as i had desired i had hopes then of shouldering the quarrel on to him for i had near as soon drawn against my own brother as against comyn i protest i loved him then as one with whom i had been reared  let me deal with this young gamecock comyn cried the captain with an oath he seems to think his importance sufficient  but comyn would brook no interference he swore that no man should strike him with impunity and in this i could not but allow he was right  you shall hear from me mr carvel he said  nay i answered and fighting is to be done sir let us be through with it at once a large room upstairs is at our disposal and there is a hunt tomorrow which one of us may like to attend  there was a laugh at this in which his lordship joined  i would to god mr carvel he said that i had no quarrel with you  amen to that my lord i replied there are others here i would rather fight and i gave a meaning look at mr allen i was of two minds to announce the scurvy trick he had played but saw that i would lose rather than gain by the attempt up to that time the wretch had not spoken a word now he pushed himself forward though well clear of me  i think it my duty as mr carvels tutor gentlemen to protest against this matter proceeding he said a sneer creeping into his voice nor can i be present at it mr carvel is young and besides is not himself with liquor and in the choice of politics he knows not which leg he stands upon my lord and gentlemen your most humble and devoted  he made a bow and before the retort on my lips could be spoken left the tavern my cousin philip left with him tom swain had fallen asleep in his chair  captain collinson and mr furness of the thunderer offered to serve his lordship which made me bethink that i too would have need of some one twas then i remembered singleton who had passed from my mind  he was standing close behind me and nodded simply when i asked him and will fotheringay came forward  i will act richard if you allow me he said i would have you know i am in no wise hostile to you my lord and i am of the kings party but i admire mr carvel and i may say i am not wholly out of sympathy with that which prompted his act  it was a noble speech and changed will in my eyes and i thanked him with warmth he of all that company had the courage to oppose his lordship  mr claude was called in and as is the custom in such cases was told that some of us would play awhile above he was asked for his private room the good man had his suspicions but could not refuse a party of such distinction and sent a drawer thither with wine and cards presently we followed leaving the pack of toadies in sad disappointment below  we gathered about the table and made shift at loo until the fellow had retired when the seconds proceeded to clear the room of furniture and lord comyn and i stripped off our coats and waistcoats i had lost my anger but felt no fear only a kind of pity that blood should be shed between two so united in spirit as we yes my dears i thought of dorothy if i died she would hear that it was like a manlike a carvel but the thought of my old grandfather tightened my heart then the clock on the inn stairs struck two and the noise of harsh laughter floated up to us from below  and comynof what was he thinking of some fair home set upon the downs across the sea of some heroic english mother who had kept her tears until he was gone her image rose in dumb entreaty invoked by the lad before me what a picture was he in his spotless shirt with the ruffles his handsome boyish face all that was good and honest  i had scarce felt his lordships wrist than i knew i had to deal with a pupil of angelo at first his attacks were all simple without feint or trickery as were mine collinson cursed and cried out that it was buffoonery and called on my lord not to let me off so easily swore that i fenced like a mercer that he could have stuck me like a pincushion twenty and twenty times often have i seen two animals thrust into a pit with nothing but goodwill between them and those without force them into anger and a deadly battle and so it was unconsciously between comyn and me i forgot presently that i was not dealing with captain collinson and my feelings went into my sword comyn began to press me nor did i give back and then before it came over me that we had to do with life and death he was upon me with a volte coupe feinting in high carte and thrusting in low tierce his point passing through a fold in my shirt and i were not alive to write these words had i not leaped out of his measure  bravo richard cried fotheringay  well made gads life from mr furness  we engaged again our faces hot now i knew that if i did not carry the matter against him i should be killed out of hand and heaven knows i was not used to play a passive part i began to go carefully but fiercely tried one attack after another that my grandfather and captain daniel had taught meflanconnades beats and lunges comyn held me even and in truth i had much to do to defend myself once i thought i had him in the swordarm after a circular parry but he was too quick for me we were sweating freely by now and by reason of the buzzing in my ears i could scarce hear the applause of the seconds  what unlucky chance it was i know not that impelled comyn to essay again the trick by which he had come so near to spitting me but try it he did this time in prime and seconde i had come by nature to that intuition which a true swordsman must have gleaned from the eyes of his adversary long ago captain daniel had taught me the remedy for this coupe i parried circled and straightened my body in swift motion and my point at comyns heart when heaven brought me recollection in the space of a second my sword rang clattering on the floor  his lordship understood but too late despairing his life he made one wild lunge at me that had never gone home had i held to my hilt but the rattle of the blade had scarce reached my ears when there came a sharp pain at my throat and the room faded before me i heard the clock striking the halfhour  i was blessed with a sturdy health such as few men enjoy and came to myself sooner than had been looked for with a dash of cold water and the first face i beheld was that of colonel washington i heard him speaking in a voice that was calm yet urgent and commanding  i pray you gentlemen give back he is coming to and must have air fetch some linen  now god be praised i heard captain daniel cry  with that his lordship began to tear his own shirt into strips and the captain bringing a bowl and napkin the colonel himself washed the wound and bound it deftly singleton and captain daniel assisting when mr washington had finished he turned to comyn who stood anxious and dishevelled at my feet  you may be thankful that you missed the artery my lord he said  with all my heart colonel washington cried his lordship i owe my life to his generosity  whats that sir  mr carvel dropped his sword rather than run me through  ill warrant captain daniel put in ods heart the lad has skill to point the eye of a button i taught him myself  colonel washington stood up and laid his hand on the captains arm  he is jack carvel over again i heard him say in a low voice  i tried to struggle to my feet to speak but he restrained me and sending for his servants he ordered them to have his baggage removed from the roebuck which was the best bed in the house at this moment the door opened and mr swain came in hurriedly  i pray you gentlemen he cried and he is fit to be moved you will let me take him to marlboro street i have a chariot at the door     chapter xv of which the rector has the worst  twas late when i awoke the next day with something of a dull ache in my neck and a prodigious stiffness studying the pleatings of the bed canopy over my head and i know not how long i lay idly thus when i perceived mrs willis moving quietly about and my grandfather sitting in the armchair by the window looking into freshwater lane as my eyes fell upon him my memory came surging backfirst of the duel then of its cause and finally like a leaden weight the thought of the deception i had practised upon him of which he must have learned ere this nay i was sure from the troubled look of his face that he knew of it  mr carvel i said  at the sound of my voice he got hastily from his chair and hurried to my side  richard he answered taking my hand richard  i opened my mouth to speak to confess but he prevented me the tears filling the wrinkles around his eyes  nay lad nay we will not talk of it i know all  mr allen has been here i began  and be dd to him be dd to him for a wolf in sheeps clothing shouted my grandfather his manner shifting so suddenly to anger that i was taken back so help me god i will never set foot in st annes while he is rector nor shall he come to this house  and he took three or four disorderly turns about the room  ah he continued more quietly with something of a sigh i might have known how stubborn your mind should be that you was never one to blow from the north one day and from the south the next i deny not that there be good men and able of your way of thinking colonel washington for one whom i admire and honour and our friend captain daniel they have been here today richard and i promise you were good advocates  then i knew that i was forgiven and i could have thrown myself at mr carvels feet for happiness  has colonel washington spoken in my favour sir  that he has he is upon some urgent business for the north i believe which he delayed for your sake both he and the captain were in my dressingroom before i was up ahead of that scurrilous clergyman who was for pushing his way to my bedcurtains ay the two of them were here at nigh dawn this morning and mr allen close after them and i own that captain daniel can swear with such a consuming violence as to put any rogue out of countenance twas all mr washington could do to restrain clapsaddle from booting his reverence over the balustrade and down two runs of the stairs the captain declaring he would do for every curs son of the whelps diomedes says i waking up whats this damnable racket on the landing is mr richard home for i had some notion it was you sir after an overnight brawl and i profess i would have caned you soundly the fellow answered that captain clapsaddles honour was killing mr allen and went out and came back presently to say that some tall gentleman had the captain by the neck and that mr allen was picking his way down the ice on the steps outside with that i went in to them in my dressinggown  whats all this todo gentlemen said i  id have finished that son of a dog says the captain and colonel washington had let me  what what said i how now what drive a clergyman from my house gentlemen  whats richard been at now  mr washington asked me to dress saying that they had something very particular to speak about that they would stay to breakfast with me tho they were in haste to be gone to new york i made my compliments to the colonel and had them shown to the library fire and hurried down after them then they told me of this affair last night and they cleared you sir faith cried i and i would have fought too the lad was in the right of it though i would have him a little less hasty dn me if i dont wish you had knocked that sea captains teeth into his throat and his brains with them i like your spirit sir a pox on such men as he who disgrace his majestys name and set better men against him  and they told you nothing else sir i asked with misgiving  that they did mr washington repeated the confession you made to them sir in a manner that did you credit he made me compliments on yousaid that you were a man sir though a trifle hasty in the which i agreed yes dn me a trifle hasty like your father i rejoice that you did not kill his lordship my son  the twilight was beginning and the old gentleman going back to his chair was set amusing gazing out across the bare trees and gables falling gray after the sunset  what amazed me was that he did not seem to be shocked by the revelation near as much as i had feared so this matter had brought me happiness where i looked for nothing but sorrow  and the gentlemen are gone north sir said i after a while  yes richard these four hours i commanded an early dinner for them since the colonel was pleased to tarry long enough for a little politics and to spin a glass and i profess was i to live neighbours with such a man i might come to his way of thinking despite myself though i say it that shouldnt some of his majestys ministers are dd rascals  i laughed as i live i never hoped to hear such words from my grandfathers lips  he did not seek to convince like so many of your hotheaded knowitalls said mr carvel he leaves a man to convince himself he has great parts richard and few can stand before him he paused and then his smoothshaven face became creased in a roguish smile which i had often seen upon it what baggage is this i hear of that you quarrelled over at the assembly ah sir i fear you are become but a sad rake says he  but by great good fortune dr leiden was shown in at this instant and the candles being lighted he examined my neck haranguing the while in his vile english against the practice of duelling he bade me keep my bed for two days thereby giving me no great pleasure  as i hope to live said mr carvel when the doctor was gone one would have thought his excellency himself had been pinked instead of a whip of a lad for the people who have been here his lordship and dr courtenay came before the hunt and young mr fotheringay and half a score of others mr swain is but now left to go to baltimore on some barristers business  i was burning to learn what the rector had said to patty but it was plain mr carvel knew nothing of this part of the story he had not mentioned grafton among the callers i wondered what course my uncle would now pursue that his plans to alienate me from my grandfather had failed and i began debating whether or not to lay the whole plot before mr carvel prudence bade me wait since grafton had not consorted with the rector openly at leastfor more than a year and yet i spoke  mr carvel  he stirred in his chair  yes my son  he had to repeat and still i held my tongue even as i hesitated there came a knock at the door and scipio entered bearing candles  massa grafton suh he said  my uncle was close at his heels he was soberly dressed in dark brown silk and his face wore that expression of sorrow and concern he knew how to assume at will after greeting his father with his usual ceremony he came to my bedside and asked gravely how i did  how now grafton cried mr carvel this is no funeral the lad has only a scratch thank god  my uncle looked at me and forced a smile  indeed i am rejoiced to find you are not worried over this matter father said he i am but just back from kent to learn of it and looked to find you in bed  why no sir i am not worried i fought a duel in my own dayover a lass it was  this time graftons smile was not forced  over a lass was it he asked and added in a tone of relief and how do you nephew  mr carvel saved me from replying  ods life he cried no i did not say this was over a lass i have heard the whole matter how captain collinson who is a disgrace to the service brought shame upon his majestys supporters and how richard felled the young lord instead ill be sworn and i had been there i myself would have run the brute through  my uncle did not ask for further particulars but took a chair and a dish of tea from scipio his smug look told me plainer than words that he thought my grandfather still ignorant of my whig sentiments  i often wish that this deplorable practice of duelling might be legislated against he remarked was there no one at the coffee house with character enough to stop the lads  here was my chance  mr allen was there i said  a devils plague upon him shouted my grandfather beating the floor with his stick and the lying hypocrite ever crosses my path by gads life ill tear his gown from his back  i watched grafton narrowly such as he never turn pale but he set down his tea so hastily as to spill the most of it on the dresser  why you astound me my dear father he faltered mr allen a lying hypocrite what can he have done  done cried my grandfather sputtering and red as a cherry with indignation he is as rotten within as a pricked pear i tell you sir for the sake of retaining the lad in his tuition he came to me and lied sir just after i had escaped death and said that by his influence richard had become loyal and set dependence upon richards fear of the shock twould give me if he confessedrichard who never told me a falsehood in his life and instead of teaching him he has gamed with the lad at the rectory i dare make oath he has treated your son to a like instruction slife sir and he had his deserts he would hang from a gibbet at the town gate  i raised up in bed to see the effect of this on my uncle but however the wind veered grafton could steer a course he got up and began pacing the room and his agitation my grandfather took for indignation such as his own  the dog he cried fiercely the villain philip shall leave him tomorrow and to think that it was i who moved you to put richard to him  his distress seemed so real that mr carvel replied  no grafton twas not your fault you were deceived as much as i you have put your own son to him but if i live another twelve hours i shall write his lordship to remove him what you shake your head sir  it will not do said my uncle lord baltimore has had his reasons for sending such a scoundrelhe knew what he was you may be sure father his lordship sir is the most abandoned rake in london and that unmentionable crime of his but lately in the magazines  yes yes my grandfather interrupted i have seen it but i will publish him in annapolis  my uncles answer startled me so like was it to the argument colonel washington himself had used  what would you publish sir mr allen will reply that what he did was for the lads good and your own he may swear that since richard mentioned politics no more he had taken his conversion for granted  my grandfather groaned and did not speak and i saw the futility of attempting to bring grafton to earth for a while yet  my uncle had recovered his confidence he had hoped so he said that i had become a good loyalist perchance as i grew older i would see the folly of those who called themselves patriots but my grandfather cried out to him not to bother me then and when at last he was gone of my own volition i proposed to promise mr carvel that while he lived i would take no active part in any troubles that might come he stopped me with some vehemence  i pray god there may be no troubles lad he answered but you need give me no promise i would rather see you in the whig ranks than a trimmer for the carvels have ever been partisans  i tried to express my gratitude but he sighed and wished me good night bidding me get some rest  i had scarce finished my breakfast the next morning when i heard a loud rattattat upon the street doorsurely the footman of some person of consequence and scipio was in the act of announcing the names when greatly to his disgust the visitors themselves rushed into my bedroom and curtailed the ceremony they were none other than dr courtenay and my lord comyn himself his lordship had no sooner seen me than he ran to the bed grasped both my hands and asked me how i did declaring he would not have gone to yesterdays hunt had he been permitted to visit me  richard cried the doctor your fame has sprung up like jonahs gourd the gazette is but just distributed heres for you twill set the wags agoing ill warrant  he drew the newspaper from his pocket and began to read stopping now and anon to laugh  rumour hath it that a young gentleman of quality of this town who is possessed of more valour than discretion and whose skill at fence and in the field is beyond his years crossed swords on wednesday night with a young nobleman from the thunderer the cause of this deplorable quarrel which had its origin at the ball is purported to have been a young lady of wit and beauty  we doubt it not for alas the sex hath much to answer for of this kind  the gentlemen with their seconds repaired after the assembly to the coffee house tis said upon authority that hs ldshp owes his life to the noble spirit of our young american who cast down his blade rather than sheathe it in his adversarys body thereby himself receiving a grievous the happily not mortal wound our young gentleman is become the hero of the town and the subject of prodigious anxiety of all the ladies thereof  theres for you my lad says he mr green has done for you both cleverly  upon my soul i cried raising up in bed he should be put in the gatehouse for his impudence my lord  dont my lord me says comyn plain jack will do  there was no resisting such a man and i said as much and took his hand and called him jack the doctor posing before the mirror the while stroking his rues out upon you both says he for a brace of sentimental fools  richard said comyn presently with a roguish glance at the doctor there were some reason in our fighting had it been over a favour of miss manners eh come doctor he cried you will break your neck looking for the reflection of wrinkles come now we must have little finerys letter i give you my word chartersea is as ugly as all three heads of cerberus and as foul as a ships barrel of grease i tell you miss dorothy would sooner marry you  and she might do worse my lord the doctor flung back with a strut  ay and better but i promise you richard and i are not such fools as to think she will marry his grace we must have the little coxcombs letter  well have it you must i suppose returns the doctor and with that he draws it from his pocket where he has it buttoned in then he took a pinch of holland and began  the first two pages had to deal with miss dorothys triumph to which her father made full justice mr manners world have the doctor and all the province to know that peers of the realm soldiers and statesmen were at her feet orders were as plentiful in his drawingroom as the candles and he had taken a house in arlington street where horry walpole lived when not at strawberry and their entrance was crowded night and day with the footmen and chairmen of the grand monde lord comyn broke in more than once upon the reading cryinghear hear andmy word mr manners has not perjured himself thus far he has not done her justice by half and i smiled at the thought that i had aspired to such a beauty  entre noes mon cher courtenay mr manners writes entre noes our dorothy hath had many offers of great advantage since she hath been here and but yesterday comes a chariot with a ducal coronet to our door his grace of chartersea if you please to request a private talk with me and i rode with him straightway to his house in hanover square  egad and would gladly have ridden straightway to newgate in a ducal chariot cried his lordship in a fit of laughter  i rode to hanover square the doctor continued where we discussed the matter over a bottle his graces generosity was such that i could not but cry out at it for he left me to name any settlement i pleased he must have dorothy at any price said he and i give you my honour mon cher courtenay that i lost no time in getting back to arlington street and called dorothy down to tell her  now may i be flayed said comyn if ever there was such another ass  the doctor took more snuff and fell alaughing  but hark to this said he heres the cream of it all  you will scarce believe me when i say that the baggage was near beside herself with anger at what i had to tell her marry that misshapen duke cries she i would quicker marry doctor johnson and truly i begin to fear she hath formed an affection for some like foullinened beggar that his grace is misshapen i cannot deny but i tried reason upon her think of the coronet my dear and of the ancient name to which it belongs she only stamps her foot and cries out  coronet fiddlesticks and are you not content with the name you bear sir our name is good as any in the three kingdoms said i with truth then you would have me for the sake of the coronet joined to a wretch who is steeped in debauchery yes debauchery sir you might then talk forsooth to the macaronies of maryland of your daughter the duchess  theres spirit for you my lad comyn shouted i give you miss dorothy and he drained a glass of punch scipio had brought in doctor courtenay and i joining him with a will  i pray you go on sir i said to the doctor  a pest on your impatience replied he i begin to think you are in love with her yourself  to be sure he is said comyn he had lost my esteem and he were not  the doctor gave me an odd look i was red enough indeed  i could say naught my dear courtenay to induce her to believe that his graces indiscretions arose from the wildness of youth and i pass over the injustice she hath unwittingly done me whose only efforts are for her bettering the end of it all was that i must needs post back to the duke who was stamping with impatience up and down and drinking burgundy i am sure i meant him no offence but told him in as many words that my daughter had refused him and will you believe me sir he took occasion to insult me i cannot with propriety repeat his speech and he flung a bottle after me as i passed out the door was he not far gone in wine at the time i assure you i had called him out for it  and gentlemen said the doctor when our merriment was somewhat spent ill lay a pipe of the best madeira that our little fool never knows the figure he has cut with his grace     chapter xvi in which some things are made clear  the thunderer weighed the next day saturday while i was still upon my back and comyn sailed with her not however before i had seen him again our affection was such as comes not often to those who drift together to part and he left me that sword with the jewelled hilt that hangs above my study fire which he had bought in toledo he told me that he was heartily sick of the navy that he had entered only in respect for a wish of his fathers the late admiral lord comyn and that the thunderer was to sail for new york where he looked for a release from his commission and whence he would return to england he would carry any messages to miss manners that i chose to send but i could think of none save to beg him to remind her that she was constantly in my thoughts he promised me roguishly enough that he would have thought of a better than that by the time he sighted cape clear and were i ever to come to london he would put me up at brookss club and warrant me a better time and more friends than ever had a caribbee who came home on a visit  my grandfather kept his word in regard to mr allen and on sunday commanded the coach at eight we drove over bad roads to the church at south river and he afterwards declined the voluntary aid he hitherto had been used to give to st annes in the meantime good mr swain had called again bringing some jelly and cake of pattys own making and a letter writ out of the sincerity of her heart full of tender concern and of penitence she would never cease to blame herself for the wrong she now knew she had done me  though still somewhat weak from my wound and confinement after dinner that sunday i repaired to gloucester street from the window she saw me coming and bareheaded ran out in the cold to meet me her eyes rested first on the linen around my throat and she seemed all in a fire of anxiety  i had thought you would come today when i heard you had been to south river she said  i was struck all of a sudden with her looks her face was pale and i saw that she had suffered as much again as i troubled i followed her into the little library the day was fading fast and the leaping flames behind the andirons threw fantastic shadows across the beams of the ceiling we sat together in the deep window  and you have forgiven me richard she asked  an hundred times i replied i deserved all i got and more  if i had not wronged and insulted you  you did neither patty i broke in i have played a double part for the first and last time in my life and i have been justly punished for it  twas i sent you to the coffee house she cried where you might have been killed how i despise myself for listening to mr allens tales  then it was mr allen i exclaimed fetching a long breath  yes yes i will tell you all  no said i alarmed at her agitation another time  i must she answered more calmly it has burned me enough you recall that we were at supper together with betty tayloe and lord comyn and how merry we were altho twas nothing but dorothy with you gentlemen then you left me afterwards as i was talking with mr singleton the rector came up i never have liked the man richard but i little knew his character he began by twitting me for a whig and presently he said but we have gained one convert miss swain who sees the error of his ways scarce a year since young richard carvel promised to be one of those with whom his majesty will have to reckon and he is now becomelaughingthe kings most loyal and devoted i was beside myself that is no subject for jest mr allen i cried i will never believe it of him jest said he i give you my word i was never soberer in my life then it all came to me of a sudden that you sat no longer by the hour with my father as you used and you denounced the kings measures and ministers no more my father had spoken of it tell me why he has changed i asked faltering with doubt of you which i never before had felt indeed i know not replied the rector with his most cynical smile unless it is because old mr carvel might disinherit a whig but i see you doubt my word miss swain here is mr carroll and you may ask him god forgive me richard i stopped mr carroll who seemed mightily surprised and he told me yes that your grandfather had said but a few days before and with joy that you were now of his majestys party  alas i might have foreseen this consequence i exclaimed nor do i blame you patty  but my father has explained all patty continued brightening his admiration for you is increased tenfold richard your grandfather told him of the rectors treachery which he says is sufficient to make him turn methodist or lutheran we went to the curates service today andwill you hear more sir or do your ears burn that patriots and loyalists are singing your praises from town gate to the dock and regretting that you did not kill that detestable captain collinsonbut i have something else and of more importance to tell you richard she continued lowering her voice  what mr carroll had told me stunned me like a blow such had been my faith in you and when mr allen moved off i stood talking to percy singleton and his lordship without understanding a word of the conversation i could scarce have been in my right mind it was not your going over to the other side that pained me so for all your people are tories but i had rather seen you dead than a pretender and a hypocrite selling yourself for an inheritance then you came my natural impulse should have been to draw you aside and there accuse you but this was beyond my strength and when i saw you go away without a word i knew that i had been unjust i could have wept before them all mr carroll went for his coach and was a full half an hour in getting it but this is what i would tell you in particular richard i have not spoken of it to a soul and it troubles me above all else while maria was getting my cardinal i heard voices on the other side of the dressingroom door the supperroom is next you know i listened and recognized the rectors deep tones he has gone to the coffee house he was saying collinson declares that his lordship is our man if we can but contrive it he is the best foil in the service and was taught bythere i have forgot the name  angelo i cried  yes yes angelo it was how did you know she demanded rising in her excitement  angelo is the great fencingmaster of london i replied  when i heard that she said i had no doubt of your innocence i ran out into the assembly room as i was in my hood and tried to find tom but he she paused ashamed  yes i know i said hurriedly you could not find him  she glanced at me in gratitude  how everybody stared at me but little i cared twas that gave rise to mr greens report i thought of percy singleton and stopped him in the midst of a dance to bid him run as fast as his legs would carry him to the coffee house and to see that no harm befell you i shall hold you responsible for richard i whispered you must get him away from mr claudes or i shall never speak to you again he did not wait to ask questions but went at once like the good fellow he is then i rode home with maria i would not have mr carroll come with me though he begged hard father was in here writing his brief but i was all in pieces richard and so shaken with sobbing that i could tell him no more than that you had gone to the coffee house where they meant to draw you into a duel he took me up to my own room and i heard him going out to wake limbo to harness and at last heard him driving away in our coach i hope i may never in my life spend such another hour as i passed then  the light in the sky had gone out i looked up at the girl before me as she stood gazing into the flame her features in strong relief her lips parted her hair redgold and the rounded outlines of her figure softened i wondered why i had never before known her beauty perchance it was because until that night i had never seen her heart  i leaped to my feet and seized her hands for a second she looked at me startled then she tore them away and ran behind the dipping chair in the corner  richard richard she exclaimed did dorothy but know  dorothy is occupied with titles i said  pattys lip quivered and i knew blundering fool that i was that i had hurt her  oh you wrong her she cried believe me when i say that she loves you and you only richard  loves me i retorted bitterlybrutally i fear no she may have once long ago but now her head is turned  she loves you now answered patty earnestly and i think ever will if you but deserve her  and with that she went away leaving me to stare after her in perplexity and consternation     chapter xvii south river  my grandfathers defection from st annes called forth a deal of comment in annapolis his excellency came to remonstrate but to no avail and mr carvel denounced the rector in such terms that the governor was glad to turn the subject my uncle grafton acted with such quickness and force as would have served to lull the sharpest suspicions he forbid the rector his house attended the curates service and took philip from his care it was decided that both my cousin and i were to go to kings college after christmas graftons conduct greatly pleased my grandfather he has behaved very loyally in this matter richard he said to me i grow to reproach myself more every day for the injustice i once did him he is heaping coals of fire upon my old head but faith i cannot stomach your aunt caroline you do not seem to like your uncle lad  i answered that i did not  it was ever the carvel way not to forget he went on nevertheless grafton hath your welfare at heart i think his affection for you as his brothers son is great  o that i had spoken the words that burned my tongue  christmas fell upon monday of that year 1769 there was to be a ball at upper marlboro on the friday before to which many of us were invited though the morning came in with a blinding snowstorm from the north the first of that winter about ten of the clock we set out from annapolis an exceeding merry party the ladies in four coachesandsix the gentlemen and their servants riding at the wheels we laughed and joked despite the storm and exchanged signals with the fair ones behind the glasses  but we had scarce got two miles beyond the town gate when a messenger overtook us with a note for mr carvel writ upon an odd slip of paper and with great apparent hurry  honoured sir  i have but just come to annapolis from new york with instructions to put into your hands  no others a message of the greatest import hearing you are but now set out for upper marlboro i beg of you to return for half an hour to the coffee house by so doing you will be of service to a friend and confer a favour upon yr most obdt humble servant  silas ridgeway  our cavalcade had halted while i read the ladies letting down the glasses and leaning out in their concern lest some trouble had befallen me or my grandfather i answered them and bade them ride on vowing that i would overtake the coaches before they reached the patuxent then i turned cynthias head for town with hugo at my heels  patty leaning from the window of the last coach called out to me as i passed i waved my hand in return and did not remember until long after the anxiety in her eyes  as i rode and i rode hard i pondered over the words of this letter i knew not this mr ridgeway from the lord mayor of london but i came to the conclusion before i had reprised the gate that his message was from captain daniel and i greatly feared that some evil had befallen my good friend so i came to the coffee house and throwing my bridle to hugo i ran in  i found mr ridgeway neither in the long room nor in the billiard room nor the bar mr claude told me that indeed a man had arrived that morning from the north a spare person with a hooked nose and scant hair in a brown greatcoat with a torn cape he had gone forth afoot half an hour since his messenger a negro lad whose face i knew was in the stables with hugo he had never seen the stranger till he met him that morning in state house circle inquiring for mr carvel and had been given a shilling to gallop after me impatient as i was to be gone i sat me down in the coffee room thinking every minute the man must return and strongly apprehensive that captain daniel must be in some grave predicament that the favour he asked was of such a nature as i and not my grandfather could best fulfil  at length about a quarter after noon my man comes in with mr claude close behind him i liked his looks less than his description and the moment i clapped eyes on him i knew that captain daniel had never chose such a messenger  this is mr richard carvel said mr claude  the fellow made me a low bow which i scarcely returned  i am sure sir he began in a whining voice that i crave your forbearance for this prodigious stupid mistake i have made  mistake i exclaimed hotly you mean to say sir that you have brought me back for nothing  the mans eye shifted and he made me another bow  i scarce know what to say mr carvel he answered with much humility to speak truth twas zeal to my employers and methought to you that caused you to retrace your steps in this pestiferous storm i travel he proceeded with some importance i travel for messrs rinnell and runn barristers of the town of new york and carry letters to men of mark all over these middle and southern colonies and my instructions sir were to come to annapolis with all reasonable speed with this doublesealed enclosure for mr carvel and to deliver it to him and him only the very moment i arrived as i came through your town i made inquiries and was told by a black fellow in the circle that mr carvel was but just left for upper marlboro with a cavalcade of four coachesandsix and some dozen gentlemen with their servants i am sure my mistake was pardonable mr carvel he concluded with a smirk this gentleman was plainly of the first quality as was he to whom i was directed and as he was about to leave town for i knew not how long i hope i was in the right in bidding the black ride after him for i give you my word the business was most pressing for him i crave your forgiveness and the pleasure of drinking your honours health  i barely heard the fellow through and was turning on my heel in disgust when it struck me to ask him what mr carvel he sought for i feared lest my grandfather had got into some lawsuit  and it please your honour mr grafton carvel said he your uncle i understand unfortunately he has gone to his estate in kent county whither i must now follow him  i bade mr claude summon my servant not stopping to question the man further such was my resentment against him and in ten minutes we were out of the town again galloping between the nearly filled tracks of the coaches now three hours ahead of us the storm was increasing and the wind cutting but i dug into cynthia so that poor hugo was put to it to hold the pace and tho he had a pint of rum in him was near perished with the cold as my anger cooled somewhat i began to wonder how mr silas ridgeway whoever he was could have been such a simpleton as his story made him out indeed he looked more the rogue than the ass nor could i conceive how reliable barristers could hire such a one i wished heartily that i had exhausted him further and a suspicion crossed my brain that he might have come to mr allen who had persuaded him to deliver a letter to grafton intended for me some foreboding beset me and i was once close to a full mind for going back and slacked cynthias pace to a trot but the thought of the pleasures at upper marlboro and the hope of overtaking the party at mr dorseys place over the patuxent where they looked to dine decided me in pushing on and thus we came to south river with the snow so thick that we could scarce see ten yards in front of us  beyond the road winds up the hillaround the end of mr wileys plantation and plunges shortly into the woods gray and cold indeed today at their skirt a trail branches off which leads to mr wheys warehouses on the waters edge a mile or so below and i marked that this path was freshly trodden i recall a small shock of surprise at this for the way was used only in the early autumn to connect with some fields beyond the hill and then i heard a sharp cry from hugo and pulled cynthia short he was some ten paces behind me  marse dick he shouted the whites of his eyes rolled up wese gwine to be robbed marse dick and he pointed to the footprints in the snow somefin done tole hugo not come today  nonsense i cried mr wiley is making his lazy beggars cut wood against christmas  when in this temper the poor fellow had more fear of me than of aught else and he closed up to my horses flank glancing apprehensively to the right and left his teeth rattling we went at a brisk trot we know not indeed how to account for many things in this world for with each beat of cynthias feet i found myself repeating the words south river and marlboro and seeking in my mind a connection to something gone before then like a sudden gust of wind comes to me that strange talk between grafton and the rector overheard by old harvey in the stables at carvel hall and cynthias ears were pointing forward  with a quick impulse i loosed the lower frogs of my coat for my sword was buckled beneath and was reaching for one of the brace of pistols in my saddlebags i had but released them when hugo cried out gawd marse dick run for yo life and i caught a glimpse of him flying down the road as i turned a shot rang out cynthia reared high with a rough brute of a fellow clinging to her bridle i sent my charge full into his chest and as he tumbled in the snow i dug my spurs to the rowels  what happened then is still a blurred picture in my brain i know that cynthia was shot from under me before she had taken her leap and we fell heavily together and i was scarcely up again and my sword drawn when the villains were pressing me from all sides i remember spitting but one and then i heard a great seafaring oath the first word out of their mouths and i was felled from behind with a mighty blow     chapter xviii the black moll  i have no intention my dears of dwelling upon that part of my adventures which must be as painful to you as to me the very recollection of which after all these years suffices to cause the blood within me to run cold in my youth men whose natures shrank not from encounter with their enemies lacked not i warrant you a checkered experience those of us who are wound the tightest go the farthest and strike the hardest nor is it difficult for one the last of whose life is being recorded to review the outspread roll of it and trace the unerring forces which have drawn for themselves  some indeed traverse this world weighing before they partake pleasure and business alike but i am not sure my children that they better themselves or that god in his allwise judgment prefers them to such as are guided by the divine impulse with which he has endowed them far be it from me to advise rashness or imprudence as such nor do i believe you will take me so but i say unto you do that which is right and let god not man be your interpreter  my narrative awaits me  i came to my wits with an immoderate feeling of faintness and sickness with no more remembrance of things past than has a man bereft of reason and for some time i swung between sense and oblivion before an overpowering stench forced itself upon my nostrils accompanied by a creaking straining sound and sweeping motion i could see nothing for the pitchy blackness then i recalled what had befallen me and cried aloud to god in my anguish for i well knew i had been carried aboard ship and was at sea i had oftentimes heard of the notorious pressgang which supplied the need of the kings navy and my first thought was that i had fallen in their clutches but i wondered that they had dared attack a person of my consequence  i had no pain i lay in a bunk that felt gritty and greasy to the touch and my hair was matted behind by a clot of blood i had been stripped of my clothes and put into some coarse and rough material the colour and condition of which i could not see for want of light i began to cast about me to examine the size of the bunk which i found to be narrow and plainly at some distance from the deck for i laid hold upon one of the rough beams above me by its curvature i knew it to be a knee and thus i came to the caulked sides of the vessel and for the first time heard the rattling thud and swish of water on the far side of it i had no sooner made this discovery which drew from me an involuntary groan when a ships lanthorn was of a sudden thrust over me and i perceived behind it a head covered with shaggy hair and beard and beetling brows never had i been in such a terrifying presence  damn my blood and bones life signals at last another three bells gone my silks and laces and we had given you to the sharks  the man hung his lanthorn to a hook on the beam and thrust a casebottle of rum toward me at the same time biting off a great quid of tobacco for all my alarm i saw that his manner was not unkindly and as i was conscious of a consuming thirst i seized and tipped it eagerly  tis no fine madeira my blood said he such as i fancy your palate is acquainted with yet tis as fair a jamaica as ever griggs put ashore i the dark  griggs i cried the whole affair coming to me griggs upper marlboro south river grafton and the rector plotting in the stalls and mr silas ridgeway the accomplice  ay griggs replied he ye may well repeat it the ill lay a puncheon hell be hailing you shortly guinea griggs goldcoast griggs smuggler griggs skullandbones griggs damn his soul and eyes he hath sent to damnation many a ships company  he drained what remained of the bottle took down the lanthorn and left me sufficiently terrified to reflect upon my situation which i found desperate enough my dears i have no words to describe what i went through in that vile foulsmelling place my tears flowed fast when i thought of my grandfather and of the dear friends i had left behind and of dorothy whom i never hoped to see again and then perchance twas the rum put heart into me i vowed i would face the matter show this cutthroat of a griggs a bold front had he meant to murder me i reflected he had done the business long since then i fell asleep  i awoke i know not how soon to discover the same shaggy countenance and the lanthorn  canst walk mechlin says he  i can try at least i answered  he seemed pleased at this  you have courage aplenty and by g you will have need of it all with that of a griggs he gave me his bottle again and assisted me down and i found that my legs save for the rocking of the ship were steady enough i followed him out of the hole in which i had lain on to a deck which in the half light i saw covered with slush and filth it was small and but dimly illuminated by a hatchway up the which i pushed after him and then another and so we came to the light of day which near blinded me so that i was fain to clap my hand to mine eyes and stood for a space looking about me like a man dazed the wind tho blowing stiff was mild and league after league of the green sea danced and foamed in the morning sunlight and i perceived that i was on a large schooner under full sail the crew of which were littered about at different occupations some gaming and some drinking while on the forecastle two men were settling a dispute at fisticuffs and they gave me no more notice nor as much than i had been a baboon thrust among them from this indifference to a captive i augured no good then my conductor whom i rightly judged to be the mate of this devils crew took me roughly by the shoulder and bade me accompany him to the cabin  as we drew near the topgallant poop there sounded in my ears a noise like a tempest which i soon became aware was a man swearing with a prodigious vehemence in a foghorn of a voice sdeath and wounds where is that dogfish of a cockle damn his entrails and he is not come soon ill masthead him naked by the seven holy spritsails and much more and worse to the same tune until we passed the door and stood before him when he let out an oath like the deathcry of a monster  he was a short lean man with a leathery face and long black ropy hair and beady black eyes that caught the light like a cats his looks indeed would have scared a timid person into a fit but i resolved i would die rather than show the fear with which he inspired me he was dressed in an old navy uniform with dirty lace his cabin was bare enough being scattered about with pistols and muskets and cutlasses with a ragged pallet in one corner and he sat behind an oaken table covered with greasy charts and spilled liquor and tobacco  so ho you are risen from the dead are you my fine buck mr whatdotheycallyou cried the captain with a word as foul as any he had yet uttered by the lord you shall pay for running my bosun through  and by the lord captain whatsyourname i cried back for the rum i had taken had heated me you and your fellowrascals shall pay in blood for this villanous injury  griggs got to his feet and seized his hanger his face like livid marble seamed with blue and from force of habit i made motion for my sword to make the shameful discovery that i was clothed from head to foot in linseywoolsey  gdmy soul he roared if i dont slit you like a herring the devil burn me to a cinder if i dont give your guts to the sharks and he made at me in such a fury that i would certainly have been cut to pieces had i not grasped a cutlass and parried his blow cockle looking on with his jaw dropped like a peak without haulyards with a stroke of my weapon i disarmed captain griggs his sword flying through the cabin window for i made up my mind i would better die fighting than expire at a hideous torture which i doubted not he would inflict and so i took up a posture of defence with one eye on the mate despite the kind offices of the latter below i knew not whether he were disposed to befriend me before the captain what was my astonishment therefore to behold griggss truculent manner change  avast my manowar he cried blood and wounds i had more than an eye when they brought thee aboard else i would have killed thee like a suckingpig under the forecastle as i have given oath to do by the ghost you are worth seven of that roger spratt whom you sent to hell in his boots  wherewith cockle who for all his terrible appearance stood in a mighty awe of his captain set up a loud laugh and vowed that griggs knew a man when he spared me and was cursed for his pains  so you were contracted to murder me captain griggs said i  ay he replied a devilish gleam coming into his eye but i have now got you and the money to boot but harkye ill stand by my half of the bargain by g if ever you reach maryland alive they may hang me to the yardarm of a shipoftheline  and i live long enough my dears i hope some day to write for you the account of all that befell me on this slaver black moll for so she was called twould but delay my story now suffice it to say that we sailed for a fortnight or so in the west india seas from some observations that fell from the mouth of griggs i gathered that he was searching for an island which evaded him and each day added to his vexation at not finding it at times he was drunk for forty hours at a stretch when he would shut himself in his cabin and leave his ship to the care of cockle who navigated with the sober portion of the crew and such a lousy brawling lot of convicts i had never clapped eyes upon as for me i was treated indifferently well though twas in truth punishment enough to live in that filthy ship to eat their shins of beef and briny pork and wormy biscuit to wear rough clothes that chafed my skin i shared cockles cabin in every way as dirty a place as the den i had left but with the advantage of air for which i fervently thanked god  i think the mate had some little friendship for me though he was too hardened by the life he had led to care a deal what became of me he encouraged me secretly to continue to beard griggs as i had begun saying that it was my sole chance of a whole skin and vowing that if he had had the courage to pursue the same course his own back had not been checkered like a grating he told me stories of the captains cruelty which i dare not repeat for their very horror and indeed i lacked not for instances to substantiate what he said men with their backs beaten to a pulp and others with ears cut off and mouths slit and toes missing so that i lived in hourly fear lest in some drunken fit griggs might command me to be tortured but fortunately he held small converse with me and when sober busied himself in trying to find the island and in cursing the fate by which it eluded him  so i existed and prayed daily for deliverance i plied cockle with questions as to what they purposed doing with me but he was wont to turn sulky and would answer me not a word but once when he was deeper in his cups than common he let me know that griggs was to sell me to a certain planter you may well believe that this did not serve to liven my spirits  at length one morning captain griggs came out of his cabin and climbed upon the poop calling all hands aft to the quarterdeck whereupon he proceeded to make them a speech that for vileness exceeded aught i have ever heard before or since he finished by reminding them that this was the anniversary of the scuttling of the sloop jane which had made them all rich a year before off the canaries the day that he had sent three and twenty men over the plank to hell wherefore he decreed a holiday as the weather was bright and the trades light and would serve quadruple portions of rum to every man jack aboard and they set up a cheer that started the mother careys astern  i have no language to depict the bestiality of that day and if i had i would think it sin to write of it the helm was lashed on the port tack the haulyards set taut and all hands down to the lad who was the cooks scullion proceeded to get drunk i took the precaution to have a hanger at my side and to slip one of cockles pistols within the band of my breeches i was in an exquisite agony of indecision as to what manner to act and how to defend myself from their drunken brutality for i well knew that if i refused to imbibe with them i should probably be murdered for my abstemiousness and if i drank the stuff was so near to alcohol that i could not hope to keep my senses while in this predicament i received a polite invitation to partake in the captains company which i did not see my way clear to refuse and repaired to the cabin accordingly  there i found griggs and cockle seated and a fairsized barrel of rum between them that the captain had just moved thither by way of welcome he shot at me a volley of curses and bade me to fill up and through fear of offending him i took down my first mug with a fair good grace then in his own particular language he began the account of the capture of the jane taking care in the pauses to see that my mug was full but as luck would have it he got no farther than the boarding by the black molls crew when he fell to squabbling with cockle as to who had been the first man over the side and while they were settling this difference i grasped the opportunity to escape  the maudlin scene that met my eyes on deck defies description some were fighting others grinning with a hideous laughter and still others shouting tavern jokes unspeakable and suddenly whilst i was observing these things from a niche behind the cabin door i heard the captain cry from within the ensign the ensign forgetting his dispute with cockle he bumped past me and made his way with some trouble to the poop i climbed the ladder after him and to my horror beheld him in a drunken frenzy drag a black flag with a rudely painted skull and crossbones from the signalchest and with uncertain fingers toggle it to the ensign haulyards and hoist to the peak where it fluttered grimly in the light wind like an evil augur on a fair day at sight of it the wretches on deck fell to shouting and huzzaing griggs standing leering up at it then he gravely pulled off his hat and made it a bow and turned upon me  salute it ye lubberly ye are no firstrate here he thundered salute the flag  unless fear had kept me sober tis past my understanding why i was not as drunk as he be that as it may i was near as quarrelsome and would as soon have worshipped the golden calf as saluted that rag i flung back some reply and he lugged out and came at me with a spring like a wild beast and his men below seeing us fall out made a rush for the poop with knives and cutlasses drawn betwixt them all i should soon have been in slivers had not the main shrouds offered themselves handy and up them i sprung the captain cutting at my legs as i left the sheerpole and i stopped not until i reached the schooners crosstrees where i drew my cutlass they pranced around the mast and showered me with oaths for all the world like a lot of howling dogs which had treed a cat  i began to feel somewhat easier and cried aloud that the first of them who came up after me would go down again in two pieces despite my warning a brace essayed to climb the ratlines as pitiable an attempt as ever i witnessed and fell to the deck again twas a miracle that they missed falling into the sea and after a while becoming convinced that they could not get at me and being too far gone to shoot with any accuracy they tumbled off the poop swearing to serve me in a hundred horrible ways when they caught me and fell again to drinking and quarrelling amongst themselves i was indeed in an unenviable plight by no means sure that i would not be slain out of hand when they became sufficiently sober to capture me as i marked the progress of their damnable orgy i cast about for some plan to take advantage of their condition i observed that a stupor was already beginning to overcome a few of them then suddenly an incident happened to drive all else from my mind  nothing less my dears than a white speck of sail gleaming on the southern horizon  for an hour i watched it now in a shiver of apprehension lest it pass us by now weeping in an ecstasy of joy over a possible deliverance but it grew steadily larger and when about three miles on our port bow i saw that the ship was a brigantine though she had long been in sight from our deck twas not until now that she was made out by a man on the forecastle who set up a cry that brought about him all who could reel thither griggs staggering out of his cabin and to the nettings the sight sobered him somewhat for he immediately shouted orders to cast loose the guns himself tearing the breeching from the ninepounder next him and taking out the tompion about half the crew were in a liquorish stupor from which the trump itself could scarce have aroused them the rest responded with savage oaths swore that they would boil their suppers in the blood of the brigantines men and give their corpses to the sea they fell to work on the port battery in so ludicrous a manner that i was fain to laugh despite the gravity of the situation but when they came to rig the powderhoist and a couple of them descended into the magazine with pipes lighted i was in imminent expectation of being blown as high as a kite  so absorbed had i been in these preparations that i neglected to watch the brigantine which i discovered to be standing on and off in a very undecided manner as though hesitating to attack my spirits fell again at this for with all my inexperience i knew her to be a better sailer than the black moll her master as griggs remarked was no dd slouching lubber and knew a yardarm from a rattan cane  finally about six bells of the watch the stranger wore ship and bore down across our bows hoisting english colours at sight of which i could scarce forbear a cheer at this instant captain griggs woke to the fact that his helm was still lashed and bestowing a hearty kick on his prostrate quartermaster stuck fast to the pitchy seams of the deck took the wheel himself and easing off before the wind to bring the vessels broadside to broadside commanded that the guns be shooed to the muzzle an order that was barely executed before the brigantine came within close range aboard her was all order and readiness the men at her guns fuse in hand an erect and pompous figure of a man in a cocked hat on the break of her poop he raised his hand two puffs of white smoke darted out and i heard first the shrieking of shot the broadside came crashing round us one tearing through the mainsail below me another mangling two men in the waist of our schooner and griggs gave the order to touch off but two of his guns answered one of which had been so gorged with shot that it burst in a hundred pieces and sent the fellow with the swab to perdition and such a hell of blood and confusion as resulted is indescribable i saw griggs in a wild fit of rage force the helm down the schooner flying into the wind and by this time the brigantine having got round and presented her port battery raked us at a bare hundred yards and i was the first to guess by the tilting forward of the mast that our hull was hit between wind and water and was fast settling by the bow  the schooner was sinking like a gallipot  that day with the sea flashing blue and white in the sun i saw men go to death with a curse upon their lips and a fever in their eyes with murder and defiance of gods holy will in their hearts overtaken in bestiality like the judgment of nineveh five and twenty disappeared from beneath me and i had scarce the time to throw off my cutlass before i too was engulfed so expired the black moll     volume 4     chapter xix a man of destiny  i was picked up and thrown into the brigantines longboat with a head and stomach full of salt water and a heart as light as spray with the joy of it all a big redbearded man lifted my heels to drain me  the mons deid said he  dead cried i from the bottomboard no more dead than you  i turned over so lustily that he dropped my feet and i sat up something to his consternation and they had scarce hooked the ships side when i sprang up the sealadder to the great gaping of the boats crew and stood with the water running off me in rivulets before the captain himself i shall never forget the look of his face as he regarded my sorry figure  now by saint andrew exclaimed he are ye kelpie or pirate  neither captain i replied smiling as the comical end of it came up to me but a young gentleman in misfortune  hoots says he frowning at the grinning halfcircle about us its daft ye are  but there he paused and took of me a second sizing how he got at my birth behind my tangled mat of hair and wringing linseywoolsey i know not to this day but he dropped his scotch and merchantcaptains manner and was suddenly a french courtier making me a bow that had done credit to a richelieu  your servant mr  richard carvel of carvel hall in his majestys province of maryland  he seemed sufficiently impressed  your very humble servant mr carvel tis in faith a privilege to be able to serve a gentleman  he bowed me toward his cabin and then in sharp quick tones he gave an order to his mate to get under way and i saw the men turning to the braces with wonder in their eyes my own astonishment was as great and so with my clothes sucking to my body and a trail of water behind me like that of a wet walrus i accompanied the captain aft his quarters were indeed a contrast to those of griggs being so neat that i paused at the door for fear of profaning them but was so courteously bid to enter that i came on again he summoned a boy from the round house  william said he a bottle of my french brandy and my compliments to mr macmuir and ask him for a suit of clothes you are a larger man than i mr carvel he said to me or i would fit you out according to your station  i was too overwhelmed to speak he poured out a liberal three fingers of brandy and pledged me as handsomely as i had been an admiral come thither in mine own barge instead of a ragged lad picked off a piratical slaver with nothing save my bare word and address twas then i had space to note him more particularly his skin was the rich colour of a wellseasoned ships bell and he was of the middle height owned a slight graceful figure tapering down at the waist like a top which had set off a silk coat to perfection and soured the beaus with envy his movements however had all the decision of a man of action and of force but his eye it was took possession of mean unfathomable dark eye which bore more toward melancholy than sternness and yet had something of both he wore a clean ruffled shirt an exceeding neat coat and breeches of blue broadcloth with plate burnished buttons and white cotton stockings truly this was a person to make one look twice and think oftener then as i went to pledge him i too was caught for his name  paul said he john paul of the brigantine john of kirkcudbright in the west india trade  captain paul i began but my gratitude stuck fast in my throat and flowed out of my eyes for the thought of the horrors from which he had saved me for the first time swept over me his own kind treatment overcame me and i blubbered like a child with that he turned his back  hoots says he again dinna ye thank me tis naething to scuttle a nest of vermin but the duty of ilka man who sails the seas by this having got the better of his emotion he added and if it has been my good fortune to save a gentleman mr carvel i thank god for it as you must  save for a slackness inside the leg and in the hips macbluirs clothes fitted me well enough and presently i reappeared in the captains cabin rigged out in the mates shore suit of purplish drab and brassbuckled shoes that came high over the instep with my hair combed clear and tied with a ribbon behind i felt at last that i might lay some claim to respectability and what was my surprise to find captain paul buried to his middle in a great chest and the place strewn about with laced and broidered coats and waistcoats frocks and newmarkets like any tailors shop in church street so strange they looked in those tropical seas that he was near to catching me in a laugh as he straightened up twas then i noted that he was a younger man than i had taken him for  you gentlemen from the southern colonies are too well nourished by far says he you are apt to be large of chest and limb odds bods mr carvel it grieves me to see you apparelled like a barber surgeon if the good lord had but made you smaller now and he sighed how well this skyblue frock had set you off  indeed i am content and more captain i replied with a smile and thankful to be safe amongst friends never i assure you have i had less desire for finery  ay said he you may well say that you who have worn silk all your life and will the rest of it and we get safe to port but believe me sir the pleasure of seeing one of your face and figure in such a coat as that would not be a small one  and disregarding my blushes and protests he held up the watchet blue frock against me and it was near fitting me but for my breadththe skirts being prodigiously long i wondered mightily what tailor had thrust this garment upon him its fashion was of the old kings time the cuffs slashed like a seaofficers uniform and the shoulders made carefully round but other thoughts were running within me then  captain i cut in you are sailing eastward  yes yes he answered absently fingering some point despagne  there is no chance of touching in the colonies i persisted  colonies no said he in the same abstraction i am making for the solway being long overdue but what think you of this mr carvel  and he held up a wondrous vellumhole waistcoat of a goneby vintage and i saw how futile it were to attempt to lead him while in that state of absorption to topics which touched my affair of a sudden the significance of what he had said crept over me the word solway repeating itself in my mind that firth bordered england itself and dorothy was in london i became reconciled i had no particle of objection to the solway save the uneasiness my grandfather would come through which was beyond helping fate had ordered things well  then i fell to applauding while the captain tried on for he was not content with holding up another frock of white drab which cuffs and pockets ill take my oath mounted no less than twentyfour another plain one of pink cutvelvet tailcoats of silk heavily broidered with flowers and satin waistcoats with narrow lace he took an inconceivable enjoyment out of this parade discoursing the while like a nobleman with nothing but dress in his head or perhaps like a mastercutter about the turn of this or that lapel the length from armpit to fold and the number of buttonholes that was proper and finally he exhibited with evident pride a pair of doeskins that buttoned over the calf to be worn with high shoes which i make sure he would have tried on likewise had he been offered the slightest encouragement so he exploited the whole of his wardrobe such an unlucky assortment of finery as i never wish to see again all of which however became him marvellously though i think he had looked well in anything i hope i may be forgiven the perjury i did that day i wondered greatly that such a foible should crop out in a man of otherwise sound sense and plain ability  at length when the last chest was shut again and locked and i had exhausted my ingenuity at commendation and my patience also he turned to me as a man come out of a trance  ods fish mr carvel he cried you will be starved i had forgot your state  i owned that hunger had nigh overcome me whereupon he became very solicitous bade the boy bring in supper at once and in a short time we sat down together to the best meal i had seen for a month it seemed like a year porridge and bacon nicely done and duff and ale with the sea rushing past the cabin windows as we ate touched into colour by the setting sun captain paul did not mess with his mates not he and he gave me to understand that i was to share his cabin apologizing profusely for what he was pleased to call poor fare he would have it that he and not i were receiving favour  my dear sir he said once you cannot know what a bit of finery is to me who has so little chance for the wearing of it to discuss with a gentleman a connoisseur i know a bit of french mr carvel is a pleasure i do not often come at  his simplicity in this touched me it was pathetic  how know you i am a gentleman captain paul i asked curiously  i should lack discernment sir he retorted with some heat if i could not see as much breeding shines through sackcloth sir besides he continued in a milder tone the look of you is candour itself though i have not greatly the advantage of you in age i have seen many men and i know that such a face as yours cannot lie  here mr lowrie the second mate came in with a report and i remarked that he stood up hat in hand whilst making it very much as if captain paul commanded a frigate the captain went to a locker and brought forth some mellow madeira and after the mate had taken a glass of it standing he withdrew then we lighted pipes and sat very cosey with a lanthorn swung between us and captain paul expressed a wish to hear my story  i gave him my early history briefly dwelling but casually upon the position enjoyed in maryland by my family but i spoke of my grandfather now turning seventy grayhaired in the service of king and province the captain was indeed a most sympathetic listener now throwing in a question showing keen scotch penetration and anon making a most ludicrous inquiry as to the dress livery our footmen wore and whether mr carvel used outriders when he travelled abroad this was the other side of the man as the wine warmed and the pipe soothed i spoke at length of grafton and the rector and when i came to the wretched contrivance by which they got me aboard the black moll he was stalking hither and thither about the cabin his fists clenched and his voice thick breaking into scotch again and vowing that hell were too good for such as they  his indignation which seemed real and generous transformed him into another man he showered question after question upon me concerning my uncle and mr allen declared that he had known many villains but had yet to hear of their equals and finally cooling a little gave it as his judgment that the crime could never be brought home to them this was my own opinion he advised me before we turned in to gie the parson a grunt as soon as ever i could lay hands upon him   the john made a good voyage for that season with fair winds and clear skies for the most part twas a stout ship and a steady with generous breadth of beam and kept by the master as clean and bright as his porringer he was emperor aboard her he spelt command with a large c and when he inspected his jacks stood to attention like manowars men the john mounting only four guns and but two of them ninepounders i expressed my astonishment that he had dared attack a pirate craft like the black moll without knowing her condition and armament  richard says he impressively for we had become very friendly i would close with a thirtytwo and she flew that flag why sir a bold front is half the battle using circumspection of a course a pretty woman whatever her airs and quality is to be carried the same way and a man ought never to be frightened by appearances  sometimes at our meals we discussed politics but he seemed lukewarm upon this subject he had told me that he had a brother william in virginia who was a hot patriot the american quarrel seemed to interest him very little i should like to underscore this last sentence my dears in view of what comes after what he said on the topic leaned perhaps to the kings side tho he was careful to say nothing that would give me offence i was not surprised for i had made a fair guess of his ambitions it is only honest to declare that in my soberer moments my estimate of his character suffered but he was a strange mana genius as i soon discovered to rouse the most sluggish nature to enthusiasm  the joy of sailing is born into some men and those who are marked for the sea go down thither like the very streams to be salted whatever the sign old stanwix was not far wrong when he read it upon me and twas no great while before i was part and parcel of the ship beneath my feet breathing deep with her every motion what feeling can compare with that i tasted when the brigantine lay on her side the silver spray hurling over the bulwarks and stinging me to life or in the watches to hear the sea lashing along her strakes in never ending music i gave macmuir his shore suit again and hugely delighted and astonished captain paul by donning a jacket of scotch wool and a pair of seamans boots and so became a sailor myself i had no mind to sit idle the passage and the love of it as i have said was in me in a fortnight i went aloft with the best of the watch to reef topsails and trod a footrope without losing head or balance bent an easing and could lay hand on any lift brace sheet or haulyards in the racks john paul himself taught me to tack and wear ship and macmuir to stow a headsail the craft came to me as it were in a handgallop  at first i could make nothing of the crew not being able to understand a word of their scotch but i remarked from the first that they were sour and sulky and given to gathering in knots when the captain or macmuir had not the deck for mr lowrie poor man they had little respect but they plainly feared the first mate and john paul most of all of me their suspicion knew no bounds and they would give me gruff answers or none when i spoke to them these things roused both curiosity and foreboding within me  many a watch i paced thro with macmuir big and red and kindly and i was not long in letting him know of the interest which captain paul had inspired within me his own feeling for him was little short of idolatry i had surmised much as to the rank of life from which the captain had sprung but my astonishment was great when i was told that john paul was the son of a poor gardener  a gardeners son mr macmuir i repeated  just that said he solemnly a guid man an haly was auld paul unco puir by reason o seven bairns i kennt the daddie weel i mak sma doubt the captainll tak ye hame wi him syne the mither an sisters still be i the cot i mr craiks croft  tell me macmuir said i is not the captain in some trouble  for i knew that something whatever it was hung heavy on john pauls mind as we drew nearer scotland at times his brow would cloud and he would fall silent in the midst of a jest and that night with the stars jumping and the air biting cold for we were up in the 40s and the john wishwashing through the seas at three leagues the hour macmuir told me the story of mungo maxwell you may read it for yourselves my dears in the life of john paul jones  waes me he said with a heave of his big chest i reca as yestreen the night maxwell cam aboord the sun gaed loon a bluidy an belyve the morn rose unco mirk an dreary wi bullers rollers frae the west like muckle sowthers soldiers wi white plumes i tauld the captain twas a the faut o maxwell i neer cad bide the blellum dour an din he was wi ae girn like th auld hornie but the captain wadna hark to my rede when i tauld him naught but dool wad cooin o taking mungo  it seemed that john paul contrary to macmuirs advice had shipped as carpenter on the voyage outnear seven months sincea man by the name of mungo maxwell the captains motive had nothing in it but kindness and a laudable desire to do a good turn to a playmate of his boyhood as macmuir said they had gaed barefit thegither amang the braes the man hailed from kirkbean john pauls own parish but he had within him little of the milk of kindness being in truth a sour and mutinous devil and instead of the gratitude he might have shown he cursed the fate that had placed him under the gardeners son whom he deemed no better than himself the john had scarce cleared the solway before maxwell showed signs of impudence and rebellion  the crew was threefourths made of kirkcudbright men who had known the master from childhood many of them indeed being older than he they were mostly jealous of paul envious of the command he had attained to over them and impatient under the discipline he was ever ready to inflict tis no light task to enforce obedience from those with whom one has birdnested but having more than once felt the weight of his hand they feared him  dissatisfaction among such spreads apace if a leader is but given and maxwell was such a one his hatred for john paul knew no bounds and having once tasted of his displeasure he lay awake o nights scheming to ruin him and this was the plot when the azores should be in the wake captain paul was to be murdered as he paced his quarterdeck in the morning the two mates clapt into irons and so brought to submission and maxwell who had no more notion of navigation than a carpenter should was to take the john to god knows wherethe guinea coast most probably he would have no more navy regulations on a merchant brigantine he promised them nor banyan days for the matter o that  happily macmuir himself discovered the affair on the eve of its perpetration overhearing two men talking in the breadroom and he ran to the cabin with the sweat standing out on his forehead but the captain would have none of the precautions he urged declared he would walk the deck as usual and vowed he could cope singlehanded with a dozen cowards like maxwell sure enough at crowdietime the men were seen coming aft with maxwell in the van carrying a bowl on the pretext of a complaint against the cook  john paul said macmuir with admiration in his voice and gesture john paul wasna feart a pickle but gaed to the mast whyles i stannt chittering i my claes fearfu for his life he teuk the horns from mungo priet tasted a soup o the crowdie an wi that he seizt haut o the man by baith shouthers ere the blastie scoundrel raught for s knife my aith upot sir the lave rest o the batch cowert frae his ee for a the wand like thumpit tykes  so ended that mutiny by the brave act of a brave man the carpenter was clapt into irons himself and given no less of the catoninetails than was good for him and properly discharged at tobago with such as had supported him but he brought captain paul before the viceadmiralty court of that place charging him with gross cruelty and this proceeding had delayed the brigantine six months from her homeward voyage to the great loss of her owners and tho at length the captain was handsomely acquitted his character suffered unjustly for there lacked not those who put their own interpretation upon the affair he would most probably lose the brigantine he expected as much said macmuir  there be mony aboord he concluded with a sigh asll muckle gash gossip when we win to kirkcudbright     chapter xx a sad homecoming  mr lowrie and auctherlonnie the dumfries bosun both of whom would have died for the captain assured me of the truth of macmuirs story and shook their heads gravely as to the probable outcome the peculiar watermark of greatness that is woven into some men is often enough to set their own community bitter against them sandie the plodding peasant finds it a hard matter to forgive jamie who is taken from the plough next to his and ends in parliament the affair of mungo maxwell altered to suit had already made its way on more than one vessel to scotland for according to lowrie there was scarce a man or woman in kirkcudbrightshire who did not know that john paul was master of the john and in their hearts that he would be master of more in days to come human nature is such that they resented it and cried out aloud against his cruelty  on the voyage i had many sober thoughts of my own to occupy me of the terrible fate from which by divine inter position i had been rescued of the home i had left behind i was all that remained to mr carvel in the world and i was sure that he had given me up for dead how had he sustained the shock i saw him heavily mounting the stairs upon scipicks arm when first the news was brought to him next grafton would come hurrying in from kent to marlboro street disavowing all knowledge of the messenger from new york and intent only upon comforting his father and when i pictured my uncle soothing him to his face and grinning behind his bedcurtains my anger would scald me and the realization of my helplessness bring tears of very bitterness  what would i not have given then for one word with that honest and faithful friend of our family captain daniel i knew that he suspected grafton he had told me as much that night at the coffee house perhaps the greatest of my fears was that my uncle would deny him access to mr carvel when he returned from the north  in the evening when the sun settled red upon the horizon i would think of patty and my friends in gloucester street for i knew they missed me sadly of a sunday at the suppertable but it has ever been my nature to turn forward instead of back and to accept the twists and flings of fortune with hope rather than with discouragement and so as we left league after league of the blue ocean behind us i would set my face to the forecastle for dorothy was in england  on a dazzling morning in march with the brigantine running like a beagle in full cry before a heaping sea that swayed her bodyso i beheld for the first time the misty green of the high shores of ireland ah of what heroes deeds was i capable as i watched the lines come out in bold relief from a wonderland of cloud with what eternal life i seemed to tingle twas as though i richard carvel had discovered all this colour and when a tiny white speck of a cottage came out on the edge of the cliff i thought irresistibly of the joy to live there the year round with dorothy with the wind whistling about our gables and the sea thundering on the rocks far below youth is in truth a mystery  how long i was gazing at the shifting coast i know not for a strange wildness was within me that made me forget all else until suddenly i became conscious of a presence at my side and turned to behold the captain  tis a braw sight richard said he but no sae bonnie as auld scotland an the wind hands we shall see her shores the morn  his voice broke and i looked again to see two great tears rolling upon his cheeks  ah scotland he pressed on heedless of them god aboon kens what she is to me but she hasna been ower guid to me laddie and he walked to the taffrail and stood looking astern that two men who had come aft to splice a haulyard might not perceive his disorder i followed him emboldened to speak at last what was in me  captain paul said i macmuir has told me of your trouble my grandfather is rich and not lacking in gratitudehere i paused for suitable words as i could not solve his expressionyou sir whose bravery and charity will have restored me to him shall not want for friends and money  he heard me through  mr carvel he replied with an impressiveness that took me aback reward is a thing that should not be spoken of between gentlemen  and thus he left me upbraiding myself that i should have mentioned money and yet i reflected secondly why not he was no more nor less than a master of a merchantman and surely nothing was out of the common in such a one accepting what he had honestly come by had my affection for him been less sincere had i not been racked with sympathy i had laughed over his notions of gentility i resolved however that when i had reached london and seen mr dix mr carvels agent he should be rewarded despite his scruples and if he lost his ship he should have one of my grandfathers  but at dinner he had plainly forgot any offence and i had more cause than ever to be puzzled over his odd mixture of confidence and aloofness he talked gayly on a score of subjectson dress of which he was never tired and described ports in the indies and south america in a fashion that betrayed prodigious powers of acute observation nor did he lack for wit when he spoke of the rich planters who had wined him and had me much in laughter we fell into a merry mood in booth jingling the glasses in many toasts for he had a list of healths to make me gasp near as long as the brigantines articlesinez in havana and maraquita in cartagena and clotilde the creole of martinico each had her separate charm then there was bess in kingston the relict of a customs official captain paul relating with ingenuous gusto a midnight brush with a lieutenant of his majesty in which the fair widow figured and showed her preference too but his adoration for the ladies of the more northern colonies he would have me to understand was unbounded for example miss arabella pope of norfolk in virginiaand did i know her no i had not that pleasure though i assured him the popes of virginia were famed miss pope danced divinely as any sylph and the very memory of her tripping at the norfolk assembly roused the captain to such a pitch of enthusiasm as i had never seen in him marvellous to say his own words failed him and he had recourse to the poets            her feet beneath her petticoat           like little mice stole in and out           as if they feared the light           but oh she dances such a way           no sun upon an easterday           is half so fine a sight  the lines he told me were sir john sucklings and he gave them standing in excellent voice and elegant gesture  he was in particular partial to the poets could quote at will from gay and thomson and goldsmith and gray and even from shakespeare much to my own astonishment and humiliation saving only dr courtenay of annapolis i had never met his equal for versatility of speech and command of fine language and having heard that he had been at sea since the age of twelve i made bold to ask him at what school he had got his knowledge  at none richard he answered with pride saving the rudiments at the parish school at kirkbean why sir i hold it to be within every mans province to make himself what he will and i early recognized in learning the only guide for such as me i may say that i married her for the furtherance of my fortunes and have come to love her for her own sake many and many the tweenwatch have i passed in a coil of rope in the tops a volume of the classics in my hand and my happiest days when not at sea have been spent in my brother williams little library he hath a modest estate near fredericksburg in virginia and none holds higher than he the worth of an education ah richard he added with a certain sadness i fear you little know the value of that which hath been so lavishly bestowed upon you there is no creation in the world to equal your fine gentleman  it struck me indeed as strange that a man of his powers should set store by such trumpery and too that these notions had not impaired his ability as a seaman i did not reply he gave no heed however but drew from a case a number of odes and compositions which he told me were his own they were addressed to various of his enamouritas abounded in orrery and were all i make no doubt incredibly fine tho not so much as one sticks in my mind to speak truth i listened with a very ill grace longing the while to be on deck for we were about to sight the isle of man the wine and the air of the cabin had made my eyes heavy but presently when he had run through with some dozen or more he put them by and with a quick motion got from his chair a light coming into his dark eyes that startled me to attention and i forgot the merchant captain and seemed to be looking forward into the years  mark you richard said he mark well when i say that my time will come and a day when the best of them will bow to me and every ell of that triumph shall be mine siray every inch  such was his force which sprang from some hidden fire within him that i believed his words as firmly as they had been writ down in the book of isaiah brimming over with enthusiasm i pledged his coming greatness in a reaming glass of malaga  alack he cried an they all had your faith laddie a fig for the prophecy ya maun ken th incentives the maist o the battle  there was more of wisdom in this than i dreamed of then here lay hid the very keynote of that ambitious character he stooped to nothing less than greatness for a triumph over his slanderers  i rose betimes the next morning to find the sun peeping above the wavy line of the scottish hills far up the solway and the brigantine sliding smoothly along in the lee of the galloway rhinns and though the month was march the slopes of burrow head were green as the lawn of carvel hall in may and the slanting rays danced on the ruffed water by eight of the clock we had crept into kirkcudbright bay and anchored off st marys isle the tide running ebb and leaving a wide brown belt of sand behind it  st marys isle as we looked upon it that day john paul and i and it lay low against the bright water with its bare oaks and chestnuts against the dark pines twas perhaps as well that the future was sealed to us  captain paul had conned the brigantine hither with a masters hand but now that the anchor was on the ground he became palpably nervous i had donned again good macmuirs shore suit and was standing by the gangway when the captain approached me  whatll ye be doing now dickie lad he asked kindly  what indeed i was without money in a foreign port still dependent upon my benefactor and since he had declared his unwillingness to accept any return i was of no mind to go farther into his debt i thanked him again for his goodness in what sincere terms i could choose and told him i should be obliged if he would put me in the way of working my passage to london upon some coasting vessel but my voice was thick my affection for him having grownpast my understanding  hoots he replied moved in his turn whyles i hae siller ye shallna lack ye maun gae postchaise to london as befits yere station  and scouting my expostulations he commanded the longboat bidding me be ready to go ashore with him i had nothing to do but to say farewell to macmuir and lowrie and auctherlonnie which was hard enough for the honest first mate i had a great liking and was touched beyond speech when he enjoined me to keep his shore suit as long as i had want of it  but you will be needing it macmuir i said suspecting he had no other  haith i am but a plain man mr carvel and ye can sen back the claw frae london wi this geordie  he slipped a guinea into my hand but this i positively refused to take and to hide my feelings i climbed quickly over the side and into the stern of the boat beside the captain and was rowed away through the little fleet of cobles gathering about the ship twisting my neck for a parting look at the john i caught a glimpse of macmuirs ungainly shoulders over the fokesle rail and i was near to tears as he shouted a hearty god speed after me  as we drew near the town of kirkcudbright which lies very low at the mouth of the river dee i made out a group of men and women on the wharves the captain was silent regarding them when we had got within twenty feet or so of the landing a dame in a red woollen kerchief called out  what hae ye done wi mungo john paul  captain john paul mither birkie spoke up a coarse fellow with a rough beard and a laugh went round  ay captain ill captain him screamed the carlin pushing to the front as the oars were tossed ill tak aith mr curriell be captaining him for his towmond voyage o piratin he be leukin for ye noo john paul with that some of the men on the thwarts perceiving that matters were likely to go ill with the captain began to chaff with their friends above the respect with which he had inspired them however prevented any overt insult on their part as for me my temper had flared up like the burning of a loose charge of powder and by instinct my right hand sought the handle of the mates hanger the beldame saw the motion  an hae ye murdert macmuir john paul an giens claw to a buckskin gowk  the knot stirred with an angry murmur in truth they meant violencenothing less but they had counted without their man for paul was born to ride greater crises with his lips set in a line he stepped lightly out of the boat into their very midst and they looked into his eyes to forget time and place macmuir had told me how those eyes could conquer mutiny but i had not believed had i trot been thereto see the pack of them give back in sullen wonder and so we walked through and on to the little street beyond and never a word from the captain until we came opposite the sign of the hurcheon  do you await me here richard he said quite calmly i mast seek mr currie and make my report  i have still the remembrance of that pitiful day in the clean little village i went into the inn and sat down upon an oak settle in a corner of the bar under the high lattice and thought of the bitterness of this homecoming if i was amongst strangers he was amongst worse verily to have ones own people set against one is heaviness of heart to a man whose love of scotland was great as john pauls after a while the place began to fill willie and robbie and jamie arriving to discuss pauls return over their nappy the little i could make of their talk was not to my liking but for the captains sake i kept my anger under as best i could for i had the sense to know that brawling with a lot of alehouse frequenters would not advance his cause at length however came in the same sneering fellow i had marked on the wharf calling loudly for swats ay captain paul was noo at mr curries syne banie alan seed him gang forbye the kirk the speakers name i learned was davie and he had been talking with each and every man in the longboat yes mungo maxwell had been catoninetailed within an inch of his life and that was the truth for a trifling offence too and cruelly discharged at some outlandish port because forsooth he would not accept the gospel of the divinity of captain paul he would as soon sign papers with the devil  this davie was gifted with a dangerous kind of humour which i have heard called innuendo and he soon had the bar packed with listeners who laughed and cursed turn about filling the room to a closeness scarce supportable and what between the foul air and my resentment and apprehension lest john paul would come hither after me i was in prodigious discomfort of body and mind but there was no pushing my way through them unnoticed wedged as i was in a far corner so i sat still until unfortunately or fortunately the eye of davie chanced to fall upon me and immediately his yellow face lighted malignantly  oh here be the gentleman the captains brocht hame he cried emphasizing the two words as braw a gentleman as eer taen frae pirates an nae doubt sin to ae bien buckskin bonnetlaird  i saw through his game of getting satisfaction out of john paul thro goading me and determined he should have his fill of it for all in all he had me mad enough to fight three times over  set aside the gentleman said i standing up and taking off macmuirs coat and call me a lubberly clout like yourself and we will see which is the better clout i put off the longsleeved jacket and faced him with my fists doubled crying ill teach you you spawn of a dunghill to speak ill of a good man  a clamour of fecht fecht arose and some of them applauded me calling me a swankie which i believe is a compliment a certain sense of fairness is often to be found where least expected they capsized the fat protesting browsterwife over her own stool and were pulling jamies coat from his back when i began to suspect that a fight was not to the snivellers liking indeed the very look of him made me laugh outtwas now as mild as a summers morn  wow says jamie ye maun fecht wi a man o yere ain size  ill lay a guinea that we weigh even said i and suddenly remembered that i had not so much as tuppence to bless me  happily he did not accept the wager in huge disgust they hustled him from the inn and put forward the blacksmith who was standing at the door in his leather apron now i had not bargained with the smith who seemed a wellnatured enough man and grinned broadly at the prospect but they made a ring on the floor i going over it at one end and he at the other when a cry came from the street those about the entrance parted and in walked john paul himself at sight of him my new adversary who was preparing to deal me out a blow to fell an ox dropped his arms in surprise and held out his big hand  haith john paul he shouted heartily forgetting me tis blythe i am to see yere bonnie face ance mair  an wha are ye jamie darrell said the captain to be bangin yere betters dinna ye ken gentry when ye seet  a puzzled look spread over the smiths grimy face  gentry says he nae gentry that i ken john paul th fecht be but a bit o fun an nane o my seekin  what quarrel is this richard says john paul to me  in truth i have no quarrel with this honest man i replied i desired but the pleasure of beating a certain eviltongued davie who seems to have no stomach for blows and hath taken his lies elsewhere  so quiet was the place that the tinkle of the guidwifes needle which she had dropped to the flags sounded clear to all john paul stood in the middle of the ring erect like a man inspired and the same strange sense of prophecy that had stirred my blood crept over him and awed the rest as tho twere suddenly given to see him not as he was but as he would be then he spoke  you who are my countrymen who should be my oldest and best friends are become my enemies you who were companions of my childhood are revilers of my manhood you have robbed me of my good name and my honour of my ship of my very means of livelihood and you are not content you would rob me of my country which i hold dearer than all and i have never done you evil nor spoken aught against you as for the man maxwell whose part you take his child is starving in your very midst and you have not lifted your hands twas for her sake i shipped him and none other may god forgive you he alone sees the bitterness in my heart this day he alone knows my love for scotland and what it costs me to renounce her  he had said so much with an infinite sadness and i read a response in the eyes of more than one of his listeners the guidwife weeping aloud but now his voice rose and he ended with a fiery vigour  renounce her i do he cried now and forevermore henceforth i am no countryman of yours and if a day of repentance should come for this evil remember well what i have said to you  they stood for a moment when he had finished shifting uneasily their tongues gone like lads caught in a lie i think they felt his greatness then and had any one of them possessed the nobility to come forward with an honest word john paul might yet have been saved to scotland as it was they slunk away in twos and threes leaving at last only the good smith with us he was not a man of talk and the tears had washed the soot from his face in two white furrows  yell hae a waught wi me afore ye gang john he said clumsily for th morns weve paddl t thegither i th nith  the ale was brought by the guidwife who paused as she put it down to wipe her eyes with her apron she gave john paul one furtive glance and betook herself again to her knitting with a sigh speech having failed her likewise the captain grasped up his mug  may god bless you jamie he said  yell be gaen noo to see the mither said jamie after a long space  ay for the last time an jamie yell see that nae harm cams to her when im far awa  the smith promised and also agreed to have john pauls chests sent by wagon that very day to dumfries and we left him at his forge his honest breast torn with emotion looking after us     chapter xxi the gardeners cottage  so we walked out of the village with many a head craned after us and many an eye peeping from behind a shutter and on into the open highway the day was heavenly bright the wind humming around us and playing mad pranks with the white cotton clouds and i forgot awhile the pity within me to wonder at the orderly look of the country the hedges with never a stone out of place and the bars always up the ground was parcelled off in such bits as to make me smile when i remembered our own wide tracts in the new world here waste was sin with us part and parcel of a creed i marvelled too at the primness and solidity of the houses along the road and remarked how their lines belonged rather to the landscape than to themselves but i was conscious ever of a strange wish to expand for i felt as tho i were in the land of the liliputians and the thought of a gallop of forty miles or so over these honeycombed fields brought me to a laugh but i was yet to see some estates of the gentry  i had it on my tongues tip to ask the captain whither he was taking me yet dared not intrude on the sorrow that still gripped him time and time we met people plodding along some of them nodding uncertainly others abruptly taking the far side of the pike and every encounter drove the poison deeper into his soul but after we had travelled some way up hill and down dale he vouchsafed the intelligence that we were making for arbigland mr craiks seat near dumfries which lies on the nith twenty miles or so up the solway from kirkcudbright on that estate stood the cottage where john paul was born and where his mother and sisters still dwelt  ill juist be saying guidbye richard he said and leave them a bit siller i hae saved an syne well be aff to london thegither for scotlands no but a cauld kintra  you are going to london with me i cried  ay answered he this is hame nae mair for john paul  i made bold to ask how the johns owners had treated him  i have naught to complain of laddie he answered both mr beck and mr currie bore the matter of the admiralty court and the delay like the gentlemen they are they well know that i am hard driven when i resort to the lash they were both sore at losing me and says mr beck i well not soon get another to keep the brigantine like a manowar as did you john paul i thanked him and told him i had sworn never to take another merchantman out of the solway and i will keep that oath  he sighed and added that he never hoped for better owners in token of which he drew a certificate of service from his pocket signed by messrs currie and beck proclaiming him the best master and supercargo they had ever had in their service i perceived that talk lightened him and led him on i inquired how he had got the john  i took passage on her from kingston laddie on the trip both captain macadam and the chief mate died of the fever and it was i the passenger who sailed her into kirkcudbright tho i had never been more than a chief mate before that is scarce three years gone when i was just turned one and twenty and old mr currie who had known my father was so pleased that he gave me the ship i had been chief mate of the two friends a slaver out of kingston  and so you were in that trade i exclaimed  he seemed to hesitate  yes he replied and sorry i am to say it but a man must live it was no place for a gentleman and i left of my own accord before that i was on a slaver out of whitehaven  you must know whitehaven then  i said it only to keep the talk going but i remembered the remark long after  i do said he tis a fair sample of an english coast town and i have often thought in the event of war with france how easy twould be for louiss cruisers to harry the place and an hundred like it and raise such a terror as to keep the british navy at home  i did not know at the time that this was the inspiration of an admiral and of a genius the subject waned and as familiar scenes jogged his memory he launched into scotch and reminiscence every barn he knew and cairn and croft and steeple recalled stories of his boyhood  we had long been in sight of criffel towering ahead of us whose summit had beckoned for cycles to helvellyn and saddleback looming up to the southward marking the wonderland of the english lakes and at length after some five hours of stiff walking we saw the brown nith below us going down to meet the solway and so came to the entrance of mr craiks place the old porter recognized paul by a mere shake of the head and the words yere back are ye and a lowering of his bushy white eyebrows we took a byway to avoid the manorhouse which stood on the rising ground twixt us and the mountain i walking close to john pauls shoulder and feeling for him at every step presently at a turn of the path we were brought face to face with an elderly gentleman in black and john paul stopped  mr craik he said removing his hat  but the gentleman only whistled to his dogs and went on  my god even he exclaimed the captain bitterly even he who thought so highly of my father  a hundred yards more and we came to the little cottage nigh hid among the trees john paul paused a moment his hand upon the latch of the gate his eyes drinking in the familiar picture the light of day was dying behind criffel and the tiny panes of the cottage windows pulsed with the rosy flame on the hearth within now flaring and again deepening he sighed he walked with unsteady step to the door and pushed it open i followed scarce knowing what i did halted at the threshold and drew back for i had been upon holy ground  john paul was kneeling upon the flags by the ingleside his face buried on the open bible in his mothers lap her snowywhite head was bent upon his her tears running fast and her lips moving in silent prayer to him who giveth and taketh away verily here in this humble place dwelt a love that defied the hard usage of a hard world  after a space he came to the door and called and took me by the hand and i went in with him though his eyes were wet he bore himself like a cavalier  mother this is mr richard carvell heir to carvel hall in marylanda young gentleman whom i have had the honour to rescue from a slaver  i bowed low such was my respect for dame paul and she rose and curtseyed she wore a widows cap and a black gown and i saw in her deeplined face a resemblance to her son  madam i said the title coming naturally i owe captain paul a debt i can never repay  an him but a laddie she cried im thankful john im thankful for his mither that ye saved him  i have no mother madam paul said i and my father was killed in the french war but i have a grandfather who loves me dearly as i love him  some impulse brought her forward and she took both my hands in her own  yell forgive an auld woman sir she said with a dignity that matched her sons but yere sae young an ye hae sic a leuk in yere bonny gray ee that i ken yell aye be a true friend o johns hes been a guid sin to me an ye maunna reek what they say o him  when now i think of the triumph john paul has achieved of the scoffing world he has brought to his feet i cannot but recall that sorrowful evening in the gardeners cottage when a son was restored but to be torn away the sisters came in from their days workboth wellfavoured lasses with johns eyes and hairand cooked the simple meal of broth and porridge and the fowl they had kept so long against the captains homecoming he carved with many a light word that cost him dear did janet reca the simmer nights they had supped here wi the bumclocks bizzin ower the candles and was nancy the cow still i the byre and did the bees still give the same bonnie hiney and were the red apples still in the far orchard ay meg had thocht o him that autumn and ran to fetch them with her apron to her face to come back smiling through her tears so it went and often a lump would rise in my throat that i could not eat famished as i was and the mother and sisters scarce touched a morsel of the feast  the one never failing test of a son my dears lies in his treatment of his mother and from that hour forth i had not a doubt of john paul he was a man who had seen the world and become in more than one meaning of the word a gentleman whatever foibles he may have had he brought no conscious airs and graces to this lowly place but was again the humble gardeners boy  but time pressed as it ever does the hour came for us to leave john paul firmly refusing to remain the night in a house that belonged to mr craik of the tenderness nay of the pity and cruelty of that parting i have no power to write we knelt with bowed heads while the mother prayed for the son expatriated whom she never hoped to see again on this earth she gave us bannocks of her own baking and her last words were to implore me always to be a friend to john paul  then we went out into the night and walked all the way to dumfries in silence  we lay that night at the sign of the twa naigs where bonnie prince charlie had rested in the mars year1715 before i went to bed i called for pen and paper and by the light of a tallow dip sat down to compose a letter to my grandfather telling him that i was alive and well and recounting as much of my adventures as i could i said that i was going to london where i would see mr dix and would take passage thence for america i prayed that he had been able to bear up against the ordeal of my disappearance i dwelt upon the obligations i was under to john paul relating the misfortunes of that worthy seaman which he so little deserved and said that it was my purpose to bring him to maryland with me where i knew mr carvel would reward him with one of his ships explaining that he would accept no money but when it came to accusing grafton and the rector i thought twice and bit the end of the feather the chances were so great that my grandfather would be in bed and under the guardianship of my uncle that i forbore and resolved instead to write it to captain daniel at my first opportunity  i arose early to discover a morning gray and drear with a mist falling to chill the bones news travels apace the world over and that of john pauls homecoming and of his public renunciation of scotland at the hurcheon had reached dumfries in good time substantiated by the arrival of the teamster with the chests the night before i descended into the courtyard in time to catch the captain in his watchetblue frock haggling with the landlord for a chaise the two of them surrounded by a muttering crowd anxious for a glimpse of mr craiks gardeners son for he had become a nineday sensation to the country round about but john paul minded them not so much as a swarm of flies and the teamsters account of the happenings at kirkcudbright had given them so wholesome a fear of his speech and presence as to cause them to misdoubt their own wit which is saying a deal of scotchmen but when the bargain had been struck and john paul gone with the ostler to see to his chests mine host thought it a pity not to have a fall out of me  so ye be the buckskin laud he said with a wink at a leering group of farmers ye hae braw gentles in america  he was a man of sixty or thereabout with a shrewd but not unkindly face that had something familiar in it  you have discernment indeed to recognize a gentleman in scotch clothes i replied turning the laugh on him  dinna raise ae buckskin mr rawlinson said a man in corduroy  rawlinson i exclaimed at random there is one of your name in the colonies who knows his station better  trowkt cried mine host ye ken ivie o maryland ivie my brither  he is my grandfathers miller at carvel hall i said  syne ye maun be nane ither than mr richard carvel yere servan mr carvel and he made me a low bow to the great dropping of jaws round about and led me into the inn with trembling hands he took a packet from his cabinet and showed me the letters twentythree in all which ivie had written home since he had gone out as the kings passenger in 45 the sight of them brought tears to my eyes and carried me out of the scotch mist back to dear old maryland i had no trouble in convincing mine host that i was the lad eulogized in the scrawls and he put hand on the very sheet which announced my birth nineteen years sincethe fourth generation of carvels ivie had known  so it came that the captain and i got the best chaise and pair in place of the worst and sat down to a breakfast such as was prepared only for my lord selkirk when he passed that way while i told the landlord of his brother and as i talked i remembered the day i had caught the arm of the mill and gone the round to find that ivie had written of that too  after that our landlord would not hear of a reckoning i might stay a month a year at the twa naigs if i wished as for john paul who seemed my friend he would say nothing only to advise me privately that the man was queer company shaking his head when i defended him he came to me with ten guineas which he pressed me to take for ivies sake and repay when occasion offered i thanked him but was of no mind to accept money from one who thought ill of my benefactor  the refusal of these recalled the chaise and i took the trouble to expostulate with the captain on that score pointing out as delicately as i might that as he had brought me to scotland i held it within my right to incur the expense of the trip to london and that i intended to reimburse him when i saw mr dix for i knew that his wallet was not over full since he had left the half of his savings with his mother much to my secret delight he agreed to this as within the compass of a gentlemans acceptance had he not i had the full intention of leaving him to post it alone and of offering myself to the master of the first schooner  despite the rain and the painful scenes gone through but yesterday and the sourlooking ring of men and women gathered to see the start i was in high spirits as we went spinning down the carlisle road with my heart leaping to the crack of the postilions whip  i was going to london and to dorothy     chapter xxii on the road  many were the ludicrous incidents we encountered on our journey to london as long as i live i shall never forget john pauls alighting upon the bridge of the sark to rid himself of a mighty farewell address to scotland he had been composing upon the road and this he delivered with such appalling voice and gesture as to frighten to a standstill a chaise on the english side of the stream containing a young gentleman in a scarlet coat and a laced hat and a young lady who sobbed as we passed them they were no doubt running to gretna green to be married  captain paul as i have said was a man of moods and strangely affected by ridicule and this we had in plenty upon the road landlords grooms andostlers and even our own postboys laughed and jested coarsely at his skyblue frock and their sallies angered him beyond all reason while they afforded me so great an amusement that more than once i was on the edge of a serious fallingout with him as a consequence of my merriment usually when we alighted from our vehicle the expression of mine host would sour and his sir would shift to a master while his servants would go trooping in again with many a coarse fling that they would get no vails from such as we and once we were invited into the kitchen he would be soar for half a day at a spell after a piece of insolence out of the common and then deliver me a solemn lecture upon the advantages of birth in a manor then his natural buoyancy would lift him again and he would be in childish ecstasies at the prospect of getting to london and seeing the great world and i began to think that he secretly cherished the hope of meeting some of its votaries for i had told him casually as possible that i had friends in arlington street where i remembered the manners were established  arlington street he repeated rolling the words over his tongue it has a fine sound laddie a fine sound that street must be the very acme of fashion  i laughed and replied that i did not know and at the ordinary of the next inn we came to he took occasion to mention to me in a louder voice than was necessary that i would do well to call in arlington street as we went into town so far as i could see the remark did not compel any increase of respect from our fellowdiners  upon more than one point i was worried often and often i reflected that some hitch might occur to prevent my getting money promptly from mr dix days would perchance elapse before i could find the man in such a great city as london he might be out of town at this season easter being less than a sennight away for i had heard my grandfather say that the elder mr dix had a house in some merchants suburb and loved to play at being a squire before he died again my heart stood at the thought the manners might be gone back to america i cursed the stubborn pride which had led the captain to hire a postchaise when the wagon had served us so much better and besides relieved him of the fusillade of ridicule he got travelling as a gentleman but such reflections always ended in my upbraiding myself for blaming him whose generosity had rescued me from perhaps a lifelong misery  but on the whole we rolled southward happily between high walls and hedges past trim gardens and fields and meadows and i marvelled at the regular parklike look of the country as though stamped from one design continually recurring like our butter at carvel hall the roads were sometimes good and sometimes as execrable as a colonial byway in winter with mud up to the axles and yet my heart went out to this country the home of my ancestors spring was at hand the ploughboys whistled between the furrows the larks circled overhead and the lilacs were cautiously pushing forth their noses the air was heavy with the perfume of living things  the welcome we got at our various stoppingplaces was often scanty indeed and more than once we were told to go farther down the street that the inn was full and i may as well confess that my mind was troubled about john paul despite all i could say he would go to the best hotels in the larger towns declaring that there we should meet the people of fashion nor was his eagerness damped when he discovered that such people never came to the ordinary but were served in their own rooms by their own servants  i shall know them yet he would vow as we started off of a morning after having seen no more of my lord than his liveries below stairs am i not a gentleman in all but birth richard and that is a difficulty many before me have overcome i have the classics and the history and the poets and the french language though i have never made the grand tour i flatter myself that my tone might be worse by the help of your friends i shall have a title or two for acquaintances before i leave london and when my money is gone there is a shipowner i know of who will give me employment if i have not obtained preferment  the desire to meet persons of birth was near to a mania with him and i had not the courage to dampen his hopes but inexperienced as i was i knew the kind better than he and understood that it was easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for john paul to cross the thresholds of the great houses of london the way of adventurers is hard and he could scarce lay claim then to a better name  we shall go to maryland together captain paul i said and waste no time upon london save to see vauxhall and the opera and st jamess and the queens house and the tower and parliament and perchance his majesty himself i added attempting merriment for the notion of seeing dolly only to leave her gave me a pang and the captain knew nothing of dolly  so richard you fear i shall disgrace you he said reproachfully know sir that i have pride enough and to spare that i can make friends without going to arlington street  i was ready to cry with vexation at this childish speech  and a time will come when they shall know me he went on if they insult me now they shall pay dearly for it  my dear captain i cried nobody will insult you and least of all my friends the manners i had my misgivings about little mr marmaduke but we are neither of us equipped for a london season i am but an unknown provincial and you i paused for words  for a sudden realization had come upon me that our positions were now reversed it seemed strange that i should be interpreting the world to this man of power  and i he repeated bitterly  you have first to become an admiral i replied with inspiration drake was once a common seaman  he did not answer but that evening as we came into windsor i perceived that he had not abandoned his intentions the long light flashed on the peaceful thames and the great grim castle was gilded all over its western side  the captain leaned out of the window  postilion he called which inn here is most favoured by gentlemen  the castle said the boy turning in his saddle to grin at me but if i might be so bold as to advise your honour the swan is a comfortable house and well attended  know your place sirrah shouted the captain angrily and drive us to the castle  the boy snapped his whip disdainfully and presently pulled us up at the inn our chaise covered with the mud of three particular showers we had run through that day and as usual the landlord thinking he was about to receive quality came scraping to the chaise door only to turn with a gesture of disgust when he perceived john pauls seaboxes tied on behind and the costume of that hero as well as my own  the captain demanded a room but mine host had turned his back when suddenly a thought must have struck him for he wheeled again  stay he cried glancing suspiciously at the skyblue frock if you are mr dysons courier i have reserved a suite  this same john paul who was like iron with mob and mutiny was pitiably helpless before such a prop of the aristocracy he flew into a rage and rated the landlord in scotch and english and i was fain to put my tongue in my cheek and turn my back that my laughter might not anger him the more  and so i came face to face with another smile behind a spyingglassa smile so cynical and unpleasant withal that my own was smothered a tall and thin gentleman who had come out of the inn without a hat was surveying the dispute with a keen delight he was past the middle age his clothes bore that mark which distinguishes his world from the other but his features were so striking as to hold my attention unwittingly  after a while he withdrew his glass cast one look at me which might have meant anything and spoke up  pray my good goble why all this folderol about admitting a gentleman to your house  i scarce know which was the more astonished the landlord john paul or i goble bowed at the speaker  a gentleman your honour he gasped your honour is joking again surely this trumpery scotchman in jews finery is no gentleman nor the longshore lout he has got with him they may go to the swan  jews finery shouted the captain with his fingers on his sword  but the stranger held up a hand deprecatingly  pon my oath goble i gave you credit for more penetration he drawled you may be right about the scotchman but your longshore lout has had both birth and breeding or i know nothing  john paul who was in the act of bowing to the speaker remained petrified with his hand upon his heart entirely discomfited the landlord forsook him instantly for me then stole a glance at his guest to test his seriousness and looked at my face to see how greatly it were at variance with my clothes the temptation to lay hands on the cringing little toadeater grew too strong for me and i picked him up by the scruff of the collarhe was all skin and bonesand spun him round like a corpse upon a gibbet while he cried mercy in a voice to wake the dead the slim gentleman under the sign laughed until he held his sides with a heartiness that jarred upon me it did not seem to fit him  by hercules and vulcan he cried when at last i had set the landlord down what an arm and back the lad has he must have the best in the house goble and sup with me  goble pulled himself together  and he is your honours friend he began with a scowl  ay he is my friend i tell you retorted the important personage impatiently  the innkeeper sulky halfsatisfied yet fearing to offend welcomed us with what grace he could muster and we were shown to the fox and the grapes a large room in the rear of the house  john paul had not spoken since the slim gentleman had drawn the distinction between us and i knew that the affront was rankling in his breast he cast himself into a chair with such an air of dejection as made me pity him from my heart but i had no consolation to offer his first words far from being the torrent of protest i looked for almost startled me into laughter  he can be nothing less than a duke said the captain ah richard see what it is to be a gentleman  fiddlesticks i had rather own your powers than the best title in england i retorted sharply  he shook his head sorrowfully which made me wonder the more that a man of his ability should be unhappy without this one bauble attainment  i shall begin to believe the philosophers have the right of it he remarked presently have you ever read anything of monsieur rousseaus richard  the words were scarce out of his mouth when we heard a loud rap on the door which i opened to discover a swiss fellow in a private livery come to say that his master begged the young gentleman would sup with him the man stood immovable while he delivered this message and put an impudent emphasis upon the gentleman  say to your master whoever he may be i replied in some heat at the mans sneer that i am travelling with captain paul that any invitation to me must include him  the lackey stood astounded at my answer as though he had not heard aright then he retired with less assurance than he had come and john paul sprang to his feet and laid his hands upon my shoulders as was his wont when affected he reproached himself for having misjudged me and added a deal more that i have forgotten  and to think he cried that you have forgone supping with a nobleman on my account  pish captain tis no great denial his lordshipif lordship he isis stranded in an inn overcome with ennui and must be amused that is all  nevertheless i think the good captain was distinctly disappointed not alone because i gave up what in his opinion was a great advantage but likewise because i could have regaled him on my return with an account of the meal for it must be borne in mind my dears that those days are not these nor that country this one and in judging captain paul it must be remembered that rank inspired a vast respect when king george came to the throne it can never be said of john paul that he lacked either independence or spirit but a nobleman was a nobleman then  so when presently the gentleman himself appeared smiling at our door which his servant had left open we both of us rose up in astonishment and bowed very respectfully and my face burned at the thought of the message i had sent him for after all the captain was but twentyone and i nineteen and the distinguished unknown at least fifty he took a pinch of snuff and brushed his waistcoat before he spoke  egad said he with good nature looking up at me mohammed was a philosopher and so am i and come to the mountain tis worth crossing an inn in these times to see a young man whose strength has not been wasted upon foppery may i ask your name sir  richard carvel i answered much put aback  ah carvel he repeated i know three or four of that name perhaps you are robert carvels son of yorkshire but what the devil do you do in such clothes i was resolved to have you though i am forced to take a dozen watchetblue mountebanks in the bargain  sir i warn you not to insult my friend i cried in a temper again  there there not so loud i beg you said he with a gesture hot as pounded pepperbut all things are the better for a touch of it i had no intention of insulting the worthy man i give my word i must have my joke sir no harm meant and he nodded at john paul who looked as if he would sink through the floor robert carvel is as testy as the devil with the gout and you are not unlike him in feature  he is no relation of mine i replied undecided whether to laugh or be angry and then i added for i was very young i am an american and heir to carvel hall in maryland  lord lord i might have known exclaimed he once i had the honour of dining with your dr franklin from pennsylvania he dresses for all the world like you only worse and wears a hat i would not be caught under at bagnigge wells were i so imprudent as to go there  dr franklin has weightier matters than hats to occupy him sir i retorted for i was determined to hold my own  he made a french gesture a shrug of his thin shoulders which caused me to suspect he was not always so goodnatured  dr franklin would better have stuck to his newspaper my young friend said he but i like your appearance too well to quarrel with you and well have no politics before eating come gentlemen come let us see what goble has left after his shaking  he struck off with something of a painful gait which he explained was from the gout and presently we arrived at his parlour where supper was set out for us i had not tasted its equal since i left maryland we sat down to a capon stuffed with eggs and dainty sausages and hot rolls such as we had at home and a wine which had cobwebbed and mellowed under the castle inn for better than twenty years the personage did not drink wine he sent his servant to quarrel with goble because he had not been given iced water while he was tapping on the table i took occasion to observe him his was a physiognomy to strike the stranger not by reason of its nobility but because of its oddity he had a prodigious length of face the nose long in proportion but not prominent the eyes were dark very bright and wide apart with little eyebrows dabbed over them at a slanting angle the thinlipped mouth rather pursed up which made his smile the contradiction it was in short my dears while i do not lay claim to the reading of character it required no great astuteness to perceive the scholar the man of the world and the asceticand all affected his conversation bore out the summary it astonished us it encircled the earth embraced history and letters since the world began and added to all this he had a thousand anecdotes on his tongues tip his words he chose with too great a nicety his sentences were of a foreign formation twisted around and his stories were illustrated with french gesticulations he threw in quotations galore in latin and french and english until the captain began casting me odd uncomfortable looks as though he wished himself well out of the entertainment indeed poor john pauls perturbation amused me more than the gentlemans anecdotes to be ill at ease is discouraging to any one but it was peculiarly fatal with the captain this archaristocrat dazzled him when he attempted to follow in the same vein he would get lost and his really considerable learning counted for nothing he reached the height of his mortification when the slim gentleman dropped his eyelids and began to yawn i was wickedly delighted he could not have been better met another such encounter and i would warrant the captains illusions concerning the gentry to go up in smoke then he might come to some notion of his own true powers as for me i enjoyed the supper which our host had insisted upon our partaking drank his wine and paid him very little attention  may i make so bold as to ask sir whether you are a patron of literature said the captain at length  a very poor patron my dear man was the answer merely a humble worshipper at the shrine and i might say that i partake of its benefits as much as a gentleman may and yet he added with a laugh and a cough those silly newspapers and magazines insist on calling me a literary man  and now that you have indulged in a question and the claret is coming on said he perhaps you will tell me something of yourself mr carvel and of your friend captain paul and how you come to be so far from home and he settled himself comfortably to listen as a man who has bought his right to an opera box  here was my chance and i resolved that if i did not further enlighten john paul it would be no fault of mine  sir i replied in as dry a monotone as i could assume i was kidnapped by the connivance of some unscrupulous persons in my colony who had designs upon my grandfathers fortune i was taken abroad in a slaver and carried down to the caribbean seas when i soon discovered that the captain and his crew were nothing less than pirates for one day all hands got into a beastly state of drunkenness and the captain raised the skull and crossbones which he had handy in his chest i was forced to climb the main rigging in order to escape being hacked to pieces  he sat bolt upright those little eyebrows of his gone up full half an inch and he raised his thin hands with an air of incredulity john paul was no less astonished at my little ruse  holy saint clement exclaimed our host pirates this begins to have a flavour indeed and yet you do not seem to be a lad with an imagination egad mr carvel i had put you down for one who might say with alceste etre franc et sincere est mon plus grand talent but pray go on sir you have but to call for pen and ink to rival mr fielding  with that i pushed back my chair got up from the table and made him a bow and the captain at last seeing my drift did the same  i am not used at home to have my word doubted sir i said sir your humble servant i wish you a very good evening he rose precipitately crying out from his gout and laid a hand upon my arm  pray mr carvel pray sir be seated he said in some agitation remember that the story is unusual and that i have never clapped eyes on you until tonight are all young gentlemen from maryland so fiery but i should have known from your face that you are incapable of deceit pray be seated captain  i was persuaded to go on not a little delighted that i had scored my point and broken down his mask of affectation and careless cynicism i told my story leaving out the family history involved and he listened with every mark of attention and interest indeed to my surprise he began to show some enthusiasm of which sensation i had not believed him capable  what a find what a find he continued to exclaim when i had finished and true you say it is true mr carvel  sir i replied i thought we had thrashed that out  yes yes to be sure i beg pardon said he and then to his servant colomb is my writingtablet unpacked  i was more mystified than ever as to his identity was he going to put the story in a magazine  after that he seemed plainly anxious to be rid of us i bade him good night and he grasped my hand warmly enough then he turned to the captain in his most condescending manner but a great change had come over john paul he was ever quick to see and to learn and i rejoiced to remark that he did not bow over the hand as he might have done two hours since he was again captain paul the man who fought his way on his own merits he held himself as tho he was once more pacing the deck of the john  the slim gentleman poured the width of a finger of claret in his glass soused it with water and held it up  heres to your future my good captain he said and to mr carvels safe arrival home again when you get to town mr carvel dont fail to go to davenport who makes clothes for most of us at almacks and let him remodel you i wish to god he might get hold of your doctor and put up at the star and garter in pall mall i take it that you have friends in london  i replied that i had but he did not push the inquiry  you should write out this history for your grandchildren mr carvel he added as he bade his swiss light us to our room a strange yarn indeed captain  and therefore said the captain coolly as a stranger give it welcome      there are more things in heaven and earth horatio      than are dreamt of in your philosophy  had a meteor struck at the gentlemans feet he could not have been more taken aback  what whats this he cried you quote hamlet and who the devil are you sir that you know my name  your name sir exclaims the captain in astonishment  well well he said stepping back and eying us closely tis no matter good night gentlemen good night  and we went to bed with many a laugh over the incident  his name must be horatio well discover it in the morning said john paul     chapter xxiii london town  but he had not risen when we set out nor would the illnatured landlord reveal his name it mattered little to me since i desired to forget him as quickly as possible for here was one of my own people of quality a gentleman who professed to believe what i told him and yet would do no more for me than recommend me an inn and a tailor while a poor seacaptain driven from his employment and his home with no better reason to put faith in my story was sharing with me his last penny goble in truth had made us pay dearly for our fun with him and the hum of the vast unknown fell upon our ears with the question of lodging still unsettled the captain was for going to the star and garter the inn the gentleman had mentioned i was in favour of seeking a more modest and less fashionable hostelry  remember that you must keep up your condition richard said john paul  and if all english gentlemen are like our late friend i said i would rather stay in a city coffeehouse remember that you have only two guineas left after paying for the chaise and that mr dix may be out of town  and your friends in arlington street said he  may be back in maryland said i and added inwardly  god forbid  we shall have twice the chance at the star and garter they will want a show of gold at a humbler place and at the star we may carry matters with a high hand pick out the biggest frigate he cried for the tenth time at least or the most beautiful lady and it will surprise you my lad to find out how many times you will win  i know of no feeling of awe to equal that of a stranger approaching for the first time a huge city the thought of a human multitude is ever appalling as that of infinity itself a human multitude with its infinity of despairs and joys disgraces and honours each small unit with all the world in its own brain and all the world out of it each intent upon his own business or pleasure and striving the while by hook or crook to keep the ground from slipping beneath his feet for if he falls god help him  yes here was london great and pitiless and the fear of it was upon our souls as we rode into it that day  holland house with its shaded gardens kensington palace with the broad green acres of parks in front of it stitched by the silver serpentine and buckingham house which lay to the south over the hillall were one to us in wonder as they loomed through the glittering mist that softened all we met with a stream of countless wagons that spoke of a trade beyond knowledge sprinkled with the equipages of the gentry floating upon it coach and chaise cabriolet and chariot gorgeously bedecked with heraldry and wreaths their numbers astonished me for to my mind the best of them were no better than we could boast in annapolis one matter which brings a laugh as i recall it was the oddity to me of seeing white coachmen and footmen  we clattered down st jamess street of which i had often heard my grandfather speak and at length we drew up before the star and garter in pall mall over against the palace the servants came hurrying out headed by a chamberlain clad in magnificent livery a functionary we had not before encountered john paul alighted to face this personage who the moment he perceived us shifted his welcoming look to one of such withering scorn as would have daunted a more timid man than the captain without the formality of a sir he demanded our business which started the inn people and our own boy to snickering and made the passersby pause and stare dandies who were taking the air stopped to ogle us with their spyingglasses and to offer quips and behind them gathered the flunkies and chairmen awaiting their masters at the clubs and coffeehouses near by what was my astonishment therefore to see a change in the captains demeanour truly for quick learning and the application of it i have never known his equal his air became the one of careless ease habitual to the little gentleman we had met at windsor and he drew from his pocket one of his guineas which he tossed in the mans palm  here my man said he snapping his fingers an apartment at once or you shall pay for this nonsense i promise you and walked in with his chin in the air so grandly as to dissolve ridicule into speculation  for an instant the chamberlain wavered and i trembled for i dreaded a disgrace in pall mall where the manners might hear of it then fear or hope of gain or something else got the better of him for he led us to a snug wellfurnished suite of a parlour and bedroom on the first floor and stood bowing in the doorway for his honours further commands they were of a sort to bring the sweat to my forehead  have a fellow run to bid davenport the tailor come hither as fast as his legs will carry him and you may make it known that this young gentleman desires a servant a good man mind you with references who knows a gentlemans wants he will be well paid  that name of davenport was a charmthe mention of a servant was its finishing touch the chamberlain bent almost double and retired closing the door softly behind him and so great had been my surprise over these last acquirements of the captain that until now i had had no breath to expostulate  i must have my fling richard he answered laughing i shall not be a gentleman long i must know how it feels to take your ease and stroke your velvet and order lackeys about and when my money is gone i shall be content to go to sea again and think about it o stormy nights  this feeling was so far beyond my intelligence that i made no comment and i could not for the life of me chide him but prayed that all would come right in the end  in less than an hour davenport himself arrived bristling with importance followed by his man carrying such a variety of silks and satins flowered and plain and broadcloths and velvets to fill the furniture and close behind the tailor came a tall haberdasher from bond street who had got wind of a customer with a bewildering lot of ruffles and handkerchiefs and neckerchiefs and bows of lawn and lace which so he informed us gentlemen now wore in the place of solitaires then came a hosier and a bootmaker and a hatter nay i was forgetting a jeweller from temple bar and so imposing a front did the captain wear as he picked this and recommended the other that he got credit for me for all he chose and might have had more besides for himself he ordered merely a modest street suit of purple the sword to be thrust through the pocket davenport promising it with mine for the next afternoon for so much discredit had been cast upon his taste on the road to london that he was resolved to remain indoors until he could appear with decency he learned quickly as i have said  by the time we had done with these matters which i wished to perdition some score of applicants was in waiting for me and out of them i hired one who had been valet to the young lord rereby and whose recommendation was excellent his name was banks his face open and ingenuous his stature a little above the ordinary and his manner respectful i had davenport measure him at once for a suit of the carvel livery and bade him report on the morrow  all this while my dears i was aching to be off to arlington street but a foolish pride held me back i had heard so much of the fashion in which the manners moved that i feared to bring ridicule upon them in poor macmuirs clothes but presently the desire to see dolly took such hold upon me that i set out before dinner fought my way past the chairmen and chaisemen at the door and asked my way of the first civil person i encountered twas only a little rise up the steps of st jamess street arlington street being but a small pocket of piccadilly but it seemed a dull english mile and my heart thumped when i reached the corner and the houses danced before my eyes i steadied myself by a post and looked again at last after a thousand leagues of wandering i was near her but how to choose between fifty severe and imposing mansions i walked on toward that endless race of affairs and fashion piccadilly scanning every door nay every window in the hope that i might behold my ladys face framed therein here a chair was set down there a chariot or a coach pulled up and a clocked flunky bowing a lady in but no dorothy finally when i had near made the round of each side i summoned courage and asked a butchers lad whistling as he passed me whether he could point out the residence of mr manners  ay he replied looking me over out of the corner of his eye that i can but yell not get a glimpse o the beauty this day for shes but just off to kensington with a coachful o quality  and he led me all in a tremble over his answer to a large stone dwelling with arched windows and pillared portico with lanthorns and link extinguishers an area and railing beside it the flavour of generations of aristocracy hung about the place and the big knocker on the carved door seemed to regard with such a forbidding frown my shabby clothes that i took but the one glance enough to fix it forever in my memory and hurried on alas what hope had i of dorothy now  what cheer richard cried the captain when i returned have you seen your friends  i told him that i had feared to disgrace them and so refrained from knockinga decision which he commended as the very essence of wisdom though a desire to meet and talk with quality pushed him hard he would not go a step to the ordinary and gave orders to be served in our room thus fostering the mystery which had enveloped us since our arrival dinner at the star and garter being at the fashionable hour of half after four i was forced to give over for that day the task of finding mr dix  that eveningshall i confess iti spent between the green park and arlington street hoping for a glimpse of miss dolly returning from kensington  the next morning i proclaimed my intention of going to mr dix  send for him said the captain gentlemen never seek their men of affairs  no i cried i can contain myself in this place no longer i must be moving  as you will richard he replied and giving me a queer puzzled look he settled himself between the morning post and the chronicle  as i passed the servants in the lower hall i could not but remark an altered treatment my friend the chamberlain more pompous than ever stood erect in the door with a stony stare which melted the moment he perceived a young gentleman who descended behind me i heard him cry out a chaise for his lordship at which command two of his assistants ran out together suspicion had plainly gripped his soul overnight and this added to mortified vanity at having been duped was sufficient for him to allow me to leave the inn unattended nor could i greatly blame him for you must know my dears that at that time london was filled with adventurers of all types  i felt a deal like an impostor in truth as i stepped into the street disdaining to inquire of any of the people of the star and garter where an american agent might be found the day was gray and cheerless the colour of my own spirits as i walked toward the east knowing that the city lay that way but i soon found plenty to distract me  to a lad such as i bred in a quiet tho prosperous colonial town a walk through london was a revelation here in the pall mall the day was not yet begun tho for some scarce ended i had not gone fifty paces from the hotel before i came upon a stout gentleman with twelve hours of claret inside him brought out of a coffeehouse and put with vast difficulty into his chair and i stopped to watch the men stagger off with their load to st jamess street next i met a squad of redcoated guards going to the palace and after them a grand coach and six rattled over the scotch granite swaying to a degree that threatened to shake off the footmen clinging behind within a man with an eagle nose sat impassive and i set him down for one of the kings ministers  presently i came out into a wide space which i knew to be charing cross by the statue of charles the first which stood in the centre of it and the throat of a street which was just in front of me must be the strand here all was life and bustle on one hand was goldens hotel and a crowded mailcoach was dashing out from the arch beneath it the horn blowing merrily on the other hand so i was told by a friendly man in brown was northumberland house the gloomy grandeur whereof held my eyes for a time and i made bold to ask in what district were those who had dealings with the colonies he scanned me with a puzzling look of commiseration  yere not agoing to sell yereself for seven year my lad said he i was near that myself when i was young and i thank god to this day that i talked first to an honest man even as you are doing theyll give ye a pretty talethe factorsof a land of milk and honey when its naught but stripes and curses yell get  and he was about to rebuke me hotly when i told him i had come from maryland where i was born  why ye speak like a gentleman he exclaimed i was informed that all talk like naygurs over there and is it not so of your redemptioners  i said that depended upon the master they got  then i take it ye are looking for the lawyers who mostly represent the planters and y ell find them at the temple or lincolns inn  i replied that he i sought was not an attorney but a man of business whereupon he said that i should find all those in a batch about the north and south american coffee house in threadneedle street and he pointed me into the strand adding that i had but to follow my nose to st pauls and there inquire  i would i might give you some notion of the great artery of london in those days for it has changed much since i went down it that heavy morning in april 1770 fighting my way ay truly fighting my way for the street then was no place for the weak and timid when bullocks ran through it in droves on the way to market when it was often jammed from wall to wall with wagons and carmen and truckmen and coachmen swung their whips and cursed one another to the extent of their lungs near st clement danes i was packed in a crowd for ten minutes while two of these fellows formed a ring and fought for the right of way stopping the traffic as far as i could see dustmen and sweeps and even beggars jostled you on the corners bullies tried to push you against the posts or into the kennels and once in butchers row i was stopped by a flashy softtongued fellow who would have lured me into a tavern near by  the noises were bedlam ten times over shopmen stood at their doors and cried rally up rally up buy buy buy venders shouted saloop and barley furmity shrewsbury cakes and hot peascods rosemary and lavender small coal and sealingwax and others bawled pots to solder and knives to grind then there was the incessant roar of the heavy wheels over the rough stones and the rasp and shriek of the brewers sledges as they moved clumsily along as for the odours from that of the roasted coffee and food of the taverns to the stale fish on the stalls and worse i can say nothing they surpassed imagination  at length upon emerging from butchers row i came upon some stocks standing in the street and beheld ahead of me a great gateway stretching across the strand from house to house  its stone was stained with age and the stern front of it seemed to mock the unseemly and impetuous haste of the tide rushing through its arches i stood and gazed nor needed one to tell me that those two grinning skulls above it swinging to the wind on the pikes were rebel heads bare and bleached now and exposed to a cruel view but once caressed by loving hands was the last of those whose devotion to the house of stuart had brought from their homes to temple bar  i halted by the fleet market nor could i resist the desire to go into st pauls to feel like a pebble in a bell under its mighty dome and it lacked but half an hour of noon when i had come out at the poultry and finished gaping at the mansion house i missed threadneedle street and went down cornhill in my ignorance mistaking the royal exchange with its long piazza and high tower for the coffeehouse i sought in the great hall i begged a gentleman to direct me to mr dix if he knew such a person he shrugged his shoulders which mystified me somewhat but answered with a ready goodnature that he was likely to be found at that time at toms coffee house in birchin lane near by whither i went with him he climbed the stairs ahead of me and directed me puffing to the news room which i found filled with men some writing some talking eagerly and others turning over newspapers the servant there looked me over with no great favour but on telling him my business he went off and returned with a young man of a pink and white complexion in a green ridingfrock leather breeches and top boots who said  well my man i am mr dix  there was a look about him added to his tone and manner set me strong against him i knew his father had not been of this stamp  and i am mr richard carvel grandson to mr lionel carvel of carvel hall in maryland i replied much in the same way  he thrust his hands into his breeches and stared very hard  you he said finally with something very near a laugh  sir a gentlemans word usually suffices i cried  he changed his tone a little  your pardon mr carvel he said but we men of business have need to be careful let us sit and i will examine your letters your determination must have been suddenly taken he added for i have nothing from mr carvel on the subject of your coming  letters you have heard nothing i gasped and there stopped short and clinched the table has not my grandfather written of my disappearance  immediately his expression went back to the one he had met me with pardon me he said again  i composed myself as best i could in the face of his incredulity swallowing with an effort the aversion i felt to giving him my story  i think it strange he has not informed you i said i was kidnapped near annapolis last christmastime and put on board of a slaver from which i was rescued by great good fortune and brought to scotland and i have but just made my way to london  the thing is not likely mr mr he said drumming impatiently on the board  then i lost control of myself  as sure as i am heir to carvel hall mr dix i cried rising you shall pay for your insolence by forfeiting your agency  now the roan was a natural coward with a sneer for some and a smirk for others he went to the smirk  i am but looking to mr carvels interests the best i know how he replied and if indeed you be mr richard carvel then you must applaud my caution sir in seeking proofs  proofs i have none i cried the very clothes on my back are borrowed from a scotch seaman my god mr dix do i look like a rogue  were i to advance money upon appearances sir i should be insolvent in a fortnight but stay he cried uneasily as i flung back my chair stay sir is there no one of your province in the town to attest your identity  ay that there is i said bitterly you shall hear from mr manners soon i promise you  pray mr carvel he said overtaking me on the stairs you will surely allow the situation to beextraordinary you will surely commend my discretion permit me sir to go with you to arlington street and he sent a lad in haste to the exchange for a hackneychaise which was soon brought around  i got in somewhat mollified and ashamed of my heat still disliking the man but acknowledging he had the better right on his side true to his kind he gave me every mark of politeness now asked particularly after mr carvels health and encouraged me to give him as much of my adventure as i thought proper but what with the rattle of the carriage and the street noises and my disgust i did not care to talk and presently told him as much very curtly he persisted how ever in pointing out the sights the fleet prison and where the ludgate stood six years gone and the devils tavern of old ben jonsons time and the mitre and the cheshire cheese and the cock where dr johnson might be found near the end of the week at his dinner he showed me the kings mews above charing cross and the famous theatre in the haymarket and we had but turned the corner into piccadilly when he cried excitedly at a passing chariot  there mr carvel there go my lord north and mr rigby  the devil take them mr dix i exclaimed  he was silent after that glancing at me covertly from while to while until we swung into arlington street before i knew we were stopped in front of the house but as i set foot on the step i found myself confronted by a footman in the manners livery who cried out angrily to our man make way make way for his grace of chartersea turning i saw a coach behind the horses dancing at the rear wheels of the chaise we alighted hastily and i stood motionless my heart jumping quick and hard in the hope and fear that dorothy was within my eye fixed on the coach door but when the footman pulled it open and lowered the step out lolled a very broad man with a bloated face and little beady eyes without a spark of meaning and something very like a hump was on the top of his back he wore a yellow topcoat and redheeled shoes of the latest fashion and i settled at once he was the duke of chartersea  next came little mr manners stepping daintily as ever and then as the door closed with a bang i remembered my errand they had got halfway to the portico  mr manners i cried  he faced about and his grace also and both stared in wellbred surprise as i live mr manners looked into my face into my very eyes and gave no sign of recognition and what between astonishment and anger and a contempt that arose within me i could not speak  give the man a shilling manners said his grace we cant stay here forever  ay give the man a shilling lisped mr manners to the footman and they passed into the house and the door eras shut  then i heard mr dix at my elbow saying in a soft voice now my fine gentleman is there any good reason why you should not ride to bow street with me  as there is a god in heaven mr dix i answered very low if you attempt to lay hands on me you shall answer for it and you shall hear from me yet at the star and garter hotel  i spun on my heel and left him nor did he follow and a great lump was in my throat and tears welling in my eyes  what would john paul say     chapter xxiv castle yard  but i did not go direct to the star and garter no i lacked the courage to say to john paul you have trusted me and this is how i have rewarded your faith and the thought that dorothys father of all men had served me thus after what i had gone through filled me with a bitterness i had never before conceived and when my brain became clearer i reflected that mr manners had had ample time to learn of my disappearance from maryland and that his action had been one of design and of cold blood but i gave to dorothy or her mother no part in it mr manners never had had cause to hate me and the only reason i could assign was connected with his grace of chartersea which i dismissed as absurd  a few drops of rain warned me to seek shelter i knew not where i was nor how long i had been walking the streets at a furious pace but a huckster told me i was in chelsea and kindly directed me back to pall mall the usual bunch of chairmen was around the hotel entrance but i noticed a couple of men at the door of sharp features and unkempt dress and heard a laugh as i went in my head swam as i stumbled up the stairs and fumbled at the knob when i heard voices raised inside and the door was suddenly and violently thrown open across the sill stood a big roughlooking man with his hands on his hips  oho here be the other fine bird ahoming ill warrant he cried  the place was full i caught sight of davenport the tailor with a wry face talking against the noise of banks the man i had hired resplendent in my livery one of the hotel servants was in the corner perspiring over john pauls chests and beside him stood a man disdainfully turning over with his foot the contents as they were thrown on the floor i saw him kick the precious vellumhole waistcoat across the room in wrath and disgust and heard him shout above the rest the lot of them would not bring a guinea from any jew in st martins lane  in the other corner by the writingdesk stood the hatter and the haberdasher with their heads together and in the very centre of the confusion was the captain himself he was drest in his new clothes davenport had brought and surprised me by his changed appearance and looked as fine a gentleman as any i have ever seen his face lighted with relief at sight of me  now may i tell these rogues begone richard he cried and turning to the man confronting me he added this gentleman will settle their beggarly accounts  then i knew we had to do with bailiffs and my heart failed me  likely laughed the big man ill stake my oath he has not a groat to pay their beggarly accounts as year honour is pleased to call them  they ceased jabbering and straightened to attention awaiting my reply but i forgot them all and thought only of the captain and of the trouble i had brought him he began to show some consternation as i went up to him  my dear friend i said vainly trying to steady my voice i beg i pray that you will not lose faith in methat you will not think any deceit of mine has brought you to these straits mr dix did not know me and has had no word from my grandfather of my disappearance and mr manners whom i thought my friend spurned me in the street before the duke of chartersea  and no longer master of myself i sat down at the table and hid my face shaken by great sobs to think that this was my return for his kindness  what i heard him cry mr manners spurned you richard by all the law in coke and littleton he shall answer for it to me your fairweather fowl shall have the chance to run me through  i sat up in bewilderment doubting my senses  you believe me captain i said overcome by the mans faith you believe me when i tell you that one i have known from childhood refused to recognize me today  he raised me in his arms as tenderly as a woman might  and the whole world denied you lad i would not i believe you and he repeated it again and again unable to get farther  and if his words brought tears to my eyes my strength came with them  then i care not i replied i only to live to reward you  mr manners shall answer for it to me cried john paul again and made a pace toward the door  not so fast not so fast captain or admiral or whatever you are said the bailiff stepping in his way for he was used to such scenes as god reigns the owners of all these fierce titles be fireeaters who would spit you if you spilt snuff upon em come come gentlemen your swords and we shall see the sights o london  this was the signal for another uproar the tailor shrieking that john paul must take off the suit and banks the livery asking the man in the corner by the seachests who proved to be the landlord who was to pay him for his work and his lost cloth and the landlord shook his fist at us and shouted back who was to pay him his four pounds odd which included two tenshilling dinners and a flask of his best wine the other tradesmen seized what was theirs and made off with remarks appropriate to the occasion and when john paul and my man were divested of their plumes we were marched downstairs and out through a jeering line of people to a hackney coach  now sirs whereaway said the bailiff when we were got in beside one of his men and burning with the shame of it to the prison or i has a very pleasant hotel for gentlemen in castle yard  the frightful stories my dear grandfather had told me of the fleet came flooding into my head and i shuddered and turned sick i glanced at john paul  a guinea will not go far in a sponginghouse said he and the bailiffs man laughed  the bailiff gave a direction we did not hear and we drove off he proved a bluff fellow with a bloat yet not unkindly humour and despite his calling seemed to have something that was human in him he passed many a joke on that pitiful journey in an attempt to break our despondency urging us not to be downcast and reminding us that the last gentleman he had taken from pall mall was in over a thousand pounds and that our amount was a bagatelle and when we had gone through temple bar instead of keeping on down fleet street we jolted into chancery lane this roused me  my friend has warned you that he has no money i said and no more have i  the bailiff regarded me shrewdly  ay he replied i know but i has seen many stripes o men in my time my masters and i know them to trust and them whose silver i must feel or send to the fleet  i told him unreservedly my case and that he must take his chance of being paid that i could not hear from america for three months at least he listened without much show of attention shaking his head from side to side  if you ever cheated a man or the admiral here either then i begin over again he broke in with decision it is the fine sparks from the clubs i has to watch youll not worry sir about me take my oath ill get interest out of you on my money  unwilling as we both were to be beholden to a bailiff the alternative of the fleet was too terrible to be thought of and so we alighted after him with a shiver at the sight of the ugly grimy face of the house and the dirty windows all barred with double iron in answer to a knock we were presently admitted by a turnkey to a vestibule as black as a tomb and the heavy outer door was locked behind us then as the man cursed and groped for the keyhole of the inner door despair laid hold of me  once inside in the half light of a narrow hallway a variety of noises greeted our earslaughter from above and below interspersed with oaths the click of billiard balls and the occasional hammering of a pack of cards on a bare table before the shuffle the air was close almost to suffocation and out of the coffee room into which i glanced came a heavy cloud of tobacco smoke  why my masters why so glum said the bailiff my inn is not such a bad place and youll find ample good company here i promise you  and he led us into a dingy antechamber littered with papers on every one of which i daresay was written a tragedy then he inscribed our names ages descriptions and the like in a great book when we followed him up three flights to a low room under the eaves having but one small window and bare of furniture save two narrow cots for beds a broken chair and a cracked mirror he explained that cash boarders got better and added that we might be happy we were not in the fleet  we dine at two here gentlemen and sup at eight this is not the star and garter said he as he left us  it was the captain who spoke first though he swallowed twice before the words came out  come richard come laddie he said tis no so bad it michtna be waur well mak the maist o it  i care not for myself captain paul i replied marvelling the more at him but to think that i have landed you here that this is my return for your sacrifice  hoots how was ye to foresee mr manners was a blellum and he broke into threats which if mr marmaduke had heard and comprehended would have driven him into the seventh state of fear have you no other friends in london he asked regaining his english  i shook my head then camea question i dreaded  and mr mannerss family  i would rather remain here for life i said than to them now  for pride is often selfish my dears and i did not reflect that if i remained the captain would remain likewise  are they all like mr manners  that they are not i returned with more heat than was necessary his wife is goodness itself and his daughter words failed me and i reddened  ah he has a daughter you say said the captain casting a significant look at me and beginning to pace the little room he was keener than i thought this john paul  if it were not so painful a task my dears i would give you here some notion of what a london sponginghouse was in the last century comyn has heard me tell of it and i have seen bess cry over the story gaming was the kingvice of that age and it filled these places to overflowing heaven help a man who came into the world with that propensity in the early days of king george the third many alas acquired it before they were come to years of discretion next me at the long table where we were all thrown in togetherall who could not pay for private mealssat a poor fellow who had flung away a patrimony of three thousand a year another had even mortgaged to a jew his prospects on the death of his mother and had been seized by the bailiffs outside of st jamess palace coming to castle yard direct from his majestys levee yet another with such a look of dead hope in his eyes as haunts me yet would talk to us by the hour of the devonshire house where he was born of the green valley and the peaceful stream and of the old towerroom caressed by trees where queen bess had once lain under the carved oak rafters here he had taken his young wife and they used to sit together so he said in the sunny oriel over the water and he had sworn to give up the cards that was but three years since and then all had gone across the green cloth in one mad night in st jamess street their friends had deserted them and the poor little woman was lodged in holborn near by and came every morning with some little dainty to the bailiffs for her liege lord who had so used her he pressed me to share a fowl with him one day but it would have choked me god knows where she got the money to buy it i saw her once hanging on his neck in the hall he trying to shield her from the impudent gaze of his fellowlodgers  but some of them lived like lords in luxury with never a seeming regret and had apartments on the first floor and had their tea and paper in bed and lounged out the morning in a flowered nightgown and the rest of the day in a laced coat these drank the bailiffs best port and champagne and had nothing better than a frown or haughty look for us when we passed them at the landing whence the piper was paid i knew not and the bailiff cared not but the bulk of the poor gentlemen were a merry crew withal and had their wit and their wine at table and knew each others histories and soon enough ours by heart they betted away the week at billiards or whist or picquet or loo and sometimes measured swords for diversion tho this pastime the bailiff was greatly set against as calculated to deprive him of a lodger  although we had no money for gaming and little for wine or tobacco the captain and i were received very heartily into the fraternity after one afternoon of despondency we both voted it the worst of bad policy to remain aloof and nurse our misfortune and spent our first evening in making acquaintances over a deal of very thin debtors claret i tossed long that night on the hard cot listening to the scurrying rats among the rooftimbers they ran like the thoughts in my brain and before i slept i prayed again and again that god would put it in my power to reward him whom charity for a friendless foundling had brought to a debtors prison  not so much as a single complaint or reproach had passed his lips     chapter xxv the rescue  perchance my dears if john paul and i had not been cast by accident in a debtors prison this great man might never have bestowed upon our country those glorious services which contributed so largely to its liberty and i might never have comprehended that the american revolution was brought on and fought by a headstrong king backed by unscrupulous followers who held wealth above patriotism it is often difficult to lay finger upon the causes which change the drift of a mans opinions and so i never wholly knew why john paul abandoned his deeprooted purpose to obtain advancement in london by grace of the accomplishments he had laboured so hard to attain but i believe the beginning was at the meeting at windsor with the slim and cynical gentleman who had treated him to something between patronage and contempt then my experience with mr manners had so embedded itself in his mind that he could never speak of it but with impatience and disgust and lastly the bailiffs hotel contained many born gentlemen who had been left here to rot out the rest of their dreary lives by friends who were still in power and opulence more than once when i climbed to our garret i found the captain seated on the threelegged chair with his head between his hands sunk in reflection  you were right richard said he your great world is a hard world for those in the shadow of it i see now that it must not be entered from below but from the cabin window a man may climb around it lad and when he is above may scourge it  and you will scourge it captain i had no doubt of his ability one day to do it  ay and snap my fingers at it tis a pretty organization this society which kicks the man who falls to the dogs none of your fine gentlemen for me  and he would descend to talk politics with our fellowguests we should have been unhappy indeed had it not been for this pastime it seems to me strange that these debtors took such a keen interest in outside affairs even tho it was a time of great agitation we read with eagerness the castoff newspapers of the firstfloor gentlemen one poor devil who had waddled failed in change alley had collected under his mattress the letters of junius then selling the public advertiser as few publications had ever sold before john paul devoured these attacks upon his majesty and his ministry in a single afternoon and ere long he had on the tip of his tongue the name and value of every man in parliament and out of it he learned almost by heart the history of the astonishing fight made by mr wilkes for the liberties of england and speedily was as good a whig and a better than the member from middlesex himself  the most of our companions were tories for odd as it may appear they retained their principles even in castle yard and in those days to be a tory was to be the friend of the king and to be the friend of the king was to have some hope of advancement and reward at his hand they had none the captain joined forces with the speculator from the alley who had hitherto contended against mighty odds and together they bore down upon the enemyay and rooted him too for john paul had an air about him and a natural gift of oratory to command attention and shortly the dining room after dinner became the scene of such contests as to call up in the minds of the old stagers a field night in the good days of mr pitt and the second george the bailiff often sat by the door an interested spectator and the macaroni lodgers condescended to come downstairs and listen the captain attained to fame in our little world from his maiden address in which he very shrewdly separated the political character of mr wilkes from his character as a private gentleman and so refuted a charge of profligacy against the peoples champion  altho i never had sufficient confidence in my powers to join in these discussions i followed them zealously especially when they touched american questions as they frequently did this subject of the wrongs of the colonies was the only one i could ever be got to study at king williams school and i believe that my intimate knowledge of it gave the captain a surprise he fell into the habit of seating himself on the edge of my bed after we had retired for the night and would hold me talking until the small hours upon the injustice of taxing a people without their consent and upon the multitude of measures of coercion which the king had pressed upon us to punish our resistance he declaimed so loudly against the tyranny of quartering troops upon a peaceable state that our exhausted neighbours were driven to pounding their walls and ceilings for peace the news of the boston massacre had not then reached england  i was not therefore wholly taken by surprise when he said to me one night  i am resolved to try my fortune in america lad that is the land for such as i where a man may stand upon his own merits  indeed we shall go together captain i answered heartily if we are ever free of this cursed house and you shall taste of our hospitality at carvel hall and choose that career which pleases you faith i could point you a dozen examples in annapolis of men who have made their way without influence but you shall have influence i cried glowing at the notion of rewarding him you shall experience mr carvels gratitude and mine you shall have the best of our ships and you will  he was a man to take fire easily and embraced me and strange to say neither he nor i saw the humour nor the pity of the situation how many another would long before have become sceptical of my promises and justly for i had led him to london spent all his savings and then got him into a miserable prison and yet he had faith remaining and to spare  it occurred to me to notify mr dix of my residence in castle yard not from any hope that he would turn his hand to my rescue but that he might know where to find me if he heard from maryland and i penned another letter to mr carvel but a feeling i took no pains to define compelled me to withhold an account of mr mannerss conduct and i refrained from telling him that i was in a debtors prison for i believe the thought of a carvel in a debtors prison would have killed him i said only that we were comfortably lodged in a modest part of london that the manners were inaccessible for i could not bring myself to write that they were out of town just then a thought struck me with such force that i got up with a cheer and hit the astonished captain between the shoulders  how now he cried ruefully rubbing himself if these are thy amenities richard heaven spare me thy blows  why i have been a fool and worse i shouted my grandfathers ship the sprightly bess is overhauling this winter in the severn and unless she has sailed which i think unlikely i have but to despatch a line to bristol to summon captain bell the master to london i think he will bring the worthy mr dix to terms  whether he will or no said john paul hope lighting his face bell must have command of the twenty pounds to free us and will take us back to america for i must own richard that i have no great love for london  no more had i i composed this letter to bell in such haste that my hand shook and sent it off with a shilling to the bailiffs servant that it might catch the post and that afternoon we had a twoshilling bottle of port for dinner which we shared with a brokendown parson who had been chaplain in ordinary to my lord wortley and who had preached us an easter sermon the day before for it was easter monday our talk was broken into by the bailiff who informed me that a man awaited me in the passage and my heart leaped into my throat  there was banks thinking he had come to reproach me i asked him rather sharply what he wanted he shifted his hat from one hand to the other and looked sheepish  your pardon sir said he but your honour must be very illserved here  better than i should be banks for i have no money i said wondering if he thought me a firstfloor lodger  he made no immediate reply to that either but seemed more uneasy still and i took occasion to note his appearance he was exceeding neat in a livery of his old master which he had stripped of the trimmings then before i had guessed at his drift he thrust his hand inside his coat and drew forth a pile of carefully folded bank notes  i be a single man sir and has small need of this and and i knows your honour will pay me when your letter comes from america  and he handed me five bank of england notes of ten pounds apiece i took them mechanically without knowing what i did the generosity of the act benumbed my senses and for the instant i was inclined to accept the offer upon the impulse of it  how do you know you would get your money again banks i asked curiously  no fear sir he replied promptly actually brightening at the prospect i knows gentlemen sir them that are such sir and i will go to america with you and you say the word sir  i was more touched than i cared to show over his offer which i scarce knew how to refuse in truth it was a difficult task for he pressed me again and again and when he saw me firm turned away to wipe his eyes upon his sleeve then he begged me to let him remain and serve me in the sponginghouse saying that he would pay his own way the very thought of a servant in the bailiffs garret made me laugh and so i put him off first getting his address and promising him employment on the day of my release  on wednesday we looked for a reply from bristol if not for the appearance of bell himself and when neither came apprehension seized us lest he had already sailed for maryland the slender bag of thursdays letters contained none for me nevertheless we both did our best to keep in humour forbearing to mention to one another the hope that had gone friday seemed the beginning of eternity the day dragged through i know not how and toward evening we climbed back to our little room not daring to speak of what we knew in our hearts to be sothat the sprightly bess had sailed we sat silently looking out over the dreary stretch of roofs and down into a dingy court of bernards inn below when suddenly there arose a commotion on the stairs as of a man mounting hastily the door was almost flung from its hinges some one caught me by the shoulders gazed eagerly into my face and drew back for a space i thought myself dreaming i searched my memory and the name came had it been dorothy or mr carvel himself i could not have been more astonished and my knees weakened under me  jack i exclaimed lord comyn  he seized my hand yes jack whose life you saved and no other he cried with a sailors impetuosity my god richard it was true then and you have been in this place for three weeks  for three weeks i repeated  he looked at me at john paul who was standing by in bewilderment and then about the grimy cobwebbed walls of the dark garret and then turned his back to hide his emotion and so met the bailiff who was coming in  for how much are these gentlemen in your books he demanded hotly  a small matter your lordshipa mere trifle said the man bowing  how much i say  twentytwo guineas five shillings and eight pence my lord counting debts and boardand interest the bailiff glibly replied for he had no doubt taken off the account when he spied his lordships coach and i was very good to mr carvel and the captain as your lordship will discover  dn your goodness said my lord cutting him short  and he pulled out a wallet and threw some pieces at the bailiff bidding him get change with all haste and now richard he added with a glance of disgust about him pack up and well out of this cursed hole  i have nothing to pack my lord i said  my lord jack i have told you or i leave you here  well then jack and you will said i overflowing with thankfulness to god for the friends he had bestowed upon me but before we go a step jack you must know the man but for whose bravery i should long ago have been dead of fever and illtreatment in the indies and whose generosity has brought him hither my lord comyn this is captain john paul  the captain who had been quite overwhelmed by this sudden arrival of a real lord to our rescue at the very moment when we had sunk to despair and no less astonished by the intimacy that seemed to exist between the newcomer and myself had the presence of mind to bend his head and that was all comyn shook his hand heartily  you shall not lack reward for this captain i promise you cried he what you have done for mr carvel you have done for me captain i thank you you shall have my interest  i flushed seeing john paul draw his lips together but how was his lordship to know that he was dealing with no common seacaptain  i have sought no reward my lord said he what i have done was out of friendship for mr carvel solely  comyn was completely taken by surprise by these words and by the haughty tone in which they were spoken he had not looked for a gentleman and no wonder he took a quizzical sizing of the skyblue coat such a man in such a station was out of his experience  egad i believe you captain he answered in a voice which said plainly that he did not but he shall be rewarded nevertheless eh richard ill see charles fox in this matter tomorrow come come he added impatiently the bailiff must have his change by now come richard and he led the way down the winding stairs  you must not take offence at his ways i whispered to the captain for i well knew that a year before i should have taken the same tone with one not of my class his lordship is all kindness  i have learned a bit since i came into england richard was his sober reply  twas a pitiful sight to see gathered on the landings the poor fellows we had come to know in castle yard whose horizons were then as gray as ours was bright but they each had a cheery word of congratulation for us as we passed and the unhappy gentleman from devonshire pressed my hand and begged that i would sometime think of him when i was out under the sky i promised even more and am happy to be able to say my dears that i saw both him and his wife off for america before i left london our eyes were wet when we reached the lower hall and i was making for the door in an agony to leave the place when the bailiff came out of his little office  one moment sir he said getting in front of me there is a little form yet to be gone through the haste of gentlemen to leave us is not flattering  he glanced slyly at comyn and his lordship laughed a little i stepped unsuspectingly into the office  richard  i stopped across the threshold as tho i had been struck the late sunlight filtering through the dirt of the window fell upon the tall figure of a girl and lighted an upturned face and i saw tears glistening on the long lashes  it was dorothy her hands were stretched out in welcome and then i had them pressed in my own and i could only look and look again for i was dumb with joy  thank god you are alive she cried alive and well when we feared you dead oh richard we have been miserable indeed since we had news of your disappearance  this is worth it all dolly i said only brokenly  she dropped her eyes which had searched me through in wonder and pitythose eyes i had so often likened to the deep blue of the seaand her breast rose and fell quickly with i knew not what emotions how the mind runs and the heart runs at such a time here was the same dorothy i had known in maryland and yet not the same for she was a woman now who had seen the great world who had refused both titles and estatesand perchance accepted them she drew her hands from mine  and how came you in such a place she asked turning with a shudder did you not know you had friends in london sir  not for so much again would i have told her of mr mannerss conduct so i stood confused casting about for a reply with truth in it when comyn broke in upon us  ill warrant you did not look for her here richard faith but you are a lucky dog said my lord shaking his head in mock dolefulness for there is no man in london in the world for whom she would descend a flight of steps save you and now she has driven the length of the town when she heard you were in a sponginghouse nor all the dowagers in mayfair could stop her  fie comyn said my lady blushing and gathering up her skirts that tongue of yours had hung you long since had it not been for your peers privilege richard and i were brought up as brother and sister and you know you were full as keen for his rescue as i  his lordship pinched me playfully  i vow i would pass a year in the fleet to have her do as much for me said he  but where is the gallant seaman who saved you richard asked dolly stamping her foot  what i exclaimed you know the story  never mind said she bring him here  my conscience smote me for i had not so much as thought of john paul since i came into that room i found him waiting in the passage and took him by the hand  a lady wishes to know you captain i said  a lady he cried here impossible and he looked at his clothes  who cares more for your heart than your appearance i answered gayly and led him into the office  at sight of dorothy he stopped abruptly confounded as a man who sees a diamond in a dustheap and a glow came over me as i said  miss manners here is captain paul to whose courage and unselfishness i owe everything  captain said dorothy graciously extending her hand richard has many friends you have put us all in your debt and none deeper than his old playmate  the captain fairly devoured her with his eyes as she made him a curtsey but he was never lacking in gallantry and was as brave on such occasions as when all the dangers of the deep threatened him with an elaborate movement he took miss mannerss fingers and kissed them and then swept the floor with a bow  to have such a divinity in my debt madam is too much happiness for one man he said i have done nothing to merit it a lifetime were all too short to pay for such a favour  i had almost forgotten miss dolly the wayward the mischievous but she was before me now her eyes sparkling and biting her lips to keep down her laughter comyn turned to fleck the window with his handkerchief while i was not a little put out at their mirth but if john paul observed it he gave no sign  captain i vow your manners are worthy of a frenchman said my lord and yet i am given to understand you are a scotchman  a shadow crossed the captains face  i was sir he said  you were exclaimed comyn astonished and pray what are you now sir  henceforth my lord john paul replied with vast ceremony i am an american the compatriot of the beautiful miss manners  one thing ill warrant captain said his lordship that you are a wit     volume 5     chapter xxvi the part horatio played  the bailiffs business was quickly settled i heard the heavy doors close at our backs and drew a deep draught of the air god has made for all his creatures alike both the captain and i turned to the windows to wave a farewell to the sad ones we were leaving behind who gathered about the bars for a last view of us for strange as it may seem the mere sight of happiness is often a pleasure for those who are sad a coach in private arms and livery was in waiting surrounded by a crowd they made a lane for us to pass and stared at the young lady of queenly beauty coming out of the sponginghouse until the coachman snapped his whip in their faces and the footman jostled them back when we were got in dolly and i on the back seat comyn told the man to go to mr mannerss  oh no i cried scarce knowing what i said no not there for the thought of entering the house in arlington street was unbearable  both comyn and dorothy gazed at me in astonishment  and pray richard why not she asked have not your old friends the right to receive you  it was my lord who saved me for i was in agony what to say  he is still proud and wont go to arlington street dressed like a bargeman he must needs plume miss manners  i glanced anxiously at dorothy and saw that she was neither satisfied nor appeased well i remembered every turn of her head and every curve of her lip in the meantime we were off through cursitor street at a gallop nearly causing the death of a ragged urchin at the corner of chancery lane i had forgotten my eagerness to know whence they had heard of my plight when some words from comyn aroused me  the carriage is mr horace walpoles richard he has taken a great fancy to you  but i have never so much as clapped eyes upon him i exclaimed in perplexity  how about his honour with whom you supped at windsor how about the landlord you spun by the neck you should have heard the company laugh when horry told us that and miss dolly cried out that she was sure it must be richard and none other is it not so miss manners  really my lord i cant remember replied dolly looking out of the coach window who put those frightful skulls upon temple bar  then the mystery of their coming was clear to me and the superior gentleman at the castle inn had been the fashionable dabbler in arts and letters and architecture of strawberry hill of whom i remembered having heard dr courtenay speak horace walpole but i was then far too concerned about dorothy to listen to more her face was still turned away from me and she was silent i could have cut out my tongue for my blunder presently when we were nearly out of the strand she turned upon me abruptly  we have not yet heard richard she said how you got into such a predicament  indeed i dont know myself dolly some scoundrel bribed the captain of the slaver for i take it mr walpole has told you i was carried off on a slaver if he recalled that much of the story  i dont mean that answered dolly impatiently there is something strange about all this how is it that you were in prison  mr dix my grandfathers agent took me for an impostor and would advance me no money i answered hard pushed  but dorothy had a womans instinct which is often the best of understanding and i was beginning to think that a suspicion was at the bottom of her questions she gave her head an impatient fling and as i feared appealed to john paul  perhaps you can tell me captain why he did not come to his friends in his trouble  and despite my signals to him he replied in truth my dear lady he haunted the place for a sight of you from the moment he set foot in london  comyn laughed and i felt the blood rise to my face and kicked john paul viciously dolly retained her selfpossession  pho says she for a sight of me you seamen are all alike for a sight of me and had you not strength enough to lift a knocker siryou who can raise a man from the ground with one hand  twas before his tailor had prepared him madam and he feared to disgrace you the captain gravely continued and i perceived how futile it were to attempt to stop him and afterward  and afterward repeated dorothy leaning forward  and afterward he went to arlington street with mr dix to seek mr manners that he might be identified before that gentleman he encountered mr manners and his grace of something  chartersea put in comyn who had been listening eagerly getting out of a coach said the captain  when was this demanded dorothy of me interrupting him her voice was steady but the colour had left her face  about three weeks ago  please be exact richard  well if you must said i the day was tuesday and the time about half an hour after two  she said nothing for a while trying to put down an agitation which was beginning to show itself in spite of her effort as for me i was almost wishing myself back in the sponginghouse  are you sure my father saw you she asked presently  as clearly as you do now dolly i said  but your clothes he might have gone by you in such  i pray that he did dorothy i replied but i was wholly convinced that mr manners had recognized me  andand what did he say she asked  for she had the rare courage that never shrinks from the truth i think i have never admired and pitied her as at that moment  he said to the footman i answered resolved to go through with it now give the man a shilling that was his graces suggestion  my lord uttered something very near an oath and she spoke not a word more until i handed her out in arlington street the rest of us were silent too comyn now and again giving me eloquent glances expressive of what he would say if she were not present the captain watching her with a furtive praise and he vowed to me afterward she was never so beautiful as when angry that he loved her as an avenging diana but i was uneasy and when i stood alone with her before the house i begged her not to speak to her father of the episode  nay he must be cleared of such an imputation richard she answered proudly he may have made mistakes but i feel sure he would never turn you away when you came to him in troubleyou the grandson of his old friend lionel carvel  why bother over matters that are past and gone i would have borne an hundred such trials to have you come to me as you came today dorothy and i shall surely see you again i said trying to speak lightly and your mother to whom you will present my respects before i sail for america  she looked up at me startled  before you sail for america she exclaimed in a tone that made me thrill at once with joy and sadness and are you not then to see london now you are here  are you never coming back dolly i whispered for i feared mr marmaduke might appear at any moment or do you wish to remain in england always  for an instant i felt her pressure on my hand and then she had fled into the house leaving me standing by the steps looking after her comyns voice aroused me  to the star and garter i heard him command and on the way to pall mall he ceased not to rate mr manners with more vigour than propriety i never liked the little cur dn him no one likes him richard he declared all the town knows how chartersea threw a bottle at him and were it not for his daughter he had long since been put out of whites were it not for miss dolly i would call him out for this cowardly trick and then publish him  nay my lord i had held that as my privilege interrupted the captain were it not as you say for miss manners  his lordship shot a glance at john paul somewhat divided between surprise resentment and amusement  now you have seen the daughter captain you perceive it is impossible i hastened to interpose  how in the name of lineage did she come to have such a father comyn went on i thank heaven hes not mine hes not fit to be her lackey i would sooner twenty times have a profligate like my lord sandwich for a parent than a milk and water sop like manners who will risk nothing over a crown piece at play or a guinea at newmarket by g richard said his lordship bringing his fist against the glass with near force enough to break the pane i have a notion why he did not choose to see you that day why he has no more blood than a louse  i had come to the guess as soon as he but i dared not give it voice nor anything but ridicule and so we came to the hotel the red of departing day fading in the sky above the ragged houseline in st jamess street  it was a very different reception we got than when we had first come there you my dears who live in this republic can have no notion of the stir and bustle caused by the arrival of horace walpoles carriage at a fashionable hotel at a time when every innkeeper was versed in the arms of every family of note in the three kingdoms our friend the chamberlain was now humility itself and fairly ran in his eagerness to anticipate comyns demands it was yes my lord and to be sure your lordship every other second and he seized the first occasion to make me an elaborate apology for his former cold conduct assuring me that had our honours been pleased to divulge the fact that we had friends in london such friends as my lord comyn and mr walpole whose great father he had once had the distinction to serve as linkman all would have been well and he was desiring me particularly to comprehend that he had been acting under most disagreeable orders when he sent for the bailiff before i cut him short  we were soon comfortably installed in our old rooms comyn had sent posthaste for davenport who chanced to be his own tailor and for the whole army of auxiliaries indispensable to a gentlemans makeup and mr dix was notified that his lordship would receive him at eleven on the following morning in my rooms i remembered the faithful banks with a twinge of gratitude and sent for him and john paul and i having been duly installed in the clothes made for us all three of us sat down merrily to such a supper as only the cook of the star and garter who had been chef to the comte de maurepas could prepare then i begged comyn to relate the story of our rescue which i burned to hear  why richard said he filling his glass had you run afoul any other man in london save perchance selwyn youd have been drinking the bailiffs triplediluted for a month to come i never knew such a brace of fools as he and horry for getting hold of strange yarns and making them stranger the wonder was that horry told this as straight as he did he has written it to all his friends on the continent and had he not been in dock with the gout ever since he reached town he would have told it at the opera and at a dozen routs and suppers beg pardon captain said he turning to john paul but i think twas your peacock coat that saved you both for it caught horrys eye through the window as you got out of the chaise and down he came as fast as he could hobble  horry had a little dinner today in arlington street where he lives and miss dorothy was there i have told you richard there has been no sensation in town equal to that of your maryland beauty since lady sarah lennox you may have some notion of the old beau horry can be when he tries and he is overfond of miss dollyshe puts him in mind of some canvas or other of sir peters he vowed he had been saving this piece de resistance as he was pleased to call it expressly for her since it had to do somewhat with maryland what dye think i met at windsor miss manners he cries before we had begun the second course  perhaps a repulse from his majesty says dolly promptly  nay says mr walpole making a face for he hates a laugh at his cost nothing less than a young american giant with the attire of dr benjamin franklin and the manner of the fauxbourg saint germain but he had a whiff of deer leather about him and shoulders and back and legs to make his fortune at hockley in the hole had he lived two generations since and he had with him a strange scotch seacaptain who had rescued him from pirates bless you no less that is he said he was a seacaptain but he talked french like a parisian and quoted shakespeare like mr burke or dr johnson he may have been m caron de beaumarchais for i never saw him or a soothsayer or cagliostro the magician for he guessed my name  guessed your name we cried for the story was out of the ordinary  just that answered he and repeated some damned verse i never heard with horatio in it and made them all laugh  john paul and i looked at each other in astonishment and we too laughed heartily it was indeed an odd coincidence  his lordship continued well be that as it may said horry he was an able man of sagacity this seacaptain and like many another had a penchant for being a gentleman but he was more of an oddity than hertfords beast of gevaudan and was dressed like salvinio the monkey my lord holland brought back from his last italian tour  i have laughed over this description since my dears and so has john paul but at that time i saw nothing funny in it and winced with him when comyn repeated it with such brutal unconsciousness however young englishmen of birth and wealth of that day were not apt to consider the feelings of those they deemed below them  come to your story comyn i cut in testily  but his lordship missed entirely the cause of my displeasure  listen to him he exclaimed goodnaturedly he will hear of nothing but miss dolly well richard my lad you should have seen her as horry went on to tell that you had been taken from maryland with her head forward and her lips parted and a light in those eyes of hers to make a man fall down and worship for mr lloyd or some one in your colony had written of your disappearance and i vow bliss dorothy has not been the same since nor have i been the only one to remark it said he waving off my natural protest at such extravagance we have talked of you more than once she and i and mourned you for dead but i am off my course again as we sailors say captain horry was describing how richard lifted little goble by one hand and spun all the dignity out of him when miss manners broke in being able to contain herself no longer  an american mr walpole and from maryland she demanded and the way she said it made them all look at her  assurement mademoiselle replied horry in his cursed french and perhaps you know him he would gladden the heart of frederick of prussia for he stands six and three if an inch i took such a fancy to the lad that i invited him to sup with me and he gave me back a message fit for mr wilkes to send to his majesty as haughty as you choose that if i desired him i must have his friend in the bargain you americans are the very devil for independence miss manners ods fish i liked his spirit so much i had his friend captain something or otherand there he stopped caught by miss mannerss appearance for she was very white  the name is richard carvel she cried  ill lay a thousand it was i shouted rising in my chair and the company stared and lady pembroke vowed i had gone mad  bless me bless me heres a romance for certain cried horry it throws my castle of otranto in the shade thats some damned book he has written comyn interjected  you may not believe me richard when i say that miss dolly ate but little after that and her colour came and went like the red of a stormy sunset at sea heres this dog richard come to spill all our chances i swore to myself the company had been prodigiously entertained by the tale and clamoured for more and when horry had done i told how you had fought me at annapolis and had saved my life but miss manners sat very still biting her lip and i knew she was sadly vexed that you had not gone to her in arlington street for a woman will reason thus said his lordship winking wisely but i more than suspected something to have happened so i asked horry to send his fellow favre over to the star and garter to see if you were there tho i was of three minds to let you go to the devil you should have seen her face when he came back to say that you had been for three weeks in a castle yard sponginghouse then horry said he would lend me his coach and when it was brought around miss manners took our breaths by walking downstairs and into it nor would she listen to a word of the objections cried by my lady pembroke and the rest you must know there is no stopping the beauty when she has made her mind and while they were all chattering on the steps i jumped in and off we drove and you will be the most talkedof man in london tomorrow i give you miss manners cried his lordship as he ended  we all stood to the toast i with my blood atingle and my brain awhirl so that i scarce knew what i did     chapter xxvii in which i am sore tempted  who the devil is this john paul and what is to become of him asked comyn as i escorted him downstairs to a chair you must give him two hundred pounds or a thousand if you like and let him get out he cant be coming to the clubs with you  and he pulled me into the coffee room after him  you dont understand the man comyn said i he isnt that kind i tell you what he has done for me is out of friendship as he says and he wouldnt touch a farthing save what i owe him  cursed if he isnt a rum seacaptain he answered shrugging his shoulders cursed if i ever ran foul of one yet who would refuse a couple of hundred and call quits whats he to do is he to live like a lord of the treasury upon a masters savings  jack said i soberly resolved not to be angry i would willingly be cast back in castle yard tonight rather than desert him who might have deserted me twenty times to his advantage mr carvel has not wealth enough nor i gratitude enough to reward him but if our family can make his fortune it shall be made and i am determined to go with him to america by the first packet i can secure  he clutched my arm with an earnestness to startle me  you must not leave england now he said  and why  because she will marry chartersea if you do and take my oath upon it you alone can save her from that  nonsense i exclaimed but my breath caught sharply  listen richard mr mannerss manoeuvres are the talk of the town and the beast of a duke is forever wining and dining in arlington street at first people ridiculed now they are giving credit it is said he whispered fearfully it is said that his grace has got mr manners in his powersome question of honour you understand which will ruin himand that even now the duke is in a position to force the marriage  he leaned forward and searched me with his keen gray eyes as tho watching the effect of the intelligence upon me i was indeed stunned  now had she refused me fifty times instead of only twice my lord continued i could not wish her such a fate as that vicious scoundrel and since she will not have me i would rather it were you than any man alive for she loves you richard as surely as the world is turning  oh no i replied passionately you are deceived by the old liking she has always had for me since we were children together i was deeply touched by his friendship but tell me how that could affect this marriage with chartersea i believe her pride capable of any sacrifice for the family honour  he made a gesture of impatience that knocked over a candlestick  there curse you there you are again he said showing how little you know of women and of their pride if she were sure that you loved her she would never marry chartersea or any one else she has had near the whole of london at her feet and toyed with it now she has been amusing herself with charles fox but i vow she cares for none of them titles fame estates will not move her  if she were sure that i loved her i repeated dazed by what he was saying how you are talking comyn  just that ah how i know her richard she can be reckless beyond notion and if it were proved to her that you were in love with miss swain the barristers daughter over whom we were said to have fought she would as soon marry chartersea or march or the devil to show you how little she cared  with patty swain i exclaimed  but if she knew you did not care a ropes end for patty mr marmaduke and his reputation might go into exile together he continued without heeding so much for a womans pride i say the day the news of your disappearance arrived richard she was starting out with a party to visit lord carlisles seat castle howard not a step would she stir though mr marmaduke whined and coaxed and threatened and i swear to you she has never been the same since though few but i know why i might tell you more my lad were it not a breach of confidence  then dont i said for i would not let my feelings run  egad then i will he cried impetuously for the end justifies it you must know that after the letter came from mr lloyd we thought you dead i could never get her to speak of you until a fortnight ago we both had gone with a party to see wanstead and dine at the spread eagle upon the forest and i stole her away from the company and led her out under the trees my god richard how beautiful she was in the wood with the red in her cheeks and the wind blowing her black hair for the second time i begged her to be lady comyn fool that i was i thought she wavered and my heart beat as it never will again then as she turned away from her hand slipped a little goldbound purse and as i picked it up a clipping from a newspaper fluttered out pon my soul it was that very scandalous squib of the maryland gazette about our duel i handed it back with a bow i dared not look up at her face but stood with my eyes on the ground waiting  lord comyn says she presently with a quiver in her voice before i give you a reply you must first answer on your word as a gentleman what i ask you  i bowed again  is it true that richard carvel was in love with miss swain she asked  and you said comyn i broke in unable longer to contain myself you said  i said dorothy if i were to die tomorrow i would swear richard carvel loved you and you only  his lordship had spoken with that lightness which hides only the deepest emotion  and she refused you i cried oh surely not for that  and she did well said my lord  i bowed my head on my arms for i had gone through a great deal that day and this final example of comyns generosity overwhelmed me then i felt his hand laid kindly on my shoulder and i rose up and seized it his eyes were dim as were mine  and now will you go to maryland and be a fool asked his lordship  i hesitated sadly torn between duty and inclination john paul could indeed go to america without me next the thought came over me in a flash that my grandfather might be ill or even dead and there would be no one to receive the captain i knew he would never consent to spend the season at the star and garter at my expense and then the image of the man rose before me of him who had given me all he owned and gone with me so cheerfully to prison though he knew me not from the veriest adventurer and impostor i was undecided no longer  i must go jack i said sadly as god judges i must  he looked at me queerly as if i were beyond his comprehension picked up his hat called out that he would see me in the morning and was gone  i went slowly upstairs threw off my clothes mechanically and tumbled into bed the captain had long been asleep by the exertion of all the will power i could command i was able gradually to think more and more soberly and the more i thought the more absurd impossible it seemed that i a rough provincial not yet of age should possess the heart of a beauty who had but to choose from the best of all england an hundred times i went over the scene of poor comyns proposal nay saw it vividly as though the whole of it had been acted before me and as i became calmer the plainer i perceived that dorothy thinking me dead was willing to let comyn believe that she had loved me and had so eased the soreness of her refusal perhaps in truth a sentiment had sprung up in her breast when she heard of my disappearance which she mistook for love but surely the impulse that sent her to castle yard was not the same as that comyn had depicted it was merely the survival of the fancy of a little girl in a grassstained frock who had romped on the lawn at carvel hall i sighed as i remembered the sun and the flowers and the blue chesapeake and recalled the very toss of her head when she had said she would marry nothing less than a duke  alas dolly perchance it was to be nothing more than a duke the bloated face and beady eyes and the broad crooked back i had seen that day in arlington street rose before mei should know his grace of chartersea again were i to meet him in purgatory was it indeed possible that i could prevent her marriage with this man i fell asleep repeating the query as the dawn was sifting through the blinds  i awakened late banks was already there to dress me to congratulate me as discreetly as a welltrained servant should nor did he remind me of the fact that he had offered to lend me money for which omission i liked him the better in the parlour i found the captain sipping his chocolate and reading his morning chronicle as though all his life he had done nothing else  good morning captain and fetching him a lick on the back that nearly upset his bowl i cried as heartily as i could  egad if our luck holds well be sailing before the week is out  but he looked troubled he hemmed and hawed and finally broke out into scotch  indeed laddie yell no be leaving miss dorothy for me  what nonsense has comyn put into your head i demanded with a stitch in my side i am no more to miss manners than  than john paul faith yell not make me believe that ah richard said he yere a sly dog you and i have been as thick these twa months as men can well live and never a word out of you of the most sublime creature that walks i have seen women in many countries lad beauties to set thoughts afire and swords aplayand tis not her beauty alone she hath a spirit for a queen to covet and air and carriage too  this eloquent harangue left me purple  i grant it all captain she has but to choose her title and estate  ay and i have a notion which shell be choosing  the knowledge is worth a thousand pounds at the least i replied i will lend you the sum and warrant no lack of takers  now the devil fly off with such temperament and i had half the encouragement she has given you i would cast anchor on the spot and they might hang and quarter me to move me but i know you well he exclaimed his manner changing you are making this great sacrifice on my account and i will not be a drag on your pleasures richard or stand in the way of your prospects  captain paul i said sitting down beside him have i deserved this from you have i shown a desire to desert you now that my fortunes have changed i have said that you shall taste of our cheer at carvel hall and have looked forward this long while to the time when i shall take you to my grandfather and say mr carvel this is he whose courage and charity have restored you to me and me to you and he will have changed mightily if you do not have the best in maryland should you wish to continue on the sea you shall have the belle of the wye launched last year tis time captain elliott took to his pension  the captain sighed and a gleam i did not understand came into his dark eyes  i would that god had given me your character and your heart richard he said in place of this striving thing i have within me but tis written that a leopard cannot change his spots  the passage shall be booked this day i said  that morning was an eventful one comyn arrived first dressed in a suit of mauve french cloth that set off his fine figure to great advantage he regarded me keenly as he entered as if to discover whether i had changed my mind over night and i saw he was not in the best of tempers  and when do you sail he cried i have no doubt you have sent out already to get passage  i have been trying to persuade mr carvel to remain in london my lord said the captain i tell him he is leaving his best interests behind him  i fear that for once you have undertaken a task beyond your ability captain paul was the rather tart reply  the captain has a ridiculous idea that he is the cause of my going i said quickly  john paul rose somewhat abruptly seized his hat and bowed to his lordship and in the face of a rain sallied out remarking that he had as yet seen nothing of the city  jack you must do me the favour not to talk of this in john pauls presence i said when the door had closed  if he doesnt suspect why you are going he has more stupidity than i gave him credit for comyn answered gruffly  i fear he does suspect i said  his lordship went to the table and began to write leaving me to the chronicle the pages of which i did not see then came mr dix and such a change i had never beheld in mortal man in place of the wouldbe squire i had encountered in threadneedle street here was an unctuous person of business in sober gray but he still wore the hypocritical smirk with no joy in it his bow was now all respectful obedience comyn acknowledged it with a curt nod  mr dix began smoothly where a man of more honesty would have found the going difficult  mr carvel he said rubbing his hands i wish first to express my profound regrets for what has happened  curse your regrets said comyn bluntly you come here on business mr carvel does not stand in need of regrets at present  i was but on the safe side of mr carvels money my lord  ay ill warrant you are always on the safe side of money replied comyn with a laugh what i wish to know mr dix he continued is whether you are willing to take my word that this is mr richard carvel the grandson and heir of lionel carvel esquire of carvel hall in maryland  i am your lordships most obedient servant said mr dix  confound you sir can you or can you not answer a simple question  mr dix straightened he may have spoken elsewhere of asserting his dignity  i would not presume to doubt your lordships word  then if i were to be personally responsible for such sums as mr carvel may need i suppose you would be willing to advance them to him  willingly willingly my lord said mr dix and added immediately your lordship will not object to putting that in writing merely a matter of form as your lordship knows but we men of affairs are held to a strict accountability  comyn made a movement of disgust took up a pen and wrote out the indorsement  there he said you men of affairs will at least never die of starvation  mr dix took the paper with a low bow began to shower me with protestations of his fidelity to my grandfathers interests which were one day to be my ownhe hoped with me not soondrew from his pocket more than sufficient for my immediate wants said that i should have more by a trusty messenger and was going on to clear himself of his former neglect and indifference when banks announced  his honour mr manners  comyn and i exchanged glances and his lordship gave a low whistle nor was the circumstance without its effect upon mr dix with my knowledge of the character of dorothys father i might have foreseen this visit which came nevertheless as a complete surprise for a moment i hesitated and then made a motion to show him up comyn voiced my decision  why let the little cur stand in the way he said he counts for nothing  mr marmaduke was not long in ascending and tripped into the room as mr dix backed out of it as gayly as tho he had never sent me about my business in the street his clothes of a cherry cut velvet were as ever a little beyond the fashion and he carried something i had never before seen then used by the extreme dandies in londonan umbrella  what richard carvel is it possible he screamed in his piping voice we mourned you for dead and here you turn up in london alive and well and bigger and stronger than ever oons one need not go to scripture for miracles i shall write my congratulations to mr carvel this day sir and he pushed his fingers into my waistcoat so that comyn and i were near to laughing in his face for it was impossible to be angry with a little coxcomb of such pitiful intelligence  ah good morning my lord i see your lordship has risen early in the same good cause i myself am up two hours before my time you will pardon the fuss i am making over the lad comyn but his grandfather is my very dear friend and richard was brought up with my daughter dorothy they were like brother and sister what richard you will not take my hand surely you are not so unreasonable as to hold against me that unfortunate circumstance in arlington street yes dorothy has shocked me she has told me of it  comyn winked at me as i replied  we shant mention it mr manners i have had my three weeks in prison and perhaps know the world all the better for them  he held up his umbrella in mock dismay and stumbled abruptly into a chair there he sat looking at me a whimsical uneasiness on his face we shall indeed mention it sir three weeks in prison to think of it and you would not so much as send me a line ah richard pride is a good thing but i sometimes think we from maryland have too much of it we shall indeed speak of the matter out of justice to me you must understand how it occurred you must know that i am deucedly absentminded and positively lost without my glass and i had somebody with me so dorothy said chartersea i believe and his grace made me think you were a cursed beggar i make a point never to have to do with em  you are right mr manners comyn cut in dryly for i have known them to be so persistently troublesome when once encouraged as to interfere seriously with our arrangements  eh mr manners ejaculated and then came to an abrupt pause while i wondered whether the shot had told to relieve him i inquired after mrs mannerss health  ah to be sure he replied beginning to fumble in his skirts london agrees with her remarkably and she is better than she has been for years and she is overjoyed at your most wonderful escape richard as are we all  and he gave me a note i concealed my eagerness as i took it and broke the seal to discover that it was not from dorothy but from mrs manners herself     my dear richard so it ran i thank god with your dear    grandfather over yr deliverance  you must bring yr deliverer    whom dorothy describes as courtly and gentlemanly despite his    calling to dine with us this very day that we may express to him    our gratitude i know you are far too sensible not to come to    arlington street i subscribe myself richard yr sincere friend                      margaret manners  there was not so much as a postscript from dolly as i had hoped but the letter was wholesouled like mrs manners and breathed the affection she had always had for me i honoured her the more that she had not attempted to excuse mr mannerss conduct  you will come richard cried mr marmaduke with an attempt at heartiness you must come and the captain too for i hear with regret that you are not to be long with us  i caught another significant look from comyn from between the window curtains but i accepted for myself and conditionally for john paul mr manners rose to take his leave  dorothy will be glad to see you he said i often think richard that she tires of these generals and kings ministers and longs for a romp at wilmot house again alas he sighed offering us a pinch of snuff which he said was the famous number 37 alas she has had a deal too much of attention with his grace of chartersea and a dozen others would to marry her i fear she will go soon and he sighed again upon my soul i cannot make her out ill lay something handsome my lord that the madcap adventure with you after richard sets the gossips going one day she is like a schoolgirl and i blame myself for not taking her mothers advice to send her to mrs terry at campden house and the next egad she is as difficult to approach as a crowned head well gentlemen i give you good day i have an appointment at whites i am happy to see you have fallen in good hands richard my lord your most obedient  hell lay something handsome said my lord when the door had closed behind him     chapter xxviii arlington street  the sun having come out and john paul not returning by twobeing ogling i supposed the ladies in hyde parki left him a message and betook myself with as great trepidation as ever to dorothys house the door was opened by the identical footman who had so insolently offered me money and i think he recognized me for he backed away as he told me the ladies were not at home but i had not gone a dozen paces in my disappointment when i heard him running after me asking if my honour were mr richard carvel  the ladies will see your honour he said and conducted me back into the house and up the wide stairs i had heard that arlington street was known as the street of the kings ministers and i surmised that mr manners had rented this house and its furniture from some great man who had gone out of office plainly a person of means and taste the hall like that of many of the great townhouses was in semidarkness but i remarked that the stair railing was of costly ironwork and polished brass and as i went up that the stone niches in the wall were filled with the busts of statesmen and i recognized among these that of the great walpole a great copper gilt chandelier hung above but the picture of the drawingroom i was led into with all its colours remains in the eye of my mind to this day it was a large room the like of which i had never seen in any private residence of the new world situated in the back of the house its balcony overlooked the fresh expanse of the green park upon its high ceiling floated venus and the graces by zucchi and the mantel upon which ticked an antique and curious french clock was carved marble  on the gilt panels of the walls were wreaths of red roses at least a halfdozen tall mirrors framed in rococos were placed about the largest taking the space between the two high windows on the park side and underneath it stood a gold cabinet lacquered by martins inimitable hand in the centre of which was set a medallion of porcelain with the head in dark blue of his majesty charles the first the chairs and lounges were marquetrysatinwood and mahoganywith seats and backs of blue brocade the floor was polished to the degree of danger and on the walls hung a portrait by van dycke another of a young girl by richardson a landscape by the dutch artist ruysdael and a watercolour by zaccarelli  i had lived for four months the roughest of lives and the room brought before me so sharply the contrast between my estate and the grandeur and elegance in which dorothy lived that my spirits fell as i looked about me in front of me was a vase of flowers and beside them on the table lay a note to miss manners in arlington street and sealed with a ducal crest i was unconsciously turning it over when something impelled me to look around there erect in the doorway stood dolly her eyes so earnestly fixed upon me that i dropped the letter with a start a faint colour mounted to her crown of black hair  and so you have come richard she said her voice was low and tho there was no anger in it the tone seemed that of reproach i wondered whether she thought the less of me for coming  can you blame me for wishing to see you before i leave dolly i cried and crossed quickly over to her  but she drew a step backward  then it is true that you are going said she this time with a plain note of coldness  i must dorothy  when  as soon as i can get passage  she passed me and seated herself on the lounge leaving me to stand like a lout before her ashamed of my youth and of the clumsiness of my great body  ah richard she laughed confess to your old play mate i should like to know how many young men of wealth and family would give up the pleasures of a london season were there not a strong attraction in maryland  how i longed to tell her that i would give ten years of my life to remain in england that duty to john paul took me home but i was dumb  we should make a macaroni of you to amaze our colony said dolly lightly as i sat down a great distance away to accept my schooling were to double your chances when you return richard you should have cards to everything and my lord comyn or mr fox or some one would introduce you at the clubs i vow you would be a sensation with your height and figure you should meet all the beauties of england and perchance she added mischievously perchance you might be taking one home with you  nay dolly i answered i am not your match in jesting  jesting she exclaimed i was never more sober but where is your captain  i said that i hoped that john paul would be there shortly  how fanciful he is and his conversationone might think he had acquired the art at marly or in the fauxbourg in truth he should have been born on the far side of the channel and he has the air of the great man said she glancing up at ms covertly for my part i prefer a little more bluntness  i was nettled at the speech dorothy had ever been quick to seize upon and ridicule the vulnerable oddities of a character and she had all the contempt of the great lady for those who tried to scale by pleasing arts i perceived with regret that she had taken a prejudice  there dorothy i cried not even you shall talk so of the captain for you have seen him at his worst there are not many i warrant you born like him a poor gardeners son who rise by character and ability to be a captain at three and twenty and he will be higher yet he has never attended any but a parish school and still has learning to astonish mr walpole learning which he got under vast difficulties he is a gentleman i say far above many i have known and he is a man if you would know a master you should see him on his own ship if you would know a gentleman you have been with me in his mothers cottage and warming as i talked i told her of that saddest of all homecomings to the little cabin under criffels height  small wonder that i adored dorothy  would that i could paint her moods that i might describe the strange light in her eyes when i had finished that i might tell how in an instant she was another woman she rose impulsively and took a chair at my side and said  tis so i love to hear you speak richard when you uphold the absent for i feel it is so you must champion me when i am far away my dear old playmate is ever the same strong to resent and seeing ever the best in his friends forgive me richard i have been worse than silly and will you tell me that story of your adventures which i long to learn  ay that i would i told it her and she listened silently save only now and then a cry of wonder or of sympathy that sounded sweet to my earsjust as i had dreamed of her listening when i used to pace the deck of the brigantine john at sea and when at length i had finished she sat looking out over the green park as tho she had forgot my presence  and so mrs manners came in and found us  it had ever pleased me to imagine that dorothys mother had been in her youth like dorothy she had the same tall figure grace in its every motion and the same eyes of deep blue and the generous but wellformed mouth a man may pity but cannot conceive the heroism that a woman of such a mould must have gone through who has been married since early girlhood to a man like mr manners some women would have been driven quickly to frivolity and worse but this one had struggled year after year to maintain an outward serenity to a critical world and had succeeded tho success had cost her dear each trial had deepened a line of that face had done its share to subdue the voice which had once rung like dorothys and in the depths of her eyes lingered a sadness indefinable  she gazed upon me with that kindness and tenderness i had always received since the days when younger and more beautiful than now she was the companion of my mother and the unbidden shadow of a thought came to me that these two sweet women had had some sadness in common many a summers day i remembered them sewing together in the springhouse talking in subdued voices which were hushed when i came running in and lo the same memory was on dorothys mother then half expressed as she laid her hands upon my shoulders  poor elizabeth she saidnot to me nor yet to dorothy i wish that she might have lived to see you now it is captain jack again  she sighed and kissed me and i felt at last that i had come home after many wanderings we sat down mother and daughter on the sofa with their fingers locked she did not speak of mr mannerss conduct or of my stay in the sponginghouse and for this i was thankful  i have had a letter from mr lloyd richard she said  and my grandfather i faltered a thickness in my throat  my dear boy answered mrs manners gently he thinks you dead but you have written him she added hurriedly  i nodded from dumfries  he will have the letter soon she said cheerfully i thank heaven i am able to tell you that his health is remarkable under the circumstances but he will not quit the house and sees no one except your uncle who is with him constantly  it was what i expected but the confirmation of it brought me to my feet in a torrent of indignation exclaiming  the villain you tell me he will allow mr carvel to see no one  she started forward laying her hand on my arm and dorothy gave a little cry  what are you saying richard what are you saying  mrs manners i answered collecting myself i must tell you that i believe it is grafton carvel himself that is responsible for my abduction he meant that i should be murdered  then dorothy rose her eyes flashing and her head high  he would have murdered youyou richard she cried in such a storm of anger as i had never seen her oh he should hang for the thought of it i have always suspected grafton carvel capable of any crime  hush dorothy said her mother it is not seemly for a young girl to talk so  seemly said dorothy if i were a man i would bring him to justice and it took me a lifetime nay if i were a man and could use a sword  dorothy dorothy interrupted mrs manners  dorothy sat down the light lingering in her eyes she had revealed more of herself in that instant than in all her life before  it is a grave charge richard said mrs manners at length and your uncle is a man of the best standing in annapolis  you must remember his behaviour before my mothers marriage mrs manners  i do i do richard she said sadly and i have never trusted him since i suppose you are not making your accusation without cause  i have cause enough i answered bitterly  and proof she added she should have been the man in her family  i told her how harvey had overheard the bits of the plot at carvel hall near two years gone and now that i had begun i was going through with mr allens part in the conspiracy when dorothy startled us both by crying  oh there is so much wickedness in the world i wish i had never been born  she flung herself from the room in a passion of tears to shock me as if in answer to my troubled look mrs manners said with a sigh  she has not been at all well lately richard i fear the gayety of this place is too much for her indeed i am sorry we ever left maryland  i was greatly disturbed and thought involuntarily of comyns words could it be that mr manners was forcing her to marry chartersea  and has mr lloyd said nothing of my uncle i asked after a while  i will not deny that ugly rumours are afloat she answered grafton as you know is not liked in annapolis especially by the patriot party but there is not the slightest ground for suspicion the messenger  yes  your uncle denies all knowledge of he was taken to be the tool of the captain of the slaver and he disappeared so completely that it was supposed he had escaped to the ship the story goes that you were seized for a ransom and killed in the struggle your black ran all the way to town crying the news to those he met on the circle and in west street but by the mercy of god he was stopped by mr swain and some others before he had reached your grandfather in ten minutes a score of men were galloping out of the town gate mr lloyd and mr singleton ahead they found your horse dead and the road through the woods all trampled down and they spurred after the tracks down to the waters edge singleton recalled a slaver the crew of which had been brawling at the ship tavern a few nights before but the storm was so thick they could not see the ships length out into the river they started two fast sloops from the town wharves in chase and your uncle has been moving heaven and earth to obtain some clew of you he has put notices in the newspapers of charlestown philadelphia new york and even boston and offered a thousand pounds reward     chapter xxix i meet a very great young man  the french clock had struck four and i was beginning to fear that despite my note the captains pride forbade his coming to mr mannerss house when in he walked as tho twere no novelty to have his name announced and so straight and handsome was he his dark eye flashing with the selfconfidence born in the man that the look of uneasiness i had detected upon mrs mannerss face quickly changed to one of surprise and pleasure of course the good lady had anticipated a seacaptain of a far different mould he kissed her hand with a respectful grace and then her daughters for dorothy had come back to us calmer and i was filled with joy over his fine appearance even dorothy was struck by the change the clothes had made in him mrs manners thanked him very tactfully for restoring me to them as she was pleased to put it to which john paul modestly replied that he had done no more than another would under the same circumstances and he soon had them both charmed by his address  why richard said dorothys mother aside to me surely this cannot be your seacaptain  i nodded merrily but john pauls greatest triumph was yet to come for presently mr marmaduke arrived from whites and when he had greeted me with effusion he levelled his glass at the corner of the room  ahem he exclaimed pray my dear whom have you invited today and without awaiting her reply as was frequently his habit he turned to me and said i had hoped we were to have the pleasure of captain pauls company richard for i must have the chance before you go of clasping the hand of your benefactor  you shall have the chance at least sir i replied a fiery exultation in my breast mr manners this is my friend captain paul  the captain stood up and bowed gravely at the little gentlemans blankly amazed countenance  ahem said he dear me is it possible and advanced a step but the captain remained immovable mr marmaduke fumbled for his snuffbox failed to find it halted and began again for he never was known to lack words for long captain as one of the oldest friends of mr lionel carvel i claim the right to thank you in his name for your gallant conduct i hear that you are soon to see him and to receive his obligations from him in person you will not find him lacking sir ill warrant  such was mr marmadukes feline ingenuity i had a retort ready and i saw that mrs manners long tried in such occasions was about to pour oil on the waters but it was dorothy who exclaimed  what captain are you too going to maryland  john paul reddened  ay that he is dolly i cut in hurriedly did you imagine i would let him escape so easily henceforth as he has said he is to be an american  she flashed at me such a look as might have had a dozen different meanings and in a trice it was gone again under her dark lashes  dinner was got through i know not how mr manners led the talk and spoke more than was needful concerning our approaching voyage he was at great pains to recommend the virginia packet which had made the fastest passage from the capes and she sailed as was no doubt most convenient the saturday following i should find her a comfortable vessel and he would oblige me with a letter to captain alsop did captain paul know him but the captain was describing west indian life to mrs manners dorothy had little to say and as for me i was in no very pleasant humour  i gave a deaf ear to mr marmadukes sallies to speculate on the nature of the disgrace which chartersea was said to hold over his head and twenty times as i looked upon dollys beauty i ground my teeth at the notion of returning home i have ever been slow of suspicion but suddenly it struck me sharply that mr mannerss tactics must have a deeper significance than i had thought why was it that he feared my presence in london  as we made our way back to the drawingroom i was hoping for a talk with dolly alas i should not have many more when i heard a voice which sounded strangely familiar  you know comyn it was saying you know i should be at the princesss were i not so completely worn out i was up near all of last night with rosette  mr marmaduke entering before us cried  the dear creature i trust you have had medical attendance mr walpole  egad quoth horry for it was he i sent favre to hampstead to fetch dr pratt where he was attending some mercers wife it seems that rosette had got into the street and eaten something horrible out of the kennel i discharged the footman of course  a plague on your dog horry said my lord yawning and was about to add something worse when he caught sight of dorothy  mr walpole bowed over her hand  and have you forgotten so soon your windsor acquaintances mr walpole she asked laughing  bless me said horry looking very hard at me so it is so it is your hand mr carvel you have only to remain in london sir to discover that your reputation is readymade i contributed my mite for you must know that i am a sort of circulating library of odd news which those devils the printers contrive to get sooner or laterheaven knows how and miss manners herself has completed your fame yes the story of your gallant rescue is in all the clubs today egad sir you come down heads up like a loaded coin you will soon be a factor in change alley and glancing slyly at the blushing dolly he continued  i have been many things miss manners but never before an instrument of providence and so you discovered your rough diamond yesterday and have polished him in a day o that dr franklin had profited as well by our london tailors the rogue never told me when he was ordering me about in his swanskin that he had a friend in arlington street and a reigning beauty but i like him the better for it  and i the worse said dolly  i perceive that he still retains his bodyguard said mr walpole captain  paul said dolly seeing that we would not help him out  ah yes these young princes from the new world must have their suites you must bring them both some day to my little castle at strawberry hill  unfortunately mr walpole mr carvel finds that he must return to america mr marmaduke interjected he had been waiting to get in this word  comyn nudged me and i took the opportunity in the awkward silence that followed to thank mr walpole for sending his coach after us  and pray where did you get your learning he demanded abruptly of the captain in his most patronizing way your talents are wasted at sea sir you should try your fortune in london where you shall be under my protection sir they shall not accuse me again of stifling young genius stay he cried warming with generous enthusiasm stay i have an opening twas but yesterday lady cretherton told me that she stood in need of a tutor for her youngest son and you shall have the position  pardon me sir but i shall not have the position said john paul coolly and horry might have heeded the danger signal i had seen it more than once on board the brigantine john and knew what was coming  faith and why not sir if i recommend you why not sir  because i shall not take it he said i have my profession mr walpole and it is an honourable one and i would not exchange it sir were it in your power to make me a gibbon or a hume or tutor to his royal highness which it is not  thus for the second time the weapon of the renowned master of strawberry was knocked from his hand at a single stroke of his strange adversary i should like to describe john paul as he made that speechfor twas not so much the speech as the atmosphere of it those who heard and saw were stirred with wonder for destiny lay bare that instant just as the powers above are sometimes revealed at a single lightningbolt mr walpole made a reply that strove hard to be indifferent mr marmaduke stuttered for he was frightened as little souls are apt to be at such times but my lord comyn forever natural forever generous cried out heartily  egad captain there you are a true sailor which would you rather have been i say william shakespeare or sir francis  which would you rather be richard said dolly to me under her breath horace walpole or captain john paul i begin to like your captain better  willy nilly mr walpole was forever doing me a service now in order to ignore the captain more completely he sat him down to engage mr and mrs manners comyn was soon hot in an argument with john paul concerning the seagoing qualities of a certain frigate every rope and spar of which they seemed to know and so i stole a few moments with dorothy  you are going to take the captain to maryland richard she asked playing with her fan  i intend to get him the belle of the tye tis the least i can do for i am at my wits end how to reward him dolly and when are you coming back i whispered earnestly seeing her silent  i would that i knew richard she replied with a certain sadness that went to my heart as tho the choice lay beyond her then she changed richard there was more in mr lloyds letter than mamma told you of there was ill news of one of your friends  news  she looked at me fixedly and then continued her voice so low that i was forced to bend over  yes you were not told that patty swain fell in a faint when she heard of your disappearance you were not told that the girl was ill for a week afterwards ah richard i fear you are a sad flirt nay you may benefit by the doubtperchance you are going home to be married  you may be sure that this intelligence from dorothys lips only increased my trouble and perplexity  you say that patty has been ill  very ill says she with her lips tight closed  indeed i grieve to hear of it i replied but i cannot think that my accident had anything to do with the matter  young ladies do not send their fathers to coffeehouses to prevent duels unless their feelings are engaged she flung back  you have heard the story of that affair dorothy at least enough of it to do me justice  she was plainly agitated  has lord comyn  lord comyn has told you the truth i said so much i know  alas for the exits and entrances of life here comes the footman  mr fox said he rolling the name for it was a great one  confound mr fox he might have waited five short minutes  it was in truth none other than that precocious marvel of england who but a year before had taken the breath from the house of commons and had sent his fame flying over the channel and across the wide atlantic the talk of london who set the fashions cringed not before white hairs or royalty or customs or institutions and was now at one and twenty junior lord of the admiraltycharles james fox his face was dark forbidding even harshuntil he smiled his eyebrows were heavy and shaggy and his features of a rounded almost jewish mould he put me in mind of the stuarts and i was soon to learn that he was descended from them  as he entered the room i recall remarking that he was possessed of the supremest confidence of any man i had ever met mrs manners he greeted in one way mr marmaduke in another and mr walpole in still another to comyn it was hello jack as he walked by him each as it were had been tagged with a particular value  chagrined as i was at the interruption i was struck with admiration for the smallest actions of these rare men of master passions so compel us he came to dorothy whom he seemed not to have perceived at first and there passed between them such a look of complete understanding that i suddenly remembered comyns speech of the night before now it is charles fox here indeed was the man who might have won her and yet i did not hate him nay i loved him from the first time he addressed me it was dorothy who introduced us  i think i have heard of you mr carvel he said making a barely perceptible wink at comyn  and i think i have heard of you mr fox i replied  the deuce you have mr carvel said he and laughed and comyn laughed and dorothy laughed and i laughed we were friends from that moment  richard has appeared amongst us like a comet put in the ubiquitous mr manners and i fear intends to disappear in like manner  and where is the tail of this comet demanded fox instantly for i understood there was a tail  john paul was brought up and the junior lord of the admiralty looked him over from head to toe and what my dears do you think he said to him  have you ever acted captain paul  the captain started back in surprise  acted he exclaimed really sir i do not know i have never been upon the boards  mr fox vowed that he could act that he was sure of it from the captains appearance  and i too am sure of it mr fox cried dorothy clapping her hands persuade him to stay awhile in london that you may have him at your next theatricals at holland house why he knows shakespeare and pope andand chaucer by heart and ovid and horaceis it not so mr walpole  is not what so my dear young lady asked mr walpole pretending not to have heard  there exclaimed dolly pouting when the laughter had subsided you make believe to care something about me and yet will not listen to what i say  i had seen at her feet our own maryland gallants the longest of whose reputations stretched barely from the james to the schuylkill but here in london men were hanging on her words whose names were familiarly spoken in paris and rome and geneva not a topic was broached by mr walpole or mr fox from the remonstrance of the archbishop against masquerades and the coming marriage of my lord albemarle to the rights and wrongs of mr wilkes but my lady had her say mrs manners seemed more than content that she should play the hostess which she did to perfection she contrived to throw poisoned darts at the owner of strawberry that started little mr marmaduke to fidgeting in his seat and he came to the rescue with all the towntalk at his command he knew little else could mr walpole tell him of this club of both sexes just started at almacks mr walpole could tell a deal tho he took the pains first to explain that he was becoming too old for such frivolous and fashionable society he could not for the life of him say why he was included but in spite of mr walpole john paul was led out in the paces that best suited him and finally to the undisguised delight of mr fox managed to trip horry upon an obscure point in athenian literature and this broke up the company  as we took our leave dorothy and mr fox were talking together with lowered voices  i shall see you before i go i said to her  she laughed and glanced at mr fox  you are not going richard carvel said she  that you are not richard carvel said mr fox  i smiled rather lamely i fear and said good night     chapter xxx a conspiracy  banks where is the captain i asked as i entered the parlour the next morning  gone sir since seven oclock was the reply gone i exclaimed gone where  faith i did not ask his honour sir  i thought it strange but reflected that john paul was given to whims having so little time before him he had probably gone to see the sights he had missed yesterday the pantheon which was building an account of which had appeared in all the colonial papers or the new blackfriars bridge or the tower or perhaps to see his majesty ride out the wonders of london might go hang for all i cared who would gaze at the king when he might look upon dorothy i sighed i bade banks dress me in the new suit davenport had brought that morning and then sent him off to seek the shipping agent of the virginia packet to get us a cabin i would go to arlington street as soon as propriety admitted  but i had scarce finished my chocolate and begun to smoke in a pleasant revery when i was startled by the arrival of two gentlemen one was comyn and the other none less than mr charles fox  now where the devil has your captain flown to said my lord tossing his whip on the table  i believe he must be sightseeing i said i dare swear he has taken a hackney coach to the tower  to see the liberation of the idol of the people ill lay ten guineas but they say the great mr wilkes is to come out quietly and wishes no demonstration said mr fox i believe the beggar has some sense if thegreekwould only let him have his way so your captain is a wilkite mr carvel he demanded  i fear you run very fast to conclusions mr fox i answered laughing tho i thought his guess was not far from wrong  ill lay you the ten guineas he has been to the tower said mr fox promptly  done sir said i  hark ye richard said comyn stretching himself in an armchair we are come to take the wind out of your sails and leave you without an excuse for going home and we want your captain alive or dead charles here is to give him a commission in his majestys navy  then i knew why dorothy had laughed when i had spoken of seeing her again comynbless himhad told her of his little scheme  egad charles cried his lordship to look at his glum face one might think we were a couple of jews who had cornered him  alas for the perversity of the heart instead of leaping for joy as no doubt they had both confidently expected i was both troubled and perplexed by this unlookedfor news oak when bent is even harder to bend back again and so it has ever been with me i had determined after a bitter struggle to go to maryland and had now become used to that prospect i was anxious to see my grandfather and to confront grafton carvel with his villany and there was john paul what would he think  what ails you richard comyn demanded somewhat testily  nothing jack i replied i thank you from my heart and you mr fox i know that commissions are not to be had for the asking and i rejoice with the captain over his good fortune but gentlemen i said soberly i had most selfishly hoped that i might be able to do a service to john paul in return for his charity to me you offer him something nearer his deserts something beyond my power to give him  foxs eyes kindled  you speak like a man mr carvel said he but you are too modest damn it sir dont you see that it is you and no one else who has procured this commission had i not been taken with you sir i should scarce have promised it to your friend comyn through whose interest you obtain it for your protege  i remembered what mr foxs enemies said of him and smiled at the plausible twist he had given the facts  no i said no mr fox never that the captain must not think that i wish to be rid of him i will not stand in the way though if it is to be offered him he must comprehend that i had naught to do with the matter but sir i continued curiously what do you know of john pauls abilities as an officer  mr fox and comyn laughed so immoderately as to bring the blood to my face  damme cried the junior lord but you americans have odd consciences do you suppose rigby was appointed paymaster of the forces because of his fitness why was north himself made prime minister for his abilities and he broke down again ask jack here how he got into the service and how much seamanship he knows  faith answered jack unblushingly admiral lord comyn my father wished me to serve awhile and so i have taken two cruises delivered some score of commands and scarce know a supple jack from a can of flip cursed if i see the fun of it in these piping times o peace so i have given it up richard for charles says this falkland business with spain will blow out of the touchhole  i could see little to laugh over for the very rottenness of the service was due to the miserable and servile ministry and parliament of his majesty by means of which instruments he was forcing the colonies to the wall verily that was a time when the greatness of england hung in the balance how little i suspected that the young man then seated beside me who had cast so unthinkingly his mighty powers on the side of corruption was to be one of the chief instruments of her salvation we were to fight george the third across the seas he was to wage no less courageous a battle at home in the kings own capital and the cause yes the cause was to be the same as that of the mr wilkes he reviled who obtained his liberty that day  at length john paul came in calling my name he broke off abruptly at sight of the visitors  now we shall decide said mr fox captain i have bet mr carvel ten guineas you have been to the tower to see squinting jack john wilkes get his liberty at last  the captain looked astonished  anan then you have lost richard said he for i have been just there  and helped no doubt to carry off the champion on your shoulders said mr fox sarcastically as i paid the debt  mr wilkes knows full well the value of moderation sir replied the captain in the same tone  well damn the odds exclaimed the junior lord laughing you may have the magic number tattooed all over your back for all i care you shall have the commission  the commission  yes said fox carelessly i intend making you a lieutenant sir in the royal navy  the moment the words were out i was atremble as to how he would take the offer for he had a certain puzzling pride which flew hither and thither but there was surely no comparison between the situations of the master of the belle of the wye and an officer in the royal navy there his talents would make him an admiral and doubtless give him the social position he secretly coveted he confounded us all by his answer  i thank you mr fox but i cannot accept your kindness  slife said fox you refuse and you know what you are doing  i know usually sir  comyn swore my exclamation had something of relief in it  captain i said i felt that i could not stand in the way of this it has been my hope that you will come with me and i have sent this morning after a cabin on the virginia you must know that mr foxs offer is his own and lord comyns  i know it well richard i have not lived these three months with you for nothing his voice seemed to fail him he drew near me and took my hand but did you think i would require of you the sacrifice of leaving london now  it is my pleasure as well as my duty captain  no he said i am not like that yesterday i went to the city to see a shipowner whose acquaintance i made when he was a master in the west india trade he has had some reason to know that i can handle a ship never mind what and he has given me the bark betsy whose former master is lately dead of the smallpox richard i sail tomorrow   in dorothys coach to whitehall stairs by the grim old palace out of whose window charles the martyr had walked to his death for dorothy had vowed it was her pleasure to see john paul off and who could stand in her way surely not mr marmaduke and mrs manners laughingly acquiesced our spirits were such that we might have been some honest mercers apprentice and his sweetheart away for an outing  if we should take a wherry richard said dolly who would know of it i have longed to be in a wherry ever since i came to london  the river was smiling as she tripped gayly down to the water and the redcoated watermen were smiling too and nudging one another but little cared we dolly in holiday humour stopped for naught boat your honour boat boat to rotherhitheredriff two and six apiece sir for that intricate puzzle called human nature was solved out of hand by the thames watermen here was a young gentleman who never heard of the lord mayors scale of charges and what was a shilling to such as he intricate puzzle indeed any booby might have read upon the young mans face that secret which is written for allhigh and low rich and poor alike  my new lace handkerchief was down upon the seat lest dolly soil her bright pink lutestring she should have worn nothing else but the hue of roses how the bargemen stared and the passengers craned their necks and the longshoremen stopped their work as we shot past them on her account a barrister on the temple stairs was near to letting fall his bag in the water a lady in a wherry where were the whims of the quality to lead them next past the tall watertower and york stairs the idlers under the straight row of trees leaning over the high river wall past adelphi terrace where the great garrick lived past the white columns of somerset house with its courts and fountains and alleys and architecture of all ages and its river gate where many a gilded royal barge had lain and many a fine ambassador had arrived in state over the great highway of england past the ancient trees in the temple gardens and then under the new blackfriars bridge to southwark dingy with its docks and breweries and huddled houses but forever famousthe southwark of shakespeare and jonson and beaumont and fletcher and the shelf upon which they stood in the library at carvel hall was before my eyes  yes said dolly and i recall your mothers name written in faded ink upon the flyleaves  ah london town by what subtleties are you tied to the hearts of those born across the sea that is one of the mysteries of race  under the pointed arches of old london bridge with its hooded shelters for the weary to where the massive tower had frowned for ages upon the foolish river and then the forest of ships and the officious throng of little wherries and lighters that pressed around them seeming to say you clumsy giants how helpless would you be without us soon our own wherry was dodging among them ships brought hither by the four winds of the seas many discharging in the stream some in the docks then beginning to be built and hugging the huge warehouses hides from frozen russia were piled high beside barrels of sugar and rum from the moist island canefields of the indies and pipes of wine from the sunny hillsides of france and big boxes of tea bearing the hallmark of the mysterious east dolly gazed in wonder and i was commanded to show her a schooner like the black moll and a brigantine like the john  and captain paul told me you climbed the masts richard and worked like a common seaman tell me says she pointing at the royal yard of a tall east indiaman did you go as high as that when it was rough  and hugely to the boatmans delight the minx must needs put her fingers on the hard welts on my hands and vow she would be a sailor and she were a man but at length we came to a trimbuilt bark lying off redriff stairs with the words betsy of london painted across her stern in no time at all captain paul was down the gangway ladder and at the waterside too hand dorothy out  this honour overwhelms me miss manners he said but i know whom to thank for it and he glanced slyly at me  dorothy stepped aboard with the air of queen elizabeth come to inspect lord howards flagship  then you will thank me said she why i could eat my dinner off your deck captain are all merchantmen so clean  john paul smiled  not all miss manners he said  and you are still sailing at the ebb i asked  in an hour richard if the wind holds good  with what pride he showed us over his ship the sailors gaping at the fine young lady it had taken him just a day to institute his navy discipline and dolly went about exclaiming and asking an hundred questions and merrily catechising me upon the run of the ropes all was order and readiness for dropping down the stream when he led us into his cabin where he had a bottle of wine and some refreshments laid out against my coming  had i presumed to anticipate your visit miss manners i should have had something more suitable for a lady he said what you will not eat either richard  i could not so downcast had i become at the thought of parting i had sat up half the night before with him in restless argument and indecision and even when he had left for rotherhithe early that morning my mind had not been made my conscience had insisted that i should sail with john paul that i might never see my deaf grandfather on earth again i had gone to arlington street that morning resolved to say farewell to dorothy i will not recount the history of that defeat my dears nay to this day i know not how she accomplished the matter not once had she asked me to remain or referred to my going nor had i spoken of it weakling that i was she had come down in the pink lutestring smiling but pale and traces of tears in her eyes i thought from that moment i knew that i was defeated it was she herself who had proposed going with me to see the betsy sail  i will drink some madeira to wish you godspeed captain i said  what is the matter with you richard dolly cried you are as sour as my lord sandwich after a bad newmarket why captain said she i really believe he wants to go too the swain pines for his provincial beauty  poor john paul he had not yet learned that good society is seldom literal  upon my soul miss manners there you do him wrong he retorted with ludicrous heat you above all should know for whom he pines  he has misled you by praising me this richard despite his frank exterior is most secretive  there you have hit him miss manners he declared there you have hit him we were together night and day on the sea and on the road and while i poured out my life to him the rogue never once let fall a hint of the divine miss dorothy twas not till i got to london that i knew of her existence and then only by a chance you astonish me you speak of a young lady in maryland  dorothy swept aside my protest  captain says she gravely i leave you to judge what is your inference when he fights a duel about a miss with my lord comyn  a duel cried the captain astounded  miss manners persists in her view of the affair despite my word to the contrary i put in rather coldly  but a duel cried the captain again and with lord comyn miss manners i fondly thought i had discovered a constant man but you make me fear he has had as many flames as i and yet richard he added meaningly i should think shame on my conduct and i had had such a subject for constancy as you  dorothys armour was pierced and my illhumour broken down by this characteristic speech we both laughed greatly to his discomfiture  you had best go home with him richard said dolly i can find my way back to arlington street alone  nay gallantry forbids his going with me now answered john paul and i have my sailing orders but had i known of this i should never have wasted my breath in persuading him to remain  and did he stand in need of much persuasion captain asked dolly archly  time was pressing and the owner came aboard puffinga roundfaced vociferous jolly merchant who had no sooner got his breath than he lost it again upon catching sight of dolly  while the captain was giving the mate his final orders mr orchardson for such was his name regaled us with a part of his lifes history he had been a master himself and mangled and clipped king georges english as only a true master might  i like your own captain better than ever richard whispered dolly while mr orchardson relieved himself of his quid over the other side how commanding he is were i to take passage in the betsy i know i should be in love with him long before we got to norfolk  i took it upon myself to tell mr orchardson briefly and clearly as i could the lamentable story of john pauls last cruise for i feared it might sooner or later reach his ears from prejudiced mouths and i ended by relating how the captain had refused a commission in the navy because he had promised to take the betsy this appeared vastly to impress him and he forgot dorothys presence  passion o my eart mr carvel cried he excitedly  john pauls too big a man an too good a seaman to go into the navy without hinflooence if flag horfocers i roots of is booted haside to rankle like a lump o salt butter in a gallipot ow will a poor scotch lieutenant win hadvancement an he be not o the kings friends wilkes an liberty say i forever say i an wen i see im goin to the tower to beold the champion captain paul says i yere a man arfter my hown eart my heye sir didnt i see im wn a mere lad take the john into kingston arbour in the face o the worst gale i hever seed blowed in the caribbees an i says bill horchardson an ye never ave ships o yere own wich i ope will be yell know were to look for a marster an i tells im that same mr carvel i means no disrespect to the dead sir but an john paul ad discharged the betsy id not a been out twenty barrels or more this day by thames mudlarks an scuffle hunters eave me flat if ell be two blocks wi liquor an dischargin cargo an ye may rest heasy mr carvel ill not do wrong by im neither  he told me that if i would honour him in maid lane southwark i should have as many pounds as i liked of the best tobacco ever cured in cuba and so he left me to see that the mate had signed all his lighter bills shouting to the captain not to forget his cockets at gravesend dolly and i stood silent while the men hove short singing a jolly song to the step with a friendly wave the round figure of mr orchardson disappeared over the side and i knew that the time had come to say farewell i fumbled in my waistcoat for the repeater i had bought that morning over against temple bar in fleet street and i thrust it into john pauls hand as he came up  take this in remembrance of what you have suffered so unselfishly for my sake captain paul i said my voice breaking and whatever befalls you do not forget that carvel hall is your home as well as mine  he seemed as greatly affected as was i tears forced themselves to his eyes as he held the watch which he opened absently to read the simple inscription i had put there  oh dickie lad he cried ill be missing ye sair three hours hence and thinking of ye for months to come in the night watches but something tells me ill see ye again  and he took me in his arms embracing me with such fervour that there was no doubting the sincerity of his feelings  miss dorothy said he when he was calmer i give ye richard for a leal and a true heart few men are born with the gift of keeping the affections warm despite absence and years and interest but have no fear of richard carvel  dorothy stood a little apart watching us her eyes that faraway blue of the deepening skies at twilight  indeed i have no fear of him captain she said gently then with a quick movement impulsive and womanly she unpinned a little gold brooch at her throat and gave it to him saying in token of my gratitude for bringing him back to us  john paul raised it to his lips  i shall treasure it miss manners as a memento of the greatest joy of my life and that has been gracefully taking her hand and mine the bringing you two together again  dorothy grew scarlet as she curtseyed as for me i could speak never a word he stepped over the side to hand her into the wherry and embraced me once again and as we rowed away he waved his hat in a last goodby from the taffrail then the betsy floated down the thames     chapter xxxi upstairs into the world  it will be difficult my dears without bulging this history out of all proportion to give you a just notion of the society into which i fell after john paul left london it was above all a gaming society from that prying and allpowerful god of chance none great or small escaped guineas were staked and won upon frugal king george and his beef and barleywater charles fox and his debts the intrigues of choiseul and the du barry and the sensational marriage of the due dorleans with madame de montesson for your macaroni knew his paris as well as his london lord march and his opera singer and even the doings of betty the applewoman of st jamess street and the beautiful barmaid of nandos in whom my lord thurlow was said to be interested all these and much more not to be repeated were duly set down in the bettingbooks at whites and brookss  then the luxury of the life was something to startle a provincial even tho he came as did i from one of the two most luxurious colonies of the thirteen annapolis might be said to be london on a small scalebut on a very small scale the historian of the future need look no farther than our houses if any remain to be satisfied that we had more than the necessities of existence the maryland aristocrat with his town place and his country place was indeed a parallel of the patrician at home he wore his english clothes drove and rode his english horses and his coaches were built in long acre his heavy silver service came from fleet street and his claret and champagne and lisbon and madeira were the best that could be bought or smuggled his sons were often educated at home at eton or westminster and oxford or cambridge so would i have been if circumstances had permitted so was james fotheringay the eldest of the family and later the dulany boys and half a dozen others i might mention and then our ladies tis but necessary to cite my aunt caroline as an extreme dame of fashion who had her french hairdresser piton  as was my aunt to the duchess of kingston so was annapolis to london to depict the life of mayfair and of st jamess street during a season about the year of grace 1770 demands a mightier pen than wields the writer of these simple memoirs  and who was responsible for all this luxury and laxity who but the great mr pitt then the earl of chatham whose wise policy had made britain the ruler of the world and rich beyond compare from all corners of the earth her wealth poured in upon her nabob and caribbee came from east and west to spend their money in the capital and fortunes near as great were acquired by the city merchants themselves one by one these were admitted within that charmed circle whose motto for ages had been no trade to leaven it with their gold and to keep the pacenay to set it the nobility and landed gentry were sore pressed as far back as good queen anne and farther their ancestors had gamed and tippled away the acres and now that john and william whose forebears had been good tenants for centuries were setting their faces to liverpool and birmingham and leeds their cottages were empty so lord and squire went to london to recuperate and to get their share of the game running st jamess street and st stephens became their preserves my lord wormed himself into a berth in the treasury robbed the country systematically for a dozen of years and sold the places and reversions under him to the highest bidder boroughs were to be had somewhat dearer than a pair of colours and my lord spent his spare timehe had plenty of itin fleecing the pigeons at whites and almacks here there was no honour even amongst thieves and young gentlemen were hurried through eton and oxford where they learned to drink and swear and to call a main as well as to play tennis and billiards and to write latin and were thrust into brookss before they knew the difference in value between a farthing and a banknote at nineteen they were hardened rake or accomplished men of the world or both dissipated noblemen of middle age like march and sandwich wits and beaus and fine gentlemen like selwyn and chesterfield and walpole were familiarly called by their first names by youngsters like fox and carlisle and comyn difference of age was no difference young lord carlisle was the intimate of mr selwyn born thirty years before him  and whilst i am speaking of intimacies that short one which sprang up between me and the renowned charles fox has always seemed the most unaccountable not on my part for i fell a victim to him at once pen and paper brush and canvas are wholly inadequate to describe the charm of the man when he desired to please his conversation and the expression of his face must have moved a temperament of stone itself none ever had more devoted friends or more ardent admirers they saw his faults which he laid bare before them but they settled his debts again and again vast sums which he lost at newmarket and at brookss and not many years after the time of which i now write lord carlisle was paying fifteen hundred a year on the sum he had loaned him cheerfully denying himself the pleasures of london as a consequence  it was mr fox who discovered for me my lodgings in dover street vowing that i could not be so out of fashion as to live at an inn the brief history of these rooms as given by him was this a young cub had owned them whose mamma had come up from berkshire on thursday beat him soundly on friday paid his debts on saturday and had taken him back on sunday to hunt with sir henry the rest of his life dorothy came one day with her mother and swept through my apartments commanded all the furniture to be moved about ordered me to get pictures for the walls and by one fell decree abolished all the ornaments before the landlady used as she was to the ways of quality had time to gasp  why richard says my lady you will be wanting no end of pretty things to take back to maryland when you go you shall come with me tomorrow to mr josiah wedgwoods to choose some of them  dorothy says her mother reprovingly  and he must have the chippendale table i saw yesterday at the exhibition and chairs to match and every bachelor should have a punch bowljosiah has such a beauty  but i am running far ahead among the notes with which my table was laden banks had found a scrawl this i made out with difficulty to convey that mr fox was not attending parliament that day if mr carvel would do him the honour of calling at his lodging over mackies italian warehouse in piccadilly at four oclock he would take great pleasure in introducing him at brookss club in those days twas far better for a young gentleman of any pretensions to remain at home than go to london and be denied that inner sanctuarythe younger club at almacks many the rich brewers son has embittered his life because it was not given him to see more than the front of the house from the far side of pall mall but to be taken there by charles fox was an honour falling to few i made sure that dolly was at the bottom of it  promptly at four i climbed the stairs and knocked at mr foxs door the swiss who opened it shook his head dubiously when i asked for his master and said he had not been at home that day  but i had an appointment to meet him i said thinking it very strange  the mans expression changed  an appointment sir ah sir then you are to step in here and to my vast astonishment he admitted me into a small room at one side of the entrance it was bare as poverty and furnished with benches and nothing more on one of these was seated a person with an unmistakable nose and an odour of st giless who sprang to his feet and then sat down again dejectedly i also sat down wondering what it could mean and debating whether to go or stay  exguse me your honour said the person but haf you seen mister fox  i said that i too was waiting for him whereat he cast at me a cunning look beyond my comprehension surely i thought a man of foxs inherited wealth and position could not be living in such a place before the truth and humour of the situation had dawned upon me i heard a ringing voice without swearing in most forcible english and the door was thrown open admitting a tall young gentleman as striking as i have ever seen he paid not the smallest attention to the jew who was bowing and muttering behind me  mr richard carvel said he with a merry twinkle in his eye  i bowed  gads life mr carvel im deuced sorry this should have happened will you come with me  exguse me your honour cried the other visitor  now what the plague aaron says he you wear out the stairs come tomorrow or the day after  ay tis always tomorrow with you fine gentlemen but i vill bring the bailiffs so help me  damn em says the tall young gentleman as he slammed the door and so shut off the wail damn em they worry charles to death if he would only stick to quinze and picquet and keep clear of the hounds he need never go near a broker     the hounds it appears were the gentlemen of sharp practices at    whites and almacksd c c  do you have jews in america mr carvel without waiting for an answer he led me through a parlour hung with pictures and bewilderingly furnished with french and italian things and japan and china ware and bronzes and cups and trophies my name is fitzpatrick mr carvelyours to command and charless i am his ally for offence and defence we went to school together he explained simply  his manner was so free and yet so dignified as to charm me completely for i heartily despised all that fustian trumpery of the age then came a voice from beyond calling  that you carvel damn that fellow eiffel and did he thrust you into the jerusalem chamber  the jerusalem chamber i exclaimed  where i keep my israelites said he but by gads life i think they are one and all descended from job and not father abraham at all he must have thought me cursed ascetic eh fitz did you find the benches hard i had em made hard as the devil but if they were of stone i vow the flock could find their own straw to sit on  curse it charles cut in mr fitzpatrick in some temper cant you be serious for once he would behave this way mr carvel if he were being shriven by the newgate ordinary before a last carting to tyburn charles charles it was aaron again and the dog is like to snap at last he is talking of bailiffs take my advice and settle with him hold cavendish off another fortnight and settle with him  mr foxs reply was partly a laugh and the rest of it is not to be printed he did not seem in the least to mind this wholesale disclosure of his somewhat awkward affairs and he continued to dress or to be dressed alternately swearing at his valet and talking to fitzpatrick and to me  you are both of a name said he let a man but be called richard and i seem to take to him i faith i like the hunchback king and believe our friend horry walpole is right in defending him despite davie hume i vow i shall like you mr carvel  i replied that i certainly hoped so  egad you come well enough recommended he said pulling on his breeches no eiffel cursed if i go en petit maitre today how does that strike you for a demi saison mr buckskin i wore three of em through the customs last year and marchs worked olive nightgown tucked under my greatcoat and near a dozen pairs of shirts and stockings and each of my servants had on near as much o lud we were amazinglike beefeaters or blower pigeons sorry you wont meet my brotherhe that will have the title hes out of town  going on in this discursory haphazard way while he dressed he made me feel much at home for the young dictatorso mr fitzpatrick informed me afterwardeither took to you or else he did not and stood upon no ceremony after he had chosen a coat with a small pattern and his feet had been thrust into the little red shoes with the high heels imported by him from france he sent for a hackneychaise and the three of us drove together to pall mall mr brooks was at the door and bowed from his hips as we entered  a dozen vin de graves brooks cries mr fox and ushers me into a dining room with high curtained windows and painted ceiling and chandeliers throwing a glitter of light there at a long table surrounded by powdered lackeys sat a bevy of wits mostly in blue and silver with point ruffles to match mr foxs costume they greeted my companions uproariously it was heres charles at last howdy charles hello richard and what have you there a new caribbee they made way for mr fox at the head of the table and he took the seat as though it were his right  this is mr richard carvel gentlemen of carvel hall in maryland  they stirred with interest when my name was called and most of them turned in their chairs to look at me i knew well the reason and felt my face grow hot although you may read much of the courtesy of that age there was a deal of brutal frankness among young men of fashion  egad charles is this he the beauty rescued from castle yard  a familiar voice relieved my embarrassment  give the devil his due bully you forget that i had a hand in that  faith jack comyn retorted the gentleman addressed youre already famous for clinging to her skirt  but cling to mine bully and well all enter the temple together but i bid you welcome richard said his lordship you come with two of the most delightful vagabonds in the world  mr fox introduced me in succession to colonel st john known in st jamess street as the baptist to my lord bolingbroke colonel st johns brother who was more familiarly called bully to mr fitzpatricks brother the earl of upper ossory who had come up to london so he said to see a little italian dance at the garden to gilly williams to sir charles bunbury who had married lady sarah lennox foxs cousin the beauty who had come so near to being queen of all england to mr storer who was at once a caribbee and a crichton to mr uvedale price these i remember but there are more that escape me most goodnaturedly they drank my health in charless vin de grave at four shillings the bottle and soon i was astonished to find myself launched upon the story of my adventures which they had besought me to tell them when i had done they pledged me again and beginning to feel at home i pledged them handsomely in return then the conversation began the like of it i have never heard anywhere else in the world there was a deal that might not be written here and a deal more that might to make these pages sparkle they went through the meetings of course and thrashed over the list of horses entered at ipswich and york and newmarket and how many were thought to be pulled then followed the recent gains and losses of each and every individual of the company after that there was a roar of merriment over mr storer cracking mottoes with a certain lady jane and how young lord stavordale on a wager tilted the candles and set fire to the drawingroom at lady julias drum the day before mr price told of the rage topham beauclerk had got dr johnson into by setting down a mark for each oyster the sage had eaten and showing him the count but mr fox who was the soul of the club had the best array of any he related how he had gone post from paris to lyons to order among other things an embroidered canary waistcoat for george selwyn from jabot  et quel dessin monsieur beetles and frogs in green escargots grenouilles he cries with a shriek et pour monsieur selwyn monsieur fox badine it came yesterday by crawford and i sent it to chesterfield street in time for george to wear to the duchesss he has been twice to piccadilly after me and twice here and swears he will have my heart and i believe he is now gone to matson in a funk  after that they fell upon politics i knew that mr fox was already near the head of the kings party and that he had just received a substantial reward at his majestys hands and i went not far to guess that every one of these easygoing devilmaycare macaronies was a follower or sympathizer with lord norths policy but what i heard was a revelation indeed i have dignified it by calling it politics all was frankness here amongst friends there was no attempt made to gloss over ugly transactions with a veneer of morality for this much i honoured them but irresistibly there came into my mind the grand and simple characters of our own public men in america and it made me shudder to think that while they strove honestly for our rights this was the type which opposed them motives of personal spite and of personal gain were laid bare and even the barter and sale of offices of trust took place before my very eyes i was silent though my tongue burned me until one of the gentlemen thinking me neglected said  what adeuce is to be done with those unruly countrymen of yours mr carvel are they likely to be pacified now that we have taken off all except the tea you who are of our party must lead a sorry life among them tell me do they really mean to go as far as rebellion  the blood rushed to my face  it is not a question of tea sir i answered hotly nor yet of tuppence it is a question of principle which means more to englishmen than life itself and we are englishmen  i believe i spoke louder than i intended for a silence followed my words fox glanced at comyn who of all of them at the table was not smiling and said  i thought you came of a loyalist family mr carvel  king george has no more loyal servants than the americans mr fox be they tory or whig and he has but to read our petitions to discover it i said  i spoke calmly but my heart was thumping with excitement and resentment the apprehension of the untried is apt to be sharp at such moments and i looked for them to turn their backs upon me for an impertinent provincial indeed i think they would have all save comyn had it not been for fox himself he lighted a pipe smiled and began easily quite dispassionately to address me  i wish you would favour us with your point of view mr carvel said he for upon my soul i know little about the subject  you know little about the subject and you in parliament  i cried  this started them all to laughing why i did not then understand but i was angry enough  come lets have it said he  they drew their chairs closer some wearing that smile of superiority which to us is the englishmans most maddening trait i did not stop to think twice or to remember that i was pitted against the greatest debater in all england i was to speak that of which i was full and the hearts argument needs no logic to defend it if it were my last word i would pronounce it  i began by telling them that the americans had paid their share of the french war in blood and money twice over and i had the figures in my memory mr fox interrupted for ten minutes at a space he spoke and in all my life i have never talked to a man who had the english of king jamess bible of shakespeare and milton so wholly at his command and his knowledge of history his classical citations confounded me i forgot myself in wondering how one who had lived so fast had acquired such learning afterward when i tried to recall what he said i laughed at his surprising ignorance of the question at issue and wondered where my wits could have gone that i allowed myself to be dazzled and turned aside at every corner as his speech came faster he twisted fact into fiction and fiction into fact until i must needs close my mind and bolt the shutters of it or he had betrayed me into confessing the right of parliament to quarter troops among us though my head swam i clung doggedly to my text and that was my salvation he grew more excited and they applauded him in truth i myself felt near to clapping and then as i stared him in the eye marvelling how a man of such vast power and ability could stand for such rotten practices the thought came to me i know not whence of saint paul the apostle  mr fox i said when he had paused before god do you believe what you are saying  i saw them smiling at my earnestness and simplicity fox seemed surprised and laughed evasivelynot heartily as was his wont  my dear mr carvel he said glancing around the circle political principles are not to be swallowed like religion but taken rather like medicine experimentally if they agree with you very good if not drop them and try others we are always ready to listen to remedies here  ay if they agree with you i exclaimed but food for one is poison for another do you know what you are doing you are pushing home injustice and tyranny to the millions for the benefit of the thousands for is it not true gentlemen that the great masses of england are against the measures you impose upon us their fight is our fight they are no longer represented in parliament we have never been taxation without representation is true of your rotten boroughs as well as of your vast colonies you are helping the king to crush freedom abroad in order that he may the more easily break it at home you are committing a crime  i tell you we would give up all we own were the glory or honour of england at stake and yet you call us rebels and accuse us of meanness and of parsimony if you wish money leave the matter to our colonial assemblies and see how readily you will get it but if you wish war persist in trying to grind the spirit from a people who have in them the pride of your own ancestors yes you are estranging the colonies gentlemen a greater man than i has warned you  and with that i rose believing that i had given them all mortal offence to my astonishment several got to their feet in front of me huzzaing and comyn and lord ossory grasped my hands and charles fox reached out over the corner of the table and pulled me back into my chair  bravo richard carvel he cried cursed if i dont love a man who will put up a fight against odds who will stand bluff to what he believes and wont be talked out of his boots we wont quarrel with any such here my buckskin i can tell you  and that is the simple story my dears of the beginning of my friendship with one who may rightly be called the saint paul of english politics he had yet some distance to go alas ere he was to begin that sturdy battle for the right for which his countrymen and ours will always bless him i gave him my hand with a better will than i had ever done anything and we pressed our fingers numb and his was not the only hand i clasped and honest jack comyn ordered more wine that they might drink to a speedy reconciliation with america  a pint bumper to richard carvel said mr fitzpatrick  i pledged brookss club in another pint upon which they swore that i was a good fellow and that if all american whigs were like me all cause of quarrel was at an end of this i was not so sure nor could i see that the question had been settled one way or another and that night i had reason to thank the reverend mr allen for the first and last time in my life that i could stand a deal of liquor and yet not roll bottom upward  the dinner was settled on the baptist who paid for it without a murmur and then we adjourned to the business of the evening the great drawingroom lighted by an hundred candles was filled with gayly dressed macaronies and the sound of their laughter and voices in contention mingled with the pounding of the packs on the mahogany and the rattle of the dice and the ring of the gold pieces the sight was dazzling and the noise distracting fox had me under his especial care and i was presented to young gentlemen who bore names that had been the boast of england through the centuries lands their forebears had won by lance and sword they were squandering away as fast as ever they could i too was known all had heard the romance of the beauty and castle yard and some had listened to horry walpole tell that foolish story of goble at windsor on which he seemed to set such store they guessed at my weight they betted upon it and they wished to know if i could spin mr brooks who was scraping his way from table to table they gave me choice of whist or picquet or quinze or hazard i was carried away nay i make no excuse tho the times were drinking and gaming ones i had been brought up that a gentleman should do both in moderation we mounted some dozen of us to the floor above and passed along to a room of which fox had the key and he swung me in on his arm the others pressing after and the door was scarce closed and locked again before they began stripping off their clothes  to my astonishment fox handed me a great frieze coat which he bade me don as the others were doing some were turning their coats inside out for luck said they and putting on footmans leather guards to save their ruffles and they gave me a hat with a high crown and a broad brim to save my eyes from the candle glare we were as grotesque a set as ever i laid my eyes upon but i hasten over the scene which has long become distasteful to me i mention it only to show to what heights of folly the young men had gone i recall a gasp when they told me they played for rouleaux of ten pounds each but i took out my pocketbook as boldly as tho i had never played for less and laid my stake upon the board fox lost again and again but he treated his illluck with such a raillery of contemptuous wit that we must needs laugh with him comyn too lost and at supper excused himself saying that he had promised his mother the dowager countess not to lose more than a quarters income at a sitting but i won and won until the fever of it got into my blood and as the first faint light of that morning crept into the empty streets we were still at it fox vowing that he never waked up until daylight that the best things he said in the house came to him at dawn     chapter xxxii lady tankervilles drummajor  the rising sun as he came through the little panes of the windows etched a picture of that room into my brain i can see the twisted candles with their wax smearing the sticks the chairs awry the tables littered with blackened pipes and bottles and spilled wine and tobacco among the dice and the few that were left of my companions some with dark lines under their eyes all pale but all gay unconcerned witty and cynical smoothing their ruffles and brushing the ashes and snuff from the pattern of their waistcoats as we went downstairs singing a song mr foote had put upon the stage that week they were good enough to declare that i should never be permitted to go back to maryland that my grandfather should buy me a certain borough which might be had for six thousand pounds  the drawingroom made a dismal scene too after the riot and disorder of the night sleepy servants were cleaning up but fox vowed that they should bring us yet another bottle before going home so down we sat about the famous old round table fox fingering the dents the gold had made in the board and philosophizing and reciting orlando furioso in the italian and herodotus in the original greek suddenly casting his eyes about they fell upon an ungainly form stretched on a lounge that made us all start  bully he cried ill lay you fifty guineas that mr carvel gets the beauty against chartersea  this roused me  nay mr fox i beg of you i protested with all the vehemence i could muster miss manners must not be writ down in such a way  for answer he snapped his fingers at the drowsy brooks who brought the betting book  there says he and there and there turning over the pages her name adorns a dozen leaves my fine buckskin and it will be well to have some truth about her enter the wager brooks  hold shouts bolingbroke i havent accepted  you may be sure i was in an agony over this desecration which i was so powerless to prevent but as i was thanking my stars that the matter had blown over with bolingbrokes rejection there occurred a most singular thing  the figure on the lounge with vast difficulty sat up to our amazement we beheld the bloated face of the duke of chartersea staring stupidly  damme bully you refushe bet like tha he said ill take doshen of emdoshen egad gimme the book brooksh cursh foxlay thousand dd provinshial never getsh eri know  i sat very still seized with a loathing beyond my power to describe to thick that this was the man mr manners was forcing her to marry fox laughed  help his grace to his coach he said to two of the footmen  kill fellow firsht cried his grace with his hand on his sword and instantly fell over and went sound asleep  his grace has sent his coach home your honour said one of the men respectfully the duke is very quarrelsome sir  put him in a chair then said charles  so they fearfully lifted his grace who was too far gone to resist and carried him to a chair and mr fox bribed the chairmen with two guineas apiece which he borrowed from me to set his grace down amongst the marketwomen at covent garden  the next morning banks found in my pockets something over seven hundred pounds more than i had had the day before  i rose late my head swimming with mains and nicks and combinations of all the numbers under the dozen debated whether or no i would go to arlington street and decided that i had not the courage comyn settled it by coming in his cabriolet proposed that we should get the air in the park dine at the cocoa tree and go afterwards to lady tankervilles drummajor where dolly would undoubtedly be  now you are here richard said his lordship with his accustomed bluntness and your seacaptain has relieved your quixotic conscience what the deuce do you intend to do  win a thousand pounds every night at brookss or improve your time and do your duty and get miss manners out of his graces clutches ill warrant something will come of that matter this morning  i hope so i said shortly  comyn looked at me sharply  would you fight him he asked  if he gave me the chance  his lordship whistled egad then said he i shall want to be there to see in spite of his puddingbag shape he handles the sword as well as any man in england i have crossed with him at angelos and he has a devilish tricky record richard  i said nothing to that  hope you dokill him comyn continued he deserves it richly but that will be a cursed unpleasant way of settling the businessunpleasant for you unpleasant for her and cursed unpleasant for him too i suppose cant you think of any other way of getting her ask charles to give you a plan of campaign you havent any sense and neither have i  hang you jack i have no hopes of getting her i replied for i was out of humour with myself that day in spite of what you say i know she doesnt care a brass farthing to marry me so lets drop that  comyn made a comic gesture of deprecation i went on but i am going to stay here and find out the truth though it may be a foolish undertaking and if he is intimidating mr manners  you may count on me and on charles said my lord generously and there are some others i know of gad you made a dozen of friends and admirers by what you said last night richard and his grace has a few enemies you will not lack support  we dined very comfortably at the cocoa tree where comyn had made an appointment for me with two as diverting gentlemen as had ever been my lot to meet my lord carlisle was the poet and scholar of the little clique which had been to eton with charles fox any member of which so twas said would have died for him his lordship be it remarked in passing was as lively a poet and scholar as can well be imagined he had been recently sobered so comyn confided which i afterwards discovered meant married charles foxs word for the same was fallen and i remembered that jack had told me it was to visit lady carlisle at castle howard that dorothy was going when she heard of my disappearance comyns other guest was mr topham beauclerk the macaroni friend of dr johnson he too had been recently married but appeared no more sobered than his lordship mr beauclerks wife by the way was the beautiful lady diana spencer who had been divorced from lord bolingbroke the bully i had met the night before these gentlemen seemed both well acquainted with miss manners and vowed that none but american beauties would ever be the fashion in london more then we all drove to lady tankervilles drummajor near chesterfield house  you will be wanting a word with her when she comes in said comyn slyly divining poor fellow i fear that i scarcely appreciated his feelings as to dorothy or the noble unselfishness of his friendship for me  we sat aside in a recess of the lower hall watching the throng as they passed haughty dowagers distorted in lead and disfigured in silk and feathers nodding at the ceiling accomplished beaus of threescore or more carefully mended for the night by their frenchmen at home young ladies in gay brocades with round skirts and stiff pearshaped bodices and youngsters just learning to ogle and to handle their snuffboxes one by one their names were sent up and solemnly mouthed by the footman on the landing at length when we had all but given her up dorothy arrived a hood of lavender silk heightened the oval of her face and out from under it crept rebellious wisps of her dark hair but she was very pale and i noticed for the first time a worn expression that gave me a twinge of uneasiness twas then i caught sight of the duke a surly stamp on his leaden features and after him danced mr manners dolly gave a little cry when she saw me  oh richard i am so glad you are here i was wondering what had become of you and comyn too whispering to me mamma has had a letter from mrs brice your grandfather has been to walk in the garden  and grafton  she said nothing of your uncle she replied with a little shudder at the name but wrote that mr carvel was said to be better so there your conscience need not trouble you for remaining i am sure he would wish you to pay a visit home  and i have to scold you sir you have not been to arlington street for three whole days  it struck me suddenly that her gayety was the same as that she had worn to my birthday party scarce a year agone  dolly you are not well i said anxiously  she flung her head saucily for answer in the meantime his grace talking coldly to comyn had been looking unutterable thunders at me i thought of him awaking in the dew at covent garden and could scarce keep from laughing in his face mr marmaduke squirmed to the front  morning richard he said with a marked cordiality have you met the duke of chartersea no your grace this is mr richard carvel his family are dear friends of ours in the colonies  to my great surprise the duke saluted me quite civilly but i had the feeling of facing a treacherous bull which would gore me as soon as ever my back was turned he was always putting me in mind of a bull with his short neck and heavy hunched shouldersand with the ugly tinge of red in the whites of his eyes  mr manners tells me you are to remain awhile in london mr carvel he said in his thick voice  i took his meaning instantly and replied in kind  yes your grace i have some business to attend to here  ah he answered then i shall see you again  probably sir said i  his lordship watched this thrust and parry with an illconcealed delight dorothys face was impassive expressionless as the duke turned to mount the stairs he stumbled clumsily across a young man coming to pay his respects to miss manners and his grace went sprawling against the wall  confound you sir he cried  for the ducal temper was no respecter of presences then a title was a title to those born lower and the young man plainly had a vast honour for a coronet  i beg your graces pardon said he  who the deuce is he demanded the duke petulantly of mr manners thereby setting the poor little man all atremble  why why he replied searching for his spyglass  for an instant dollys eyes shot scorn chartersea had clearly seen and heeded that signal before  the gentleman is a friend of mine she said  tho i were put out of the garden of eden as a consequence i itched to have it out with his grace then and there i knew that i was bound to come into collision with him sooner or later such indeed was my mission in london but dorothy led the way upstairs a spot of colour burning each of her cheeks the stream of guests had been arrested until the hall was packed and the curious were peering over the rail above  lord wasnt she superb exclaimed comyn exultingly as we followed in the drawingroom the buzzing about the card tables was hushed a moment as she went in but i soon lost sight of her thanks to comyn he drew me on from group to group and i was duly presented to a score of lady soandsos and honourable misses most of whom had titles but little else mammas searched their memories and suddenly discovered that they had heard their parents speak of my grandfather but as it was a fair presumption that most colonial gentlemen made a visit home at least once in their lives i did not allow the dust to get into my eyes i was invited to dinners and fairly showered with invitations to balls and drums and garden parties i was twitted about the beauty most often with only a thin coating of amiability covering the spite of the remark in short if my head had not been so heavily laden with other matters it might well have become light under the strain had i been ambitious to enter the arena i should have had but little trouble since eligibility then might be reduced to guineas and another element not moral i was the only heir of one of the richest men in the colony vouched for by the manners and taken up by mr fox and my lord comyn inquiries are not pushed farther i could not help seeing the hardness of it all or refrain from contrasting my situation with that of the penniless outcast i had been but a little time before the gilded rooms the hundred yellow candles multiplied by the mirrors the powder the perfume the jewelsall put me in mind of the poor devils i had left wasting away their lives in castle yard they too had had their times of prosperity their friends who had faded with the first waning of fortune some of them had known what it was to be fawned over and how many of these careless flitting men of fashion i looked upon could feel the ground firm beneath their feet or could say with certainty what a change of ministers or one wild night at whites or almacks would bring forth verily one must have seen the under side of life to know the upper  presently i was sought out by mr topham beauclerk who had heard of the episode below and wished to hear more he swore at the duke  he will be run through some day and serve him jolly right said he bet you twenty pounds charles fox does it his grace knows he has the courage to fight him  the courage i repeated  yes angelo says the duke has diabolical skill and then he wont fight fair he killed young atwater on a foul you know slipped on the wet grass and chartersea had him pinned before he caught his guard but there is lady di acalling acalling  do all the women cheat in america too asked topham as we approached  i thought of my aunt caroline and laughed  some i answered  they will game dn em said topham as tho he had never gamed in his life and they will cheat till a man has to close his eyes to keep from seeing their pretty hands and they will cry egad oh so touchingly if the luck goes against them in spite of it all only last week i had to forgive mrs farnham an hundred guineas she said shed lost her pinmoney twice over and was like to have wept her eyes out  thus primed in tophams frank terms i knew what to expect and i found to my amusement he had not overrun the truth i lost like a stoic saw nothing and discovered the straight road to popularity  the dear things expect us to make it up at the clubs whispered he  i discovered how he had fallen in love with his wife lady diana and pitied poor bolingbroke heartily for having lost her she was then in her primea beauty a wit and a great lady with a dash of the humanities about her that brought both men and women to her feet  you must come to see me mr carvel said she i wish to talk to you of dorothy  your ladyship believes me versed in no other subject i asked  none other worth the mention she replied instantly topham tells me you can talk horses and that mystery of mysteries american politics but look at miss manners dow ill warrant she is making sir charles see to his laurels and young stavordale is struck dumb  i looked up quickly and beheld dolly surrounded by a circle of admirers  mark the shot strike lady di continued between the deals that time chartersea went down i fancy he is bowled over rather often she said slyly what a brute it is and they say that that little woman she has for a father imagines a union with the duke will redound to his glory  they say remarked mrs meynel sitting next me that the duke has thumbscrews of some kind on mr manners  miss manners is able to take care of herself said topham  on dit that she has already refused as many dukes as did her grace of argyle said mrs meynel  i had lost track of the cards and knew i was losing prodigiously but my eyes went back again and again to the group by the doorway where dolly was holding court and dispensing justice and perchance injustice the circle increased ribands generals whose chests were covered with medals of valour french noblemen and foreign ambassadors stopped for a word with the beauty and passed on their way some smiling some reflecting to make room for others i overheard from the neighbouring tables a spiteful protest that a young upstart from the colonies should turn lady tankervilles drum into a levee my ears tingled as i listened but not a feathered parrot in the carping lot of them could deny that miss manners had beauty and wit enough to keep them all at bay hers was not an english beauty every line of her face and pose of her body proclaimed her of that noble type of maryland women distinctly american over which many englishmen before and since have lost their heads and hearts  egad exclaimed mr storer who was looking on shes already defeated some of the treasury bench and bless me if she isnt rating north himself  half the heads in the room were turned toward miss manners who was exchanging jokes with the prime minister of great britain i saw a corpulent man ludicrously like the kings pictures with bulging gray eyes that seemed to take in nothing and this was north upon whose conduct with the king depended the fate of our america goodnatured he was and his laziness was painfully apparent he had the reputation of going to sleep standing like a horse  but the beauty contrives to keep him awake said storer  if you stay among us mr carvel said topham she will get you a commissionership for the asking  look cried lady di there comes mr fox the precocious the irresistible were he in the bible we should read of him passing the time of day with king solomon  or instructing daniel in the art of liontaming put in mrs meynel  there was mr fox in truth and the beautys face lighted up at sight of him and presently when lord north had made his bow and passed on he was seen to lead her out of the room leaving her circle to go to pieces like an empire without a head     chapter xxxiii drury lane  after a night spent in making resolutions i set out for arlington street my heart beating a march as it had when i went thither on my arrival in london such was my excitement that i was near to being run over in piccadilly like many another country gentleman and roundly cursed by a wagoner for my stupidity i had a hollow bigness within me half of joy half of pain that sent me onward with ever increasing steps and a whirling storm of contradictions in my head now it was dolly loved me in spite of all the great men in england why otherwise had she come to the sponginghouse berating myself had her affection been other than that of a lifelong friendship she would not have come an inch but why had she made me stay in london why had she spoken so to comyn what interpretation might be put upon a score of little acts of hers that came aflooding to mind each a sacred treasure of memory a lovers interpretation forsooth fie richard what presumption to think that you a raw lad should have a chance in such a field you have yet by dint of hard knocks and buffets to learn the world  by this i had come in sight of her house and suddenly i trembled like a green horse before a cannon my courage ran out so fast that i was soon left without any and my legs had carried me as far as st jamess church before i could bring them up then i was sure for the first time that she did not love me in front of the church i halted reflecting that i had not remained in england with any hope of it but rather to discover the truth about charterseas actions and to save her if it were possible i turned back once more and now got as far as the knocker and lifted it as a belfry was striking the hour of noon i think i would have fled again had not the door been immediately opened  once more i found myself in the room looking out over the park the french windows open to the balcony the sunlight flowing in with the springscented air on the table was lying a little leather book stamped with goldher prayerbook well i remembered it i opened it to read dorothy from her mother annapolis christmas 1768 the sweet vista of the past stretched before my eyes i saw her on such a mayday as this walking to st annes under the grand old trees their budding leaves casting a delicate tracery at her feet i followed her up the aisle until she disappeared in the high pew and then i sat beside my grandfather and thought of her nor listened to a word of mr allens sermon why had they ever taken her to london  when she came in i sought her face anxiously she was still pale and i thought despite her smile that a trace of sadness lingered in her eyes  at last sir you have come she said severely sit down and give an account of yourself at once you have been behaving very badly  dorothy  pray dont dorothy me sir but explain where you have been for this week past  but dolly  you pretend to have some affection for your old playmate but you do not trouble yourself to come to see her  indeed you do me wrong  do you wrong you prefer to gallivant about town with comyn and charles fox and with all those wild gentlemen who go to brookss nay i have heard of your goingson i shall write to mr carvel today and advise him to send for you and tell him that you won a thousand pounds in one night  it was only seven hundred i interrupted sheepishly i thought she smiled faintly  and will probably lose twenty thousand before you have done and i shall say to him that you have dared to make bold rebel speeches to a lord of the admiralty and to some of the kings supporters i shall tell your grandfather you are disgracing him  rebel speeches i cried  yes rebel speeches at almacks who ever heard of such a thing no doubt i shall hear next of your going to a drawingroom and instructing his majesty how to subdue the colonies and then sir you will be sent to the tower and i shant move a finger to get you out  who told you of this dolly i demanded  mr fox himself for one he thought it so goodor so badthat he took me aside last night at lady tankervilles asked me why i had let you out of castle yard and told me i must manage to curb your tongue i replied that i had about as much influence with you as i have with dr franklin  i laughed  i saw fox lead you off i said  oh you did did you she retorted but you never once came near me yourself save when i chanced to meet you in the hall tho i was there a full three hours  how could i i exclaimed you were surrounded by prime ministers and ambassadors and heaven knows how many other great people  when you wish to do anything richard you usually find a way  nay i answered despairing i can never explain anything to you dolly your tongue is too quick for mine  why didnt you go home with your captain she asked mockingly  do you know why i stayed  i suppose because you want to be a gay spark and taste of the pleasures of london that is what you men are pleased to call pleasures i can think of no other season  there is another i said desperately  ah said dolly and in her old aggravating way she got up and stood in the window looking out over the park i rose and stood beside her my very temples throbbing  we have no such springs at home she said but oh i wish i were at wilmot house today  there is another reason i repeated my voice sounded far away like that of another i saw the colour come into her cheeks again slowly the southwest wind with a whiff of the channel salt in it blew the curtains at our backs  you have a conscience richard she said gently without turning so few of us have  i was surprised nor did i know what to make of that there were so many meanings  you are wild she continued and impulsive as they say your father was but he was a man i should have honoured he stood firm beside his friends he made his enemies fear him all strong men must have enemies i suppose they must make them  i looked at her troubled puzzled but burning at her praise of captain jack  dolly i cried you are not well why wont you come back to maryland  she did not reply to that then she faced me suddenly  richard i know now why you insisted upon going back it was because you would not desert your seacaptain comyn and mr fox have told me and they admire you for it as much as i  what language is worthy to describe her as she was then in that pose with her head high as she was wont to ride over the field after the hounds hers was in truth no beauty of stone but the beauty of forceof life itself  dorothy i cried dorothy i stayed because i love you there i have said it again what has not passed my lips since we were children what has been in my heart ever since  i stopped awed for she had stepped back out on the balcony she hid her head in her hands and i saw her breast shaken as with sobs i waited what seemed a daya year then she raised her face and looked at me through the tears shining in her eyes  richard she said sadly why why did you ever tell me why can we not always be playmates  the words i tried to say choked me i could not speak for sorrow for very bitterness and yet i might have known i dared not look at her again  dear richard i heard her say god alone understands how it hurts me to give you pain had i only foreseen  had you only foreseen i said quickly  i should never have let you speak  her words came steadily but painfully and when i raised my eyes she met them bravely  you must have seen i cried these years i have loved you nor could i have hidden it if i had wished but i have littleto offer you i went on cruelly for i knew not what i said you who may have english lands and titles for the consenting i was a fool  her tears started again and at sight of them i was seized with such remorse that i could have bitten my tongue in two  forgive me dorothy if you can i implored i did not mean it nor did i presume to think you loved me i have adoredi shall be content to adore from far below and i stayedi stayed that i might save you if a danger threatened  danger she exclaimed catching her breath  i will come to the point i said i stayed to save you from the duke of chartersea  she grasped the balcony rail and i think would have fallen but for my arm then she straightened and only the quiver of her lip marked the effort  to save me from the duke of chartersea she said so coldly that my conviction was shaken explain yourself sir  you cannot love him i cried amazed  she flashed upon me a glance i shall never forget  richard carvel she said you have gone too far though you have been my friend all my life there are some things which even you cannot say to me  and she left me abruptly and went into the house her head flung back and i followed in a tumult of mortification and wounded pride in such a state of dejection that i wished i had never been born but hers was a nature of surprises and impulsive like my own beside the cabinet she turned calm again all trace of anger vanished from her face drawing a hawthorn sprig from a porcelain vase i had given her she put it in my hand  let us forget this richard said she we have both been very foolish  forget indeed unless heaven had robbed me of reason had torn the past from me at a single stroke i could not have forgotten when i reached my lodgings i sent the anxious banks about his business and threw myself in a great chair before the window the chair she had chosen strange to say i had no sensation save numbness the time must have been about two of the clock i took no account of it i recall banks coming timidly back with the news that two gentlemen had called i bade him send them away would my honour not have mrs marble cook my dinner and be dressed for lady pembrokes ball i sent him off again harshly  after a long while the slamming of a coach door roused me and i was straightway seized with such an agony of mind that i could have cried aloud twas like the pain of blood flowing back into a frozen limb darkness was fast gathering as i reached the street and began to walk madly word by word i rehearsed the scene in the drawingroom over the park but i could not think calmly for the pain of it little by little i probed writhing until far back in my boyhood i was tearing at the dead roots of that cherished plant which was the hope of her love it had grown with my own life and now with its death today i felt that i had lost all that was dear to me then in the midst of this abject selfpity i was stricken with shame i thought of comyn who had borne the same misfortune as a man should had his pain been the less because he had not loved her from childhood like comyn i resolved to labour for her happiness  what hour of the night it was i know not when a man touched me on the shoulder and i came to myself with a start i was in a narrow street lined by hideous houses their windows glaring with light each seemed a skull with rays darting from its grinning eyeholes within i caught glimpses of debauchery that turned me sick ten paces away three women and a man were brawling the low angry tones of his voice mingling with the screeches of their billingsgate muffled figures were passing and repassing unconcernedly some entering the houses others coming out and a handsome coach without arms and with a footman in plain livery lumbered along and stopped farther on all this i remarked before i took notice of him who had intercepted me and demanded what he wanted  hey bill he cried with an oath to a man who stood on the steps opposite eres a soft un as has put is gill in  the man responded and behind him came two more of the same feather and suddenly i found myself surrounded by an illsmelling crowd of flashy men and tawdry women they jostled me and i reached for my sword to make the discovery that i had forgotten it regaining my full senses i struck the man nearest me a blow that sent him sprawling in the dirt a blade gleamed under the sickly light of the fishoil lamp overhead but a man crashed through from behind and caught the ruffians swordarm and flung him back in the kennel  the watch he cried the watch  they vanished like rats into their holes at the shout leaving me standing alone with him the affair had come and gone so quickly that i scarce caught my breath  pardon sir he said knuckling but i followed you  it was banks for a second time he had given me an affecting example of his faithfulness i forgot that he was my servant and i caught his hand and pressed it  you have saved my life at the risk of your own i said i shall not forget it  but banks had been too well trained to lose sight of his position he merely tipped his hat again and said imperturbably  best get out of here your honour theyll be coming again directly  where are we i asked  drury lane sir he replied giving me just the corner of a glance shall i fetch a coach sir no i preferred to walk before we had turned into long acre i had seen all of this sodom of london that it should be given a man to see if indeed we must behold some of the bestiality of this world here alone in the great city high and low were met equal sin levels rank the devil makes no choice between my lord and his kitchen wench who has gone astray here in sodom painted vice had lain for an hundred years and bred half the crime of a century how many souls had gone hence in that time to meet their maker some of these brazen creatures who leered at me had known how long agoa peaceful home and a mothers love had been lured in their innocence to this place of horrors never to leave it until death mercifully overtakes them others having fallen had been driven hither by a cruel world that shelters all save the helpless that forgives all save the truly penitent i shuddered as i thought of mr hogarths prints which in the library in marlboro street at home had had so little meaning for me verily he had painted no worse than the reality as i strode homeward my own sorrow subdued by the greater sorrow i had looked upon the craving i had had to be alone was gone and i would have locked arms with a turnspit i called to banks who was behind at a respectful distance and bade him come talk to me his presence of mind in calling on the watch had made even a greater impression upon me than his bravery i told him that he should have ten pounds and an increase of wages and i asked him where i had gone after leaving dover street and why he had followed me he answered this latter question first he had seen gentlemen in the same state or something like it before his lordship his late master after he had fought with mr onslow of the guards and sir edward minturn when he had lost an inheritance and a reversion at brookss and was forced to give over his engagement to marry the honourable miss swift lord sir he said but that was a sad case as set all london agog and sir edward shot hisself at portsmouth not a sennight after  and he relapsed into silence no doubt longing to ask the cause of my own affliction presently he surprised me by saying  and i might make so bold mr carvel i would like to tell your honour something  i nodded and he hawed awhile and then burst out  your honour must know then that i belongs to the footmans club in berkeley square where i meets all the servants o quality  yes i said wondering what footmans tale he had to tell  and whipple hes a hintimate o mine sir he stopped again  and who may whipple be  with submission sir whipples his grace o charterseas manand youll forgive me sirwhipple owns his grace is prodigious ugly an killed young mr atwater unfair some think whipple says he would give notice had he not promised the old duke  drat whipple i cried  yes sir to be sure sir his grace was in a bloody rage when he found hisself in a fruit bin at covent carding an two redbreasts had carried him to the round house sir afore they discovered his title an since his grace ha said time an time afore whipple that hell ha mr carvels heart for that and has called you most disgustin bad names sir an whipple he says to me banks drop your marster a word an you get the chance his gracell speak him fair tos face but let him look behind him  i thank you again banks i shall bear in mind your devotion i replied but i had nothing to do with sending the duke to covent garden  ay sir so i tells whipple  pray how did you know i demanded curiously  lord sir all the servants at almacks is friends o mine says he but whipple declares his grace will be sworn you did it sir tho the lord mayor hisself made deposition twas not  then mark me banks you are not to talk of this  oh lord no your honour he said as he fell back but i was not so sure of his discretion as of his loyalty  and so i was led to perceive that i was not to be the only aggressor in the struggle that was to come that his grace did me the honour to look upon me as an obstacle and that he intended to seize the first opportunity to make way with me by fair means or foul     volume 6     chapter xxxiv his grace makes advances  the next morning i began casting about as to what i should do next there was no longer any chance of getting at the secret from dorothy if secret there were whilst i am ruminating comes a great battling at the street door and jack comyn blew in like a gust of wind rating me soundly for being a lout and a blockhead  zooks he cried i danced the soles off my shoes trying to get in here yesterday and i hear you were moping all the time and paid me no more attention than i had been a dog scratching at the door what and have you fallen out with my lady  i confessed the whole matter to him he was not to be resisted he called to banks for a cogue of nantsey and swore amazingly at what he was pleased to term the inscrutability of woman offering up consolation by the wholesale the incident he said but strengthened his conviction that mr manners had appealed to dorothy to save him and then added his lordship facing me with absolute fierceness and then richard why the devil did she weep there were no tears when i made my avowal i tell you man that the whole thing points but the one way she loves you i swear it by the rood  i could not help laughing and he stood looking at me with such a whimsical expression that i rose and flung my arms around him  jack jack i cried what a fraud you are do you remember the argument you used when you had got me out of the sponginghouse quoting you all i had to do was to put dorothy to the proof and she would toss mr marmaduke and his honour broadcast now i have confessed myself and what is the result nay your theory is gone up in vapour  then why cried his lordship hotly why before refusing me did she demand to know whether you had been in love with patty swain sdeath you put me in mind of a woman upon stiltsa man has always to be walking alongside her with encouragement handy and when a proud creature such as our young lady breaks down as she hath done tis clear as skylight there is something wrong and as for mr manners hare overheard a part of a powwow twixt him and the duke at the bedford armsand chartersea has all but owned in some of his drunken fits that our little fop is in his power  then she is in love with some one else i said  i tell you she is not said comyn still more emphatically and you can write that down in red in your table book gossip has never been able to connect her name with that of any man save yours when she went for you in castle yard and gemini gossip is like water and will get in if a crack shows when the marquis of wells was going to arlington street once every day she sent him about his business in a fortnight  despite comyns most unselfish optimism i could see no light and in the recklessness that so often besets youngsters of my temper on like occasions i went off to newmarket next day with mr fox and lord ossory in his lordships travellingchaise and four i spent a very gay week trying to forget miss dolly i was the loser by some three hundred pounds in addition to what i expended and loaned to mr fox this young gentleman was then beginning to accumulate at newmarket a most execrable stud he lost prodigiously but seemed in no wise disturbed thereby i have never known a man who took his illluck with such a stoical nonchalance not so while the heat was on as i write a most ridiculous recollection rises of charles dragging his lordship and me and all who were with him to that part of the course where the race was highest where he would act like a madman blowing and perspiring and whipping and swearing all at a time and rising up and down as if the horse was throwing him  at newmarket i had the goodor illfortune to meet that incorrigible rake and profligate my lord of march and ruglen for him the goddess of chance had smiled and he was in the most complaisant humour i was presented to his grace the duke of grafton whose name i had no reason to love and invited to wakefield lodge we went instead mr fox and i to ampthill lord ossorys seat with a merry troop and then we had more racing and whist and quinze and pharaoh and hazard until i was obliged to write another draft upon mr dix to settle the wails and picquet in the travellingchaise all the way to london dining at brookss we encountered fitzpatrick and comyn and my lord carlisle  now how much has charles borrowed of you mr carvel demanded fitzpatrick as we took our seats  ill lay ten guineas that charles has him mortgaged this day month though he owns as much land as william penn and is as rich as fordyce  comyn demanded where the devil i had been though he knew perfectly he was uncommonly silent during dinner and then asked me if i had heard the news i told him i had heard none he took me by the sleeve to the quiet amusement of the company and led me aside  curse you richard says be you have put me in such a temper that i vow ill fling you over you profess to love her and yet you go betting to newmarket and carousing to ampthill when she is ill  ill i said catching my breath  ay that hurts does it yes ill i say she was missed at lady pembrokes that friday you had the scene with her and at lady ailesburys on saturday on monday morning when i come to you for tidings you are off watching charles make an ass of himself at newmarket  and how is she now comyn i asked catching him by the arm  you may go yourself and see and be cursed richard carvel she is in trouble and you are pleasureseeking in the country damme you deserve richly to lose her  calling for my greatcoat and paying no heed to the jeers of the company for leaving before the toasts and the play i fairly ran to arlington street i was in a passion of remorse comyn had been but just granting indeed that she had refused to marry me was that any reason why i should desert my lifelong friend and playmate a hundred little tokens of her affection for me rose to mind and last of all that rescue from castle yard in the face of all mayfair and in that hour of darkness the conviction that something was wrong came back upon me with redoubled force her lack of colour her feverish actions and the growing slightness of her figure all gave me a pang as i connected them with that scene on the balcony over the park  the house was darkened and a coach was in front of it  yessir said the footman miss manners has been quite ill she is now some better and dr james is with her mrs manners begs company will excuse her  and mr marmaduke the man said with as near a grin as he ever got that the marster was gone to mrs cornelyss assembly as i turned away sick at heart the physician in his tiewig and scarlet cloak came out and i stopped him he was a testy man and struck the stone an impatient blow with his staff  ods life sir i am besieged day and night by you young gentlemen i begin to think of sending a daily card to almacks  sir i am an old friend of miss manners i replied having grown up with her in maryland  are you mr carvel he demanded abruptly taking his hat from his arm  yes i answered surprised in the gleam of the portico lanthorn he scrutinized me for several seconds  there are some troubles of the mind which are beyond the power of physic to remedy mr carvel said he she has mentioned your name sir and you are to judge of my meaning your most obedient sir good night sir  and he got into his coach leaving me standing where i was bewildered  that same fear of being alone which has driven many a man to his cups sent me back to brookss for company i found fox and comyn seated at a table in the corner of the drawingroom for once not playing but talking earnestly their expressions when they saw me betrayed what my own face must have been  what is it cried comyn half rising is sheis she  no she is better i said  he looked relieved  you must have frightened him badly jack said fox  i flung myself into a chair and fox proposed whist something unusual for him comyn called for cards and was about to go in search of a fourth when we all three caught sight of the duke of chartersea in the door surveying the room with a cold leisure his eye paused when in line with us and we were seized with astonishment to behold him making in our direction  squints exclaimed mr fox now what the devil can the hound want  to pull your nose for sending him to market my lord suggested  fox laughed coolly  lay you twenty he doesnt jack he said  his grace plainly had some business with us and i hoped he was coming to force the fighting the pieces had ceased to rattle on the round mahogany table and every head in the room seemed turned our way for the covent garden story was well known chartersea laid his hand on the back of our fourth chair greeted us with some ceremony and said something which under the circumstances was almost unheard of in that day if you stand in need of one gentlemen i should deem it an honour  the situation had in it enough spice for all of us we welcomed him with alacrity the cards were cut and it fell to his grace to deal which he did very prettily despite his heavy hands he drew charles fox and they won steadily the conversation between deals was anywhere on the virtue of morello cherries for the gout to which his grace was already subject on mr foxs ariel and why he had not carried sandwichs cup at newmarket on the advisability of putting threeyearolds on the track in short on a dozen small topics of the kind at length when comyn and i had lost some fifty pounds between us chartersea threw down the cards  my coach waits tonight gentlemen said he with some sort of an accent that did not escape us it would give me the greatest pleasure and you will sup with me in hanover square     chapter xxxv in which my lord baltimore appears  his graces offer was accepted with a readiness he could scarce have expected and we all left the room in the midst of a buzz of comment we knew well that the matter was not so haphazard as it appeared and on the way to hanover square comyn more than once stepped on my toe and i answered the pressure our coats and canes were taken by the dukes lackeys when we arrived we were shown over the house until nowso his grace informed usit had not been changed since the time of the fourth duke who as we doubtless knew had been an ardent supporter of the hanoverian succession the rooms were highpanelled and furnished in the german style as was the fashion when the square was built but some were stripped and littered with scaffolding and plaster new and costly marble mantels were replacing the wood and an italian of some renown was decorating the ceilings his grace appeared to be at some pains that the significance of these improvements should not be lost upon us was constantly appealing to mr foxs taste on this or that feature but those fishy eyes of his were so alert that we had not even opportunity to wink it was wholly patent in brief that the duke of chartersea meant to be married and had brought charles and comyn hither with a purpose for me he would have put himself out not an inch had he not understood that my support came from those quarters  he tempered off this exhibition by showing us a collection of pottery famous in england that had belonged to the fifth duke his father every piece of it by the way afterwards brought an enormous sum at auction supper was served in a warm little room of oak the game was from derresley manor the dukes nottinghamshire seat and the wine so he told us was some of fifty bottles of rare chinon he had inherited melted rubies it was indeed of the sort which had quickened the blood of many a royal gathering at blois and amboise and chenonceauxthe distilled peasant song of the loire valley in it many a careworn clown had tasted the purer happiness of the lowly our restraint gave way under its influence his grace lost for the moment his deformities and mr fox made us laugh until our sides ached again his lordship told many a capital yarn and my own wit was afterwards said to be astonishing though i can recall none of it to support the affirmation  not a word or even a hint of dorothy had been uttered nor did chartersea so much as refer to his covent garden experience at length when some half dozen of the wine was gone and the big oak clock had struck two the talk lapsed it was charles fox of course who threw the spark into the powder box  we were speaking of hunting chartersea he said did you ever know george wrottlesey of the suffolk branch  no said his grace very innocent  no ods whips and spurs ill be sworn i never saw a man to beat him for reckless riding he would take five bars any time egad and sit any colt that was ever foaled the wrottleseys were poor as weavers then with the jews coming down in the wagon from london and hanging round the hall gates but the old squire had plenty of good hunters in the stables and haunches on the board and a cellar that was like the widows cruse of oil or barrel of mealor whatever she had all the old man had to do to lose a guinea was to lay it on a card he never nicked in his life so they say well young george got after a rich teamerchants daughter who had come into the country near by slife she was a saucy jade and devilish pretty such a face so stavordale vowed and such a neck and such eyes so innocent so ravishingly innocent but she knew cursed well george was after the bank deposit and kept him galloping and when he got a view halloa egad she was stole away again and no scent  one morning george was out after the hounds with stavordale who told me the story and a lot of fellows who had come over from newmarket he was upon aftermath the horse that foley bought for five hundred pounds and was a colt then of course he left the field out of sight behind he made for a gap in the park wall faith there was no lack of em but the colt refused and over went george and plumped into a cart of winter apples some farmers sot was taking to bury saint edmunds to market the fall knocked the sense out of george for he hasnt much and stavordale thinks he must have struck a stake as he went in anyway the apples rolled over on top of him and the drunkard on the seat never woke up i faith and so they came to town  it so chanced egad that the devil sent miss tea merchant to bury to buy apples she amused herself at playing country gentlewoman while papa worked all week in the city she saw the cart in the market and ate three for she had the health of a barmaid and bid in the load and george with it pon my soul she did they found his boots first and the lady said before all the grinning johns and willums that since she had bought him she supposed she would have to keep him and by gads life she has got him yet which is a deal stranger  even the duke laughed for as fox told it the story was irresistible but it came as near to being a wanton insult as a reference to his graces own episode might the red came slowly back into his eye fox stared vacantly as was his habit when he had done or said something especially daring and comyn and i waited straining and expectant like boys who have prodded a wild beast and stand ready for the spring there was a metallic ring in the dukes voice as he spoke  i have heard mr carvel that you can ride any mount offered you  ods and so he can cried jack ill take oath on that  i will lay you an hundred guineas my lord says his grace very offhand that mr carvel does not sit baltimores pollux above twenty minutes  done says jack before i could draw breath  ill take your grace for another hundred calmly added mr fox  it seems to me your grace i cried angry all at once it seems to me that i am the one to whom you should address your wagers i am not a jockey to be put up at your whim and to give you the chance to lose money  chartersea swung around my way  your pardon mr carvel said he very coolly very politely yours is the choice of the wager and you reject it the others must be called off  slife i double it i said hotly provided the horse is alive and will stand up  devilish well put richard mr fox exclaimed casting off his restraint  i give you my word the horse is alive sir he answered with a mock bow twas only yesterday that he killed his groom at hampstead  a few moments of silence followed this revelation it was charles fox who spoke first  i make no doubt that your grace as a man of honourhe emphasized the word forciblywill not refuse to ride the horse for another twenty minutes provided mr carvel is successful and i will lay your grace another hundred that you are thrown or run away with  truly to cope with a wit like mr foxs the duke had need for a longer head he grew livid as he perceived how neatly he had been snared in his own trap  done he cried loudly done gentlemen it only remains to hit upon time and place for the contest i go to york tomorrow to be back this day fortnight and if you will do me the favour of arranging with baltimore for the horse i shall be obliged i believe he intends selling it to astley the showman  and are we to keep it asks mr fox  i am dealing with men of honour says the duke with a bow i need have no better assurance that the horse will not be ridden in the interval  od so said comyn when we were out very handsome of him but i would not say as much for his grace  and mr fox declared that the duke was no coward but all other epithets known might be called him a very diverting evening richard said he lets to your apartments and have a bowl and talk it over  and thither we went  i did not sleep much that night but twas of dolly i thought rather than of chartersea i was abroad early and over to inquire in arlington street where i found she had passed a good night and i sent banks ahooting for some violets to send her for i knew she loved that flower  between ten and eleven mr fox and comyn and i set out for baltimore house when you go to london my dears you will find a vast difference in the neighbourhood of bloomsbury from what it was that may morning in 1770 great russell street was all a sweet fragrance of gardens mingling with the smell of the fields from the open country to the north we drove past red montagu house with its stone facings and dome like a french hotel and the cluster of buildings at its great gate it had been then for over a decade the british museum the ground behind it was a great resort for londoners of that day many a sad affair was fought there but on that morning we saw a merry party on their way to play prisoners base  then we came to the gardens in front of bedford house which are now bloomsbury square for my part i preferred this latter mansion to the french creation by its side and admired its long and graceful lines its windows commanded a sweep from holborn on the south to highgate on the north to the east of it along southampton row a few great houses had gone up or were building and at the far end of that was baltimore house overlooking her grace of bedfords gardens beyond lambs conduit fields stretched away to the countryside  i own i had a lively curiosity to see that lordly ruler the proprietor of our province whose birthday we celebrated after his majestys had i not been in a great measure prepared i should have had a revulsion indeed  when he heard that mr fox and my lord comyn were below stairs he gave orders to show them up to his bedroom where he received us in a nightgown embroidered with oranges my lord baltimore alas was not much to see he did not make the figure a ruler should as he sat in his easy chair and whined and cursed his swiss he was scarce a year over forty and he had all but run his race dissipation and corrosion had set their seal upon him had stamped his yellow face with crows feet and blotted it with pimples but then the glimpse of a fine gentleman just out of bed of a morning before he is made for the day is unfair  morning charles howdy jack said his lordship apathetically glad to know you mr carvel heard of your family slife wish there were more like em in the province  this sentiment not sitting very well upon his lordship i bowed and said nothing  by the bye he continued pouring out his chocolate into the dish i sent a damned rake of a parson out there some years gone handsome devil too never seen his match with the women egad ods fish he leered and then added with an oath and a nod and a vile remark married three times to my knowledge carried off dozen or so more some of em for me many a good night ive had with him drank between us one evening at essexs gallon and half champagne and burgundy apiece he got to know too much y know he concluded with a wicked wink had to buy him up pack him off  his name fred said comyn with a smile at me  sdeath thats it trouble to remember damned if i can think and he repeated this remark over and over  allen said comyn  yes said baltimore allen and egad i think hell find hell a hotter place than me you know him mr carvel  yes i replied i said no more i make no reservations when i avow i was never so disgusted in my life but as i looked upon him haggard and worn with retribution so neat at hand i had no words to protest or condemn  baltimore gave a hollow mirthless laugh stopped short and looked at charles fox  curse you charles i suppose you are after that little matter i owe you for quinze  damn the little matter said fox come get you perfumed and dressed and order up some of your tokay while we wait i have to go to st stephens mr carvel has come to buy your horse pollux he has bet chartersea two hundred guineas he rides him for twenty minutes  the devil he has cried his lordship jaded no longer why you must know mr carvel there was no groom in my stables who would sit him until foley made me a present of his man miller who started to ride him to hyde park as he came out of great russell street by gads life the horse broke and ran out the tottenham court road all the way to hampstead and the fiend picked out a big stone water trough and tossed miller against it then they gathered up the fragments damme if i like to see suicide mr carvel if chartersea wants to kill you let him try it in the fields behind montagu house here  i told his lordship that i had made the wager and could not in honour withdraw though the horse had killed a dozen grooms but already he seemed to have lost interest he gave a languid pull at the velvet tassel on his bellrope ordered the wine and being informed that his anteroom below was full of people had them all dismissed with the message that he was engaged upon important affairs he told mr fox he had heard of the jerusalem chamber and vowed he would have a like institution he told me he wished the colony of maryland in hell that he was worn out with the quarrels of governor eden and his assembly and offered to lay a guinea that the governors agent would get to him that daywillhe nillhe i did not think it worth while to argue with such a man  my lord took threequarters of an hour to dress and swore he had not accomplished the feat so quickly in a year he washed his hands and face in a silver basin and the scent of the soap filled the room he rated his swiss for putting cinnamon upon his ruffles in place of attar of roses and attempted to regale us the while with some of his choicest adventures in more than one of these by the way his grace of chartersea figured it was fox who brought him up  see here baltimore he said im not squeamish but im cursed if i like to hear a man who may die any time between bottles talk so  his lordship took the rebuke with an oath and presently hobbled down the stairs of the great and silent house to the stable court where two grooms were in waiting with the horse he was an animal of amazing power about sixteen hands and dapple gray in colour and it required no special knowledge to see that he had a devil inside him it gleamed wickedly out of his eye  ods life richard cried charles he has a jew nose by all the seven tribes i bid you ware of him  you have but to ride him with a gold bit richard said comyn and he is a kitten ill warrant  at that moment pollux began to rear and kick so that it took both the ostlers to hold him  show him a sovereign suggested fox how do you feel richard  i never feared a horse yet i said with perfect truth nor do i fear this one though i know he may kill me  ill lay you twenty pounds you have at least one bone broken and ten that you are killed baltimore puts in querulously from the doorway  ill do this my lord i answered if i ride him he is mine if he throws me i give you twenty pounds for him  the gentlemen laughed and baltimore vowed he could sell the horse to astley for fifty that pollux was the son of renown of the duke of kingstons stud and much more but charles rallied him out by a reference to the debt at quinze and an appeal to his honour as a sportsman and swore he was discouraging one of the prettiest encounters that would take place in england for many a long day and so the horse was sent to the stables of the white horse cellar in piccadilly and left there at my order     chapter xxxvi a glimpse of mr garrick  day after day i went to arlington street each time to be turned away with the same answer that miss manners was a shade better but still confined to her bed you will scarce believe me my dears when i say that mr marmaduke had gone at this crisis with his grace to the york races on the fourth morning i think i saw mrs manners she was much worn with the vigil she had kept and received me with an apathy to frighten me her way with me had hitherto always been one of kindness and warmth in answer to the dozen questions i showered upon her she replied that dorothys malady was in no wise dangerous so dr james had said and undoubtedly arose out of the excitement of a london season as i knew dorothy was of the kind that must run and run until she dropped she had no notion of the measure of her own strength mrs manners hoped that in a fortnight she would be recovered sufficiently to be removed to one of the baths  she wishes me to thank you for the flowers richard she has them constantly by her and bids me tell you how sorry she is that she is compelled to miss so much of your visit to england are you enjoying london richard i hear that you are well liked by the best of company  i left prodigiously cast down and went directly to mr wedgwoods to choose the prettiest set of teacups and dishes i could find there i pitied mrs manners from my heart and made every allowance for her talk with me knowing the sorrow of her life here was yet another link in the chain of the chartersea evidence and i made no doubt that mr manners brutal desertion at such a time must be hard to bear i continued my visits of inquiry nearly always meeting some person of consequence or the footman of such come on the same errand as myself and once i encountered the young man she had championed against his grace at lady tankervilles  rather than face the array of anxieties that beset me i plunged recklessly into the gayetiesnay the excessesof mr charles fox and his associates i paid in truth a very high price for my friendship with mr fox but since it did not quite ruin me i look back upon it as cheaply bought to know the man well to be the subject of his regard was to feel an infatuation in common with the little band of worshippers which had come with him from eton they remained faithful to him all his days nor adversity nor change of opinion could shake their attachment they knew his faults deplored them and paid for them and this was not beyond my comprehension tho many have wondered at it did he ask me for five hundred poundswhich he didi gave it freely and would gladly have given more tho i saw it all wasted in a night when the dice rolled against him for those honoured few of whom i speak likewise knew his virtues which were quite as large as the faults albeit so mingled with them that all might not distinguish  i attended some of the routs and parties to all of which as a young colonial gentleman of wealth and family i was made welcome i went to a ball at lord stanleys a mixture of french horns and clarionets and coloured glass lanthorns and candles in gilt vases and young ladies pouring tea in white and musicians in red and draperies and flowers ad libitum there i met mr walpole looking on very critically he was the essence of friendliness asked after my equerry and said i had done well to ship him to america at the opera with lord ossory and mr fitzpatrick i talked through the round of the boxes from lady pembrokes on the right to lady herveys on the left where dollys illness and lady harringtons snuffing gabble were the topics rather than giardinis fiddling mr storer took me to footes dressingroom at the haymarket where we found the duke of cumberland lounging i was presented and thought his royal highness had far less dignity than the monkeycomedian we had come to see  i must not forget the visit i made to drury lane playhouse with my lords carlisle and grantham and comyn the great actor received me graciously in such a company you may be sure he appeared much smaller off the boards than on and his actions and speech were quick and nervous gast his hairdresser was making him up for the character of richard iii  ods said mr garrick your lordships come five minutes too late goldsmith is but just gone hence fresh from his tailor filby of water lane the most gorgeous creature in london gentlemen ill be sworn he is even now so he would have me know gone by invitation to my lord denbighs box to ogle the ladies  and have you seen your latest lampoon mr garrick asks comyn winking at me  up leaps mr garrick so suddenly as to knock the paintpot from gasts hand  nay your lordship jests surely he cried his voice shaking  jests says my lord very serious do i jest carlisle and turning to mr cross the prompter who stood by fetch me the st jamess evening post says he  ods my life continues poor garrick almost in tears i have loaned foote upwards of two thousand pounds and last year as your lordship remembers took charge of his theatre when his leg was cut off pon my soul i cannot account for his ingratitude  tis not foote says carlisle biting his lip i know footes mark  then johnson says the actor because i would not let him have my fine books in his dirty den to be kicked about the floor but put my library at his disposal  nay nor johnson nor yet macklin nor murphy  surely not cries mr garrick turning white under the rouge the name remained unpronounced  ay ay junius in the evening post he has fastened upon you at last answers comyn taking the paper  sdeath garrick carlisle puts in very solemn what have you done to offend the terrible unknown talebearing to his majesty ill warrant i gave you credit for more discretion  at these words mr garrick seized the chair for support and swung heavily into it whereat the young lords burst into such a tempest of laughter that i could not refrain from joining them as for mr garrick he was so pleased to have escaped that he laughed too though with a palpable nervousness     note by the editor it was not long after this that mr garricks    punishment came and for the selfsame offence  by the bye garrick carlisle remarked slyly when he had recovered mrs crewe was vastly taken with the last vers you left on her dressingtable  was she now my lord said the great actor delighted but scarce over his fright you must know that i have writ one to my lady carlisle on the occasion of her dropping her fan in piccadilly whereupon he proceeded to recite it and my lord carlisle being something of a poet himself pronounced it excellent  mr garrick asked me many questions concerning american life and manners having a play in his repertory the scene of which was laid in new york in the midst of this we were interrupted by a dirty fellow who ran in crying excitedly  sir the archbishop of york is getting drunk at the bear and swears hell be dd if hell act tonight  the archbishop may go to the devil snapped mr garrick i do not know a greater rascal except yourself  i was little short of thunderstruck but presently mr garrick added complainingly  i paid a guinea for the archbishop but the fellow got me three murderers today and the best alderman i ever clapped eyes upon so we are square  after the play we supped with him at his new house in adelphi terrace next topham beauclerks twas handsomely built in the italian style and newly furnished throughout for mr garrick travelled now with a coach and six and four menservants forsooth and amongst other things he took pride in showing us that night was a handsome snuffbox which the king of denmark had given him the year before his majestys portrait set in jewels thereon  presently the news of the trial of lord baltimores horse began to be noised about and was followed by a deluge of wagers at brookss and whites and elsewhere comyn and fox my chief supporters laid large sums upon me despite all my persuasion but the most unpleasant part of the publicity was the rumour that the match was connected with the struggle for miss mannerss hand i was pressed with invitations to go into the country to ride this or that horse his grace the duke of grafton had a mount he would have me try at wakefield lodge and was far from pleasant over my refusal of his invitation i was besieged by young noblemen like lord derby and lord foley until i was heartily sick of notoriety and cursed the indiscretion of the person who let out the news and my own likewise my lord march who did me the honour to lay one hundred pounds upon my skill insisted that i should make one of a party to the famous amphitheatre near lambeth mr astley the showman being informed of his lordships intention met us on westminster bridge dressed in his uniform as sergeant major of the royal light dragoons and mounted on a white charger he escorted us to one of the large boxes under the penthouse reserved for the gentry and when the show was over and the place cleared begged that i would ride his indian chief i refused but march pressed me and comyn declared he had staked his reputation upon my horsemanship astley was a large man about my build and i donned a pair of his leather breeches and boots and put indian chief to his paces around the ring i found him no more restive nor as much so as firefly the gentlemen were good enough to clap me roundly and astley vowed no doubt because of the noble patrons present that he had never seen a better seat  we all repaired afterwards for supper to don salteros coffee house and museum in chelsea and i remembered having heard my grandfather speak of the place and tell how he had seen sir richard steele there listening to the don scraping away at the merry christ church bells on his fiddle the don was since dead but king jamess coronation sword and king henry viiis coat of mail still hung on the walls  the remembrance of that fortnight has ever been an appalling one mr carvel had never attempted to teach me the value of money my grandfather indeed held but four things essential to the conduct of life namely to fear god love the king pay your debts and pursue your enemies there was no one in london to advise me comyn being but a wild lad like myself but my lord carlisle gave me a friendly warning  have a care carvel said he kindly or you will run your grandfather through and all your relations beside i little realized the danger of it when i first came up he was not above two and twenty then and now i have a wife am more crippled than i care to be thanks to this devilish high play will you dine with lady carlisle in st jamess place next friday  my heart went out to this young nobleman handsome he was as a picture and he knew better than most of your fine gentlemen how to put a check on his inclinations as a friend he had few equals his purse being ever at the command of those he loved and his privations on foxs account were already greater than many knew  i had a call too from mr dix i found him in my parlour one morning cringing and smiling and as usual half an hour away from his point  i warrant you mr carvel says he there are few young gentlemen not born among the elect that make the great friends you are blessed with  i have been fortunate mr dix i replied dryly  fortunate he cried good lord sir i hear of you everywhere with mr fox and you have been to astleys with my lord march and i have a draft from you at ampthill  vastly well manoeuvred mr dix i said laughing at the guilty change in his pink complexion and hence you are here  he fidgeted and seeing that i paid him no attention but went on with my chocolate he drew a paper from his pocket and opened it  you have spent a prodigious sum sir for so short a time said he unsteadily tis very well for you mr carvel but i have to remember that you are heir only i am advancing you money without advices from his worship your grandfather a most irregular proceeding sir and one likely to lead me to trouble i know not what your allowance may be  nor i mr dix i replied unreasonably enough to speak truth i have never had one you have my lord comyns signature to protect you i went on illnaturedly for i had not had enough sleep and in case mr carvel protests which is unlikely and preposterous you shall have ten percentum on your money until i can pay you that should be no poor investment  he apologized but he smoothed out the paper on his knee  it is only right to tell you mr carvel that you have spent one thousand eight hundred and thirtyseven odd pounds in home money which is worth more than your colonial your grandfathers balance with me was something less than one thousand five hundred as i made him a remittance in december last i have advanced the rest and yesterday he went on resolutely for him yesterday i got an order for five hundred more  and he handed me the paper i must own that the figures startled me i laid it down with a fine show of indifference  and so you wish me to stop drawing very good mr dix  he must have seen some threat implied though i meant none he was my very humble servant at once and declared he had called only to let me know where i stood then he bowed himself out wishing me luck with the horse he had heard of and i lighted my pipe with his accompt     chapter xxxvii the serpentine  whether it was mr dix that started me reflecting or my lord carlisles warning or a few discreet words from young lady carlisle herself i know not at all events i made a resolution to stop high play and confine myself to whist and quinze and picquet for i conceived a notion enlarged by mr fox that i had more than once fallen into the tender clutches of the hounds i was so reflecting the morning following lord carlisles dinner when banks announced a footman  mr mannerss man sir he added significantly and handed me a little note i seized it and to hide my emotion told him to give the man his beer  the writing was dorothys and some time passed after i had torn off the wrapper before i could compose myself to read it  so sir the moment i am too ill to watch you you must needs lapse into wilde  flity doings for thus yrs are calld even in london never mind how yr extravigancies are come to my ears sir one matter i have herd that i am most concerned about  i pray you my dear richard do not allow yr recklessness  contemt for danger to betray you into a stil more amazing follie or i shall be very miserable indeed i have hopes that the report is at best a rumour  you must sit down  write me that it is sir that my minde may be set at rest i fear for you vastly  i beg you not riske yr life foolishly  this for the sake of one who subscribes herself yr old playmate  wellwisher dolly  ps i have writ sir jon fielding to put you in the marshallsee or new gate until mr carvel can be tolde i am better  hope soon to see you agen  have been informed of yr dayly visitts  yr flowers are beside me d m   in about an hour and a half mr marmadukes footman was on his way back to arlington street in a condition not to be lightly spoken of during that period i had committed an hundred silly acts and incidentally learned the letter by heart i was much distressed to think that she had heard of the affair of the horse and more so to surmise that the gossip which clung to it must also have reached her but i fear i thought most of her anxiety concerning me which reflection caused my hand to shake from very happiness yr flowers are beside me and i beg you not riske yr life foolishly and i shall be very miserable indeed but then yr old plamate  well wisher nay she was inscrutable as ever  and my replywhat was that to be how i composed it in the state of mind i was in i have no conception to this day the chimney was clogged with papers ere in a spelling to vie with dollys i had set down my devotion my undying devotion to her interests i asked forgiveness for my cruelty on that memorable morning i had last seen her but even to allude to the bet with chartersea was beyond my powers and as for renouncing it though for her sakethat was not to be thought of the high play i readily promised to avoid in the future and i signed myselfwell it matters not after seventy years  the same day tuesday i received a letter from his grace of chartersea saying that he looked to reach london that night but very late he begged that mr fox and lord comyn and i would sup with him at the star and garter at eleven to fix matters for the trial on the morrow mr fox could not go but comyn and i went to the inn having first attended the tempest at drury lane with lady di and mr beauclerk  we found his grace awaiting us in a private room with captain lewis of the 60th foot who had figured as a second in the duel with young atwater the captain was a rake and a bully and a toadeater of course with a loud and profane tongue and he had had a bottle too many in the dukes travellingcoach there was likewise a sir john brooke a country neighbour of his grace in nottinghamshire sir john apparently had no business in such company he was a hearty foxhunting squire who had seen little of london a threebottle man who told a foul story and went asleep immediately afterwards much to my disappointment mr manners had gone to arlington street direct i had longed for a chance to speak a little of my mind to him  this meeting which i shall not take the time to recount was near to ending in an open breach of negotiations his grace had lost money at york and more to lewis on the way to london he was in one of his vicious humours he insisted that hyde park should be the place of the contest in vain did comyn and i plead for some less public spot on account of the disagreeable advertisement the matter had received his grace would be damned before he would yield and lewis adding a more forcible contingency hinted that our side feared a public trial comyn presently shut him up  do you ride the horse after his grace is thrown says he and i agree to get on after and he does not kill you sdeath i am not of the army adds my lord cuttingly i am a seaman and not supposed to know a stirrup from a snaffle  ods blood yelled the captain you question my horsemanship my lord do i understand your lordship to question my courage  after i am thrown cries his grace very ugly and fingering the jewels on his hilt  sir john was awakened by the noise and turning heavily spilled the whole of a pint of port on the dukes satin waist coat and breeches whereat chartersea in a rage flung the bottle at his head with a curse which it seems was a habit with his grace but the servants coming in headed by my old friend the chamberlain they quieted down and it was presently agreed that the horse was to be at noon in the kings old road or rotten row as it was then beginning to be called in hyde park  i shall carry to the grave the memory of the next day i was up betimes and over to the white horse cellar to see pollux groomed where i found a crowd about the opening into the stable court the young american called some one and to my astonishment and no small annoyance i was greeted with a huzzay for you sir my groats on your honour  this goodwill was owing wholly to the dukes unpopularity with all classes inside sporting gentlemen in huntingfrocks of red and green and velvet visored caps were shouldering favoured ostlers from the different noblemens stables and there was a liberal sprinkling of the characters who attended the cock mains in drury lane and at newmarket at the moment of my arrival the head ostler was rubbing down the stallions flank  heres ten pounds to ride him saunders called one of the huntingfrocks  umph sniffed the ostler ride im is it yere honour two hunner beast eno an a portugal crown i th boot sooner take me chaunces o tyburn on ounslow eath an miller waurna able to sit im tis no for th likes o me to try th bloody devil took th shirt off teddys back this morn i adwises th young buckskin t order s coffin just then he perceived me and touched his cap something abashed with submission sir yr honourll take an old mans adwise an not go near im  polluxs appearance indeed was not calculated to reassure me he looked ugly to exaggeration his ears laid back and his nostrils as big as crowns and his teeth bared time and time now and anon an impatient fling of his hoof would make the grooms start away from him since coming to the inn he had been walked a couple of miles each day with two men with loaded whips to control him i was being offered a deal of counsel when big mr astley came in from lambeth and silenced them all  these grooms mr carvel he said to me as we took a bottle in private inside these grooms are the very devil for superstition and once a horse gets a bad name with them goodby to him miller knew how to ride of course but like many another of them was too damned overconfident i warned him more than once for getting young horses into a fret and im willing to lay a tenpound note that he angered pollux ods life he is a vicious beast so was his father culloden before him but heres luck to you sir says mr astley tipping his glass having seen you ride egad i have put all the money i can afford in your favour  before i left him he had given me several valuable hints as to the manner of managing that kind of a horse not to auger him with the spurs unless it became plain that he meant to kill me to try persuasion first and force afterwards and secondly he taught me a little trick of twisting the bit which i have since found very useful  leaving the white horse i was followed into piccadilly by the crowd until i was forced to take refuge in a hackney chaise the noise of the affair had got around town and i was heartily sorry i had not taken the other and better method of trying conclusions with the duke and slapped his face i found jack comyn in dover street and presently mr fox came for us with his chestnuts in his chaise fitzpatrick with him at hyde park corner there was quite a jam of coaches chaises and cabriolets and beribboned phaetons which made way for us but kept us busy bowing as we passed among them it seemed as if everybody of consequence that i had met in london was gathered there one face i missed and rejoiced that she was absent for i had a degraded feeling like that of being the favourite in a cudgelbout and the thought that her name was connected with all this made my face twitch i heard the people clapping and saw them waving in the carriages as we passed and some stood forward before the rest in a haphazard way without rhyme or reason mr walpole with lady di beauclerk and mr storer and mr price and colonel st john and lord and lady carlisle and lady ossory these i recognized inside the railing along the row was lined with people and there stood pollux bridled with a blanket thrown over his great back and chest surrounded still by the huntingfrocks who had followed him from the white horse mixed in with these swearing conjecturing and betting were some to surprise me whose names were connected with every track in england the duke of grafton and my lords sandwich and march and bolingbroke and sir charles bunbury and young lords derby and foley who after establishing separate names for folly on the tracks went into partnership my lord baltimore descended listlessly from his cabriolet to join the group they all sang out when they caught sight of our party and greeted me with a zeal to carry me off my feet and my lord sandwich having done me the honour to lay something very handsome upon me had his chief jockey on hand to give me some final advice i believe i was the coolest of any of them and at that time of all others the fact came up to me with irresistible humour that i a young colonial whig who had grown up to detest these people should be rubbing noses with them  the duke put in an appearance five minutes before the hour upon a bay gelding and attended by lewis and sir john brooke both mounted as a most particular evidence of the detestation in which chartersea was held he could find nothing in common with such notorious rakes as march and sandwich and it fell to me to champion these after some discussion between fox and captain lewis march was chosen umpire his lordship took his post in the middle of the row drew forth an enamelled repeater from his waistcoat and mouthed out the conditions of the matchthe terms as he said being private  are you ready mr carvel he asked  i am my lord i answered the bells were pealing noon  then mount sir said he  the voices of the people dropped to a hum that brought to mind the long forgotten sound of the bees swarming in the garden by the chesapeake my breath began to come quickly through the sunny haze i saw the cows and deer grazing by the serpentine and out of the back of my eye handkerchiefs floated from the carriages banked at the gate they took the blanket off the stallion stallfed and excited by the crowd he looked brutal indeed the faithful banks in a new suit of the carvel livery held the stirrup and whispered a husky god keep you sir suddenly i was up the murmur was hushed and the park became still as a peaceful farm in devonshire the grooms let go of the stallions head  he stood trembling like the throes of death i gripped my knees as captain daniel had taught me years ago when some invisible force impelled me to look aside from between the broad and hunching shoulders of chartersea i met such a venomous stare as a cattlefish might use to freeze his prey cattlefish the word kept running over my tongue i thought of the snaky arms that had already caught mr marmaduke and were soon perhaps to entangle dorothy she had begged me not to ride and i was risking a life which might save hers  the wind rushing in my ears and beating against my face awoke me all at once the trees ran madly past and the water at my right was a silver blur the beast beneath me snorted as he rose and fell fainter and fainter dropped the clamour behind me which had risen as i started and the leaps grew longer and longer then my head was cleared like a steamed windowpane in a cold blast i saw the road curve in front of me i put all my strength into the curb and heeling at a fearful angle was swept into the busy kensington road for the first time i knew what it was to fear a horse the stallions neck was stretched his shoes rang on the cobbles and my eyes were fixed on a narrow space between carriages coming together in a flash i understood why the duke had insisted upon hyde park and that nerved me some i saw the frightened coachmen pulling their horses this way and that i heard the cries of the footpassengers and then i was through i know not how once more i summoned all my power recalled the twist astley had spoken of and tried it i bent his neck for an inch of rein next i got another inch and then came a tastethe smallest tasteof mastery like elixir the motion changed with it became rougher and the hoofbeats a fraction less frequent he steered like a ship with sail reduced in and out we dodged among the wagons and i was beginning to think i had him when suddenly without a move of warning he came down rigid with his feet planted together and only a miracle and my tight grip restrained me from shooting over his head there he stood shaking and snorting nor any persuasion would move him i resorted at last to the spurs  he was up in the air in an instant and came down across the road again i dug in to the rowels and clung the tighter and this time he landed with his head to london a little knot of people had collected to watch me and out stepped a strapping fellow in the kings scarlet from the guards horse near by  hold him sir he said tipping better dismount sir he means murder yr honour  keep clear curse you i cried waving him off what time is it  he stepped back no doubt thinking me mad some one spoke up and said it was five minutes past noon i had the grace to thank him i believe to my astonishment i had been gone but four minutes they had seemed twenty looking about me i found i was in the open space before old kensington church over against the archway there once more i dug in the spurs this time with success almost at a jump the beast took me into the angle of posts to the east of the churchyard gate and tore up the footpath of church lane terrified men and women ahead of me taking to the kennel he ran irregularly now on the side of the posts now against the bricks and then i gave myself up  heaven put a last expedient into my head that i had once heard mr dulany speak of i braced myself for a pull that should have broken the stallions jaw and released his mouth altogether incredible as it may seem he jarred into a trot and presently came down to a walk tossing his head like fury and sweating at every pore i leaned over and patted him speaking him fair and marvel of marvels when we had got to the dogs that guard the entrance of camden house i had coaxed him around and into the street and cantered back at easy speed to the church without pausing to speak to the bunch that stood at the throat of the lane i started toward london thankfulness and relief swelling within me i understood the beast and spoke to him when he danced aside at a wagon with bells or a rattling load of coals and checked him with a word and a light hand  before i gained the life guards house i met a dozen horsemen amongst them banks on a mount of mr foxs they shouted when they saw me colonel st john calling out that he had won another hundred that i was not dead sir john brooke puffed and swore he did not begrudge his losses to see me safe despite captain lewiss sourness storey vowed he would give a dinner in my honour and riding up beside me whispered that he was damned sorry the horse was now broken and his graces chance of being killed taken away and thus escorted i came in by the kings new road to avoid the people running in the row and so down to hyde park corner and in among the chaises and the phaetons where there was enough cheering and waving of hats and handkerchiefs to please the most exacting of successful generals i rode up to my lord march and finding there was a minute yet to run i went up the row a distance and back again amidst more huzzaing pollux prancing and quivering and frothing his bit but never once attempting to break  when i had got down they pressed around me until i could scarce breathe crying congratulations comyn embracing me openly mr fox vowed he had never seen so fine a sight and said many impolitic things which the duke must have overheard lady carlisle sent me a red rose for my buttonhole by his lordship mr warner the lively parson with my lord march desired to press my hand declaring that he had won a dozen of port upon me which he had set his best cassock against my lord sandwich offered me snuff and invited me to hichinbroke indeed i should never be through were i to continue but i must not forget my old acquaintance mr walpole who protested that he must get permission to present me to princess amelia that her royal highness would not rest content now until she had seen me i did not then know her highnesss sporting propensity  then my lord march called upon the duke who stood in the midst of an army of his toadeaters i almost pitied him then tho i could not account for the feeling i think it was because a nobleman with so great a title should be so cordially hated and despised there were high words along the railing among the dukes supporters captain lewis in his anger going above an inference that the stallion had been broken privately chartersea came forward with an indifferent swagger as if to say as much and in truth no one looked for more sport and some were even turning away he had scarce put foot to the stirrup when the surprise came two minutes were up before he was got in the saddle pollux rearing and plunging and dancing in a circle the grooms shouting and dodging and his grace cursing in a voice to wake the dead and mr fox laughing and making small wagers that he would never be mounted but at last the duke was up and gripped his face bloody red giving vent to his fury with the spurs  then something happened and so quickly that it cannot be writ fast enough pollux bolted like a shot out of a sling vaulted the railing as easily as you or i would hop over a stick and galloping across the lawn and down the embankment flung his grace into the serpentine precisely as mr fox afterwards remarked as the swine with the evil spirits ran down the slope into the sea  an indescribable bedlam of confusion followed lords and gentlemen tradesmen and grooms hostlers and apprentices all tumbling after many crying with laughter my lord sandwichs jockey pulled his grace from the water in a most pitiable state of rage and humiliation his side curls gone the powder and pomatum washed from his hair bedraggled and muddy and sputtering oaths he made his way to lord march swearing by all divine that a trick was put on him that he would ride the stallion to lands end his lordship pulling his face straight gravely informed the duke that the match was over with this his grace fell flatly sullen was pushed into a coach by sir john and the captain and drove rapidly off kensington way to avoid the people at the corner     chapter xxxviii in which i am roundly brought to task  i would have gone to arlington street direct but my friends had no notion of letting me escape they carried me off to brookss club where a bowl of punch was brewed directly and my health was drunk to three times three mr storer commanded a turtle dinner in my honour we were not many fortunatelyonly mr foxs little coterie and it was none other than mr fox who made the speech of the evening may i be strung as high as haman said he amid a tempest of laughter if ever i saw half so edifying a sight as his grace pitching into the serpentine unless it were his grace dragged out again mr carvels advent has been a godsend to us narrow ignoramuses of this island gentlemen to the englishmen of our colonies sirs and that we may never underrate or misunderstand them more  nay charles cried my lord comyn where is our gallantry i give you first the englishwomen of our colonies and in particular the pride of maryland who has brought back to the old country all the graces of the newmiss manners  his voice was drowned by a deafening shout and we charged our glasses to drain them brimming and then we all went to drury lane to see mrs clive romp through the wonder in the spirit of the immortal peg she spoke an epilogue that mr walpole had writ especial for her and made some witty and sarcastic remarks directed at the gentlemen in our stagebox we topped off a very full day by a supper at the bedford arms where i must draw the certain  the next morning i was abed at an hour which the sobriety of old age makes me blush abed think of banks had just concluded a discreet discourse upon my accomplishment of the day before and had left for my newspapers when he came running back with the information that miss manners would see my honour that day there was no note between us we made my toilet in a jiffy and presently i was walking in at the mannerss door in an amazing hurry and scarcely waited for a direction but as i ran up the stairs i heard the tinkle of the spinet and the notes of an old familiar tune fell upon my ears the words rose in my head with the cadence            love me little love me long           is the burthen of my song           love that is too hot and strong           runneth soon to waste  that simple air already mellowed by an hundred years had always been her favourite she used to sing it softly to herself as we roamed the woods and fields of the eastern shore instinctively i paused at the dressingroom door nay my dears you need not cry out such was the custom of the times a dainty bower it was filled with the perfume of flowers and rosy cupids disporting on the ceiling and china and silver and gold filigree strewn about with my teacups on the table the sunlight fell like a halo round dorothys head her hands strayed over the keys and her eyes were far away she had not heard me i remember her dressa silk with blue cornflowers on a light ground and the flimsiest of lace caps resting on her hair i thought her face paler but beyond that she did not show her illness  she looked up and perceived me i thought with a start so it is you she said demurely enough you are come at last to give an account of yourself  are you better dorothy i asked earnestly  why should you think that i have been ill she replied her fingers going back to the spinet it is a mistake sir dr james has given me near a gross of his infamous powders and is now exploiting another cure i have been resting from the fatigues of london while you have been wearing yourself out  dr james himself told me your condition was serious i said  of course said she the worse the disease the more remarkable the cure the more sought after the physician when will you get over your provincial simplicity  i saw there was nothing to be got out of her while in this baffling humour i wondered what devil impelled a woman to write one way and talk another in her note to me she had confessed her illness the words i had formed to say to her were tied on my tongue but on the whole i congratulated myself she knew how to step better than i and there were many awkward things between us of late best not spoken of but she kept me standing an unconscionable time without a word which on the whole was cruelty while she played over some of dibdins ballads  are you in a hurry sir she asked at length turning on me with a smile are you in a hurry to join my lord march or his grace of grafton and have you writ captain clapsaddle and your whig friends at home of your new intimacies of mr fox and my lord sandwich  i was dumb  yes you must be wishing to get away she continued cruelly picking up the newspaper i had forgotten this notice when i saw it this morning i thought of you and despaired of a glimpse of you today reading at the three hats islington this day the 10th of may will be played a grand match at that ancient and much renowned manly diversion called double stick by a sect of chosen young men at that exercise from different parts of the west country for two guineas given free those who break the most heads to bear away the prize before the abovementioned diversion begins mr sampson and his young german will display alternately on one two and three horses various surprising and curious feats of famous horsemanship in like manner as at the grand jubilee at stratforduponavon admittance one shilling each person before you leave mr richard she continued with her eyes still on the sheet i should like to talk over one or two little matters  dolly  will you sit sir  i sat down uneasily expecting the worst she disappointed me as usual  what an unspeakable place must you keep in dover street i cannot send even a footman there but what he comes back reeling  i had to laugh at this but there was no smile out of my lady  it took me near an hour and a half to answer your note i replied  and twas a masterpiece exclaimed dolly with withering sarcasm oh a most amazing masterpiece ill be bound his worship the french ambassador is a kitten at diplomacy beside you sir an hour and a half did you say sir gemini the secretary of state and his whole corps could not have composed the like in a day  faith i cried with feeling enough and if that is diplomacy i would rather make leather breeches than be given an embassy  she fixed her eyes upon me so disconcertingly that mine fell  there was a time she said with a change of tone there was a time when a request of mine and it were not granted outright would have received some attention this is my first experience at being ignored  i had made a wager said i and could not retract with honour  so you had made a wager now we are to have some news at last how stupid of you richard not to tell me before i confess i wonder what these wits find in your company here am i who have seen naught but dull women for a fortnight and you have failed to say anything amusing in a quarter of an hour let us hear about the wager  where is little to tell i answered shortly considerably piqued i bet your friend the duke of chartersea some hundreds of pounds i could ride lord baltimores pollux for twenty minutes after which his grace was to get on and ride twenty more  where did you see the duke dolly interrupted without much show of interest  i explained how we had met him at brookss and had gone to his house  you went to his house she repeated raising her eyebrows a trifle and comyn and mr fox and pray how did this pretty subject come up  i related very badly i fear foxs story of young wrottlesey and the teamerchants daughter and what does my lady do but get up and turn her back arranging some pinks in the window i could have sworn she was laughing had i not known better  well  well that was a reference to a little pleasantry mr fox had put up on him some time before his grace flared but tried not to show it he said he had heard i could do something with a horse i believe he made it up and comyn gave oath that i could and then he offered to bet comyn that i could not ride this pollux who had killed his groom that made me angry and i told the duke i was no jockey to be put up to decide wagers and that he must make his offers to me  la said dolly you fell in head over heels  what do you mean by that i demanded  nothing said she biting her lip come you are as ponderous as dr johnson  then mr fox proposed that his grace should ride after me  here dolly laughed in her handkerchief  ill be bound said she  then the duke went to york i continued hurriedly and when he came back we met him at the star and garter he insisted that the match should come off in hyde park i should have preferred the open roads north of bedford house  where there is no serpentine she interrupted with the faintest suspicion of a twinkle about her eyes on sir on you are as reluctant as our pump at wilmot house in the dry season i see you were not killed as you richly deserved let us have the rest of your tale  there is very little more to it save that i contrived to master the beast and his grace  was disgraced a vastly fine achievement surely but where are you to stop you will be shaming the king next by outwalking him pray how did the duke appear as he was going into the serpentine  you have heard i exclaimed the trick she had played me dawning upon me  upon my word richard you are more of a simpleton than i thought you have you not seen your newspaper this morning  i explained how it was that i had not she took up the chronicle  this mr carvel has made no inconsiderable noise since his arrival in town and yesterday crowned his performances by defeating publicly a noble duke at a riding match in hyde park before half the quality of the kingdom his lordship of march and ruglen acted as umpire there sir was i not right to beg sir john fielding to put you in safe keeping until your grandfather can send for you  i made to seize the paper but she held it from me  if mr carvel remains long enough in england he bids fair to share the talk of mayfair with a certain honourable young gentleman of brookss and the admiralty whose debts and doings now furnish most of the gossip for the clubs and the card tables their names are both connected with this contest tis whispered that the wager upon which the match was ridden arose here dolly stopped shortly her colour mounting and cried out with a stamp of her foot you are not content to bring publicity upon yourself who deserve it but must needs drag innocent names into the newspapers  what have they said i demanded ready to roll every printer in london in the kennel  nay you may read for yourself said she and flinging the paper in my lap left the room  they had not said much more heaven be praised but i was angry and mortified as i had never been before realizing for the first time what a botch i had made of my stay in london in great dejection i was picking up my hat to leave the house when mrs manners came in upon me and insisted that i should stay for dinner she was very white and seemed troubled and preoccupied and said that mr manners had come back from york with a cold on his chest but would insist upon joining the party to vauxhall on monday i asked her when she was going to the baths and suggested that the change would do her good indeed she looked badly  we are not going richard she replied dorothy will not hear of it in spite of the doctor she says she is not ill and must attend at vauxhall too you are asked  i said that mr storer had included me i am sure from the way she looked at me that she did not heed my answer she appeared to hesitate on the verge of a speech and glanced once or twice at the doors  richard i suppose you are old enough to take care of yourself tho you seem still a child to me i pray you will be careful my boy she said with something of the affection she had always borne me for your grandfathers sake i pray you will run into no more danger iwe are your old friends and the only ones here to advise you  she stopped seemingly to weigh the wisdom of what was to come next while i leaned forward with an eagerness i could not hide was she to speak of the duke of chartersea alas i was not to know for at that moment dorothy came back to inquire why i was not gone to the cudgelling at the three hats i said i had been invited to stay to dinner  why i have writ a note asking comyn said she do you think the house will hold you both  his lordship came in as we were sitting down bursting with some news and he could hardly wait to congratulate dolly on her recovery before he delivered it  why richard says the dog what do you think some wag has done now they believe at brookss twas that jackanapes of a parson dr warner who was there yesterday with march he drew a clipping from his pocket listen miss dolly         on wednesday did a carter see         his grace the duke of chrtsa         as plump and helpless as a bag         astraddle of a bigboned nag         lord sam the carter loudly yelled         on by this wondrous sight impelled         well run and watch this noble gander         master a steed like alexander         but when the carter reached the row         his grace had left it long ago         bucephalus had leaped the green         the duke was in the serpentine         the fervent wish of all good men         that he may neer come out again  comyns impudence took my breath tho the experiment interested me not a little my lady was pleased to laugh at the doggerel and even mrs manners its effect upon mr marmaduke was not so spontaneous his smile was halfhearted indeed the little gentleman seemed to have lost his spirits and said so little for him that i was encouraged to corner him that very evening and force him to a confession but i might have known he was not to be caught it appeared almost as if he guessed my purpose for as soon as ever the claret was come on he excused himself saying he was promised to lady harrington who wanted one  comyn and i departed early on account of dorothy she had denied a dozen who had left cards upon her  egad richard said my lord when we had got to my lodgings i made him change colour did i not do you know how the little fool looks to me ods life he looks hunted and cursed near brought to earth we must fetch this thing to a point richard and i am wondering what charterseas next move will be he added thoughtfully      chapter xxxix holland house  on the morrow as i was setting out to dine at brookss i received the following on a torn slip of paper dear richard we shall have a good show today you may care to see it was signed fox and dated at st stephens i lost no time in riding to westminster where i found a flock of excited people in parliament street and in the palace yard and on climbing the wide stone steps outside and a narrower flight within i was admitted directly into the august presence of the representatives of the english people they were in a most prodigious and unseemly state of uproar  what a place is old st stephens chapel over st marys in the vaults for the great commons of england to gather it is scarce larger or more imposing than our own assembly room in the stadt house in annapolis st stephens measures but ten yards by thirty with a narrow gallery running along each side for visitors in one of these by the rail i sat down suffocated bewildered and deafened and my first impression out of the confusion was of the bewigged speaker enthroned under the royal arms sore put to restore order on the table in front of him lay the great mace of the restoration three chandeliers threw down their light upon the mob of honourable members and i wondered what had put them into this state of uproar  presently with the help of a kind stranger on my right who was occasionally making shorthand notes i got a few bearings that was the treasury bench where lord north sat he was wide awake now and there was the government side he pointed out barrington and weymouth and jerry dyson and sandwich and rigby in the court suit of purple velvet with the sword thrust through the pocket i took them all in as some of the worst enemies my country had in britain then my informant seemed to hesitate and made bold to ask my persuasion when i told him i was a whig and an american he begged the favour of my hand  there sir he cried excitedly that stout young gentleman with the black face and eyebrows and the blacker heart i may saythe one dressed in the fantastical costume called by a french nameis mr charles fox he has been sent by the devil himself i believe to ruin this country ods sir that devil lord holland begot him he is but one and twenty but his detestable arts have saved norths neck from burke and wedderburn on two occasions this year  and what has happened today i asked smiling  the stranger smiled too  why sir he answered raising his voice above the noise if you have been in london any length of time you will have read the account with comment of the duke of graftons speech in the lords signed domitian their lordships well know it should have been over a greater signature this afternoon his grace of manchester was talking in the upper house about the spanish troubles when lord gower arose and desired that the place might be cleared of strangers lest some castilian spy might lurk under the gallery that was directed against us of the press sir and their lordships knew it ads heart sir there was a riot the house servants tumbling everybody out and mr burke and mr dunning in the boot who were gone there on the business of this house to present a bill those gentlemen are but just back calling upon the commons to revenge them and vindicate their honour and my lord north looks troubled as you will mark for the matter is like to go hard against his majestys friends but hush mr burke is to speak  the horse fell quiet to listen and my friend began to ply his shorthand industriously i leaned forward with a sharp curiosity to see this great friend of america he was dressed in a wellworn suit of brown and i recall a decided irish face and a more decided irish accent which presently i forgot under the spell of his eloquence i have heard it said he had many defects of delivery he had none that day or else i was too little experienced to note them afire with indignation he told how the deputy black rod had hustled him like a vagabond or a thief and he called the house of lords a bear garden he was followed by dunning in a still more inflammatory mood until it seemed as if all the kings friends in the lower house must desert their confederates in the upper no less important a retainer than mr onslow moved a policy of retaliation and those that were left began to act like the egyptians when they felt the red sea under them they nodded and whispered in their consternation  it was then that mr fox got calmly up before the pack of frightened mercenaries and argued god save the mark for moderation he had the ear of the house in a second and he spoke with all the confidencethis youngster who had just reached his majorityhe had used with me before his intimates i gaped with astonishment and admiration the lords said he had plainly meant no insult to this honourable house nor yet to the honourable members they had aimed at the common enemies of man the printers and for this their heat was more than pardonable my friend at my side stopped his writing to swear under his breath look at em he cried they are turning already he could argue swedenborg into popery  the deserters were coming back to the ranks indeed and north and dyson and weymouth had ceased to look haggard and were wreathed in smiles in vain did mr burke harangue them in polished phrase it was a language north and company did not understand and cared not to learn their young champion spoke the more worldly and cynical tongue of whites and brookss with its shorter sentences and absence of formality and even as the devil can quote scripture to his purpose mr fox quoted history and the classics with plenty more that was not above the heads of the booted and spurred country squires and thus for the third time he earned the gratitude of his gracious majesty  well richard said he slipping his arm through mine as we came out into parliament street i promised you some sport have you enjoyed it  i was forced to admit that i had  let us to the thatched house and have supper privately he suggested i do not feel like a company tonight we walked on for some time in silence presently he said  you must not leave us richard you may go home to see your grandfather die and when you come back i will see about getting you a little borough for what my father paid for mine and you shall marry dorothy and perchance return in ten years as governor of a principality that is after weve ruined you at the club how does that prospect sit  i wondered at the mood he was in that made him choose me rather than the adulation and applause he was sure to receive at brookss for the part he had played that night after we had satisfied our hungerfor neither of us had dinedand poured out a bottle of claret he looked up at me quizzically  i have not heard you congratulate me he said  nor will you i replied laughing  i like you the better for it richard twas a damned poor performance and thats truth  i thought the performance remarkable i said honestly  oh but it was not he answered scornfully the moment that duncoloured irishman gets up the whole government pack begins to whine and shiver there are men i went to school with i fear more than burke but you dont like to see the champion of america come off second best is that what youre thinking  no but i was wondering why you have devoted your talents to the devil i said amazed at my boldness  he glanced at me and half laughed again  you are cursed frank said he damned frank  but you invited it  yes he replied so i did give me a man who is honest fill up again said he and spit out all you would like to say richard  then said i why do you waste your time and your breath in defending a crew of political brigands and placemen and a king who knows not the meaning of the word gratitude and who has no use for a man of ability you have honoured me with your friendship charles fox and i may take the liberty to add that you seem to love power more than spoils you have originality you are honest enough to think and act upon your own impulses and pardon me if i say you have very little chance on that side of the house where you have put yourself  you seem to have picked up a trifle since you came into england he said a damned shrewd estimate ill be sworn and for a colonial but as for power he added a little doggedly i have it in plenty and the kind i like the king and north hate and fear me already more than wilkes  and with more cause i replied warmly his majesty perhaps knows that you understand him better and foresees the time when a man of your character will give him cause to fear indeed  he did not answer that but called for a reckoning and taking my arm again we walked out past the sleeping houses  have you ever thought much of the men we have in the colonies i asked  no he replied chatham stands for em and i hate chatham on my fathers account that is reason enough for me  you should come back to america with me i said and when you had rested awhile at carvel hall i would ride with you through the length of the provinces from massachusetts to north carolina you will see little besides hardworking selfrespecting englishmen loyal to a king who deserves loyalty as little as louis of france but with their eyes open and despite the course he has taken they are men whose measure of resolution is not guessed at  he was silent again until we had got into piccadilly and opposite his lodgings  are they all like you he demanded  who said i for i had forgotten my words  the americans  the greater part feel as i do  i suppose you are for bed he remarked abruptly  the night is not yet begun i answered repeating his favourite words and pointing at the glint of the sun on the windows  what do you say to a drive behind those chestnuts of mine for a breath of air i have just got my new cabriolet selwyn ordered in paris  soon we were rattling over the stones in piccadilly wrapped in greatcoats for the morning wind was cold we saw the earl of march and ruglen getting out of a chair before his house opposite the green park and he stopped swearing at the chairmen to wave at us  hello march mr fox said affably youre drunk  his lordship smiled bowed graciously if unsteadily to me and did not appear to resent the pleasantry then he sighed  what a pair of cubs it is said he i wish to god i was young again i hear you astonished the world again last night charles  we left him being assisted into his residence by a sleepy footman paid our toll at hyde park corner and rolled onward toward kensington fox laughing as we passed the empty park at the thought of what had so lately occurred there after the close night of st stephens nature seemed doubly beautiful the sun slanted over the water in the gardens in bars of green and gold the bright new leaves were on the trees and the morning dew had brought with it the smell of the living earth we passed the stream of market wagons lumbering along pulled by sturdy patient farmhorses driven by smocked countrymen who touched their caps to the fine gentlemen of the court end of town who shook their heads and exchanged deep tones over the whims of quality unaccountable as the weather but one bigchested fellow arrested his salute a scowl came over his face and he shouted back to the wagoner whose horses were munching his hay  hi jeems keep down yere hands mr fox is noo friend of we  this brought a hard smile on mr foxs face  i believe richard he said i have become more detested than any man in parliament  and justly i replied for you have fought all that is good in you  i was mobbed once in parliament street i thought they would kill me have you ever been mobbed richard he asked indifferently  never i thank heaven i answered fervently  i think i would rather be mobbed than indulge in any amusement i know of he continued than confound wedderburn or drive a measure against burkewhich is no bad sport my word ont i would rather be mobbed than have my horse win at newmarket there is a keen pleasure you wot not of my lad in listening to billingsgate and spitalfields howl maledictions upon you and no sensation i know of is equal to that of the moment when the mud and sticks and oranges are coming through the windows of your coach when the dirty weavers are clutching at your ruffles and shaking their filthy fists under your nose  it is at any rate strictly an aristocratic pleasure i assented laughing  so we came to holland house its wide fields of sprouting corn its woods and pastures and orchards in blossom were smiling that morning as though leviathan the town were not rolling onward to swallow them lord holland had bought the place from the warwicks with all its associations and memories the capped towers and quaint facades and projecting windows were plain to be seen from where we halted in the shaded park and to the south was that kensington road we had left over which all the glory and royalty of england at one time or another had rolled under these majestic oaks and cedars cromwell and ireton had stood while the beaten royalists lashed their horses on to brentford nor did i forget that the renowned addison had lived here after his unhappy marriage with lady warwick and had often ridden hence to buttons coffee house in town where my grandfather had had his dinner with dean swift  we sat gazing at the building which was bathed in the early sun at the deer and sheep grazing in the park at the changing colours of the young leaves as the breeze swayed them the market wagons had almost ceased now and there was little to break the stillness  you love the place i said  he started as though i had awakened him out of a sleep and he was no longer the fox of the clubs the cynical the reckless he was no longer the bestdressed man in st jamess street or the aggressive youngster of st stephens  love it he cried ay richard and few guess how well you will not laugh when i tell you that my happiest days have been passed here when i was but a chit in the long room where addison used to walk up and down composing his spectators or trotting after my father through these woods and gardens a kinder parent does not breathe than he well i remember how he tossed me in his arms under that tree when i had thrashed another lad for speaking ill of him he called me his knight in all my life he has never broken faith with me when they were blasting down a wall where those palings now stand he promised me i should see it done and had it rebuilt and blown down again because i had missed the sight all he ever exacted of me was that i should treat him as an elder brother he had his own notion of the world i was going into and prepared me accordingly he took me from eton to spa where i learned gaming instead of greek and gave me so much a night to risk at play  i looked at him in astonishment to say that i thought these relations strange would have been a waste of words  to be sure charles continued i was bound to learn and could acquire no younger he flicked the glossy red backs of his horses with his whip you are thinking it an extraordinary education i know he added rather sadly i hav atold you thisgod knows why yes because i like you damnably and you would have heard worse elsewhere both of him and of me i fear you have listened to the worlds opinion of lord holland  indeed i had heard a deal of that noblemans peculations of the public funds but in this he was no worse than the bulk of his colleagues his desertion of william pitt i found hard to forgive  the best father in the world richard cried charles if his former friends could but look into his kind heart and see him in his home they would not have turned their backs upon him i do not mean such scoundrels as rigby and now my father is in exile half the year in nice and the other half at kings gate the king and jack bute used him for a tool and then cast him out you wonder why i am of the kings party said he with something sinister in his smile i will tell you when i got my borough i cared not a fig for parties or principles i had only the one definite ambition to revenge lord holland nay he exclaimed stopping my protest i was not too young to know rottenness as well as another the times are rotten in england you may have virtue in america amongst a people which is fresh from a struggle with the earth and its savages we have cursed little at home in faith the king with his barley water and rising at six and shivering in chapel and his middleclass table is rottener than the rest the money he saves in his damned beggarly court goes to buy mens souls his word is good with none for my part i prefer a man who is drunk six days out of the seven to one who takes his pleasure so and i am not so great a fool that i cannot distinguish justice from injustice i know the wrongs of the colonies which you yourself have put as clear as i wish to hear despite mr burke and his eloquence     my grandfather has made a note here which in justice should be    added that he was not deceived by mr foxs partialityd c c  and perhaps richard he concluded with a last lingering look at the old pile as he turned his horses perhaps some day i shall remember what you told us at brookss  it was thus boyishly that mr fox chose to take me into his confidence an honour which i shall remember with a thrill to my dying day so did he reveal to me the impulses of his early life hidden forever from his detractors how little does the censure of this world count which cannot see the heart behind the embroidered waistcoat when charles fox began his career he was a thoughtless lad but steadfast to such principles as he had formed for himself they were not many but compared to those of the arena which he entered they were noble he strove to serve his friends to lift the name of a father from whom he had received nothing but kindness however misguided and when he saw at length the error of his ways what a mighty blow did he strike for the right  here is a man said dr johnson many years afterwards who has divided his kingdom with caesar so that it was a doubt whether the nation should be ruled by the sceptre of george the third or the tongue of fox     chapter xl vauxhall  matters had come to a pretty pickle indeed i was openly warned at brookss and elsewhere to beware of the duke who was said upon various authority to be sulking in hanover square his rage all the more dangerous because it was smouldering i saw dolly only casually before the party to vauxhall needless to say she flew in the face of dr jamess authority and went everywhere she was at lady bunburys drum whither i had gone in another fruitless chase after mr marmaduke dr warners verse was the laughter of the company and greatly to my annoyancein the circumstancesi was made a hero of and showered with three times as many invitations as i could accept  the whole story got abroad even to the awakening of the duke in covent garden and that clownish mr foote of the haymarket had added some lines to a silly popular song entitled the sights o lunnun with which i was hailed at mrs bettys fruitstall in st jamess street here is one of the verses         in maryland he hunts the fox         from dewy morn till day grows dim         at home he finds a paradox         from noon till dawn the fox hunts him  charles fox laughed when he heard it but he was serious when he came to speak of chartersea and bade me look out for assassination i had banks follow me abroad at night with a brace of pistols under his coat albeit i feared nothing save that i should not have an opportunity to meet the duke in a fair fight and i resolved at all hazards to run mr marmaduke down with despatch if i had to waylay him  mr storer who was forever giving parties was responsible for this one at vauxhall we went in three coaches and besides dorothy and mr marmaduke the company included lord and lady carlisle sir charles and lady sarah bunbury lady ossory and lady julia howard two miss stanleys and miss poole and comyn and hare and price and fitzpatrick the latter feeling very glum over a sum he had dropped that afternoon to lord harrington fox had been called to st stephens on more printers business  dolly was in glowing pink as i loved best to see her and looked divine comyn and i were in mr mannerss coach the evening was fine and warm and my lady in very lively spirits as we rattled over westminster bridge the music of the vauxhall band came throbbing through the still night and the sky was bright with the reflection of the lights it was the fashion with the quality to go late and so eleven oclock had struck before we had pulled up between vauxhall stairs crowded with watermen and rough mudlarks and the very ordinarylooking house which forms the entrance of the great garden leaving the servants outside singlefile we trailed through the dark passage guarded by the wicketgate  prepare to be ravished richard said my lady with fine sarcasm  you were yourself born in the colonies miss i retorted i confess to a thrill and will not pretend that i have seen such sights often enough to be sated  la exclaimed lady sarah who had overheard i vow this is refreshing behold a new heaven and a new earth mr carvel  indeed much to the amusement of the company i took no pains to hide my enthusiasm at the brilliancy of the scene which burst upon me a great orchestra rose in the midst of a stately grove lined on all four sides with supperboxes of brave colours which ran in straight tiers or swept around in circles these were filled with people of all sorts and conditions supping and making merry other people were sauntering under the trees keeping step with the music lamps of white and blue and red and green hung like luminous fruit from the branches or clustered in stars and crescents upon the buildings  why richard you are as bad as farmer colin           o patty soft in feature           ive been at dear vauxhall           no paradise is sweeter           not that they eden call  whispered dolly paraphrasing  at that instant came hurrying mr tom tyers who was one of the brothers proprietors of the gardens he was a very lively young fellow who seemed to know everybody and he desired to know if we would walk about a little before being shown to the boxes reserved for us  they are on the right side mr tyers demanded mr storer  oh to be sure sir your man was most particular to stipulate the pink and blue flowered brocades next the prince of waless  but you must have the band stop that piece mr tyers cried lady sarah i declare it is too much for my nerves let them play dibbins ephesian matron  as your ladyship wishes responded the obliging mr tyers and sent off an uniformed warder to the bandmaster  as he led us into the rotunda my lady dolly being in one of her whimsical humours began to recite in the manner of the guidebook to the vast diversion of our party and the honest citizens gaping at us  this my lords ladies and gentlemen says the minx is that marvellous rotunda commonly known as the umbrella where the music plays on wet nights and where we have our masquerades and ridottos their royal highnesses are very commonly seen here on such occasions as you see it is decorated with mirrors and scenes and busts and with gilded festoons that picture was painted by the famous hogarth the organ in the orchestra costyou must supply the figure mr tyersand the ceiling is at least two hundred feet high gentlemen from the colonies and the country take notice  by this time we were surrounded mr marmaduke was scandalized and crushed but mr tyers used to the vagaries of his fashionable patrons was wholly convulsed  faith miss manners and you would consent to do this two nights more we should have to open another gate he declared followed by the mob which it seems was part of the excitement he led us out of the building into the grand walk and offered to turn on the waterfall and mill which so lady sarah explained to me the farmers and merchants fell down and worshipped every night at nine to the tinkling of bells she told mr tyers there was diversion enough without tin cascades when we got to the grand cross walk he pointed out the black wilderness of tall elms and cedars looming ahead of us andso we came to the south walk with its three triumphal arches framing a noble view of architecture at the far end our gentlemen sauntered ahead with their spyglasses staring the citizens pretty daughters out of countenance and making cynical remarks  why egad i heard sir charles say the wigmakers have no cause to petition his majesty for work ill be sworn the false hair this good staymaker has on cost a guinea  a remark which caused the staymaker if such he was such huge discomfort that he made off with his wife in the opposite direction to the time of jeers and cockcrows from the bevy of vauxhall bucks walking abreast  you must show us the famous dark walks mr tyers says dorothy  surely you will not care to see those miss manners  o lud of course you must chimed in the miss stanleys there is no spice in these flaps and flies  he led us accordingly into druids walk overarched with elms and dark as the shades our gentlemen singing ods lovers will contrive in chorus the ladies exclaiming and drawing together then i felt a soft restraining hold on my arm and fell back instinctively vibrating to the touch  could you not see that i have been trying to get a word with you for ever so long  i trust you to find a way dolly if you but wish i replied admiring her stratagem  i am serious tonight indeed her voice betrayed as much how well i recall those rich and low tones i said i wished you shut up in the marshalsea and i meant it i have been worrying about you  you make me very happy said i which was no lie  richard you are every bit as reckless and indifferent of danger as they say your father was and i am afraid  of what i asked quickly  you once mentioned a name to me  yes i was breathing deep  i have forgiven you she said gently i never meant to have referred to that incident more you will understand whom i mean you must know that he is a dangerous man and a treacherous oh she exclaimed i have been in hourly terror ever since you rode against him in hyde park there i have said it  the tense sweetness of that moment none will ever know  but you have more reason to fear him than i dorothy  hush she whispered catching her breath what are you saying  that he has more cause to fear me than i to dread him  she came a little closer  you stayed in london for me richard why did you there was no need she exclaimed there was no need do you hear oh i shall never forgive comyn for his meddling i am sure twas he who told you some ridiculous story he had no foundation for it  dorothy i demanded my voice shaking with earnestness will you tell me honestly there is no foundation for the report that the duke is intriguing to marry you  that question was not answered and regret came the instant it had left my lipsregret and conviction both dorothy joined lady carlisle before our absence had been noted and began to banter fitzpatrick upon his losings  we were in the lighted grove again and sitting down to a supper of vauxhall fare transparent slices of ham which had been a vauxhall joke for ages and chickens and cheese cakes and champagne and claret and arrack punch mr tyers extended the concert in our favour mrs weichsell and the beautiful baddeley trilled sentimental ballads which our ladies chose and mr vernon the celebrated tenor sang cupids recruiting sergeant so happily that storer sent him a bottle of champagne after which we amused ourselves with catches until the space between our boxes and the orchestra was filled in the midst of this comyn came quietly in from the other box and took a seat beside me  chartersea is here tonight said he  i started how do you know  tyers told me he turned up half an hour since tom asked his grace to join our party his lordship laughed duke said nohe was to be here only half an hour and tom did not push him he told me as a joke and thinks chartersea came to meet some petite  any one with him i asked  yes tall dark man one eye castthats lewis they have come on some dirty work richard watch little marmaduke he has been fidgety as a cat all night  thats true said i looking up i caught dorothys eyes upon us her lips parted uneasiness and apprehension plain upon her face comyn dropped his voice still lower  i believe she suspects something he said rising chartersea is gone off toward the wilderness so tom says you must not let little marmaduke see him if manners gets up to go i will tune up blackeked susan and do you follow on some pretext if you are not back in a reasonable time ill after you  he had been gone scant three minutes before i heard his clear voice singing in the downs and up i got with a precipitation far from politic and stepped out of the box our company stared in surprise but dorothy rose clear from her chair the terror i saw stamped upon her face haunts me yet and i heard her call my name  i waited for nothing gaining the grand walk i saw mr marmadukes insignificant figure dodging fearfully among the roughs whose hour it was he traversed the cross walk and twenty yards farther on dived into an opening in the high hedge bounding the wilderness before he had made six paces i had him by the shoulder and he let out a shriek of fright like a womans  it is i richard carvel mr manners i said shortly i could not keep out the contempt from my tone i beg a word with you  in his condition then words were impossible his teeth rattled again and he trembled like a hare caught alive i kept my hold of him and employed the time until he should be more composed peering into the darkness for all i knew chartersea might be within earshot but i could see nothing but black trunks of trees  what is it richard  you are going to meet chartersea i said  he must have seen the futility of a lie or else was scared out of all contrivance yes he said weakly  you have allowed it to become the talk of london that this filthy nobleman is blackmailing you for your daughter i went on without wasting words tell me is it or is it not true  as he did not answer i retained a handful of the grained silk on his shoulder as a measure of precaution  is this so i repeated  you must know i suppose he said under his breath and with a note of sullenness  i must i said firmly the knowledge is the weapon need for i too am going to meet chartersea  he ceased quivering all at once  you are going to meet him he cried in another voice yes yes it is soit is so i will tell you all  keep it to yourself mr manners i replied with repugnance i have heard all i wish where is he i demanded  hold the path until you come to him and god bless  i shook my head  no not that do you go back to the company and make some excuse for me do not alarm them and if you get the chance tell lord comyn where to come  i waited until i saw him under the lights of the grand walk and fairly running then i swung on my heel i was of two minds whether to wait for comyn by far the wiser course the unthinking recklessness i had inherited drove me on     chapter xli the wilderness  my eyes had become accustomed to the darkness and presently i made out a bench ahead with two black figures starting from it one i should have known on the banks of the styx from each came a separate oath as i stopped abreast them and called the duke by name  mr carvel he cried what the devil do you here sir  i am come to keep an appointment for mr manners i said may i speak to your grace alone  he made a peculiar sound by sucking in his breath meant for a sneering laugh  no says he damned if you shall i have nothing in common with you sir so love for miss manners has driven you mad my young upstart and he is not the first lewis  nor the last by g says the captain  i have a score to settle with you dn you cried chartersea  that is why i am here your grace i replied only you have twisted the words there has been foul play enough i have come to tell you i cried boiling with anger i have come to tell you there has been foul play enough with a weakling that cannot protect himself and to put an end to your blackmail  in the place of an oath a hoarse laugh of derision came out of him but i was too angry then to note its significance i slapped his facenay boxed it so that my palm stung i heard his sword scraping out of the scabbard and drew mine stepping back to distance at the same instant then with something of a shudder i remembered young atwater and a 380 brace of other instances of his villany i looked for the captain he was gone  our blades the dukes and mine came together with a ring and i felt the strength of his wrist behind his and of his short powerful arm the steel sung with our quick changes from quarte to tierce twas all by the feeling without light to go by and hatred between us left little space for skill our lunges were furious twas not long before i felt his point at my chest but his reach was scant all at once the music swelled up voices and laughter were wafted faintly from the pleasure world of lights beyond but my head was filled to the exclusion of all else with a hatred and fury and god forgive me from between my teeth came a prayer that if i might kill this monster i would die willingly  suddenly as i pressed him he shifted ground and there was lewis standing within range of my eye his hands were nowherethey were behind his back god alone knows why he had not murdered me to keep chartersea between him and me i swung another quarter the duke seemed to see my game struggled against it tried to rush in under my guard made a vicious lunge that would have ended me then and there had he not slipped we were both panting like wild beasts when next i raised my eyes lewis had faded into the darkness then i felt my head as wet as from a plunge the water running on my brow and my back twitching every second i thought the sting of his sword was between my ribs but to forsake the duke would have been the maddest of follies  in that moment of agony came footsteps beating on the path and by tacit consent our swords were still we listened  richard richard carvel  for the second time in my life i thanked heaven for that brave and loyal english heart i called back but my throat was dry and choked  so they are at their dd assassins tricks again you need have no fear of one murderer  with that their steels rang out behind me like broadswords lewis wasting his breath in curses and blasphemies i began to push chartersea with all my might and the wonder of it was that we did not fight with our fingers on each others necks his attacks too redoubled twice i felt the stings of his point once in the hand and once in the body but i minded them as little as pinpricks i was sure i had touched him too i heard him blowing distressedly the casks of wine he had drunk in his short life were telling now and his thrusts grew weaker that fiercest of all joysof killing an enemywas in me when i heard a cry that rang in my ears for many a year afterward and the thud of a body on the ground  i have done for him your grace says lewis with an oath and added immediately i think i hear people  before i had reached my lord the captain repeated this and excitedly begged the duke i believe to fly chartersea hissed out that he would not move a step until he had finished me and as i bent over the body his point popped through my coat and the pain shot under my shoulder i staggered and fell a second of silence ensued when the duke said with a laugh that was a cackle  he wont marry her dn him panting he had me cursed near killed lewis best give him another for luck  i felt his heavy hand on the sword and it tearing out of me next came the single word dover and they were gone i had not lost my senses and was on my knees again immediately ripping open comyns waistcoat with my left hand and murmuring his name in an agony of sorrow i was searching under his shirt wet with blood when i became aware of voices at my side a duel a murder call the warders warders ho  a surgeon i cried a surgeon first of all  some one had wrenched a lamp from the grand walk and held it flickering in the wind before his lordships face guided by its light more people came running through the wood then the warders with lanthorns headed by mr tyers and on top of him mr fitzpatrick and my lord carlisle we carried poor jack to the house at the gate and closed the doors against the crowd  by the grace of heaven sir charles blicke was walking in the gardens that night and battering at the door was admitted along with the constable and the watch assisted by a young apothecary sir charles washed and dressed the wound which was in the left groin and to our anxious questions replied that there was a chance of recovery  but you too are hurt sir he said turning his clear eyes upon me indeed the blood had been dripping from my hand and arm during the whole of the operation and i began to be weak from the loss of it by great good fortune charterseas thrust which he thought had ended my life passed under my armpit from behind and stitching the skin lodged deep in my right nipple this wound the surgeon bound carefully and likewise two smaller ones  the constable was for carrying me to the marshalsea and so i was forced to tell that i had quarrelled with chartersea and the watch going out to the scene of the fight discovered the dukes sword which he had pulled out of me and lewiss laced hat and also a trail of blood leading from the spot mr tyers testified that he had seen chartersea that night and lord carlisle and fitzpatrick to the grudge the duke bore me i was given my liberty  comyn was taken to his house in brook street grosvenor square in sir charless coach whither i insisted upon preceding him twas on the way there that fitzpatrick told me dorothy had fainted when she heard the alarma piece of news which added to my anxiety we called up the dowager countess comyns mother and carlisle broke the news to her mercifully lightening me of a share of the blame her ladyship received the tidings with great fortitude and instead of the torrent of reproaches i looked for and deserved she implored me to go home and care for my injuries lest i get the fever i believe that i burst into tears  his lordship was carried up the stairs with never a word or a groan from his lips and his heart beating out slowly  we reached my lodgings as the watchman was crying past two oclock and a windy morning  mr fitzpatrick stayed with me that night and the next morning save for the soreness of the cuts i had got i found myself well as ever i was again to thank the robustness of my health despite the protests of banks and fitzpatrick and of mr fox who arrived early not having been to bed at all i jumped into a chaise and drove to brook street there i had the good fortune to get the greatest load from my mind comyn was resting so much easier that the surgeon had left and her ladyship retired two hours since  the day was misting and dark but so vast was my relief that i imagined the sun was out as i rattled toward arlington street if only dolly were not ill again from the shock i should be happy indeed she must have heard ere then that i was not killed and i had still better news to tell her than that of lord comyns condition mr fox who got every rumour that ran had shouted after me that the duke and lewis were set out for france how he knew i had not waited to inquire but the report tallied with my own surmise for they had used the word dover when they left us for dead in the wilderness  i dismissed my chaise at the door  mr manners waits on you sir in the drawingroom said the footman your honour is here sooner than he looked for he added gratuitously  sooner than he looked for  yes sir james is gone to you but quarter of an hour since with a message sir  i was puzzled  and miss manners is she well  the man smiled  very well sir thank your honour  to add to my surprise mr marmaduke was pacing the drawingroom in a yellow nightgown he met me with an expression i failed to fathom and then my eye was held by a letter in his hand he cleared his throat  good morning richard said he very seriousvery pompous i thought i am pleased to see that you are so well out of the deplorable affair of last night  i had not looked for gratitude in truth i had done nothing for him and chartersea might have exposed him a highwayman for all i caredi had fought for dolly but this attitude astonished me i was about to make a tart reply and then thought better of it  walter a decanter of wine for mr carvel says he to the footman then to me i am rejoiced to hear that lord comyn is out of danger  i merely stared at him  will you sit he continued to speak truth the annapolis packet came in last night with news for you knowing that you have not had time to hear from maryland i sent for you  my brain was in such a state that for the moment i took no meaning from this introduction i was conscious only of indignation against him for sending for me when for all he knew i might have been unable to leave my bed suddenly i jumped from the chair  you have heard from maryland i cried is mr carvel dead oh tell me is mr carvel dead and i clutched his arm to make him wince  he nodded and turned away my dear old friend is no more he said your grandfather passed away on the seventh of last month  i sank into a chair and bowed my face a flood of recollections overwhelming me a thousand kindnesses of my grandfather coming to mind one comfort alone stood forth even had i gone home with john paul i had missed him but that he should have died alone with grafton brought the tears brimming to my eyes i had thought to be there to receive his last words and blessing to watch over him and to smooth his pillow who had he else in the world to bear him affection on his deathbed the imagination of that scene drove me mad  mr manners aroused me by a touch and i looked up quickly so quickly that i surprised the trace of a smile about his weak mouth were i to die tomorrow i would swear to this on the evangels nor was it the smile which compels itself upon the weak in serious moments nay there was in it something malicious and mr manners could not even act  there is more richard he was saying there is worse to come can you bear it  his words and look roused me from my sorrow i have ever been short of temper with those i disliked and alas with my friends also and now all my pentup wrath against this little man broke forth i divined his meaning and forgot that he was dorothys father  worse i shouted while he gave back in his alarm do you mean that grafton has got possession of the estate is that what you mean sir  yes he gasped yes i pray you be calm  and you call that worse than losing my dearest friend on earth i cried there must have been an infinite scorn in my voice then your standards and mine are different mr manners your ways and mine are different and i thank god for it you have played more than one double part with me you looked me in the face and denied me and left me to go to a prison i shall not repeat my grandfathers kindnesses to you sir though you may not recall them i do and if your treatment of me was known in maryland you would be drummed out of the colony even as mr hood was and hung in effigy  as god hears me richard  do not add perjury to it i said and have no uneasiness that i shall publish you your wife and daughter have saved you beforethey will save you now  i paused struck speechless by a suspicion that suddenly flashed into my head a glance at the contemptible form cowering within the folds of the flowered gown clinched it to a conviction in two strides i had seized him by the skin over his ribs and he shrieked with pain and fright  youyou snake i cried in uncontrollable anger you well knew dorothys spirit which she has not got from you and you lied to her yes lied i say to force her to marry chartersea you made her believe that your precious honour was in danger and you lied to me last night and sent me in the dark to fight two of the most treacherous villains in england you wish they had killed me the plot was between you and his grace you who have not a cats courage commit an indiscretion you never made one in your life tell me i cried shaking him until his teeth smote together was it not put up between you  let me go let me go and i will tell he wailed in the agony of my grip i tightened it the more  you shall confess it first i said from between my teeth  scarce had his lips formed the word yes when i had flung him half across the room he tripped on his gown and fell sprawling on his hands so the servant found us when he came back with the tray the lackey went out again hastily  my god i exclaimed in bitterness and disgust you are a father and would sell both your daughter and your honour for a title and to the filthiest wretch in the kingdom  without bestowing upon him another look i turned on my heel and left the room i had set my foot on the stair when i heard the rustle of a dress and the low voice which i knew so well calling my name  richard  there at my side was dorothy even taller in her paleness with sorrow and agitation in her blue eyes  richard i have heard alli listened are you going away without a word for me her breath came fast and mine as she laid a hand upon my arm richard i do not care whether you are poor what am i saying she cried wildly am i false to my own father richard what have you done  and then while i stood dazed she tore open her gown and drawing forth a little gold locket pressed it in my palm the flowers you gave me on your birthdaythe lilies of the valley do you remember they are here richard i have worn them upon my heart ever since  i raised the locket to my lips  i shall treasure it for your sake dorothy i said for the sake of the old days god keep you  for a moment i looked into the depths of her eyes then she was gone and i went down the stairs alone outside the rain fell unheeded on my new coat my steps bent southward past whitehall where the martyr charles had met death so nobly past the stairs to the river where she had tripped with me so gayly not a month since death was in my soul that daydeath and love which is the mystery of life god guided me into the great abbey near by where i fell on my knees before him and before englands dead he had raised them and cast them down even as he was casting me that i might come to know the glory of his holy name     volume 7     chapter xlii my friends are proven  at the door of my lodgings i was confronted by banks red with indignation and fidgety from uneasiness  o lord mr carvel what has happened sir he cried your honours agent as been here since noon must i take orders from the likes o him sir  mr dix was indeed in possession of my rooms lounging in the chair dolly had chosen smoking my tobacco i stared at him from the threshold something in my appearance or force of habit or both brought him to his feet and wiped away the smirk from his face he put down the pipe guiltily i told him shortly that i had heard the news which he must have got by the packet and that he should have his money tho it took the rest of my life and the ten per cent i had promised him provided he would not press my lord comyn he hesitated and drummed on the table he was the man of business again  what security am i to have mr carvel he asked  my word i said it has never yet been broken i thank god nor my fathers before me and hark ye mr dix you shall not be able to say that of grafton truly i thought the principal and agent were now well matched  very good mr carvel he said ten per cent i shall call with the papers on monday morning  i shall not run away before that i replied  he got out with a poor attempt at a swagger without his customary protestations of duty and humble offers of service and i thanked heaven he had not made a scene which in my state of mind i could not have borne but must have laid hands upon him perhaps he believed grafton not yet secure in his title i did not wonder then in the heat of my youth that he should have accepted my honour as security but since i have marvelled not a little at this the fine gentlemen at brookss with whom i had been associating were none too scrupulous and regarded moneylenders as legitimate prey debts of honour they paid but tardily if at all a certain nobleman had been owing my lord carlisle thirteen thousand pounds for a couple of years that his lordship had won at hazard and tho i blush to write it mr fox himself was notorious in such matters and was in debt to each of the coterie of fashionables of which he was the devoted chief  the faithful banks vowed with tears in his eyes that he would never desert me and in that moment of dejection the poor fellows devotion brought me no little comfort at such times the heart is bitter we look askance at our friends and make the task of comfort doubly hard for those that remain true i had a great affection for the man and had become so used to his ways and unwearying service that i had not the courage to refuse his prayers to go with me to america i had not a farthing of my ownhe would serve me for nothingnay work for me sure he said taking off my coat and bringing me my gownsure your honour was not made to work to cheer me he went on with some foolish footmans gossip that there lacked not ladies with jointures who would marry me and be thankful i smiled sadly  that was when i was mr carvels heir banks  and your face and figure sir and masterful ways faith and what more would a lady want bankss notions of morality were vague enough and he would have had me sink what i had left at hazard at almacks he had lived in this atmosphere alas there was little chance of my ever regaining the position i had held but yesterday i thought of the sponginghouse and my brow was moist england was no place in those days for fallen gentlemen with us in the colonies the law offered itself mr swain and other barristers of annapolis came to my mind for god had given me courage i would try the law for i had small hopes of defeating my uncle grafton  the sunday morning dawned brightly and the church bells ringing brought me to my feet and out into piccadilly in the forlorn hope that i might see my lady on her way to morning servicesee her for the last time in life perhaps her locket i wore over my heart it had lain upon hers to see her was the most exquisite agony in the world but not to see her and to feel that she was scarce quarter of a mile away was beyond endurance i stood beside an area at the entrance to arlington street and waited for an hour quite in vain watching every face that passed townsmen in their illfitting sunday clothes and fine ladies with the footmen carrying velvet prayerbooks and some that i knew only stared and others gave me distant bows from their coach windows for those that fall from fashion are dead to fashion  dorothy did not go to church that day  it is a pleasure my dears when writing of that hour of bitterness to record the moments of sweetness which lightened it as i climbed up to my rooms in dover street i heard merry sounds above and a cloud of smoke blew out of the door when i opened it  here he is cried mr fox you see richard we have not deserted you when we can win no more of your money  why egad the man looks as if he had had a calamity said mr fitzpatrick  and there is not a jew here fox continued tho it is sunday the air in my jerusalem chamber is as bad as in any crimps den in st giless slife and i live to be forty i shall have as many underground avenues as his majesty louis the eleventh  he must have a place put in my lord carlisle  we must do something for him said fox albeit he is an american and a whig and all the rest of the execrations thou wilt have to swallow thy golden opinions my buckskin when we put thee in office  i was too overwhelmed even to protest  you are not in such a cursed bad way when all is said richard said fitzpatrick charles when he loses a fortune immediately borrows another  if you stick to whist and quinze said charles solemnly giving me the advice they were forever thrusting upon him and play with system you may make as much as four thousand a year sir  and this was how i was treated by those heathen and cynical macaronies mr foxs friends i may not say the same for the whole of brookss club tho i never darkened its doors afterwards but i encountered my lord march that afternoon and got only a blank stare in place of a bow  charles had collected heaven knows how the thousand pounds which he stood in my debt and mr storer and lord carlisle offered to lend me as much as i chose i had some difficulty in refusing and more still in denying charles when he pressed me to go with them to richmond where he had rooms for play over sunday  banks brought me the news that lord comyn was sitting up and had been asking for me that day that he was recovering beyond belief but i was resolved not to go to brook street until the money affairs were settled on monday with mr dix for i knew well that his lordship would insist upon carrying out with the agent the contract he had so generously and hastily made rather than let me pay an abnormal interest  on monday i rose early and went out for a bit of air before the scene with mr dix returning i saw a coach with his lordships arms on the panels and there was comyn himself in my great chair at the window where he had been deposited by banks and his footman i stared as on one risen from the dead  why jack what are you doing here i cried  he replied very offhand as was his manner at such times  blicke vows that chartersea and lewis have qualified for the college of surgeons says he they are both born anatomists your job under the arm was the worst bungle of the two egad for lewis put his sword pat as you please between two of my organs cursed if i know their names and not so much as scratched one  look you jack said i i am not deceived you have no right to be here and you know it  tush answered his lordship i am as well as you and he took snuff to prove the assertion why the devil was you not in brook street yesterday to tell me that your uncle had swindled you i thought i was your friend says he and i learn of your misfortune through others  it is because you are my friend and my best friend that i would not worry you when you lay next door to death on my account i said with emotion  and just then banks announced mr dix  let him wait said i greatly disturbed  show him up said my lord peremptorily  no no i protested he can wait we shall have no business now  but banks was gone and i found out long afterward that it was put up between them  the agent swaggered in with that easy assurance he assumed whenever he got the upper hand he was the wouldbe squire once again in topboots and a frock i have rarely seen a man put out of countenance so easily as was mr dix that morning when he met his lordships fixed gaze from the armchair  and so you are turned jew says he tapping his snuffbox before you go ahead so fast again you will please to remember dn you that mr carvel is the kind that does not lose his friends with his fortune  mr dix made a salaam which was so ludicrous in a squire that my lord roared with laughter and i feared for his wound  a man must live my lord sputtered the agent his discomfiture was painful  at the expense of another says comyn dryly that is your motto in change alley  if you will permit jack i must have a few words in private with mr dix i cut in uneasily  his lordship would be damned first i am not accustomed to be thwarted richard i tell you ask the dowager if i have not always had my way i am not going to stand by and see a man who saved my life fall into the clutches of an usurer yes i said usurer mr dix my attorney mr kennett of lincolns inn has instructions to settle with you  and despite all i could say he would not budge an inch at last i submitted under the threat that he would never after have a word to say to me by good luck when i had paid into mr dixs hand the thousand pounds i had received from charles fox and cleared my outstanding bills the sum i remained in comyns debt was not greatly above seven hundred pounds and that was the end of mr dix for me when he had backed himself out in chagrin at having lost his ten per centum my feelings got the better of me the water rushed to my eyes and i turned my back upon his lordship to conceal his own emotions he fell to swearing like mad  fox will get you something he said at length when he was a little calmed  i told him sadly that my duty took me to america  and dorothy he said you will leave her  i related the whole miserable story all save the part of the locket for i felt that i owed it him his excitement grew as he listened until i had to threaten to stop to keep him quiet but when i had done he saw nothing but good to come of it  ods life richard lad come here he cried give me your hand why you ass you have won a thousand times over what you lost she loves you did i not say so and as for that intriguing little puppy her father you have pulled his teeth egad she heard what you said to him you tell me then he will never deceive her again my word ont and chartersea may come back to london and be damned      chapter xliii annapolis once more  three days after that i was at sea in the norfolk packet with the farewells of my loyal english friends ringing in my ears captain graham the master of the packet and his passengers found me but a poor companion but they had heard of my misfortune and vied with each other in heaping kindnesses upon me nor did they intrude on my walks in the night watches to see me slipping a locket from under my waistcoatay and raising it to my lips twas no doubt a blessing that i had lesser misfortunes to share my attention god had put me in the way of looking forward rather than behind and i was sure that my friends in annapolis would help me to an honest living and fight my cause against grafton  banks was with me the devoted soul did his best to cheer me tho downcast himself at leaving england to know what to do with him gave me many an anxious moment i doubted not that i could get him into a service but when i spoke of such a thing he burst into tears and demanded whether i meant to throw him off nor was any argument of mine of use  after a fair and uneventful voyage of six weeks i beheld again my native shores in the low spits of the virginia capes the sand was very hot and white and the waters of the chesapeake rolled like oil under the july sun we were all day getting over to yorktown the ships destination a schooner was sailing for annapolis early the next morning and i barely had time to get off my baggage and catch her we went up the bay with a fresh wind astern which died down at night  the heat was terrific after england and the seavoyage and we slept on the deck and banks sat most of the day exclaiming at the vast scale on which this new country was laid out and wondering at the myriad islands we passed some of them fair with grain and tobacco and at the lowlying shores clothed with forests and broken by the salt marshes with now and then the manorhouse of some gentlemanplanter visible on either side late on the second day i beheld again the cliffs that mark the mouth of the severn then the saildotted roads and the roofs of annapolis  we landed banks and i in a pinnace from the schooner and so full was my heart at the sight of the old objects that i could only gulp now and then and utter never a word there was the dock where i had paced up and down near the whole night when dolly had sailed away and pryse the coachmakers shop and the little balcony upon which i had stood with my grandfather and railed in a boyish tenor at mr hood the sun cast sharp black shadows and it being the middle of the dull season when the quality were at their seats and the dinnerhour besides the town might have been a deserted one for its stillness as tho the inhabitants had walked out of it and left it so i made my way banks behind me into church street past the ship tavern which brought memories of the brawl there and of captain clapsaddle forcing the mob like chaff before his sword the bees were humming idly over the sweetscented gardens and farris the clockmaker sat at his door and nodded he jerked his head as i went by with a cry of lord it is mr richard back and i must needs pause to let him bow over my hand farther up the street i came to mine host of the coffee house standing on his steps with his hands behind his back  mr claude i said  he looked at me as tho i had risen from the dead  god save us he shouted in a voice that echoed through the narrow street god save us  he seemed to go all to pieces to my bated questions he replied at length when he had got his breath that captain clapsaddle had come to town but the day before and was even then in the coffeeroom at his dinner alone yes alone almost tottering i mounted the steps and turned in at the coffeeroom door and stopped there sat the captain at a table the roast and wine untouched before him his waistcoat thrown open he was staring out of the open window into the inn garden beyond with its shade of cherry trees mr claudes cry had not disturbed his reveries nor our talk after it i went forward i touched him on the shoulder and he sprang up and looked once into my face and by some trick of the mind uttered the very words mr claude had used  god save us richard and he opened his arms and strained me to his great chest calling my name again and again while the tears coursed down the furrows of his cheeks for i marked the furrows for the first time and the wrinkles settling in his forehead and around his eyes what he said when he released me nor my replies can i remember now but at last he called in his ringing voice to mine host  a bottle from your choicest bin claude some of mr bordleys for he that was lost is found  the hundred questions i had longed to ask were forgotten a peace stole upon me that i had not felt since i had looked upon his face before the wine was brought by mr claude and opened and it was mine host who broke the silence and the spell  your very good health mr richard he said and may you come to your own again  i drink it with all my heart richard replied captain daniel but he glanced at me sadly and his honest nature could put no hope into his tone we have got him back again mr claude and god has answered our prayers so let us be thankful and he sat down in silence gazing at me in pity and tenderness while mr claude withdrew i can give you but a sad welcome home my lad he said presently with a hesitation strange to him tis not the first bad news i have had to break in my life to your family but i pray it may be the last he paused i knew he was thinking of the black tidings he had once brought my mother richard your grandfather is dead he ended abruptly  i nodded wonderingly  what he exclaimed you have heard already  mr manners told me in london i said completely mystified  london he cried starting forward london and mr manners have you been to london  you had my letters to mr carvel i demanded turning suddenly sick  his eye flashed  never a letter we mourned you for dead richard this is graftons work he cried springing to his feet and striking the table with his great fist so that the dishes jumped grafton carvel the prettiest villain in these thirteen colonies oh we shall hang him some day  then mr carvel died without knowing that i was safe i interrupted  on that ill lay all my worldly goods replied captain daniel emphatically if any letters came to marlboro street from you mr carvel never dropped eyes on em  what a fool was i not to have written you i groaned  he drew his chair around the table and close to mine  had the news that you escaped death been cried aloud in the streets my lad twould never have got to your grandfathers ear he said in lower tones i will tell you what happened tho i have it at second hand being in the north as you may remember grafton came in from kent and invested marlboro street he himself broke the news to mr carvel who took to his bed leiden was not in attendance you may be sure but that quackdoctor drake swain sent me a message and i killed a horse getting here from new york but i could no more gain admittance to your grandfather richard than to king george the third i was met in the hall by that crocodile who told me with too many fair words that i could not see my old friend that for the present dr drake denied him everybody then i damned dr drake and grafton too and i let him know my suspicions he ordered me off richardfrom that house which has been my only home for these twenty years his voice broke  mr carvel thought me dead then  and most mercifully your black hugo when he was somewhat recovered swore he had seen you killed and carried off sooth they say there was blood enough on the place but we spared no pains to obtain a clew of you i went north to boston and lloyds factor south to charleston but no trace of the messenger who came to the coffee house after you could we find hell had opened and swallowed him and mark this for consummate villany grafton himself spent no less than five hundred pounds in advertising and the like  and he is not suspected i asked this was the same question i had put to mrs manners it caused the captain to flare up again  tis incredible how a rogue may impose upon men of worth and integrity if he but know how to smirk piously and never miss a service and then he is an exceeding rich man riches cover a multitude of sins in the most virtuous community in the world your aunt caroline brought him a pretty fortune you know we had ominous times this spring with the associations forming and the good intent and the rest being sent back to england his excellency was at his wits end for support it was grafton carvel who helped him most and spent money like tobacco for the kings cause which being interpreted was for his own advancement but i believe colonel lloyd suspects him tho he has never said as much to me i have told mr swain under secrecy what i think he is one of the ablest lawyers that the colony owns richard and a stanch friend of yours he took your case of his own accord but he says we have no foothold as yet  when i asked if there was a will the captain rapped out an oath  sdeath yes he cried a will in favour of grafton and his heirs witnessed by dr drake they say and another scoundrel your name does not occur throughout the length and breadth of it you were dead but you will have to ask mr swain for those particulars my dear old friend was sadly gone when he wrote it i fear for he never lacked shrewdness in his best days nor added captain daniel with force nor did he want for a proper estimation of grafton  he has never been the same since that first sickness i answered sadly  when the captain came to speak of mr carvels death the son and daughter he loved and the child of his old age in the grave before him he proceeded brokenly and the tears blinded him mr carvels last words will never be known my dears they sounded in the unfeeling ears of the serpent grafton twas said that he was seen coming out of his fathers house an hour after the demise a smile on his face which he strove to hide with a pucker of sorrow but by gods grace mr allen had not read the prayers the rector was at last removed from annapolis and had obtained the fat living of frederick which he coveted  as i hope for salvation the captain concluded i will swear there is not such another villain in the world as grafton the imagination of a fiend alone could have conceived and brought to execution the crime he has committed and the borgias were children to him twas not only the love of money that urged him but hatred of you and of your father that was his strongest motive i believe however the days are coming lad when he shall have his reward unless all signs fail and we have had enough of sober talk said he pressing me to eat faith but just now when you came in i was thinking of you richard andgod forgive me complaining against the lot of my life and thinking now that you were taken out of it and your father and mother and grandfather gone how little i had to live for now you are home again says he his eyes lighting on me with affection i count the gray hairs as nothing let us have your story and be merry nay i might have guessed you had been in london with your fine clothes and your english servant  twas a long story as you know my dears he lighted his pipe and laid his big hand over mine and filled my glass and i told him most of that which had happened to me but i left out the whole of that concerning mr manners and the duke of chartersea nor did i speak of the sponginghouse i believe my only motive for this omittance was a reluctance to dwell upon dorothy and a desire to shield her father for her sake he dropped many a vigorous exclamation into my pauses but when i came to speak of my friendship with mr fox his brow clouded over  ads heart he cried ads heart and so you are turned tory and have at last been perverted from those principles for which i loved you most in the old days my conscience would not allow me to advise you richard and now that i am free to speak you are past advice  i laughed aloud  and what if i tell you that i made friends with his grace of grafton and lord sandwich and was invited to hichinbroke his lordships seat said i  his honest face was a picture of consternation  now the good lord deliver us he exclaimed fervently sandwich grafton the devil  i gave myself over to the first real merriment i had had since i had heard of mr carvels death  and when mr fox learned that i had lost my fortune i went on he offered me a position under government  have you not friends enough at home to care for you sir he said his face getting purple are you jack carvels son or are you an impostor  i am jack carvels son dear captain daniel and that is why i am here i replied i am a stouter whig than ever and i believe i might have converted mr fox himself had i remained at home sufficiently long i added with a solemn face and for my own edification i related how i had bearded his majestys friends at brookss whereat he gave a great joyful laugh and thumped me on the back  you dog richard you sly rogue and he called to mr claude for another bottle on the strength of that and we pledged the association he peppered me with questions concerning junius and mr wilkes and mr franklin of philadelphia had i seen him in london i would not doubt a carvels word says the captain always excepting grafton and his line as usual but you may duck me on the stool and i comprehend why mr fox and his friends took up with such a young rebel rapscallion as youand after the speech you made em  i astonished him vastly by pointing out that mr fox and his friends cared a deal for place and not a fig for principle that my frankness had entertained rather than offended them and that having a taste for a bit of wild life and the money to gratify it and being of a tolerant easy nature withal i had contrived to make many friends in that set without aiming at influence whereat he gave me another lick between the shoulders  it was so with jack he cried thou art a replica he would have made friends with the devil himself in the french war when all the rest of us royal americans were squabbling with his majestys officers out of england and cursing them at mess they could never be got to fight with jack tho he gave them ample provocation there was tetherington of the 22d footwho jeered us for damned provincials and swaggered through three duels in a weekwould enter no quarrel with him i can hear him say damn you carvel you may slap my face and you will or walk in ahead of me at the generals dinner and you will but i like you too well to draw at you i would not miss your company at table for all the world and when he was killed captain daniel continued lowering his voice some of them cried like women tetherington among emand swore they would rather have lost their commissions at high play  we sat talking until the summers dusk grew on apace and one thing this devoted lover of my family told me which lightened my spirits of the greatest burden that had rested upon them since my calamity befell me i had dwelt at length upon my lord comyn and upon the weight of his services to me and touched upon the sum which i stood in his debt the captain interrupted me  one day before your mother died she sent for me said he and i came to carvel hall you were too young to remember it was in september and she was sitting on the seat under the oak she loved so wellby dr hilliards study  the lace shawl your father had given her was around her shoulders and upon her face was the smile that gave me a pang to see for it had something of heaven in it richard she called me daniel then for the second time in her life she bade me be seated beside her daniel she said when i am gone and father is gone it is you who will take care of richard i sometimes believe all may not be well then and that he will need you i knew she was thinking of grafton said the captain i have a little money of my own daniel which i have saved lately with this in view i give it into your charge and if trouble comes to him my old friend you will use it as you see fit  it was a bit under a thousand pounds richard and when she died i put it out under mr carrolls direction at safe interest so that you have enough to discharge your debt and something saved against another emergency  he fell silent sunk into one of those reveries which the memory of my mother awoke in him my own thoughts drifted across the sea i was again at the top of the stairs in arlington street and feeling the dearest presence in the world the pale oval of dorothys face rose before me and the troubled depths of her blue eyes and i heard once more the tremble in her voice as she confessed in words of which she took no heed that love for which i had sought in vain  the summer dusk was gathering outside under the cherry trees i saw banks holding forth to an admiring circle of negro ostlers and presently mr claude came in to say that shaw the town carpenter and sol mogg the ancient sexton of st annes and several more of my old acquaintances were without and begged the honour of greeting me     chapter xliv noblesse oblige  i lay that night in captain clapsaddles lodgings opposite and slept soundly banks was on hand in the morning to assist at my toilet and was greatly downcast when i refused him this privilege for the first time captain daniel was highly pleased with the honest fellows devotion in following me to america to cheer him he began to question him as to my doings in london and the first thing of which banks must tell was of the ridingcontest in hyde park which i had omitted it is easy to imagine how this should have tickled the captain who always had my horsemanship at heart and when it came to charterseas descent into the serpentine i thought he would go into apoplexy for he had put on flesh with the years  the news of my return had spread all over town so that i had a deal more handshaking to do when we went to the coffee house for breakfast all the quality were in the country of course save only four gentlemen of the local patriots committee of which captain daniel was a member and with whom he had an appointment at ten it was mr swain who arrived first of the four  this old friend of my childhood was a quiet man i may not have specified thin and a little under stature with a receding but thoughtful forehead but he could express as much of joy and welcome in his face and manner as could captain daniel with his heartier ways  it does me good to see you lad he said pressing my hand i heard you were home and sent off an express to patty and the mother last night  and are they not here i asked with disappointment  mr swain smiled  i have done a rash thing since i saw you richard and bought a little plantation in talbot next to singletons it will be my ruin he added a lawyer has no business with landed ambitions  a little plantation echoed the captain ods life he has bought one of his lordships own manorsas good an estate as there is in the province  you overdo it daniel said he reprovingly  at that moment there was a stir in the doorway and in came mr carroll the barrister and mr bordley and colonel lloyd these gentlemen gave me such a welcome as those warmhearted planters and lawyers knew how to bestow  what he cried mr lloyd im stamped and taxed if it isnt young richard carvel himself well says he i know one who will sleep easier o nights nowone clapsaddle the gray hairs are forgot daniel we had more todo over your disappearance than when mr worthington lost his musical nigger where a deuce have you been sir  he shall tell us when we come back said mr bordley he has brought our worthy association to a standstill once and now we must proceed about our business will you come richard i believe you have proved yourself a sufficiently good patriot and in this very house  we went down church street i walking behind with colonel lloyd and so proud to be in such company that i cared not a groat whether grafton had my acres or not i remembered that the committee all wore plain and sober clothes and carried no swords mr swain alone had a wig i had been away but seven months and yet here was a perceptible change in these dignified and determined gentlemen england had more to fear than in all the mobs at mr wilkess back how i wished that charles fox might have been with me  the sun beat down upon the street the shopkeepers were gathered at their doors but their chattering was hushed as the dreaded committee passed more than one apparently had tasted of its discipline colonel lloyd whispered to me to keep my countenance that they were not after very large game that morningonly chipchase the butcher and presently we came upon the rascal putting up his shutters in much precipitation although it was noon he had shed his bloodstained smock and breeches and donned his sunday besta white thickset coat country cloth jacket blue broadcloth breeches and white shirt a grizzled cut wig sat somewhat awry under his bearskin hat when he perceived mr carroll at his shoulder he dropped his shutter against the wall and began bowing frantically  you keep good hours master chipchase remarked colonel lloyd  and lose good customers mr swain added laconically  the butcher wriggled  your honours must know there be little selling when the gentry be out of town and i was to take a holiday today to see my daughter married  you will have a feast my good man captain daniel asked  to be sure your honour a feast  and any little ewelambs says mr bordley very innocent  master chipchase turned the colour of his meat and his wit failed him  fourthly recited mr carroll with an exceeding sober face fourthly that we will not kill or suffer to be killed or sell or dispose to any person whom we have reason to believe intends to kill any ewelamb that shall be weaned before the first day of may in any year during the time aforesaid have you ever heard anything of that sound mr chipchase  mr chipchase had and if their honours pleased he had a defence to make if their honours would but listen and if their honours but knew he was as good a patriot as any in the province and sold his wool to peter psalter and he wore the homespun in winter then mr carroll drew a paper from his pocket and began to read mr thomas hincks personally known to me deposeth and saith  master chipchases knees gave from under him  and your honours please he cried piteously i killed the lamb but twas at mr grafton carvels order who was in town with his excellency here mr swain and the captain glanced significantly at me and i lose mr carvels custom there is twelve pounds odd gone a year your honours and i am a poor man sirs  who is it owns your shop my man asks mr bordley very sternly  oh i beg your honours will not have me put out  the wailing of his voice had drawn a crowd of idlers and brother shopkeepers who seemed vastly to enjoy the knaves discomfiture amongst them i recognized my old acquaintance weld now a rival butcher he pushed forward boldly  and your honours please said he he has sold lamb to half the tory gentry in annapolis  a lie cried chipchase a lie as god hears me  now captain clapsaddle was one who carried his loves and his hatreds to the grave and he had never liked weld since the day six years gone by he had sent me into the ship tavern and when weld heard the captains voice he slunk away without a word  have a care master weld says he in a quiet tone that boded no good there is more evidence against you than you will like  master chipchase after being frightened almost out of his senses was pardoned this once by captain daniels influence we went thence to mr hildreths shop he was suspected of having got tea out of a south river snow then to mr jacksons and so on twas after two when we got back to the coffee house and sat down to as good a dinner as mr claude could prepare and now cried colonel lloyd we shall have your adventures richard i would that your uncle were here to listen to them he added dryly  i recited them very much as i had done the night before and i warrant you my dears that they listened with more zest and eagerness than did mr walpole but they were all shrewd men and kept their suspicions if they had any to themselves captain daniel would have me omit nothingmy intimacy with mr fox the speech at brookss club and the ridingmatch at hyde park  what say you to that gentlemen he cried egad ill be sworn he deserves creditan arrant young spark out of the colonies scarce turned nineteen defeating a duke of the realm on horseback and preaching the gospel of no taxation at brookss club nor the favour of sandwich or march could turn him from his principles  modesty my dears does not permit me to picture the enthusiasm of these good gentlemen who bore the responsibility of the colony of maryland upon their shoulders they made more of me than i deserved in vain did i seek to explain that if a young man was but wellborn and had a full purse and a turn for high play his principles might go hang for all mr fox cared colonel lloyd commanded that the famous rose punchbowl be filled to the brim with mr claudes best summer brew and they drank my health and my grandfathers memory it mattered little to them that i was poor they vowed i should not lose by my choice mr bordley offered me a home and added that i should have employment enough in the days to come mr carroll pressed me likewise and bighearted colonel lloyd desired to send me to kings college as was my grandfathers wish where will fotheringay and my cousin philip had been for a term i might make a barrister of myself mr swain alone was silent and thoughtful but i did not for an instant doubt that he would have done as much for me  before we broke up for the evening the gentlemen plied me with questions concerning the state of affairs in england and the temper of his majesty and parliament i say without vanity that i was able to enlighten them not a little for i had learned a deeper lesson from the set into which i had fallen in london than if i had become the confidant of rockingham himself america was a long way from england in those days i regretted that i had not arrived in london in time to witness lord chathams dramatic return to politics in january when he had completed the work of junius and broken up the grafton ministry but i told them of the debate i had heard in st stephens and made them laugh over mr foxs rescue of the kings friends and the hustling of mr burke from the lords  they were very curious too about mr manners and i was put to much ingenuity to answer their queries and not reveal my own connection with him they wished to know if it were true that some nobleman had flung a bottle at his head in a rage because dorothy would not marry him as dr courtenays letter had stated i replied that it was so i did not add that it was the same nobleman who had been pitched into the serpentine nor did i mention the fight at vauxhall i made no doubt these things would come to their ears but i did not choose to be the one to tell them mr swain remained after the other gentlemen and asked me if i would come with him to gloucester street that he had something to say to me we went the long way thither and i was very grateful to him for avoiding marlboro street which must needs bring me painful recollections he said little on the way  i almost expected to see patty come tripping down from the vinecovered porch with her needlework in her hand and the house seemed strangely empty without her mr swain had his negro romney place chairs for us under the apple tree and bring out pipes and sangaree the air was still and heavy with the flowers scent and the sun was dipping behind the low eaves of the house it was so natural to be there that i scarce realized all that had happened since last i saw the back gate in the picket fence alas little patty would never more be smuggled through it and over the wall to marlboro street mr swain recalled my thoughts  captain clapsaddle has asked me to look into this matter of the will richard he began abruptly altho we thought never to see you again we have hoped against hope i fear you have little chance for your property my lad  i replied that captain daniel had so led me to believe and thanked him for his kindness and his trouble  twas no trouble he replied quickly indeed i wish it might have been i shall always think of your grandfather with reverence and with sorrow he was a noble man and was a friend to me in spite of my politics when other gentlemen of position would not invite me to their houses it would be the greatest happiness of my life if i could restore his property to you where he would have had it go and deprive that villain your uncle of the fruits of his crime  then there is nothing to be got by contesting the will i asked  he shook his head soberly  i fear not at present said he nor can i with honesty hold out any hope to you richard your uncle by reason of his wealth is a man of undue influence with the powers of the colony even if he were not so i doubt greatly whether we should be the gainers the will is undoubtedly genuine mr carvel thought you dead and we cannot prove undue influence by grafton unless we also prove that it was he who caused your abduction do you think you can prove that  there is one witness i exclaimed who overheard my uncle and mr allen talking of south river and griggs the master of the slaver in the stables at carvel hall  and who is that demanded mr swain with more excitement than i believed him capable of  old harvey  your grandfathers coachman alas he died the day after mr carvel and was buried the same afternoon have you spoken of this  not to a soul said i  then i would not you will have to be very careful and say nothing richard let me hear what other reasons you have for believing that your uncle tried to do away with you  i told him lucidly as possible everything i have related in these pages and the admission of griggs he listened intently shaking his head now and then but not a word out of him  no he said at length nothing is there which will be admitted but enough to damn him if you yourself might be a witness i will give you the law briefly descendible estates among us are of two kinds estates in fee simple and estates in fee tail had your grandfather died without a will his estate which we suppose to be in fee simple would have descended to you as the son of his eldest son according to the fourth of the canons of descent in blackstone but with us fee simple estates are devisable and mr carvel was wholly within his right in cutting off the line of his eldest son do you follow me  i nodded  there is one chance he continued and that is a very slim one i said that mr carvels estate was supposed to be in fee simple estates tail are not devisable our system of registration is far from infallible and sometimes an old family settlement turns up to prove that a property which has been willed out of the direct line as in fee simple is in reality entailed is there a possibility of any such document  i replied that i did not know my grandfather had never brought up the subject  we must bend our efforts in that direction said the barrister i shall have my clerks make a systematic search  he ceased talking and sat sipping his sangaree in the abstracted manner common to him i took the opportunity to ask about his family thinking about what dolly had said of pattys illness  the mother is as well as can be expected richard and patty very rosy with the country air your disappearance was a great shock to them both  and tom  he went behind his reserve tom is a dd rake he exclaimed with some vehemence i have given him over he has taken up with that macaroni courtenay who wins his moneyor rather my moneyand your cousin philip when he is home from kings college how tom can be son of mine is beyond me in faith i see him about once in two months when he comes here with a bill for his satins and his ruffles and along face of repentance and a lot of gaming debts to involve my honour and that reminds me richard said he looking straight at me with his clear dark eyes have you made any plans for your future  i ventured to ask his advice as to entering the law  as the only profession open to a gentleman he replied smiling a little no you were no more cut out for an attorney or a barrister or a judge than was i for a macaroni doctor the time is not far away my lad he went on seeing my shame and confusion when an american may amass money in any way he chooses and still be a gentleman behind a counter if he will  i do not fear work mr swain i remarked with some pride  that is what i have been thinking he said shortly and i am not a man to make up my mind while you count three richard i have the place in talbot and no one to look after it andand in short i think you are the man  he paused to watch the effect of this upon me but i was so taken aback by this new act of kindness that i could not say a word  tom is fast going to the devil as i told you he continued he cannot be trusted if i die that estate shall be pattys and he may never squander it captain daniel tells me and mr bordley also that you managed at carvel hall with sense and ability i know you are very young but i think i may rely upon you  again he hesitated eying me fixedly  ah said he with his quiet smile it is the old noblesse oblige how many careers has it ruined since the world began     chapter xlv the house of memories  i was greatly touched and made mr swain many awkward acknowledgments which he mercifully cut short i asked him for a while to think over his offer this seemed to please rather than displease him and my first impulse on reaching the inn was to ask the captains advice i thought better of it however and at length resolved to thrash out the matter for myself  the next morning as i sat reflecting an overwhelming desire seized me to go to marlboro street hitherto i could not have borne the sight of the old place i gulped down my emotion as the gate creaked behind me and made my way slowly to the white seat under the big chestnut behind the house where my grandfather had been wont to sit reading his prints in the warm weather the flowers and the hedges had grown to a certain wildness and the smell of the american roses carried me backas odours willto longforgotten and trivial scenes here i had been caned many a day for mr daakens reports and for earlier offences and i recalled my mother as she once ran out at the sound of my cries to beg me off so vivid was that picture that i could hear mr carvel say he is yours madam not mine take him  i started up the house was still the sun blistering the green paint of the shutters my eye was caught by those on the room that had been hers and which by my grandfathers decree had lain closed since she left it the image of it grew in my mind the mahogany bed with its poppy counterpane and creamy curtains and the steps at the side by which she was wont to enter it and the priedieu whence her soul had been lifted up to god and the dresser with her china and silver upon it covered by years of dust for i had once stolen the key from williss bunch crept in and crept out again awed that chamber would be profaned now and those dear ornaments which were mine violated the imagination choked me  i would have them i must nothing easier than to pry open a door or window in the north wing by the ballroom when i saw grafton i would tell him nay i would write him that day i was even casting about me for an implement when i heard a step on the gravel beside me  i swung around and came face to face with my uncle  he must have perceived me and after the first shock of my surprise had passed i remarked a bearing on him that i had not seen before he was master of the situation at lastso it read the realization gave him an easier speech than ever  i thought i might find you here richard he said since you were not at the coffee house  he did not offer me his hand i could only stare at him for i had expected anything but this  i came from carvel hall to get you he proceeded smoothly enough i heard but yesterday of your return and some of your miraculous adventures your recklessness has caused us many a trying day richard and i believe killed your grandfather you have paid dearly and have made us pay dearly for your mad frolic of fighting cutthroats on the highroad  the wonder was that i did not kill him on the spot i cannot think what possessed the manhe must have known me better  my recklessness i shouted fairly hoarse with anger i paid no heed to mr swains warning you dd scoundrel i cried it was you killed him and you know it when you had put me out of the way and he was in your power you tortured him to death you forced him to die alone with your sneering face while your shrew of a wife counted cards downstairs grafton carvel god knows you better than i who know you two well and he will punish you as sure as the crack of doom  he heard me through giving back as i came forward his face blanching only a little and wearing all the time that yellow smile which so fitted it  you have finished says he  ay i have finished and now you may order me from this ground you have robbed me of but there are some things in that house you shall not steal for they are mine despite you  name them richard he said very sorrowful  the articles in my mothers room which were hers  you shall have them this day he answered  it was his way never to lose his temper tho he were called by the vilest name in the language he must always assume this pious grief which made me long to throttle him he had the best of me even now as he took the great key from his pocket  will you look at them before you go he asked  at first i was for refusing then i nodded he led the way silently around by the front and after he had turned the lock he stepped aside with a bow to let me pass in ahead of him once more i was in the familiar hall with the stairs dividing at the back it was cool after the heat and musty and a touch of death hung in the prisoned air we paused for a moment on the landing beside the high triplearched window which the branches tapped on windy winter days while grafton took down the bunch of keys from beside the clock i thought of my dear grandfather winding it every sunday and his ruddy face and large figure as he stood glancing sidewise down at me then the sound of graftons feet upon the bare steps recalled the present  we passed mr carvels room and went down the little corridor over the ballroom until we came to the fullstoried wing my uncle flung open the window and shutters opposite and gave me the key a delicacy not foreign to him held him where he was time had sealed the door and when at last it gave before my strength a shower of dust quivered in the ray of sunlight from the window i entered reverently i took only the silverbound prayerbook cast a lingering look at the old familiar objects dimly defined and came out and locked the door again i said very quietly that i would send for the things that afternoon for my anger was hushed by what i had seen  we halted together on the uncovered porch in front of the house that had a seat set on each side of it marlboro street was still the wide trees which flanked it spreading their shade over walk and roadway not a soul was abroad in the midday heat and the windows of the long house opposite were sightless  richard said my uncle staring ahead of him i came to offer you a home and you insult me brutally as you have done unreproved all your life and yet no one shall say of me that i shirk my duty but first i must ask you if there is aught else you desire of me  the black boy hugo is mine i said i had no great love for hugo save for associations sake and i had one too many servants as it was but to rescue one slave from graftons clutches was charity  you shall have him he replied and your chaise and your wardrobe and your horses and whatever else i have that belongs to you as i was saying i will not shirk my duty the memory of my dear father and of what he would have wished will not permit me to let you go abegging you shall be provided for out of the estate despite what you have said and done  this was surely the quintessence of a rogues imagination instinctively i shrank from him with a show of piety that turned me sick he continued  let god witness that i carry out my fathers will  stop there grafton carvel i cried you shall not take his name in vain under this guise of holiness you and your accomplice have done the devils own work and the devil will reward you  this reference to mr allen i believe frightened him for a second only did he show it  mymy accomplice sir he stammered and then righting himself you will have to explain this by heaven  in ample time your plot shall be laid bare and you and his reverence shall hang or lie in chains  you threaten mr carvel he shouted nearly stepping off the porch in his excitement  nay i predict i replied calmly and i went down the steps and out of the gate he looking after me before i had turned the corner of freshwater lane he was in the seat and fanning himself with his hat  i went straight to mr swains chambers in the circle where i found the good barrister and captain daniel in their shirtsleeves seated between the windows in the back room mr swain was grave enough when he heard of my talk with grafton but the captain swore i was my fathers son for the fiftieth time since i had come back and that a man could no more help flying at graftons face than knipe could resist his legs or cynthia his back if he went into her stall i had scarce finished my recital when mr renwick the barristers clerk announced mr tucker which caused mr swain to let out a whistle of surprise  so the wind blows from that quarter daniel said he i thought so  mr tucker proved to be the pettifogger into whose hands grafton had put his affairs taking them from mr dulany at mr carvels death the man was all in a sweat and had hardly got in the door before he began to talk he had no less astonishing a proposition to make than this which he enunciated with much mouthing of the honour and sense of duty of mr grafton carvel his client offered to mr richard carvel the estate lying in kent county embracing thirtythree hundred acres more or less of arable land and woodland with a fine new house together with the indented servants and negroes and other chattels thereon mr richard carvel would observe that in making this generous offer for the welfare of his nephew mr tuckers client was far beyond the letter of his obligations wherefore mr grafton carvel made it contingent upon the acceptance of the estate that his nephew should sign a paper renouncing forever any claims upon the properties of the late mr lionel carvel this condition was so deftly rolled up in lawlatin that i did not understand a word of it until mr swain stated it very briefly in english his quiet laugh prodigiously disconcerted the pettifogger who had before been sufficiently ill at ease in the presence of the great lawyer mr tucker blew his nose loudly to hide his confusion  and what say you richard said mr swain without a shade of accent in his voice  i bowed my head i knew that the honest barrister had read my heart when he spoke of noblesse oblige that senseless pride of cast so deeprooted in those born in our province had made itself felt to be a factor so i thought for i was young was to renounce my birth until that moment of travail the doctrine of equality had seemed very pretty to me your fine gentleman may talk as nobly as he pleases over his madeira and yet would patronize monsieur rousseau if he met him and he takes never a thought of those who knuckle to him every day and clean his boots and collect his rents but when he is tried in the fire and told suddenly to collect some one elses rents and curse anothers negroes he is fainthearted for the experiment so it was with me when i had to meet the issue i might take graftons offer and the chance to marry dorothy was come again for by industry the owner of the kent lands would become rich  the room was hot and still save for the buzzing of the flies when i looked up i discovered the eyes of all three upon me  you may tell your client mr tucker that i refuse his offer i said  he got to his feet and with the customary declaration of humble servitude bowed himself out  the door was scarce closed on him when the captain had me by the hands  what said i henry he cried did i not know the lad  mr swain did not stir from his seat he was still gazing at me with a curious expression and then i saw the world in truer colour this good samaritan was not only taking me into his home but would fight for my rights with the strong brain that had lifted him out of poverty and obscurity i stood humbled before him  i would accept your kindness mr swain i said vainly trying to steady my voice but i have the faithful fellow banks who followed me here from england dependant on me and hugo whom i rescued from my uncle i will make over the black to you and you will have him  he rose brushed his eyes with his shirt and took me by the arm you and the captain dine with me today says he and as for banks i think that can be arranged now i have an estate i shall need a trained butler egad i have some affairs to keep me in town today richard but well be off for cordons pride in the morning and i know of one little girl will be glad to see us  we dined out under the apple tree in gloucester street and the captain argued in his hopeful way that tuckers visit betrayed a weak point in graftons position but the barrister shook his head and said that grafton was too shrewd a rogue to tender me an estate if he feared me it was mr swains opinion that the motive of my uncle was to put himself in a good light and perhaps he added there was a little revenge mixed therein as the kent estate was the one mr carvel had given him when he cast him off  a southerly wind was sending great rolls of fog before it as mr swain and i with banks crossed over to kent island on the ferry the next morning we traversed the island and were landed by the other ferry on the soil of my native county queen annes in due time we cantered past master dingleys tavern the sight of which gave me a sharp pang for it is there that the byroad turns over the bridge to carvel hall and wilmot house and force of habit drew my reins to the right across the horses neck so that i swerved into it the barrister had no word of comment when i overtook him again  twas about two oclock when we came to the gate mr swain had erected at the entrance to his place the land was a little rolling and partly wooded like that on the wye but the fields were prodigiously unkempt he drew up and glanced at me  you will see there is much to be done with such fallows as these said he the lessees from his lordship were sportsmen rather than husbandmen and had an antipathy to a constable or a sheriff like a rat to a boar cat that is the curse of some of your eastern shore gentlemen especially in dorchester he added they get to be fishmongers  presently we came in sight of the house long and low like the one in gloucester street with a new and unpainted wing just completed that day the mist softened its outline and blurred the trees which clustered about it even as we swung into the circle of the drive a rounded and youthful figure appeared in the doorway gave a little cry and stood immovable it was patty in a striped dimity gown with the sleeves rolled up and her face fairly shone with joy as i leaped from my horse and took her hands  so you like my surprise girl said her father as he kissed her blushing face  for answer she tore herself away and ran through the hall to the broad porch in front  our barrister is come mother we heard her exclaiming and whom do you think he has brought  is it richard asked the gentler voice more hastily than usual  i stepped out on the porch where the invalid sat in her armchair she was smiling with joy too and she held out her wasted hands and drew me toward her kissing me on both cheeks  i thank god for his goodness said she  and the boy has come to stay mother said her husband as he stooped over her  to stay cries patty  gordons pride is henceforth his home replied the barrister and now i can return in peace to my musty law and know that my plantation will be well looked after  patty gasped  oh i am so glad said she i could almost rejoice that his uncle cheated him out of his property he is to be factor of gordons pride  he is to be master of gordons pride my dear says her father smiling and tilting her chin we shall have no such persons as factors here  at that the tears forced themselves into my own eyes i turned away and then i perceived for the first time the tall form of my old friend percy singleton  may i too bid you welcome richard said he in his manly way and rejoice that i have got such a neighbour  thank you percy i answered i was not in a state to say much more  and now exclaims patty what a dinner we shall have in the prodigals honour i shall make you all some of the naples biscuit mrs brice told me of  she flew into the house and presently we heard her clear voice singing in the kitchen     chapter xlvi gordons pride  the years of a mans life that count the most are often those which may be passed quickest in the story of it and so i may hurry over the first years i spent as mr swains factor at gordons pride the task that came to my hand was heavensent  that manorhouse i am sure was the tidiest in all maryland thanks to pattys new england blood she was astir with the birds of a morning and near the last to retire at night and happy as the days were long she was ever up to her elbows in some dish and her butter and her biscuits were the best in the province little she cared to work samplers or peacocks in pretty wools tho in some way she found the time to learn the spinet as the troubles with the mother country thickened she took to a footwheel and often in the crisp autumn evenings i would hear the bumping of it as i walked to the house and turn the knob to come upon her spinning by the twilight she would have no englishmade linen in that household if mine scratch your back richard she would say you must grin and bear and console yourself with your virtue it was i saw to the flax and learned from ivie rawlinson who had come to us from carvel hall the best manner to ripple and break and swingle it and mr swain in imitation of the high example set by mr bordley had buildings put up for wheels and the looms and in due time kept his own sheep  if man or woman white or black fell sick on the place it was patty herself who tended them she knew the virtue of every herb in the big chest in the storeroom and at table she presided over her fathers guests with a womanliness that won her more admiration than mine now that the barrister was become a man of weight the house was as crowded as ever was carvel hall carrolls and pacas and dulanys and johnsons and lloyds and bordleys and brices and scotts and jennings and ridouts and colonel sharpe who remained in the province and many more families of prominence which i have not space to mention all came to gordons pride some of these as their names proclaim were of the kings side but the bulk of mr swains company were stanch patriots and toasted miss patty instead of his majesty by this i do not mean that they lacked loyalty for it is a matter of note that our colony loved king george  i must not omit from the list above the name of my good friend captain clapsaddle  nor was there lack of younger company betty tayloe who plied me with questions concerning dorothy and london but especially about the dashing and handsome lord comyn and the dulany girls and i know not how many others will fotheringay when he was home from college and archie brice and francis willard whose father was now in the assembly and half a dozen more to court patty who would not so much as look at them and when i twitted her with this she would redden and reply i was created for a housewife sir and not to make eyes from behind a fan indeed she was at her prettiest and best in the dimity frock with the sleeves rolled up  twas a very merry place the manor of gordons pride a generous bowl of punch always stood in the cool hall through which the south winds swept from off the water and fruit and sangaree and lemonade were on the table there the manor had no ballroom but the negro fiddlers played in the big parlour and the young folks danced till supper time in three months pattys suppers grew famous in a colony where there was no lack of good cooks  the sweetnatured invalid enjoyed these festivities in her quiet way and often pressed me to partake so did patty beg me and mr swain perhaps a false sense of pride restrained me but my duties held me all day in the field and often into the night when there was curing to be done or some other matters of necessity and for the rest i thought i detected a change in the tone of mr fotheringay and some others tho it may have been due to sensibility on my part i would put up with no patronage  there was no change of tone at least with the elder gentlemen they plainly showed me an added respect and so i fell into the habit after my work was over of joining them in their suppers rather than the sons and daughters there i was made right welcome the serious conversation spiced with the wit of trained barristers and men of affairs better suited my changed condition of life the times were sober and for those who could see a black cloud was on each horizon twas only a matter of months when the thunderclap was to comeindeed enough was going on within our own province to forebode a revolution the assembly to which many of these gentlemen belonged was in a righteous state of opposition to the proprietary and the council concerning the emoluments of colonial officers and of clergymen honest governor eden had the misfortune to see the justice of our side and was driven into a seventh state by his attempts to square his conscience bitter controversies were waging in the gazette and names were called and duels fought weekly for our cause the first citizen led the van and the able arguments and moderate language of his letters soon identified him as mr charles carroll of carrollton one of the greatest men maryland has ever known but even at mr swains amongst his few intimate friends mr carroll could never be got to admit his nom de guerre until long after antilon had been beaten  i write it with pride that at these suppers i was sometimes asked to speak and having been but lately to england to give my opinion upon the state of affairs there mr carroll honoured me upon two occasions with his confidence and i was made clerk to a little club they had and kept the minutes in my own hand  i went about in homespun which if good enough for mr bordley was good enough for me i rode with him over the estate this gentleman was the most accomplished and scientific farmer we had in the province having inherited his plantation on wye island near carvel hall he resigned his duties as judge and a lucrative practice to turn all his energies to the cultivation of the soil his wheat was as eagerly sought after as was colonel washingtons tobacco  it was to mr bordleys counsel that the greater part of my success was due he taught me the folly of ploughing with a flukea custom to which the eastern shore was wedded pointing out that a double surface was thus exposed to the suns rays and explained at length why there was more profit in small grain in that district than heavy tobacco he gave me dr eliots essays on field husbandry and mills husby which i read from cover to cover and i went from time to time to visit him at wye island when he would canter with me over that magnificent plantation and show me with pride the finished outcome of his experiments  mr swains affairs kept him in town the greater part of the twelve months and mrs swain and patty moved to annapolis in the autumn but for three years i was at cordons pride winter and summer alike at the end of that time i was fortunate enough to show my employer such substantial results as to earn his commendationay and his confidence which was the highest token of that mans esteem the moneys of the estate he left entirely at my order and in the spring of 73 when the opportunity was suddenly offered to buy a thousand acres of excellent wheat land adjoining i made the purchase for him while he was at williamsburg and upon my own responsibility  this connected the plantation on the east with singletons it had been my secret hope that the two estates might one day be joined in marriage for of all those who came acourting patty percy was by far the best he was but a diffident suitor he would sit with me on the lawn evening after evening when company was there while fotheringay and francis willard made their compliments withinsilly flatteries at which patty laughed  percy kept his hounds and many a run we had together in the sparkling days that followed the busy summer when the crops were safe in the bottoms or a quiet pipe and bottle in his bachelors hall after a soaking on the duck points  and this brings me to a subject on which i am loth to write where mr singleton was concerned patty the kindest of creatures was cruelty itself once when i had the effrontery to venture a word in his behalf i had been silenced so effectively as to make my ears tingle a thousand little signs led me to a conclusion which pained me more than i can express heaven is my witness that no baser feeling leads me to hint of it here every day while the garden lasted flowers were in my room and it was banks who told me that she would allow no other hands than her own to place them by my bed he got a round rating from me for violating the pledge of secrecy he had given her it was patty who made my shirts and on christmas knitted me something of comfort who stood on the horseblock in the early morning waving after me as i rode away and at my coming her eyes would kindle with a light not to be mistaken  none of these things were lost upon percy singleton and i often wondered why he did not hate me he was of the kind that never shows a hurt force of habit still sent him to gordons pride but for days he would have nothing to say to the mistress of it or she to him     chapter xlvii visitors  it was not often that mr thomas swain honoured gordons pride with his presence he vowed that the sober whig company his father brought there gave him the vapours he snapped his fingers at the articles of the patriots association and still had his cocked hats and his brussels lace and his spyglass and his top boots when he rode abroad like any other tory buck his intimates were all of the kings sideof the worst of the kings side i should say for i would not be thought to cast any slur on the great number of conscientious men of that party but being the son of one of the main props of the whigs mr tom went unpunished for his fathers sake he was not uncondemned  up to 1774 the times that mr swain mentioned his son to me might be counted on the fingers of one hand it took not a great deal of shrewdness to guess that he had paid out many a pretty sum to keep toms honour bright as bright at least as such doubtful metal would polish tho the barrister sought my ear in many matters i never heard a whimper out of him on this score  master tom had no ambition beyond that of being a macaroni his easygoing nature led him to avoid alike trouble and responsibility hence he did not bother his head concerning my position he appeared well content that i should make money out of the plantation for him to spend his visits to gordons pride were generally in the late autumn and he brought his own company with him i recall vividly his third or fourth appearance in october of 73 well i may the family was preparing to go to town and this year i was to follow them and take from mr swains shoulders some of his private business for he had been ailing a little of late from overwork  the day of which i have spoken a storm had set in the rain falling in sheets i had been in the saddle since breakfast seeing to an hundred repairs that had to be made before the cold weather twas near the middle of the afternoon when i pulled up before the weaving house the looms were still and patty met me at the door with a grave look which i knew portended something but her first words were of my comfort  richard will you ever learn sense you have been wet all day long and have missed your dinner go at once and change your clothes sir she commanded severely  i have first to look at the warehouse where the roof is leaking i expostulated  you shall do no such thing replied she but dry yourself and march into the dining room we have had the ducks you shot yesterday and some of your experimental hominy but they are all gone  i knew well she had laid aside for me some dainty as was her habit i dismounted she gave me a quick troubled glance and said in a low voice  tom is come and oh i dare not tell you whom he has with him now  courtenay i asked  yes of coarse i hate the sight of the man but your cousin philip carvel is here richard father will be very angry and they are making a drinkingtavern of the house  i gave firefly a slap that sent her trotting stableward and walked rapidly to the house i found the three of them drinking in the hall the punch spilled over the table and staining the cards  gads life cries tom here comes puritan richard in his broad rim how goes the crop richard twill have to go well egad for i lost an hundred at the south river club last week  next him sat philip whom i had not seen since before i was carried off he was lately come home from kings college and very mysteriously his father giving out that his health was not all it should be he had not gained graftons height but he was broader and his face had something in it of his father he had his mothers under lip and complexion grafton was sallow philip was a peculiar pinknot the ruddy pink of heartier natures like my grandfathers nor yet had he the peachlike skin of mr dix philips was a darker and more solid colour and i have never seen man or woman with it and not mistrusted them he wore a red velvet coat embroidered with gold and as costly ruffles as i had ever seen in london but for all this my cousin had a coarse look and his polished blue flints of eyes were those of a coarse man  he got to his feet as tom spoke looking anywhere but at me and came forward slowly he was loyal to no one was philip not even to his father when he was got within three paces he halted  how do you cousin says he  a little wet as you perceive philip i replied  i left him and stood before the fire my rough wool steaming in the heat he sat down again a little awkwardly and the situation began to please me better  how do you i asked presently  i have got a devilish cold said he faith ill warrant the doctor will be sworn i have been but indifferent company since we left the hall eh doctor  courtenay with his feet stretched out bestowed an amiable but languid wink upon me as much as to say that i knew what mr philips company was at best when i came out after my dinner they were still sitting there courtenay yawning and tom and philip wrangling over last nights play  come my man of affairs join us a hand says the doctor to me i have known the time when you would sit from noon until supper  i had money then said i  and you have a little now or i am cursed badly mistook oons what do you fear he exclaimed you that have played with march and fox  i fear nothing doctor i answered smiling but a man must have a sorry honour when he will win fifty pounds with but ten of capital  one of dr franklins maxims i presume says he with sarcasm  and if it were it could scarce be more pat i retorted tis poor richards maxim  o lud o my soul cries tom with a hiccup and a snigger tis time you made another grand tour courtenay heres the second whig has got in on you within the week  thank god they have not got me down to osnabrig and bumbo yet replies the doctor coming over to me by the fire he tapped my sleeve and added in a low tone forbearance with such a pair of asses is enough to make a man shed bitter tears but a little of it is necessary to keep out of debt you and i will play together against both the lambs richard one of them is not far from maudlin now  thank you doctor i answered politely but i have a better way to make my living in three years i had learned a little to control my temper  he shrugged his thin shoulders eh bien mon bon says he i dare swear you know your own game better than do i and he cast a look up the stairs of which i quite missed the meaning indeed i was wholly indifferent the doctor and his like had passed out of my life and i believed they were soon to disappear from our western hemisphere the report i had heard was now confirmed that his fortune was dissipated and that he lived entirely off these young rakes who aspired to be macaronies  since your factor is become a damned lutheran tom said he returning to the table and stripping a pack it will have to be picquet you promised me we could count on a fourth or i had never left inmans  it was tom as i had feared who sat down unsteadily opposite philip lounged and watched them sulkily snuffing and wheezing and dipping into the bowl and cursing the house for a draughty barn i took a pipe on the settle to see what would come of it i was not surprised that courtenay lost at first and that tom drank the most of the punch nor was it above half an hour before the stakes were raised and the tide began to turn in the doctors favour  a plague of you courtenay cries mr tom at length flinging down the cards his voice was thick while the selwyn of annapolis was never soberer in his life tom appealed first to philip for the twenty pounds he owed him  you know how damned stingy my father is curse you whined my cousin in return i told you i should not have it till the first of the month  tom swore back he thrust his hands deep in his pockets and sank into that attitude of dejection common to drunkards suddenly he pulled himself up  shblood heres richard t draw from lemme have fifty pounds richard  not a farthing i said unmoved  you say wha shall be done with my fathers money he cried i call tha damned coolgads life i do eh courtenay  courtenay had the sense not to interfere  ill have you dishcharged gads death so i will he shouted no damned airs wi me mr carvel ill have you know youre not wha you once were but only a cursht oversheer  he struggled to his feet forgot his wrath on the instant and began to sing drunkenly the words of a ribald air i took him by both shoulders and pushed him back into his chair  be quiet i said sternly while your mother and sister are here you shall not insult them with such a song he ceased astonished and as for you gentlemen i continued you should know better than to make a place of resort out of a gentlemans house  courtenays voice broke the silence that followed  of all the cursed impertinences i ever saw egad he drawled is this your manor mr carvel or have you a seat in kent  i would not have it in black and white that i am an advocate of fighting but a that moment i was in the mood when it does not matter much one way or the other the drunken man carried us past the point  the damned inintriguing roguesh worked himself into my fathers grashes he said counting out his words hesh no more whig than me i knowsh game courtenayhe wants t marry patty thish placell be hers  the effect upon me of these words with all their hideous implication of gossip and scandal was for an instant benumbing the interpretation of the doctors innuendo struck me then i was starting forward with a hand open to clap over toms mouth when i saw the laugh die on courtenays face and him come bowing to his legs i turned with a start  on the stairs stood patty herself pale as marble  come with me tom she said  he had obeyed her from childhood this time he tried and failed miserably  beg pardon patty he stammered no offensh meant thish factor thinks h ownsh gordons now i say notll h marries you good fellow richard but infernal forward eh courtenay  philip turned away while the doctor pretended to examine the silver punchladle as for me i could only stare it was patty who kept her head and made us a stately curtsey  will you do me the kindness gentlemen said she to leave me with my brother  we walked silently into the parlour and i closed the door  slife cried courtenay shes a vision what say you philip and i might see her in that guise again egad i would forgive tom his five hundred crowns  a buxom vision agreed my cousin but i vow i like em so he had forgotten his cold  this conversation is all of a piece with the rest of your conduct said i hotly  the candles were burning brightly in the sconces the doctor walked to the glass took snuff and burnished his waistcoat before he answered  sure a fortune lies under every virtue we assume he recited but she is not for you richard says he tapping his box  mr carvel if you please i replied i felt the demon within me but i had the sense to realize that a quarrel with dr courtenay under the circumstances would be far from wise he had no intention of quarrelling however he made me a grand bow  mr carvel your very obedient hereafter i shall know better than to forget myself with an overseer and he gave me his back what say you to a game of billiards philip  philip seemed glad to escape and soon i heard their voices mingling with the click of the balls there followed for me one of the bitterest half hours i have had in my life then patty opened the hall door  will you come in for a moment richard she said quite calmly  i followed her wondering at the masterful spirit she had shown for there was tom all askew in his chair his feet one way and his hands another totally subdued what was most to the point he made me an elaborate apology how she had sobered his mind i know not his body was as helpless as the day he was born  long before the guests thought of rising the next morning patty came to me as i was having the mare saddled the sun was up and the clouds were being chased like miscreants who have played their prank and were now running for it the sharp air brought the red into her cheeks and for the first time in her life with me she showed shyness she glanced up into my face and then down at the leaves running on the ground  i hope they will go today said she when i was ready to mount  i began to tighten the girths venting my feelings on firefly until the animal swung around and made a vicious pass at my arm  richard  yes  you will not worry over that senseless speech of toms  i see it in a properer light now patty i replied i usually doin the morning  she sighed  you are sohighstrung she said i was afraid you would  i would  she did not answer until i had repeated  i was very silly she said slowly her colour mounting even higher i was afraid that you wouldleave us stroking the mares neck and with a little halt in her voice i do not know what we should do without you  indeed i was beginning to think i would better leave though where i should go was more than i could say with a quick intuition she caught my hand as i put foot in the stirrup  you will not go away she cried say you will not what would poor father do he is not so well as he used to be  the wild appeal in her eyes frightened me it was beyond resisting in great agitation i put my foot to the ground again  patty i should be a graceless scamp in truth i exclaimed i do not forget that your father gave me a home when mine was taken away and has made me one of his family i shall thank god if i can but lighten some of his burdens  but they did not depart that day nor the next nor indeed for a week after for philips cold brought on a high fever he stuck to his bed and patty herself made broth and dainties for him and prescribed him medicine out of the oak chest whence had come so much comfort at first philip thought he would die and forswore wine and cards and some other things the taste for which he had cultivated and likewise worse vices that had come to him by nature  i am greatly pleased to write that the stay profited the gallant dr courtenay nothing pattys mature beauty and her manner of carrying off the episode in the hall had made a deep impression upon the censor i read the mans mind in his eye here was a match to mend his fortunes and do him credit besides however his wit and his languishing glances and double meanings fell on barren ground no tirewoman on the plantation was busier than patty during the first few days of his stay after that he grew sulky and vented his spleen on poor tom winning more money from him at billiards and picquet since the doctor was too much the macaroni to ride to hounds and to shoot ducks time began to hang exceeding heavy on his hands  patty and i had many a quiet laugh over his predicament and to add zest to the situation i informed singleton of what was going forward he came over every night for supper and to my delight the bluff englishman was received in a fashion to make the doctor writhe and snort with mortification never in his life had he been so insignificant a person and he whose conversation was so sought after in the gay season in town was thrown for companionship upon a scarcegrown boy whose talk was about as salted and whose intellect as great as those of the cockerouse in our fable he stood it about a sennight at the end of which space philip was put on his horse willhenillhe and made to ride northward  i sat with my cousin of an evening as he lay in bed not i own from any charity on my part but from other motives which do me no credit the first night he confessed his sins and they edified me not a little on the second he was well enough to sit up and swear and to vow that miss swain was an angel that he would marry her the very next week and his father grafton were not such a stickler for family  curse him says his dutiful and loyal son he is so bally stingy with my stipend that i am in debt to half the province and i say it myself richard he has been a blackguard to you tho i allow him some little excuse you were faring better now my dear cousin and you had not given him every reason to hate you for i have heard him declare more than once pon my soul i havethat he would rather you were his friend than his enemy  my contempt for philip kept me silent here i might quarrel with grafton who had sense enough to feel pain at a well deserved thrust philip had not the intelligence to recognize insult from compliment it was but natural he should mistake my attitude now he leaned forward in his bed  hark you richard whispers he with a glance at the door i might tell you some things and i chose andand it were worth my while  worth your while i repeated vaguely  he traced nervously the figures on the counterpane next came a rush of anger to redden his face  by gad i will tell you swear to gad i will then the little cunning inherited from his father asserting itself he added look you richard i am the son of one of the richest men in the colony and i get the pittance of a backwoods pastor i tell you tis not to be borne with and i am not of as much consideration at the hall as brady the irish convict who has become overseer  i little wondered at this philip sank back and for some moments eyed me between narrowed lids he continued presently with shortened breath  i have evidencei have evidence to get you back a good share of the estate which my father will never miss and i will do it he cries suddenly bold i will do it for three thousand pounds down when you receive it  this was why he had come with tom to talbot i was so dumfounded that my speech was quite taken away then i got up and began pacing the room was it not fair to fight a scoundrel with his own weapons here at last was the witness mr swain had been seeking so long come of his own free will thenheaven help memy mind flew on as time had passed i had more than once regretted refusing the kent plantation which had put her from whom my thought never wandered within my reach again good mr swain had erred for once twas foolish indeed not to accept a portion of what was rightfully mine when no more could be got and now if what philip said was true and i doubted it not here at last was the chance come again to win her without whom i should never be happy i glanced at my cousin  gads life says he it is cheap enough i might have asked you double  so you might and have been refused i cried hotly for i believe that speech of his recalled me to my senses it has ever been an instinct with me that no real prosperity comes out of doubledealing and commerce with such a sneak sickened me go back to your father philip and threaten him and he may make you rich such as he live by blackmail and you may add and you will that the day of retribution is coming for him     chapter xlviii multum in parvo  i lost no time after getting to annapolis in confiding to mr swain the conversation i had had with my cousin philip and i noticed as he sat listening to my account in the library in gloucester street that the barrister looked very worn he had never been a strong man and the severe strain he had been under with the patriots business was beginning to tell  he was very thoughtful when i had finished and then told me briefly that i had done well not to take the offer tucker would have made but short work of such evidence my lad said he and i think master philip would have lied himself in and out a dozen times i cannot think what witness he would have introduced save mr allen and there is scarcely a doubt that your uncle pays him for his silence for i am told he is living in frederick in a manner far above what he gets from the parish however philip has given us something more to work on it may be that he can put hands on the messenger  i rose to go  we shall bring them to earth yet richard and i live he added and i have always meant to ask you whether you ever regretted your decision in taking gordons pride  and you live sir i exclaimed not heeding the question  he smiled somewhat sadly  of one thing i am sure my lad he continued which is that i have had no regrets about taking you mr bordley has just been here and tells me you are the ablest young man in the province you see that more eyes than mine are upon you you have proved yourself a man richard and there are very few macaronies would have done as you did i am resolved to add another little mite to your salary  the little mite was of such a substantial nature that i protested strongly against it i thought of toms demands upon him  i could afford to give you double for what you have made off the place he interrupted but i do not believe in young men having too much he sighed and turned to his work  i hesitated you have spent time and labour upon my case sir and have asked no fee  i shall speak of the fee when i win it he said dryly and not before how would you like to be clerk this winter to the committee of correspondence  i suppose my pleasure was expressed in my face  well said he i have got you the appointment without much difficulty there are many ways in which you can be useful to the party when not helping me with my affairs  this conversation gave me food for reflection during a week i was troubled about mr swain and what he had said as to not living kept running in my head as i wrote or figured for i had enough to hold me busy  in the meantime the clouds fast gathering on both sides of the atlantic grew blacker and blacker still i saw a great change in annapolis men of affairs went about with grave faces while gay and sober alike were touched by the spell the tory gentry to be sure rattled about in their gilded mahogany coaches in spite of jeers and sour looks my aunt caroline wore jewelled stomachers to the assembliesnow become dry and shrivelled entertainments she kept her hairdresser had three men in livery to her chair and a little negro in turks costume to wait on her i often met her in the streets and took a fierce joy in staring her in the eye and grafton by a sort of fate i was continually running against him he was a very busy man was my uncle and had a kind of dignified run which he used between marlboro street and the council chamber in the stadt house or the governors mansion he never did me the honour to glance at me the rev mr allen too came avisiting from frederick where he had grown stout as an alderman upon the living and its perquisites and graftons additional bounty the gossips were busy with his doings for he had his travellingcoach and servant now he went to the tory balls with my aunt once i all but encountered him on the circle but he ran into northeast street to avoid me  yes that was the winter when the wise foresaw the inevitable and the first sharp split occurred between men who had been brothers the old order of things had plainly passed and i was truly thankful that my grandfather had not lived to witness those scenes the greater part of our gentry stood firm for americas rights and they had behind them the best lawyers in america after the lawyers came the small planters and most of the mechanics the shopkeepers formed the backbone of king georges adherents the tory gentry the clergy and those holding office under the proprietor made the rest  and it was all about tea a word which since 67 had been steadily becoming the most vexed in the language the east india company had put forth a complaint they had heaven knows how many tons getting stale in london warehouses all by reason of our stubbornness and so it was enacted that all tea paying the small american tax should have a rebate of the english duties that was truly a masterstroke for parliament to give it us cheaper than it could be had at home to cause his majestys government to lose revenues for the sake of being able to say they had caught and taxed us at last the happy result is now history my dears and this is not a history tho i wish it were what occurred at boston at philadelphia and charleston has since caused englishmen as well as americans to feel proud the chief incident in annapolis i shall mention in another chapter  when it became known with us that several cargoes were on their way to the colonies excitement and indignation gained a pitch not reached since the stamp act business came to a standstill plantations lay idle and gentry and farmers flocked to annapolis and held meetings and made resolutions anew on my way of a morning from mr swains house to his chambers in the circle i would meet as many as a dozen knots of people mr claude was one of the few patriots who reaped reward out of the disturbance for his inn was crowded the assembly met appointed committees to correspond with the other colonies and was prorogued once and again many a night i sat up until the small hours copying out letters to the committees of virginia and pennsylvania and massachusetts the gentlemen were wont to dine at the coffee house and i would sit near the foot of the table taking notes of their plans twas so i met many men of distinction from the other colonies colonel washington came once he was grown a greater man than ever and i thought him graver than when i had last seen him i believe a trait of this gentleman was never to forget a face  how do you richard said he how i reddened when he called me so before all the committee i have heard your story and it does you vast credit and the gentlemen tell me you are earning laurels sir  that first winter of the tea troubles was cold and wet with us and the sun as if in sympathy with the times rarely showed his face early in february our apprehensions concerning mr swains health were realized one day without a word to any one he went to his bed where patty found him and i ran all the way to dr leidens the doctor looked at him felt his pulse and his chest and said nothing but he did not rest that night nor did patty or i  thus i came to have to do with the good barristers private affairs i knew that he was a rich man as riches went in our province but i had never tried to guess at his estate i confess the sums he had paid out in toms behalf frightened me with the advice of mr bordley and mr lloyd i managed his money as best i could but by reason of the nonimportation resolutions there was little chance for good investmentsno cargoes coming and few going i saw indeed that buying the talbot estate had been a fortunate step since the quantities of wheat we grew there might be disposed of in america  when dr leiden was still coming twice a day to gloucester street mr tom must needs get into a scrape with one of the ladies of the theatre and come to me in the circle chambers for one hundred pounds i told him in despair that i had no authority to pay out his fathers money and so you have become master sure enough he cried in a passion for he was desperate you have worked your way in vastly well egad with your whig committee meetings and speeches and now he is on his back and you have possession you choose to cut me off slife i know what will be coming next  i pulled him into mr swains private room where we would be free of the clerks yes i am master here i replied sadly enough as he stood sullenly before me i should think you would be ashamed to own it when i came to your father i was content to be overseer in talbot and thankful for his bounty tis no fault of mine but your disgrace that his son is not managing his business and supporting him in the rights of his country i am not very old tom a year older than you i believe but i have seen enough of life to prophesy your end and you do not reform  we are turned preacher he says with a sneer  god forbid but i have been in a sponginghouse and tasted the lowest dregs and if this country becomes free as i think it will some day such as you will be driven to england and die in the fleet  not while my father lives retorts he and throws aside the oiled silk cape with a london name upon it the day was rainy i groaned my responsibility lay heavy upon me and this was not my first scene with him he continued doggedlyyou have no right to deny me what is not yours twill be mine one day  you have no right to accuse me of thoughts that do not occur to men of honour i replied i am slower to anger than i once was but i give you warning now do you know that you will ruin your father in another year and you continue  he gave me no answer i reached for the ledger and turning the pages called off to him the sums he had spent  oh have done dn it he cried when i was not a third through are you or are you not to give me the money  and you are to spend it upon an actress i should have called her by a worse name  actress he shouted have you seen her in the orphan my soul she is a divinity then he shifted suddenly to whining and cringing i am ruined outright richard if i do not get it  abjectly he confessed the situation which had in it enough material for a scandal to set the town wagging for a month and the weight of it would fall as i well knew upon those who deserved it least  i will lend you the money or rather will pay it for you i said at last for i was not so foolish as to put it into his hands you shall have the sum under certain conditions  he agreed to them before they were out of my mouth and swore in a dozen ways that he would repay me every farthing he was heartily tired of the creature and true to his nature afraid of her that night when the play was over i went to her lodging and after a scene too distressing to dwell upon bought her off  i sat with mr swain many an hour that spring with patty sewing at the window open to the garden often as we talked unnoticed by her father she would drop her work and the tears glisten in her eyes for the barristers voice was not as strong as it once was and the cold would not seem to lift from his chest so this able man who might have sat in the seats of marylands high reward was stricken when he was needed most  he was permitted two visitors a day now twas mr carroll and colonel lloyd again colonel tilghman and captain clapsaddle or mr yaca and mr bordley the gentlemen took turns and never was their business so pressing that they missed their hour mr swain read all the prints and in his easier days would dictate to me his views for the committee or a letter signed brutes for mr green to put in the gazette so i became his mouthpiece at the meetings and learned to formulate my thoughts and to speak clearly  for fear of confusing this narrative my dears i have referred but little to her who was in my thoughts night and day and whose locket i wore throughout all those years next my heart i used to sit out under the stars at gordons pride with the river lapping at my feet and picture her the shining centre of all the brilliant scenes i had left and wonder if she still thought of me  nor have i mentioned that faithful correspondent and more faithful friend lord comyn as soon as ever i had obtained from captain daniel my mothers little inheritance i sent off the debt i owed his lordship twas a year before i got him to receive it he despatched the money back once saying that i had more need of it than he i smiled at this for my lord was never within his income and i made no doubt he had signed a note to cover my indebtedness  every letter comyn writ me was nine parts dolly and the rest of his sheet usually taken up with mr fox and his calamities these had fallen upon him very thick of late lord holland had been forced to pay out a hundred thousand pounds for charles and even this enormous sum did not entirely free mr fox from the discounters and the hounds the reason for this sudden onslaught was the birth of a boy to his brother stephen who was heir to the title when they told charles of it comyn wrote said he coolly my brother stes son is a second messiah born for the destruction of the jews  i saw no definite signs as yet of the conversion of this prodigy which i so earnestly hoped for he had quarrelled with north lost his place on the admiralty and presently the king had made him a lord of the treasury tho more out of fear than love once in a while when he saw comyn at almacks he would desire to be remembered to me and he always spoke of me with affection but he could be got to write to no one said my lord with kind exaggeration nor will he receive letters for fear he may get a dun  alas i got no message from dorothy nor had she ever mentioned my name to comyn he had not seen her for eight months after i left england as she had been taken to the continent for her health she came back to london more ravishing than before and i use his lordships somewhat extravagant language her suffering had stamped upon her face even more of character and power she had lost much of her levity likewise in short my lord declared she was more of the queen than ever and the mystery which hung over the vauxhall duel had served only to add to her fame  dorothy having become cognizant of mr marmadukes trickery chartersea seemed to have dropped out of the race he now spent his time very evenly between spa and derresley and paris hence i had so much to be thankful forthat with all my blunders i had saved her from his grace my lord the marquis of wells was now most conspicuous amongst her suitors comyn had nothing particular against this nobleman saying that he was a good fellow with a pretty fortune and here is a letter my dears in which he figures that i brought to cordons pride that spring                    10 south parade bath                     march 12 1774     dear richardmiss manners has come to bath with a train behind    her longer than that which followed good queen

since and started beau nash    acursing where he lies under the floor next came her serenade by    the band mr marmaduke swore they would never have done and    squirmed and grinned like punch when he thought of the fee for he    had hoped to get off with a crown i warrant you you should have    seen his face when they would accept no fee at all for the beauty    some wag has writ a verse about it

half dozen of us adorers have a mess at the bear and have    offered up a prize for the most appropriate toast on the beauty    this is in competition with mrs miller have you not heard of her

gladly in a    thatched hut and you asked her write me more news of yourself                    your ever affectionate                          comyn      ps i have had news of you through mr worthington of your    colony who is just arrived here he tells me that you    have gained a vast reputation for your plantation and likewise that    you are thought much of by the whig wiseacres and that you hold    many seditious offices he does not call them so since your    modesty will not permit you to write me any of these things i have    been imagining you driving slaves with a rawhide and seeding    runaway convicts to the mines mr w is even now paying his    respects to miss manners and i doubt not trumpeting your praises    there for he seems to like you so i have asked him to join the    bear mess one more unfortunate     ps i was near forgetting the news about charles fox he sends    you his love and tells me to let you know that he has been turned    out of norths house for good and all he is sure you will be    cursed happy over it and says that you predicted he would go over    to the whigs i can scarce believe that he will north took a    whole week to screw up his courage hs mjsty pricking him every    day and then he wrote this     sir his majesty has thought proper to order a new commission of    the treasury to be made out in which i do not see your name poor    charles he is now without money or place but as usual appears to    worry least of all of us and still reads his damned tasso for    amusement                        c  perchance he was to be the saint paul of english politics after all     chapter xlix liberty loses a friend  mr bordleys sloop took mr swain to gordons pride in may and placed him in the big room overlooking the widening river there he would lie all day long staring through the leaves at the water or listening to the sweet music of his daughters voice as she read from the pompous prints of the time gentlemen continued to come to the plantation for the barristers wisdom was sorely missed at the councils one day as i rode in from the field i found colonel lloyd just arrived from philadelphia sipping sangaree on the lawn and mopping himself with his handkerchief his jolly face was troubled he waved his hand at me  well richard says he we children are to have our first whipping at least one of us and the rest are resolved to defy our parent  boston mr lloyd i asked  yes boston he replied her port is closed and we are forbid any intercourse with her until she comes to her senses and her citizens must receive his gracious majestys troopers into their houses and if a man kill one of them by any chance he is to go to england to be tried and there is more quite as bad  tis bad enough i cried flinging myself down and patty gave me a glass in silence  ay but you must hear all said he our masters are of a mind to do the thing thoroughly canada is given some score of privileges her french roman catholics whom we fought not long since are thrown a sop and those vast territories between the lakes and the ohio and mississippi are given to quebec as a price for her fidelity and so if the worst comes to worst georges regiments will have a place to land against us  such was the news and though we were some hundreds of miles from massachusetts we felt their cause as our own there was no need of the appeal which came by smoking horses from philadelphia for the indignation of our people was roused to the highest pitch now mr swain had to take to his bed from the excitement  this is not a history my dears as i have said and time is growing short i shall pass over that dreary summer of 74 it required no very keen eye to see the breakers ahead and mr bordleys advice to provide against seven years of famine did not go unheeded war was the last thing we desired we should have been satisfied with so little we colonies and would have voted the duties ten times over had our rights been respected should any of you doubt this you have but to read the address to the king of our congress then sitting in philadelphia the quarrel was so petty and so easy of mending that you of this generation may wonder why it was allowed to run i have tried to tell you that the head of a stubborn selfish and wilful monarch blocked the way to reconciliation king george the third is alone to blame for that hatred of race against race which already hath done so much evil and i pray god that a great historian may arise whose pen will reveal the truth and reconcile at length those who are and should be brothers  by october that most beautiful month of all the year in maryland we were again in annapolis one balmy day twas a friday i believe and a gold and blue haze hung over the severnmr chase called in gloucester street to give the barrister news of the congress which he had lately left as he came down the stairs he paused for a word with me in the library and remarked sadly upon mr swains condition he looks like a dying man richard said he and we can ill afford to lose him  even as we sat talking in subdued tones the noise of a distant commotion arose we had scarce started to our feet mr chase and i when the brass knocker resounded and mr hammond was let in his wig was awry and his face was flushed  i thought to find you here he said to mr chase the anne arundel committee is to meet at once and we desire to have you with us perceiving our blank faces he added the peggy stewart is in this morning with over a ton of tea aboard consigned to the williamss  the two jumped into a chaise and i followed afoot stopped at every corner by some excited acquaintance so that i had the whole story and more ere i reached church street the way was blocked before the committee rooms and twas said that the merchants messrs williams and captain jackson of the brig were within pleading their cause  presently the news leaked abroad that mr anthony stewart the brigs owner had himself paid the duty on the detested plant some hundreds of people were elbowing each other in the street for the most part quiet and anxious until mr hammond appeared and whispered to a man at the door in all my life before i had never heard the hum of an angry crowd the sound had something ominous in it like the first meanings of a wind that is to break off great trees at their trunks then some one shouted to hanover street to hanover street well have him tarred and feathered before the sun is down the voice sounded strangely like welds they charged at this cry like a herd of mad buffalo the weaker ones trampled under foot or thrust against the wall the windows of mr aikmans shop were shattered i ran with the leaders my stature and strength standing me in good stead more than once and as we twisted into northwest street i took a glance at the mob behind me and great was my anxiety at not being able to descry one responsible person  mr stewarts house stood and stands today amid trim gardens in plain sight of the severn arriving there the crowd massed in front of it some of the boldest pressing in at the gate and spreading over the circle of lawn enclosed by the driveway they began to shout hoarsely with what voices they had left for mr stewart to come out calling him names not to be spoken and swearing they would show him how traitors were to be served i understood then the terror of numbers and shuddered a chandler a bold and violent man whose leather was covered with grease already had his foot on the steps when the frightened servants slammed the door in his face and closed the lower windows in vain i strained my eyes for some one who might have authority with them they began to pick up stones though none were thrown  suddenly a figure appeared at an upper windowa thin and wasted woman dressed in white with sad sweet features it was mrs stewart without flinching she looked down upon the upturned faces but a mob of that kind has no pity their leaders were the worst class in our province being mostly convicts who had served their terms of indenture they continued to call sullenly for the traitor then the house door opened and the master himself appeared he was pale and nervous and no wonder and his voice shook as he strove to make himself heard his words were drowned immediately by shouts of seize him seize the dd traitor a pot and a coat of hot tar  those who were nearest started forward and i with them with me twas the decision of an instant i beat the chandler up the steps and took stand in front of the merchant and i called out to them to fall back  to my astonishment they halted the skirts of the crowd were now come to the foot of the little porch i faced them with my hand on mr stewarts arm without a thought of what to do next and expecting violence there was a seconds hush then some one cried out  three cheers for richard carvel  they gave them with a will that dumfounded me  my friends said i when i had got my wits this is neither the justice nor the moderation for which our province is noted you have elected your committee of your free wills and they have claims before you  ay ay the committee they shouted mr carvel is right take him to the committee  mr stewart raised his hand  my friends he began as i had done when you have learned the truth you will not be so hasty to blame me for an offence of which i am innocent the tea was not for me the brig was in a leaky and dangerous state and had fifty souls aboard her i paid the duty out of humanity  he had come so far when they stopped him  oh a vile tory they shouted he is conniving with the council twas put up between them and they followed this with another volley of hard names until i feared that his chance was gone  you would best go before the committee mr stewart i said  i will go with mr carvel my friends he cried at once and he invited me into the house whilst he ordered his coach i preferred to remain outside  i asked them if they would trust me with mr stewart to church street  yes yes mr carvel we know you said several he has good cause to hate tories called another with a laugh i knew the voice  for shame weld i cried and i saw mcneir who was a stanch friend of mine give him a cuff to send him spinning  to my vast satisfaction they melted away save only a few of the idlest spirits who hung about the gate and cheered as we drove off mr stewart was very nervous and profuse in his gratitude i replied that i had acted only as would have any other responsible citizen on the way he told me enough of his case to convince me that there was much to be said on his side but i thought it the better part of wisdom not to commit myself the street in front of the committee rooms was empty and i was informed that a town meeting had been called immediately at the theatre in west street and i advised mr stewart to attend but through anxiety or anger or both he was determined not to go and drove back to his house without me  i had got as far as st annes halfway to the theatre when it suddenly struck me that mr swain must be waiting for news with a twinge i remembered what mr chase had said about the barristers condition and i hurried back to gloucester street much to the surprise of those i met on their way to the meeting i was greatly relieved when i arrived to find patty on the porch i knew she had never been there were her father worse after a word with her and her mother i went up the stairs  it was the hour for the barristers nap but he was awake lying back on the pillows with his eyes half closed he was looking out into the garden which was part orchard now beginning to shrivel and to brown with the first touch of frosts  that is you richard he inquired without moving what is going forward today  i toned down the news so as not to excite him and left out the occurrence in hanover street he listened with his accustomed interest but when i had done he asked no questions and lay for a long time silent then he begged me to bring my chair nearer  richardmy son said he with an evident effort i have never thanked you for your devotion to me and mine through the best years of your life it shall not go unrewarded my lad  it seemed as if my heart stood still with the presage of what was to come  may god reward you sir i said  i have wished to speak to you he continued and i may not have another chance i have arranged with mr carroll the barrister to take your cause against your uncle so that you will lose nothing when i am gone and you will see in my table in the library that i have left my property in your hands with every confidence in your integrity and ability to care for my family even as i should have done  i could not speak at once a lump rose in my throat for i had come to look upon him as a father his honest dealings his charity of which the world knew nothing and his plain and unassuming ways had inspired in me a kind of worship i answered as steadily as i might  i believe i am too inexperienced for such a responsibility mr swain would it not be better that mr bordley or mr lloyd should act  no no he said i am not a man to do things unadvisedly or to let affection get the better of my judgment where others dear to me are concerned i know you richard carvel scarce an action of yours has escaped my eye though i have said nothing you have been through the fire and are of the kind which comes out untouched you will have judge bordleys advice and mr carrolls and they are too busy with the affairs of the province to be burdened as my executors but he added a little more strongly if what i fear is coming mr bordley will take the trust in your absence if we have war richard you will not be content to remain at home nor would i wish it  i did not reply  you will do what i ask he said  i would refuse you nothing mr swain i answered but i have heavy misgivings  he sighed and now if it were not for tom i might die content he said  if it were not for tom the full burden of the trust began to dawn upon me then presently i heard him speaking but in so low a voice that i hardly caught the words  in our youth richard he was saying the wrath of the almighty is but so many words to most of us when i was little more than a lad i committed a sin of which i tremble now to think and i was the fool to imagine when i amended my life that god had forgotten his punishment is no heavier than i deserve but he alone knows what he has made me suffer  i felt that i had no right to be there  that is why i have paid toms debts he continued i cannot cast off my son i have reasoned implored and appealed in vain he is like reubenhis resolutions melt in an hour and i have pondered day and night what is to be done for him  is he to have his portion i asked indeed the thought of the responsibility of tom swain overwhelmed me  yes he is to have it cried mr swain with a violence to bring on a fit of coughing were i to leave it in trust for a time he would have it mortgaged within a year he is to have his portion but not a penny additional  he lay for a long time breathing deeply i watching him then as he reached out and took my hand i knew by some instinct what was to come i summoned all my selfcommand to meet his eye i knew that the malicious and unthinking gossip of the town had reached him and that he had received it in the simple faith of his hopes  one thing more my lad he said the dearest wish of allthat you will marry patty she is a good girl richard and i have thought he added with hesitation i have thought that she loves you though her lips have never opened on that subject  so the blow fell i turned away for to save my life the words would not come he missed the reason of my silence  i understand and honour your scruples he went on his kindness was like a knife  no i have had none mr swain i exclaimed for i would not be thought a hypocrite  there i stopped a light step sounded in the hall and patty came in upon us her colour at once betrayed her understanding to my infinite relief her father dropped my fingers and asked cheerily if there was any news from the town meeting  on the following wednesday with her flag flying and her sails set the peggy stewart was run ashore on windmill point she rose a sacrifice to liberty in smoke to heaven before the assembled patriots of our city  that very night a dear friend to liberty passed away he failed so suddenly that patty had no time to call for aid and when the mother had been carried in his spirit was flown we laid him high on the hill above the creek in the new lot he had bought and fenced around the stone remains                  here lieth              henry swain barrister             born may 13 1730 os              died october 19 1774            fidus amicis atque patrice  the simple inscription which speaks volumes to those who knew him was cut after the revolution he was buried with the honours of a statesman which he would have been had god spared him to serve the new country which was born so soon after his death     volume 8     chapter l farewell to gordons  i cannot bear to recall my misery of mind after mr swains death one hope had lightened all the years of my servitude for when i examined my soul i knew that it was for dorothy i had laboured and every letter that came from comyn telling me she was still free gave me new heart for my work by some mystic communioni know not whati felt that she loved me yet and despite distance and degree i would wake of a morning with the knowledge of it and be silent for half the day with some particle of a dream in my head lingering like the burden of a song with its train of memories  so in the days that followed i scarce knew myself for a while i shame to write it i avoided that sweet woman who had made my comfort her care whose father had taken me when i was homeless the good in me cried out but the flesh rebelled  poor patty her grief for her father was pathetic to see weeks passed in which she scarcely spoke a word and i remember her as she sat in church sundays the whiteness of her face enhanced by the crape she wore and a piteous appeal in her gray eyes my own agony was nigh beyond endurance my will swinging like a pendulum from right to wrong and back again argue as i might that i had made the barrister no promise conscience allowed no difference i was in despair at the trick fate had played me at the decree that of all women i must love her whose sphere was now so far removed from mine for patty had character and beauty and every gift which goes to make mans happiness and to kindle his affections  her sorrow left her more womanly than ever and after the first sharp sting of it was deadened i noticed a marked reserve in her intercourse with me i knew then that she must have strong suspicions of her fathers request speak i could not soon after the sad event but i strove hard that she should see no change in my conduct  before christmas we went to the eastern shore in annapolis fife and drum had taken the place of fiddle and clarion militia companies were drilling in the empty streets despatches were arriving daily from the north and grave gentlemen were hurrying to meetings but if the war was to come i must settle what was to be done at gordons pride with all possible speed it was only a few days after our going there that i rode into oxford with a black cockade in my hat patty had made me and the army sword captain jack had given captain daniel at my side for i had been elected a lieutenant in the oxford company of which percy singleton was captain  so passed that winter the darkest of my life one soft spring day when the birds were twittering amid newborn leaves and the hyacinths and tulips in pattys garden were coming to their glory master tom rode leisurely down the drive at gordons pride that was a saturday the 29th of april 1775 the news which had flown southward night and day alike was in no hurry to run off his tongue he had been lolling on the porch for half an hour before he told us of the bloodshed between the minutemen of massachusetts and the british regulars of the rout of percys panting redcoats from concord to boston tom added with the brutal nonchalance which characterized his dealings with his mother and sister that he was on his way to philadelphia to join a company  the poor invalid was carried up the stairs in a faint by banks and romney patty with pale face and lips compressed ran to fetch the hartshorn but master tom remained undisturbed  i suppose you are going richard he remarked affably for he treated me with more consideration than his family we shall ride together said he  we ride different ways and to different destinations i replied dryly i go to serve my country and you to fight against it  i think the king is right he answered sullenly  oh i beg your pardon i remarked and rose then you have studied the question since last i saw you  no by gd he cried and i never will i do not want to know your dd principlesor grievances or whatever they are we were living an easy life in the plenty of money and nothing to complain of you take it all away with your cursed cant  i left him railing and swearing and that was the last i saw of tom swain when i returned from a final survey of the plantation and a talk with percy singleton he had ridden north again  i found patty alone in the parlour her work one of my own stockings she was darning lay idle in her lap and in her eyes were the unshed tears which are the greatest suffering of women i sat down beside her and called her name she did not seem to hear me  patty  she started and my courage ebbed  are you going to the warto leave us richard she faltered  i fear there is no choice patty i answered striving hard to keep my own voice steady but you will be well looked after ivie rawlinson is to be trusted and mr bordley has promised to keep an eye upon you  she took up the darning mechanically  i shall not speak a word to keep you richard he would have wished it she said softly and every strong arm in the colonies will be needed we shall think of you and pray for you daily  i cast about for a cheerful reply  i think when they discover how determined we are they will revoke their measures in a hurry before you know it patty i shall be back again making the rounds in my broad rim and reading to you out of captain cook  it was a pitiful attempt she shook her head sadly the tears were come now and she was smiling through them the sorrow of that smile  i have something to say to you before i go patty i said the words stuck i knew that there must be no pretence in that speech it must be true as my life after the consequence of it i have something to ask you and i do not speak without your fathers consent patty if i return will you be my wife  the stocking slipped unheeded to the floor for a moment she sat transfixed save for the tumultuous swelling of her breast then she turned and gazed earnestly into my face and the honesty of her eyes smote me for the first time i could not meet them honestly with my own  richard do you love me she asked  i bowed my head i could not answer that and for a while there was no sound save that of the singing of the frogs in the distant marsh  presently i knew that she was standing at my side i felt her hand laid upon my shoulder  isis it dorothy she said gently  still i could not answer truly the bitterness of life as the joy of it is distilled in strong drops  i knew she continued i have known ever since that autumn morning when i went to you as you saddledwhen i dreaded that you would leave us father asked you to marry me the day you took mr stewart from the mob how could you so have misunderstood me richard  i looked up in wonder the sweet cadence in her tone sprang from a purity not of this earth they alone who have consecrated their days to others may utter it and the light upon her face was of the same source it was no will of mine brought me to my feet but i was not worthy to touch her  i shall make another prayer beside that for your safety richard she said  in the morning she waved me a brave farewell from the block where she had stood so often as i rode afield when the dawn was in the sky the invalid mother sat in her chair within the door the servants were gathered on the lawn and ivie rawlinson and banks lingered where they had held my stirrup that picture is washed with my own tears  the earth was praising god that sunday as i rode to mr bordleys and as it is sorrow which lifts us nearest to heaven i felt as if i were in church  i arrived at wye island in season to dine with the good judge and his family and there i made over to his charge the property of patty and her mother the afternoon we spent in sober talk mr bordley giving me much sound advice and writing me several letters of recommendation to gentlemen in congress his conduct was distinguished by even more of kindness and consideration than he had been wont to show me  in the evening i walked out alone skirting the acres of carvel hall each familiar landmark touching the quick of some memory of other days childhood habit drew me into the path to wilmot house i came upon it just as the sunlight was stretching level across the chesapeake and burning its windows molten red i had been sitting long on the stone steps when the gaunt figure of mcandrews strode toward me out of the dusk  god be gude to us it is mr richard he cried i hae na seen yere bonny face these muckle years sir sync ye cam back frae ae sight o the young mistress i had met him in annapolis then an will ye be aff to the wars  i told him yes that i had come for a last look at the old place before i left  he sighed yere vera welcome sir then he added mr bordleys gien me a fair notion o yere management at gordons the judge is thinking therell be nane ither lad t hand a candle to ye  and what news do you hear from london i asked cutting him short  ill uncos sir he answered shaking his head with violence he had indeed but a sorry tale for my ear and one to make my heart heavier than it was mcandrews opened his mind to me and seemed the better for it how mr marmaduke was living with the establishment they wrote of was more than the honest scotchman could imagine there was a country place in sussex now said he that was the latest and drafts were coming in before the wheat was in the ear and the plantations of tobacco on the western shore had been idle since the nonexportation and were mortgaged to their limit to mr willard money was even loaned on the wilmot house estate mcandrews had a shrewd suspicion that neither mrs manners nor miss dorothy knew aught of this state of affairs  mr richard he said earnestly as he bade me goodby i kennt mr mannerss mind when he lead here there was a laird int sir an a fortune an unless these come soon im thinking i can spae th en  in truth a much greater fool than mcandrews might have predicted that end  on monday judge bordley accompanied me as far as dingleys tavern and showed much emotion at parting  you need have no fears for your friends at gordons pride richard said he and when the general comes back i shall try to give him a good account of my stewardship  the general that title brought old stanwixs cobwebbed prophecy into my head again here surely was the war which he had foretold and i ready to embark in it  why not the sea indeed    chapter li how an idle prophecy came to pass  captain clapsaddle not being at his lodgings i rode on to the coffee house to put up my horse i was stopped by mr claude  why mr carvel says he i thought you on the eastern shore there is a gentleman within will be mightily tickled to see you or else his protestations are lies which they may very well be his name now pon my faith it was jonesno more  this thing of being called for at the coffee house stirred up unpleasant associations  what appearance does the man make i demanded  merciful gad mine host exclaimed once seen never forgotten and once heard never forgotten he quotes me thomson and he tells me of his estate in virginia  the answer was not of a sort to allay my suspicions  then he appears to be a landowner said i  ods blest if i know what he is says mr claude he may be anything an impostor or a highmightiness but hes something to strike the eye and hold it for all his quaker clothes he is swarth and thickset and some five feet eight inchesfull six inches under your own height and he comes asking for you as if you owned the town between you send a fellow to marlboro street for mr richard carvel my good host says he with a snap of his fingers and when i tell him the news of you he is prodigiously affected and criesbut heres my gentleman now  i jerked my head around coming down the steps i beheld my old friend and benefactor captain john paul  ahoy ahoy cries he now heaven be praised i have found you at last  out of the saddle i leaped and straight into his arms  hold hold richard he gasped my ribs man leave me some breath that i may tell you how glad i am to see you  mr jones i said holding him out now where the devil got you that  why i am become a gentleman since i saw you he answered smiling my poor brother left me his estate in virginia and a gentleman must have three names at the least  i dropped his shoulders and shook with laughter  but jones i cried ads heart could you go no higher has your imagination left you captain  republican simplicity sir says he looking a trifle hurt but i laughed the more  well you have contrived to mix oil and vinegar said i a landed gentleman and republican simplicity ill warrant you wear silkknit under that gray homespun and have a cameo in your pocket  he shook his head looking up at me with affection  you might have guessed better he answered all of quality i have about me are an enamelled repeater and a gold brooch  this made me suddenly grave for mcandrewss words had been ringing in my ears ever since he had spoken them i hitched my arm into the captains and pulled him toward the coffee house door  come i said you have not dined and neither have i we shall be merry today and you shall have some of the best madeira in the colonies i commanded a room that we might have privacy as he took his seat opposite me i marked that he had grown heavier and more browned but his eye had the same unfathomable mystery in it as of yore and first i upbraided him for not having writ me  i took you for one who glories in correspondence captain said i and i did not think you could be so unfaithful i directed twice to you in mr orchardsons care  orchardson died before i had made one voyage he replied and the betsy changed owners but i did not forget you richard and was resolved but now not to leave maryland until i had seen you but i burn to hear of you he added i have had an inkling of your story from the landlord so your grandfather is dead and that blastie your uncle of whom you told me on the john is in possession  he listened to my narrative keenly but with many interruptions and when i was done he sighed  you are always finding friends richard said he no matter what your misfortunes they are ever double discounted as for me i am like fulmer in mr cumberlands west indian i have beat through every quarter of the compass i have bellowed for freedom i have offered to serve my country i havei am engaging to betray it no scotland is no longer my country and so i cannot betray her it is she who has betrayed me  he fell into a short mood of dejection and indeed i could not but reflect that much of the character fitted him like a jacket not the betrayal of his country he never did that no matter how roundly they accused him of it afterward  to lift him i cried  you were one of my first friends captain paul i could not stomach the jones but for you i should now be a west indian and a miserable one the slave of some unmerciful hidalgo heres that i may live to repay you  and while we are upon toasts says he bracing immediately i give you the immortal miss manners her beauty has dwelt unfaded in my memory since i last beheld her aboard the betsy remarking the pain in my face he added with a concern which may have been comical and she is not married  unless she is lately gone to gretna she is not i replied trying to speak lightly  alack i knew it he exclaimed and if theres any prophecy in my bones shell be mrs carvel one of these days  well captain i said abruptly the wheel has gone around since i saw you now it is you who are the gentleman while i am a factor is it the bliss you pictured  i suspected that his acres were not as broad nor his produce as salable as those of mount vernon  to speak truth i am heartily tired of that life said he there is little glory in raising nicotia and sipping bumbo and cursing negroes ho for the sea he cried the salt sea and the british prizes give me a tight frigate that leaves a singing wake mark me richard he said a restless gleam coning into his dark eyes stirring times are here and a chance for all of us to make a name for so it seemed ever to be with him  they are black times i fear i answered  black he said no glorious is your word and we are to have an upheaval to throw many of us to the top  i would rather the quarrel were peacefully settled said i gravely for my part i want no distinction that is to come out of strife and misery  he regarded me quizzically  you are grown an hundred years old since i pulled you out of the sea says he but we shall have to fight for our liberties here is a glass to the prospect  and so you are now an american i said curiously  ay strake and keelsonas good a one as though i had got my sap in the maine forests a plague of monarchs say i they are a blotch upon modern civilization and i have here he continued tapping his pocket some letters writ to the virginia printers signed demosthenes which mr randolph and mr henry have commended to speak truth richard i am off to congress with a portmanteau full of recommendations and i was resolved to stop here even till i secured your company we shall sweep the seas together and so let george beware  i smiled but my blood ran faster at the thought of sailing under such a captain however i made the remark that congress had as yet no army let alone a navy  and think you that gentlemen of such spirit and resources will lack either for long he demanded his eye flashing  then i know nothing of a ship save the little i learned on the john i said  you were born for the sea richard he exclaimed raising his glass high and i would rather have one of your brains and strength and handiness than any merchants mate i ever sailed with the more gentlemen get commissions the better will be our new service  at that instant came a knock at the door and one of the inn negroes to say that captain clapsaddle was below and desired to see me i persuaded john paul to descend with me we found captain daniel seated with mr carroll the barrister and mr chase  captain i said to my old friend i have a rare joy this day in making known to you mr john paul jones of whom i have spoken to you a score of times he it is whose bravery sank the black moll whose charity took me to london and who got no other reward for his faith than three weeks in a debtors prison for his honour as i have told you would allow him to accept none nor his principles to take the commission in the royal navy which mr fox offered him  captain daniel rose his honest face flushing with pleasure faith mr jones he cried when john paul had finished one of his elaborate bows this is well met indeed i have been longing these many years for a chance to press your hand and in the names of those who are dead and gone to express my gratitude  i have my reward now captain replied john paul a sight of you is to have richards whole life revealed and what says mr congreve         for blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds         and tho a late a sure reward succeeds  tho i would not have you believe that my deed was virtuous and you who know richard may form some notion of the pleasure i had out of his companionship  i hastened to present my friend to the other gentlemen who welcomed him with warmth though they could not keep their amusement wholly out of their faces  mr jones is now the possessor of an estate in virginia sirs i explained  and do you find it more to your taste than seafaring mr jones inquired mr chase  this brought forth a most vehement protest and another quotation  why sir he cried to be         fixed like a plant on his peculiar spot         to draw nutrition propagate and rot  is an animals existence i have thrown it over sir with a right good will and am now on my way to philadelphia to obtain a commission in the navy soon to be born  mr chase smiled john paul little suspected that he was a member of the congress  this is news indeed mr jones he said i have yet to hear of the birth of this infant navy for which we have not yet begun to make swaddling clothes  we are not yet an infant state sir mr carroll put in with a shade of rebuke for maryland was well content with the government she had enjoyed and her best patriots long after shunned the length of secession i believe and pray that the king will come to his senses and as for the navy it is folly how can we hope to compete with england on the sea  all great things must have a beginning sir replied john paul launching forth at once nothing daunted by such cold conservatism what israelite brickmaker of pharaohs dreamed of solomons temple nay moses himself had no conception of it and god will send us our pillars of cloud and of fire we must be reconciled to our great destiny mr carroll no fight ever was won by man or nation content with half a victory we have forests to build an hundred armadas and i will command a fleet and it is given me  the gentlemen listened in astonishment  i faith i believe you sir cried captain daniel with admiration  the others too were somehow fallen under the spell of this remarkable individuality what plan would you pursue sir asked mr chase betraying more interest than he cared to show  what plan sir said captain john paul those wonderful eyes of his alight in the first place we americans build the fastest ships in the worldyours of the chesapeake are as fleet as any here if i am not mistaken one hundred and eightytwo were built in the year 71 they are idle now to them i would issue letters of marque to harry englands trade from carolina to maine we have the wood and iron to build cruisers in harbours that may not easily be got at and skilled masters and seamen to elude the enemy  but a navy must be organized sir it must be an unit objected mr carroll and you would not for many years have force enough or discipline enough to meet englands navy  i would never meet it sir he replied instantly that would be the height of folly i would divide our forces into small swiftsailing squadrons of strength sufficient to repel his cruisers and i would carry the war straight into his unprotected ports of trade i can name a score of such defenceless places and i know every shoal of their harbours for example whitehaven might be entered that is a town of fifty thousand inhabitants the fleet of merchantmen might with the greatest ease be destroyed a contribution levied and irelands coal cut off for a winter the whole of the shipping might be swept out of the clyde newcastle is another likely place and in almost any of the irish ports valuable vessels may be found the baltic and west indian fleets are to be intercepted i have reflected upon these matters for years gentlemen they are perfectly feasible and ill warrant you cannot conceive the havoc and consternation their fulfilment would spread in england  if the divine power of genius ever made itself felt twas on that may evening at candlelight in the annapolis coffee house with my own eyes i witnessed two able and cautious statesmen of a cautious province thrilled to the pitch of enthusiasm by this strange young man of eight and twenty as for good captain daniel enthusiasm is but a poor word to express his feelings a map was sent for and spread out upon the table and it was a late hour when mr chase and mr carroll went home profoundly impressed mr chase charged john paul look him up in congress  the next morning i bade captain daniel a solemn goodby and rode away with john paul to baltimore thence we took stage to new castle on the delaware and were eventually landed by mr tatlows stageboat at crooked billet wharf philadelphia     a brief summary which brings this biography to the famous    fight of the bon homme richard and the serapis            by daniel clapsaddle carvel  mr richard carvel refers here to the narrative of his experiences in the war of the revolution which he had written in the year 1805 or 1806 the insertion of that account would swell this book already too long out of all proportion hence i take it upon myself with apologies to compress it  not until october of that year 1775 was the infant navy born mr carvel was occupied in the interval in the acquirement of practical seamanship and the theory of maritime warfare under the most competent of instructors john paul jones an interesting side light is thrown upon the character of that hero by the fact that with all his supreme confidence in his ability he applied to congress only for a first lieutenancy this was in deference to the older men before that body i hoped said he in that rank to gain much useful knowledge from those of more experience than myself his lack of assertion for once cost him dear he sailed on the new providence expedition under commodore hopkins as first lieutenant of the alfred thirty and he soon discovered that instead of gaining information he was obliged to inform others he trained the men so thoroughly in the use of the great guns that they went through the motions of broadsides and rounds exactly as soldiers generally perform the manual exercise  captain jones was not long in fixing the attention and earning the gratitude of the nation and of its commanderinchief general washington while in command of the providence twelve fourpounders his successful elusions of the cerberus which hounded him and his escape from the solebay are too famous to be dwelt upon here obtaining the alfred he captured and brought into boston ten thousand suits of uniform for washingtons shivering army then by the bungling of congress thirteen officers were promoted over his head the bitterness this act engendered in the soul of one whose thirst for distinction was as great as captain joness may be imagined to his everlasting credit be it recorded that he remained true to the country to which he had dedicated his life and his talents and it was not until 1781 that he got the justice due him  that the rough and bluff captains of the american service should have regarded a man of paul joness type with suspicion is not surprising they resented his polish and accomplishments and could not understand his language perhaps it was for this reason as well as a reward for his brilliant services that he was always given a separate command in the summer of 1777 he was singled out for the highest gift in the power of the united states nothing less than that of the magnificent frigate indien then building at amsterdam and he was ordered to france in command of the ranger a new ship then fitting at portsmouth captain jones was the admiration of all the young officers in the navy and was immediately flooded with requests to sail with him one of his first acts after receiving his command was to apply to the marine committee for mr carvel the favour was granted  my grandfather had earned much commendation from his superiors he had sailed two cruises as masters mate of the cabot and was then serving as master of the trumbull captain saltonstall this was shortly after that frigate had captured the two british transports off new york  captain jones has been at pains to mention in his letters the services rendered him by mr carvel in fitting out the ranger and my grandfather gives a striking picture of the captain at that time the privateers with the larger inducements of profit they offered were getting all the best seamen john paul had but to take two turns with a man across the dock and he would sign papers  captain jones was the first to raise the new flag of the stars and stripes over a manowar they got away on november 14 1777 with a fair crew and a poor lot of officers mr carvel had many a brush with the mutinous first lieutenant simpson family influence deterred the captain from placing this man under arrest and even dr franklin found trouble some years after in bringing about his dismissal from the service to add to the troubles the ranger proved crank and slowsailing and she had only one barrel of rum aboard which made the men discontented  bringing the official news of burgoynes surrender which was to cause king louis to acknowledge the independence of the united states the ranger arrived at nantes december 2 mr carvel accompanied captain jones to paris where a serious blow awaited him the american commissioners informed him that the indien had been transferred to france to prevent her confiscation that winter john paul spent striving in vain for a better ship and imbibing tactics from the french admirals incidentally he obtained a salute for the american flag the cruise of the ranger in english waters the following spring was a striking fulfilment with an absurdly poor and inadequate force of the plan set forth by john paul jones in the annapolis coffee house his descent upon whitehaven spread terror and consternation broadcast through england and he was branded as a pirate and a traitor mr carvel was fortunately not of the landing party on st marys isle which place he had last beheld in john pauls company on the brigantine john when entering kirkcudbright the object of that expedition as is well known was to obtain the person of the earl of selkirk in order to bring about the rescue of the unfortunate americans suffering in british prisons after the celebrated capture of the sloopofwar drake paul jones returned to france a hero  if captain jones was ambitious of personal glory he may never at least be accused of mercenary motives the ragged crew of the ranger was paid in part out of his own pocket and for a whole month he supported the drakes officers and men no provision having been made for prisoners he was at large expense in fitting out the ranger and he bought back at twice what it was worth the plate taken from st marys isle getting but a tardy recognition from the earl of selkirk for such a noble and unheardof action and i take pride in writing it mr carvel spent much of what he had earned at gordons pride in a like honourable manner  mr carvels description of the heros reception at versailles is graphic and very humorous for all his republican principles john paul never got over his love of courts and no man was ever a more thorough courtier he exchanged compliments with queen marie antoinette who was then in the bloom of her beauty and declared that she was a good girl and deserved to be happy  the unruly simpson sailed for america in the ranger in july captain jones being retained in france for a particular enterprise and through the kindness of dr franklin mr carvel remained with him then followed another period of heartrending disappointment the fine ship the french government promised him was not forthcoming though captain jones wrote a volume of beautiful letters to every one of importance from her royal highness the duchess of chartres to his most christian majesty louis king of france and navarre at length when he was sitting one day in unusual dejection and railing at the vanity of courts and kings mr carvel approached him with a book in his hand  what have you there richard the captain demanded  dr franklins maxims replied my grandfather they were great favourites with him the captain took the book and began mechanically to turn over the pages suddenly he closed it with a bang jumped up and put on his coat and hat mr carvel looked on in astonishment  where are you going sir says he  to paris sir says the captain dr franklin has taught me more wisdom in a second than i had in all my life before if you wish to have any business faithfully and expeditiously performed go and do it yourself otherwise send  as a result of that trip he got the duras which he renamed the bon homme richard in honour of dr franklin the duras was an ancient indiaman with a high poop which made my grandfather exclaim when he saw her at the remarkable fulfilment of old stanwixs prophecy she was perfectly rotten and in the constructors opinion not worth refitting her lowest deck too low for the purpose was pierced aft with three ports on a side and six wornout eighteenpounders mounted there some of them burst in the action killing their people the main battery on the deck above was composed of twentyeight twelvepounders on the uncovered deck eight ninepounders were mounted captain jones again showed his desire to serve the cause by taking such a ship and not waiting for something better  in the meantime the american frigate alliance had brought lafayette to france and was added to the little squadron that was to sail with the bon homme richard one of the most fatal mistakes congress ever made was to put captain pierre landais in command of her out of compliment to the french allies he was a man whose temper and vagaries had failed to get him a command in his own navy his insulting conduct and treachery to captain jones are strongly attested to in mr carvels manuscript they were amply proved by the written statements of other officers  the squadron sailed from lorient in june but owing to a collision between the bon homme richard and the alliance it was forced to put back into the groix roads for repairs nails and rivets were with difficulty got to hold in the sides of the old indianian on august 14th john paul jones again set sail for english waters with the following vessels alliance thirtysix pallas thirty cerf eighteen vengeance twelve and two french privateers owing to the humiliating conditions imposed upon him by the french minister of marine commodore jones did not have absolute command in a gale on the 26th the two privateers and the cerf parted company never to return after the most outrageous conduct off the coast of ireland landais in the alliance left the squadron on september 6th and did not reappear until the 23d the day of the battle  mr carvel was the third lieutenant of the bon homme richard tho he served as second in the action her first lieutenant afterwards the celebrated commodore richard dale was a magnificent man one worthy in every respect of the captain he served when the hour of battle arrived these two and the sailing master and a number of raw midshipmen were the only lineofficers left and two french officers of marines  the rest had been lost in various ways and the crew of the bon homme richard was as sorry a lot as ever trod a deck less than three score of the seamen were american born near four score were british inclusive of sixteen irish one hundred and thirtyseven were french soldiers who acted as marines and the rest of the three hundred odd souls to fight her were from all over the earthmalays and maltese and portuguese in the hold were more than one hundred and fifty english prisoners  this was a vessel and a force truly with which to conquer a fiftygun ship of the latest type and with a picked crew  mr carvels chapter opens with landaiss sudden reappearance on the morning of the day the battle was fought he shows the resentment and anger against the frenchman felt by all on board from cabinboy to commodore but none went so far as to accuse the captain of the alliance of such supreme treachery as he was to show during the action cowardice may have been in part responsible for his holding aloof from the two duels in which the richard and the pallas engaged but the fact that he poured broadsides into the richard and into her off side makes it seem probable that his motive was to sink the commodores ship and so get the credit of saving the day to the detriment of the hero who won it despite all disasters to account for the cry that was raised when first she attacked the richard it must be borne in mind that the crew of the alliance was largely composed of englishmen it was thought that these had mutinied and taken her     chapter lii how the gardeners son fought the serapis  when i came on deck the next morning our yards were adrip with a clammy fog and under it the sea was roughed by a southwest breeze we were standing to the northward before it i remember reflecting as i paused in the gangway that the day was thursday september the 23d and that we were near two months out of groix with this tub of an indiaman in all that time we had not so much as got a whiff of an english frigate though we had almost put a belt around the british isles then straining my eyes through the mist i made out two white blurs of sails on our starboard beam  honest jack pearce one of the few good seamen we had aboard was rubbing down one of the nines beside me  why jack said i what have we there another prize for that question had become a joke on board the bon homme richard since the prisoners had reached an hundred and fifty and half our crew was gone to man the ships  bless your art no sir said he tis that damned frenchy landais in th alliance she turns up with the pallas at six bells o the middle watch  so hes back is he  ay hes back he returned with a grunt that was half a growl arter three weeks breakin o liberty i tell ee what sir them frenchies is treecherous devils an not to be trusted the lenth of a lead line an they beant seamen eno to keep a full an by with all their takteek ez fer that landais i hearn him whinin at the commodore in the round house when we was off clear an sayin as how he would tell sartin on us when he gets back to paree an jabberin to thother frenchmen as was there that this here buttercask was er kings ship an that the commodore werent no commodore nohow they say as how capn jones be bound up in a hard knot by some articles of agreement an daresnt punish him be that so mr carvel  i said that it was  shiver my bulkheads cried jack i gave my oath to that same sir for i knowed the commodore was the lad t string em to the yardarm an he had the say on it oh the devil take the frenchies said jack rolling his quid to show his pleasure of the topic they sits on their bottoms in brest and loriong an talks takteek wi their hans and mouths and daresnt as much as show the noses o their threedeckers in th bay o biscay while capn jones pokes his bowsprit into every port in england with a hulk the rats have left ive had my bellyful o frenchies mr carvell save it be to fight em an i tell ee twould give me the greatest joy in life t leave loose scolding sairy at that there landais th gal aint had a match on her this here cruise an t my mind she couldnt be christened better sir  i left him patting the gun with a tender affection  the scene on board was quiet and peaceful enough that morning a knot of midshipmen on the forecastle were discussing landaiss conduct and cursing the concordat which prevented our commodore from bringing him up short mr stacey the sailingmaster had the deck and the coasting pilot was conning now and anon the boatswains whistle piped for garrett or quito or fogg to lay aft to the mast where the first lieutenant stood talking to colonel de chamillard of the french marines the scavengers were sweeping down and part of the after guard was bending a new boltrope on a storm staysail  then theforetopmast crosstrees reports a sail on the weather quarter the richard is brought around on the wind and away we go after a brigantine flying like a snow laden with english bricks as midshipman coram jokingly remarks a chase is not such a novelty with us that we crane our necks to windward  at noon when i relieved mr stacey of the deck the sun had eaten up the fog and the shores of england stood out boldly spurn head was looming up across our bows while that of flamborough jutted into the sea behind us i had the starboard watch piped to dinner and reported twelve oclock to the commodore and had just got permission to make it according to a timehonoured custom at sea when another sail ho came down from aloft  where away called back mr linthwaite who was midshipman of the forecastle  starboard quarter rounding flamborough head sir looks like a fullrigged ship sir  i sent the messenger into the great cabin to report he was barely out of sight before a second cry came from the masthead another sail rounding flamborough sir  the officers on deck hurried to the taffrail i had my glass but not a dot was visible above the sealine the messenger was scarcely back again when there came a third hail two more rounding the head sir four in all sir  here was excitement indeed without waiting for instructions i gave the command  up royal yards royal yardmen in the tops  we were already swaying out of the chains when lieutenant dale appeared and asked the coasting pilot what fleet it was he answered that it was the baltic fleet under convoy of the countess of scarborough twenty guns and the serapis fortyfour  fortyfour repeated mr dale smiling that means fifty as english frigates are rated we shall have our hands full this day my lads said he you have done well to get the royals on her mr carvel  while he was yet speaking three more sail were reported from aloft then there was a hush on deck and the commodore himself appeared as he reached the poop we saluted him and informed him of what had happened  the baltic fleet said he promptly call away the pilotboat with mr lunt to follow the brigantine sir and ease off before the wind signal general chase to the squadron mr mayrant  the men had jumped to the weather braces before i gave the command and all the while more sail were counting from the crosstrees until their number had reached fortyone the news spread over the ship the starboard watch trooped up with their dinners half eaten then a faint booming of guns drifted down upon our ears  theyve got sight of us sir shouted the lookout they be firing guns to windward an letting fly their topgallant sheets  at that the commodore hurried forward the men falling back to the bulwarks respectfully and he mounted the forerigging as agile as any topman followed by his aide with a glass from the masthead he sung out to me to set our stunsails and he remained aloft till near seven bells of the watch at that hour the merchantmen had all scuttled to safety behind the head and from the deck a great yellow kings frigate could be plainly seen standing south to meet us followed by her smaller consort presently she hove to and through our glasses we discerned a small boat making for her side and then a man clambering up her sealadder  that be the bailiff of scarborough sir said the coasting pilot come to tell her capn tis paul jones he has to fight  at that moment the commodore lay down from aloft and our hearts beat high as he walked swiftly aft to the quarterdeck where he paused for a word with mr dale meanwhile mr mayrant hove out the signal for the squadron to form line of battle  recall the pilotboat mr carvel said the commodore quietly then you may beat to quarters and i will take the ship sir  ay ay sir i raised my trumpet all hands clear ship for action  it makes me sigh now to think of the cheer which burst from that tatterdemalion crew who were they to fight the bone and sinew of the kings navy in a rotten ship of an age gone by and who was he that stood so straight upon the quarterdeck to instil this scum with love and worship and fervour to blind them to such odds but the bosuns piped and sang out the command in foghorn voices the drums beat the long roll and the fifes whistled and the decks became suddenly alive breechings were loosed and guntackles unlashed rammer and sponge laid out and pike and pistol and cutlass placed where they would be handy when the time came to rush the enemys decks the powdermonkeys tumbled over each other in their hurry to provide cartridges and grape and canister and doubleheaded shot were hoisted up from below the trimmers rigged the splinter nettings got out spare spars and blocks and ropes against those that were sure to be shot away and rolled up casks of water to put out the fires tubs were filled with sand for blood is slippery upon the boards the french marines their scarlet and white very natty in contrast to most of our ragged wharfrats at the guns were mustered on poop and forecastle and some were sent aloft to the tops to assist the tars there to sweep the british decks with handgrenade and musket and lastly the surgeon and his mates went below to cockpit and steerage to make ready for the grimmest work of all  my own duties took me to the dark lower deck a vile place indeed and reeking with the smell of tar and stale victuals there i had charge of the battery of old eighteens while mr dale commanded the twelves on the middle deck we loaded our guns with two shots apiece though i had my doubts about their standing such a charge and then the men stripped until they stood naked to the waist waiting for the fight to begin for we could see nothing of what was going forward i was pacing up and down for it was a task to quiet the nerves in that dingy place with the gunports closed when about three bells of the dog mr mease the purser appeared on the ladder  lunt has not come back with the pilotboat carvel said he i have volunteered for a battery and am assigned to this you are to report to the commodore  i thanked him and climbed quickly to the quarterdeck the bon homme richard was lumbering like a leaden ship before the wind swaying ponderously her topsails flapping and her heavy blocks whacking against the yards and there was the commodore erect and with fire in his eye giving sharp commands to the men at the wheel i knew at once that no trifle had disturbed him he wore a brandnew uniform a blue coat with red lapels and yellow buttons and slashed cuffs and standup collar a red waistcoat with tawny lace blue breeches white silk stockings and a cocked hat and a sword into his belt were stuck two brace of pistols  it took some effort to realize as i waited silently for his attention that this was the man of whose innermost life i had had so intimate a view who had taken me to the humble cottage under criffel who had poured into my ear his ambitions and his wrongs when we had sat together in the dingy room of the castle yard sponginghouse then some of those ludicrous scenes on the road to london came up to me for which the skyblue frock was responsible and yet this commodore was not greatly removed from him i had first beheld on the brigantine john his confidence in his future had not so much as wavered since that day that future was now not so far distant as the horizon and he was ready to meet it  you will take charge of the battery of nines on this deck mr carvel said he at length  very good sir i replied and was making my way down the poop ladder when i heard him calling me in a low voice by the old name richard  i turned and followed him aft to the taffrail where we were clear of the french soldiers the sun was hanging red over the yorkshire wolds the head of flamborough was in the blue shadow and the clouds were like rose leaves in the sky the enemy had tacked and was standing west with ensign and jack and pennant flying the level light washing his sails to the whiteness of paper twas then i first remarked that the alliance had left her place in line and was sailing swiftly ahead toward the serapis the commodore seemed to read my exclamation  landais means to ruin me yet by hook or crook said he  but he cant intend to close with them i replied he has not the courage  god knows what he intends said the commodore bitterly it is no good at all events  my heart bled for him some minutes passed that he did not speak making shift to raise his glass now and again and i knew that he was gripped by a strong emotion twas so he ever behaved when the stress was greatest presently he lays down the glass on the signalchest fumbles in his coat and brings out the little gold brooch i had not set eyes on since dolly and he and i had stood together on the betsys deck  when you see her richard tell her that i have kept it as sacred as her memory he said thickly she will recall what i spoke of you when she gave it me you have been leal and true to me indeed and many a black hour have you tided me over since this war began do you know how she may be directed to he concluded with abruptness  i glanced at him surprised at the question he was staring at the english shore  mr ripley of lincolns inn used to be mr mannerss lawyer i answered  he took out a little notebook and wrote that down carefully and now he continued god keep you my friend we must win for we fight with a rope around our necks  but you captain paul i said isis there no one  his face took on the look of melancholy it had worn so often of late despite his triumphs that look was the stamp of fate  richard replied he with an ineffable sadness i am naught but a wanderer upon the face of the earth i have no ties no kindredno real friends save you and dale and some of these honest fellows whom i lead to slaughter my ambition is seamed with a flaw and all my life i must be striving striving until i am laid in the grave i know that now and it is you yourself who have taught me for i have violently broken forth from those bounds which god in his wisdom did set  i pressed his hand and with bowed head went back to my station profoundly struck by the truth of what he had spoken though he fought under the flag of freedom the curse of the expatriated was upon his head  shortly afterward he appeared at the poop rail straight and alert his eye piercing each man as it fell on him he was the commodore once more  the twilight deepened until you scarce could see your hands there was no sound save the cracking of the cabins and the tumbling of the blocks and from time to time a muttered command an age went by before the trimmers were sent to the lee braces and the richard rounded lazily to and a great frigate loomed out of the night beside us half a pistolshot away  what ship is that came the hail intense out of the silence  i dont hear you replied our commodore for he had not yet got his distance  again came the hail what ship is that  john paul jones leaned forward over the rail  pass the word below to the first lieutenant to begin the action sir  hardly were the words out of my mouth before the deck gave a mighty leap a hot wind that seemed half of flame blew across my face and the roar started the pain throbbing in my ears at the same instant the screech of shot sounded overhead we heard the sharp crackcrack of wood rending and splittingas with a great broadaxeand a medley of blocks and ropes rattled to the deck with the thud of the falling bodies then instead of stillness moans and shrieks from above and below oaths and prayers in english and french and portuguese and in the heathen gibberish of the east as the men were sponging and ramming home in the first fury of hatred the carpenter jumped out under the battlelanthorn at the main hatch crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had burst killing half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them at this many of our men broke and ran for the hatches  back back to your quarters the first man to desert will be shot down  it was the same strange voice that had quelled the mutiny on the john that had awed the men of kirkcudbright the tackles were seized and the guns run out once more and fired and served again in an agony of haste in the darkness shot shrieked hither and thither about us like demons striking everywhere sometimes sending casks of salt water over the nettings incessantly the quartermaster walked to and fro scattering sand over the black pools that kept running running together as the minutes were tolled out and the red flashes from the guns revealed faces in a hideous contortion one little fellow with whom i had had many a lively word at mess had his arm taken off at the shoulder as he went skipping past me with the charge under his coat and i have but to listen now to hear the patter of the blood on the boards as they carried him away to the cockpit below out of the main hatch from that charnel house rose one continuous cry it was an odd trick of the mind or soul that put a hymn on my lips in that dreadful hour of carnage and human misery when men were calling the name of their maker in vain but as i ran from crew to crew i sang over and over again a longforgotten christmas carol and with it came a fleeting memory of my mother on the stairs at carvel hall and of the negroes gathered on the lawn without  suddenly glancing up at the dim cloud of sails above i saw that we were aback and making sternway we might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big serapis as she glided ahead of us the broadsides thundered and great ragged scantlings brake from our bulwarks and flew as high as the mizzentop and the shrieks and groans redoubled involuntarily my eyes sought the poop and i gave a sigh of relief at the sight of the commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke we shotted our guns with doubleheaded manned our lee braces and gathered headway  stand by to board  the boatswains whistles trilled through the ship pikes were seized and pistol and cutlass buckled on but even as we waited with set teeth our bows ground into the enemys weather quartergallery for the richards rigging was much cut away and she was crank at best so we backed and filled once more passing the englishman close aboard himself being aback at the time several of his shot crushed through the bulwarks in front of me shattering a ninepounder and killing half of its crew and it is only a miracle that i stand alive to be able to tell the tale then i caught a glimpse of the quartermaster whirling the spokes of our wheel and over went our helm to lay us athwart the forefoot of the serapis where we might rake and rush her decks our old indiaman answered but doggedly and the huge bowsprit of the serapis towering over our heads snapped off our spanker gaff and fouled our mizzen rigging  a hawser mr stacey a hawser i heard the commodore shout and saw the sailingmaster slide down the ladder and grope among the dead and wounded and mass of broken spars and tackles and finally pick up a smeared ropes end which i helped him drag to the poop there we found the commodore himself taking skilful turns around the mizzen with the severed stays and shrouds dangling from the bowsprit the french marines looking on  dont swear mr stacey said he severely in another minute we may all be in eternity  i rushed back to my guns for the wind was rapidly swinging the stern of the serapis to our own bow now bringing her starboard batteries into play barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside into her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching together the disordered riggings locking and both pointed northward to a leeward tide in a death embrace the chance had not been given him to shift his crews or to fling open his starboard gunports  then ensued a moments breathless hush even the cries of those in agony lulling the pall of smoke rolled a little and a silver moonlight filtered through revealing the weltering bodies twisted upon the boards a stern call came from beyond the bulwarks  have you struck sir  the answer sounded clear and bred heroworship in our souls  sir i have not yet begun to fight  our men raised a hoarse yell drowned all at once by the popping of musketry in the tops and the bursting of grenades here and there about the decks a mighty muffled blast sent the bon homme richard rolling to larboard and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of the space between the ships the englishman had blown off his gunports and next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them muzzle to muzzle below our rammers leaning into the serapis to send their shot home no chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us in moments of suspense that was a fearful hour when a shot had scarce to leap a cannons length to find its commission when the belches of the english guns burned the hair of our faces when death was sovereign merciful or cruel at his pleasure the red flashes disclosed many an act of coolness and of heroism i saw a french lad whip off his coat when a gunner called for a wad and another who had been a scavenger snatch the rammer from pearces hands when he staggered with a grapeshot through his chest poor jack pearce he did not live to see the work scolding sairy was to do that night i had but dragged him beyond reach of the recoil when he was gone  then a cry came floating down from aloft thrice did i hear it like one waking out of a sleep ere i grasped its import the alliance the alliance but hardly had the name resounded with joy throughout the ship when a hail of grape and canister tore through our sails from aft forward she rakes us she rakes us and the french soldiers tumbled headlong down from the poop with a wail of les anglais font prise her englishmen have taken her and turned her guns against us our captain was left standing alone beside the staff where the stars and stripes waved black in the moonlight  the alliance is hauling off sir called the midshipman of the mizzentop she is making for the pallas and the countess of scarborough  very good sir was all the commodore said  to us hearkening for his answer his voice betrayed no sign of dismay seven times i say was that battle lost and seven times regained again what was it kept the crews at their quarters and the officers at their posts through that hell of flame and shot when a madman could scarce have hoped for victory what but the knowledge that somewhere in the swirl above us was still that unswerving and indomitable man who swept all obstacles from before him and into whose mind the thought of defeat could not enter his spirit held us to our task for flesh and blood might not have endured alone  we had now but one of our starboard ninepounders on its carriage and word came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to scrap iron and their ports blown into one yawning gap indeed we did not have to be told that sides and stanchions had been carried away for the deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged scolding sairy from her stand in the larboard waist clearing a lane for her between the bodies our feet slipped and slipped as we hove and burning bits of sails and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and shoulders with the energy of desperation i was bending to the pull when the malay in front of me sank dead across the tackle but ere i could touch him he was tenderly lifted aside and a familiar figure seized the rope where the dead mans hands had warmed it truly the commodore was everywhere that night  down to the surgeon with you richard he cried i will look to the battery  dazed i put my hand to my hair to find it warm and wringing wet when i had been hit i knew not but i shook my head for the very notion of that cockpit turned my stomach the blood was streaming from a gash in his own temple to which he gave no heed and stood encouraging that panting line until at last the gun was got across and hooked to the ringbolts of its companion that lay shattered there serve her with doubleheaded my lads he shouted and every shot into the englishmans mainmast  ay ay sir came the answer from every man of that little remnant  the serapis too was now beginning to blaze aloft and choking woodsmoke eddied out of the richards hold and mingled with the powder fumes then the enemys fire abreast us seemed to lull and mr stacey mounted the bulwarks and cried out you have cleared their decks my hearties aloft a man was seen to clamber from our mainyard into the very top of the englishman where he threw a handgrenade as i thought down her main hatch an instant after an explosion came like a clap of thunder in our faces and a great quadrant of light flashed as high as the serapiss trucks and through a breach in her bulwarks i saw men running with only the collars of their shirts upon their naked bodies  twas at this critical moment when that fearful battle once more was won another storm of grape brought the spars about our heads and that name which we dreaded most of all was spread again as we halted in consternation a dozen round shot ripped through our unengaged side and a babel of voices hailed the treacherous landais with oaths and imprecations we made out the alliance with a full head of canvas black and sharp between us and the moon smoke hung above her rail getting over against the signal fires blazing on flamborough head she wore ship and stood across our bows the midshipman on the forecastle singing out to her by the commodores orders to lay the enemy by the board there was no response  do you hear us yelled mr linthwaite  ay ay came the reply and with it the smoke broke from her and the grape and canister swept our forecastle then the alliance sailed away leaving brave mr caswell among the many landais had murdered  the ominous clank of the chain pumps beat a sort of prelude to what happened next the gunner burst out of the hatch with blood running down his face shouting that the richard was sinking and yelling for quarter as he made for the ensignstaff on the poop for the flag was shot away him the commodore felled with a pistolbutt at the gunners heels were the hundred and fifty prisoners we had taken released by the master at arms they swarmed out of the bowels of the ship like a horde of tartars unkempt and wild and desperate with fear until i thought that the added weight on the scarcesupported deck would land us all in the bilges words fail me when i come to describe the frightful panic of these creatures frenzied by the instinct of selfpreservation they surged hither and thither as angry seas driven into a pocket of a stormswept coast they trampled roughshod over the moaning heaps of wounded and dying and crowded the crews at the guns who were powerless before their numbers some fought like maniacs and others flung themselves into the sea  those of us who had clung to hope lost it then standing with my back to the mast beating them off with a pike visions of an english prisonship of an english gallows came before me i counted the seconds until the enemys seamen would be pouring through our ragged ports the seventh and last time and we were beaten for we had not men enough left on our two decks to force them down again yesi shame to confess itthe heart went clean out of me and with that the pain pulsed and leaped in my head like a devil unbound at a turn of the hand i should have sunk to the boards had not a voice risen strong and clear above that turmoil compelling every man to halt trembling in his steps  cast off cast off the serapis is sinking to the pumps ye fools if you would save your lives  that unerring genius of the gardeners son had struck the only chord  they were like sheep before us as we beat them back into the reeking hatches and soon the pumps were heard bumping with a renewed and a desperate vigour then all at once the towering mainmast of the enemy cracked and tottered and swung this way and that on its loosened shrouds the first intense silence of the battle followed in the midst of which came a cry from our top  their captain is hauling down sir  the sound which broke from our men could scarce be called a cheer that which they felt as they sank exhausted on the blood of their comrades may not have been elation my own feeling was of unmixed wonder as i gazed at a calm profile above me sharpcut against the moon  i was moved as out of a revery by the sight of dale swinging across to the serapis by the main brace pennant calling on some of my boarders i scaled our bulwarks and leaped fairly into the middle of the gangway of the serapis  such is nearly all of my remembrance of that momentous occasion i had caught the one glimpse of our first lieutenant in converse with their captain and another officer when a naked seaman came charging at me he had raised a pike above his shoulder ere i knew what he was about and my senses left me     chapter liii in which i make some discoveries  the room had a prodigious sense of change about it that came over me with something of a shock since the moment before i had it settled that i was in marlboro street the bare branches swaying in the wind outside should belong to the trees in freshwater lane but beyond the branches were houses the like of which i had no remembrance of in annapolis and then my grandfather should be sitting in that window surely he was there he moved he was coming toward me to say richard you are forgiven and to brush his eyes with his ruffles  then there was the bedcanopy the pleatings of which were gone and it was turned white instead of the old blue and the chimneyplace that was unaccountably smaller and glowed with a seacoal fire and the mantel was now but a bit of a shelf and held many things that seemed scarce at home on the rough and painted woodgold filigree and china and japan and a french clock that ought not to have been just there ah the teacups here at last was something to touch a fibre of my brain but a pain came with the effort of memory so my eyes went back to my grandfather in the window his face was now become black as scipios and he wore a red turban and a striped cotton gown that was too large for him and he was sewing this was monstrous  i hurried over to the teacups such a twinge did that discovery give me but they troubled me near as much and the seacoal fire held strange images the fascination in the window was not to be denied for it stood in line with the houses and the trees suddenly there rose up before me a gate yes i knew that gate and the girlish figure leaning over it they were in prince george street behind them was a mass of goldenrose bushes and out of these came forth a black face under a turban saying yes mistis ise comin  mammymammy lucy  the figure in the window stirred and the sewing fell its ample lap  now lawda mercy  i trembledwith a violence unspeakable was this but one more of those thousand voices harsh and gentle rough and tender to which i had listened in vain this age past the black face was hovering over me now and in an agony of apprehension i reached up and felt its honest roughness then i could have wept for joy  mammy lucy  yes marse dick  wherewhere is miss dolly  now marse dick doctah done say you not t talk suh  where is miss dolly i cried seizing her arm  hush marse dick miss dollyll come terectly suh shes lyin down suh  the door creaked and in my eagerness i tried to lift myself twas aunt lucys hand that restrained me and the next face i saw was that of dorothys mother but why did it appear so old and sorrowlined and why was the hair now of a whiteness with the lace of the cap she took my fingers in her own and asked me anxiously if i felt any pain  where am i mrs manners  you are in london richard  in arlington street  she shook her head sadly no my dear not in arlington street but you are not to talk  and dorothy may i not see dorothy aunt lucy tells me she is here  mrs manners gave the old mammy a glance of reproof a signal that alarmed me vastly  oh tell me mrs manners you will speak the truth tell me if she is gone away  my dear boy she is here and under this very roof and you shall see her as soon as dr barry will permit which will not be soon she added with a smile if you persist in this conduct  the threat had the desired effect and mrs manners quietly left the room and after a while as quietly came back again and sat down by the fire whispering to aunt lucy  fate in some inexplicable way had carried me into the enemys country and made me the guest of mr marmaduke manners as i lay staring upward odd little bits of the past came floating to the top of my mind presently to be pieced together the injuries mr marmaduke had done me were the first to collect since i was searching for the cause of my resentment against him the incidents arrived haphazard as magic lanthorn views but very vivid his denial of me before mr dix and his treachery at vauxhall when he had sent me to be murdered next i felt myself clutching the skin over his ribs in arlington street when i had flung him across the room in his yellow nightgown that brought me to the most painful scene of my life when i had parted with dorothy at the top of the stairs afterward followed scraps of the years at gordons pride and on top of them the talk with mcandrews here was the secret i sought the crash had come and they were no longer in mayfair but must have taken a house in some poorer part of london this thought cast me down tremendously  and dorothy had time changed her twas with that query on my lips i fell asleep to dream of the sun shining down on carvel hall and wilmot house of aunt hester and aunt lucy and a lass and a lad romping through pleasant fields and gardens  when i awoke it was broad day once more a gentleman sat on the edge of my bed he had a queer short face ruddy as the harvest moon and he smiled goodhumouredly when i opened my eyes  i bid you good morning mr carvel for the first time since i have made your acquaintance said he and how do you feel sir  i have never felt better in my life i replied which was the whole truth  well vastly well says he laughing prodigious well for a young man who has as many holes in him as have you do you hear him mrs manners  at that last word i popped up to look about the room and the doctor caught hold of me with ludicrous haste a pain shot through my body  avast avast my hearty cries he tis a miracle you can speak let alone carry your bed and walk for a while yet and he turned to dorothys mother whom i beheld smiling at me you will give him the physic maam at the hours i have chosen egad i begin to think we shall come through  but pray remember maam if he talks you are to put a wad in his mouth  he shall have no opportunity to talk dr barry said mrs manners  save for a favour i have to ask you doctor i cried  ods bodkins already sir and what may that be  that you will allow me to see miss manners  he shook with laughter and then winked at me very roguishly  oh says he and faith i should be worse than cruel first she comes imploring me to see you and so prettily that a man of oak could not refuse her and now it is you begging to see her had your eyes been opened sir you might have had many a glimpse of miss dolly these three weeks past  what she has been watching with me i asked in a rapture not to be expressed  ods but those are secrets and the medical profession is closemouthed mr carvel so you want to see her no cries he tis not needful to swear it on the evangels and i let her come in will you give me your honour as a gentleman not to speak more than two words to her  i promise anything and you will not deny me looking at her said i  he shook again all over you rascal you sad dog sir no sir faith you must shut your eyes eh madam must he not shut his eyes  they were playmates doctor answers mrs manners she was laughing a little too  well she shall come in but remember that i shall have my ear to the keyhole and you go beyond your promise out shes whisked so i caution you not to spend rashly those two words sir  and he followed mrs manners out of the room frowning and shaking his fist at me in mock fierceness i would have died for the man for a spacea prodigious long spacei lay very still my heart bumping like a guncarriage broke loose and my eyes riveted on the crack of the door then i caught the sound of a light footstep the knob turned and joy poured into my soul with the sweep of a fundy tide  dorothy i cried dorothy  she put her finger to her lips  there sir said she now you have spoken them both at once  she closed the door softly behind her and stood looking down upon me with such a wondrous lovelight in her eyes as no man may describe my fancy had not lifted me within its compass my dreams even had not imagined it and the fire from which it sprang does not burn in humbler souls so she stood gazing those lips which once had been the seat of pride now parted in a smile of infinite tenderness but her head she still held high and her body straight down the front of her dress fell a tucked apron of the whitest linen and in her hand was a cup of steaming broth  you are to take this richard she commanded and added with a touch of her old mischief mind sir if i hear a sound out of you i am to disappear like the fairy godmother  i knew full well she meant it and the terror of losing her kept me silent she put down the cup placed another pillow behind my head with a marvellous deftness and then began feeding me in dainty spoonfuls something which was surely nectar and mine eyes too had their feast never before had i seen my lady in this gentle guise this task of nursing the sick which her doing raised to a queenly art  her face had changed some years of trial unknown to me had left an ennobling mark upon her features increasing their power an hundred fold and the levity of girlish years was gone how i burned to question her but her lips were now tight closed her glance now and anon seeking mine and then falling with an exquisite droop to the coverlet for the old archness at least would never be eradicated presently after she had taken the cup and smoothed my pillow i reached out for her hand it was a boldness of which i had not believed myself capable but she did not resist and even as i thought pressed my fingers with her own slender ones the red of our maryland holly blushing in her cheeks and what need of words indeed our thoughts too flew coursing hand in hand through primrose paths and the angels themselves were not to be envied  a master might picture my happiness waking and sleeping through the short winter days that came and went like flashes of gray light the memory of them is that of a figure tall and lithe a little more rounded than of yore and a chiselled face softened by a power that is one of the worlds mysteries dorothy had looked the lady in rags and housewifes cap and apron became her as well as silks or brocades when for any reason she was absent from my side i moped to the quiet amusement of mrs manners and the more boisterous delight of aunt lucy who took her turn sewing in the window i was near to forgetting the use of words until at length one rare morning when the sun poured in the jolly doctor dressed my wounds with more despatch than common and vouchsafed that i might talk awhile that day  oh cries he putting me as ever to confusion but i have a guess whom my gentleman will be wishing to talk with but ill warrant sir you have said a deal more than i have any notion of without opening your lips  and he went away intolerably pleased with his joke  alas for the perversity of maiden natures it was not my dear nurse who brought my broth that morning but mrs manners herself she smiled at my fallen face and took a chair at my bedside  now my dear boy she said you may ask what questions you choose and i will tell you very briefly how you have come here  i have been thinking mrs manners i replied that if it were known that you harboured one of john paul joness officers in london very serious trouble might follow for you  i thought her brow clouded a little  no one knows of it richard or is likely to dr barry like so many in england is a good whig and friend to america and you are in a part of london far removed from mayfair she hesitated and then continued in a voice that strove to be lighter this little house is in charlotte street marylebone for the war has made all of us suffer some and we are more fortunate than many for we are very comfortable here and though i say it happier than in arlington street and the best of our friends are still faithful mr fox with all his greatness has never deserted us nor my lord comyn indeed we owe them much more than i can tell you of now she said and sighed they are here every day of the world to inquire for you and it was his lordship brought you out of holland  and so i had reason once more to bless this stanch friend  out of holland i cried  yes one morning as we sat down to breakfast mr ripleys clerk brought in a letter for dorothy but i must say first that mr dulany who is in london told us that you were with john paul jones you can have no conception richard of the fear and hatred that name has aroused in england insurance rates have gone up past belief and the kings ships are cruising in every direction after the traitor and pirate as they call him we have prayed daily for your safety and dorothywell here is the letter she received it had been opened by the inspector and allowed to pass and it is to be kept as a curiosity she drew it from the pocket of her apron and began to read                    the texel october 3 1779     my dear miss dorothy i would not be thought to flutter yr gentle    bosom with needless alarms nor do i believe i have misjudged yr    warm  generous nature when i write you that one who is held very    high in yr esteem lies exceeding ill at this place who might by    tender nursing regain his health i seize this opportunity to say    my dear lady that i have ever held my too brief acquaintance with    you in london as one of the sacred associations of my life from    the little i saw of you then i feel sure that this appeal will not    pass in vain i remain yr most humble and devoted admirer                    james orchardson   and she knew it was from commodore jones i asked in astonishment  my dear replied mrs manners with a quiet smile we women have a keener instinct than menthough i believe your commodore has a womans intuition yes dorothy knew and i shall never forget the fright she gave me as she rose from the table and handed me the sheet to read crying but the one word she sent off to brook street for lord comyn who came at once and in half an hour the dear fellow was set out for dover he waited for nothing since war with holland was looked for at any day and his lordship himself will tell you about that rescue within the week he had brought you to us your skull had been trepanned you had this great hole in your thigh and your heart was beating but slowly by mr foxs advice we sent for dr barry who is a skilled surgeon and a discreet man despite his manner and you have been here for better than three weeks richard hanging between life and death  and i owe my life to you and to dorothy i said  to lord comyn and dr barry rather she replied quickly we have done little but keep the life they saved and i thank god it was given me to do it for the son of your mother and father  something of the debt i owed them was forced upon me  they were poor doubtless driven to make ends meet and yet they had taken me in called upon near the undivided services of an able surgeon and worn themselves out with nursing me nor did i forget the risk they ran with such a guest for the first time in many years my heart relented toward mr marmaduke for their sakes i forgave him over and over what i had suffered and my treatment of him lay like a weight upon me and how was i to repay them they needed the money i had cost them of that i was sure after the sums i had expended to aid the commodore with the ranger and the bon homme richard i had scarce a farthing to my name with such leaden reflections was i occupied when i heard mrs manners speaking to me  richard i have some news for you which the doctor thinks you can bear today mr dulany who is exiled like the rest of us brought them it is a great happiness to be able to tell you my dear that you are now the master of carvel hall and like to stay so  the tears stole into her eyes as she spoke and the enormity of those tidings coming as they did on the top of my dejection benumbed me all they meant was yet far away from my grasp but the one supreme result that was first up to me brought me near to fainting in my weakness  i would not raise your hopes unduly richard the good lady was saying but the best informed here seem to think that england cannot push the war much farther if the colonies win you are secure in your title  but how is it come about mrs manners i demanded with my first breath  you doubtless have heard that before the declaration was signed at philadelphia your uncle grafton went to the committee at annapolis and contributed to the patriot cause and took very promptly the oath of the associated freemen of maryland thus forsaking the loyalist party  yes yes i interrupted i heard of it when i was on the cabot he thought his property in danger  just so said mrs manners laughing he became the best and most exemplary of patriots even as he had been the best of tories he sent wheat and money to the army and went about bemoaning that his only son fought under the english flag but very little fighting has philip done my dear well when the big british fleet sailed up the bay in 77 your precious uncle made the first false step in his long career of rascality he began to correspond with the british at philadelphia and one of his letters was captured near the head of elk a squad was sent to the kent estate where he had been living to arrest him but he made his escape to new york and his lands were at once confiscated by the state  then they belong to the state i said with misgiving  not so fast richard at the last session of the maryland legislature a bill was introduced through the influence of mr bordley and others to restore them to you their rightful owner and insomuch as you were even then serving the country faithfully and bravely and had a clean and honourable record of service the whole of the lands were given to you and now my dear you have had excitement enough for one day     chapter liv more discoveries  all that morning i pondered over the devious lane of my life which had led up to so fair a garden and one thing above all kept turning and turning in my head until i thought i should die of waiting for its fulfilment now was i free to ask dorothy to marry me to promise her the ease and comfort that had once been hers should god bring us safe back to maryland the change in her was little less than a marvel to me when i remembered the wilful miss who had come to london bent upon pleasure alone truly she was of that rare metal which refines and then outshines all others and there was much i could not understand a miracle had saved her from the duke of chartersea but why she had refused so many great men and good was beyond my comprehension not a glimpse of her did i get that day though my eyes wandered little from the knob of the door and even from aunt lucy no satisfaction was to be had as to the cause of her absence  clare to goodness marse dick said she with great solemnity clare to goodness ise nursed miss dolly since she was dat high and neber one minnit obher life is i knowed what de chile gwine t do de next she aint neber yit done what i calcelated on  the next morning after the doctor had dressed my wounds and bantered me to his hearts content enters mr marmaduke manners i was prodigiously struck by the change in him and pitied him then near as much as i had once despised him he was arrayed in finery as of old but the finery was some thing shabby the lace was frayed at the edges there was a neat but obvious patch in his smallclothes and two more in his coat his air was what distressed me most of all being that of a man who spends his days seeking favours and getting none i had seen too many of the type not to know the sign of it  he ran forward and gave me his hand which i grasped as heartily as my weakness would permit  they would not let me see you until today my dear richard he exclaimed i bid you welcome to what is left of our home tis not arlington street my lad  but more of a home than was that grander house mr manners  he sighed heavily  alas said he poverty is a bitter draught and we have drunk deep of it since last we beheld you my great friends know me no more and will not take my note for a shilling they do not remember the dinners and suppers i gave them faith this war has brought nothing but misery and how we are to get through it god knows  now i understood it was not the war but mr marmaduke himself which had carried his family to this pass and some of my old resentment rekindled  i know that i have brought you great additional anxiety and expense mr manners i answered somewhat testily the care i have been to mrs manners and dorothy i may never repay but it gives me pleasure to feel sir that i am in a position to reimburse you and likewise to loan you something until your lands begin to pay again  there the carvel speaks he cried and the true son of our generous province you can have no conception of the misfortunes come to me out of this quarrel the mortgages on my western shore tobacco lands are foreclosed and wilmot house itself is all but gone you well know of course that i would do the same by you richard  i smiled but more in sadness than amusement hardship had only degraded mr marmaduke the more and even in trouble his memory was convenient as is that of most people in prosperity i was of no mind to jog his recollection but i wanted badly to ask about his grace where had my fine nobleman been at the critical point of his friends misfortunes for i had had many a wakeful night over that same query since my talk with mcandrews  so you have come to your own again richard my lad said mr marmaduke breaking in upon my train i have felt for you deeply and talked many a night with margaret and dorothy over the wrong done you between you and me he whispered that uncle of yours is an arrant knave whom the patriots have served with justice to speak truth sir i begin myself to have a little leaning to that cause which you have so bravely espoused  this time i was close to laughing outright but he was far too serious to remark my mirth he commenced once more with an ahem which gave me a better inkling than frankness of what bothered him  you will have an agent here richard i take it said he your grandfather had one ahem doubtless this agent will advance you all you shall have need of when you are well enough to see him fact is he might come here  you forget mr manners that i am a pirate and an outlaw and that you are the shielder of such  that thought shook the pinch of holland he held all over him but he recovered  my dear richard men of business are of no faction and of no nation their motto is discretion and to obtain the factorship in london of a like estate to yours one of them would wear a plaster over his mouth ill warrant you you have but to summon one of the rascals promise him a bit of war interest and he will leave you as much as you desire and nothing spoken  to talk plainly mr manners i replied i think twould be the height of folly to resort to such means when i am better we shall see what can be done  his face plainly showed his disappointment  to be sure he said in a whining tone i had forgotten your friends lord comyn and mr fox they may do something for you now you own your estate my dear sir i dislike to say aught against any man mrs manners will tell you of their kindness to us but i vow i have not been able to see it with all the money at their command they will not loan me a penny in my pressing need and i shame to say it my own daughter prevents me from obtaining the money to keep us out of the fleet i know she has spoken to dulany think of it richard my own daughter upon whom i lavished all when i had it who might have made a score of grand matches when i gave her the opportunity and now we had all been rolling in wealth ill be sworn i dont comprehend her nor her mother either who abets her for they prefer to cook maryland dainties for a living to put in the hands of the footmen of the ladies whose houses they once visited and how much of that money do you suppose i get sir will you believe it that i he was shrieking now that i the man of the family am allowed only my simple meals a farthing for snuff and not a groat for chaisehire at my age i am obliged to walk to and from their lordships side entrances in patched clothes egad when a new suit might obtain us a handsome years income  i turned my face to the wall completely overcome and the tears scalding in my eyes at the thought of dorothy and her mother bending over the stove cooking delicacies for their livelihood and watching at my bedside night and day despite their weariness of body and not a word out of these noble women of their sacrifice nor of the shame and trouble and labour of their lives who always had been used to every luxury nothing but cheer had they brought to the sickroom and not a sign of their poverty and hardship for they knew that their broths and biscuit and jellies must have choked me no it remained for this contemptible cur of a husband and father to open my eyes  he had risen when i had brought myself to look at him and as i hope for heaven he took my emotion for pity of himself  i have worried you enough for one day with my troubles my lad said he but they are very hard to bear and once in a while it does me good to speak of them  i did not trust myself to reply  it was aunt lucy who spent the morning with me and mrs manners brought my dinner i observed a questioning glance as she entered which i took for an attempt to read whether mr marmaduke had spoke more than he ought but i would have bitten off my tongue rather than tell her of my discoveries though perhaps my voice may have betrayed an added concern she stayed to talk on the progress of the war relating the gallant storming of stony point by mad anthony in july and the latest tory insurrection on our own eastern shore she passed from these matters to a discussion of general washingtons new policy of the defensive for mrs manners had always been at heart a patriot and whilst i lay listening with a deep interest in comes my lady herself so was it ever when you least expected her even as mammy had said she curtseyed very prettily with her chin tilted back and her cheeks red and asked me how i did  and where have you been these days gone miss willothewisp since the doctor has given me back my tongue i cried  i like you better when you are asleep says she for then you are sometimes witty though i doubt not the wit is other peoples  so i saw that she had tricked me and taken her watch at night for i slept like a trooper after a days forage as to what i might have said in my dreamsthat thought made me red as an apple  dorothy dorothy says her mother smiling you would provoke a saint  which would be better fun than teasing a sinner replies the minx with a little face at me mr carvel a gentleman craves the honour of an audience from your excellency  a gentleman  even so he presents a warrant from your excellencys physician  with that she disappeared mrs manners going after her and who should come bursting in at the door but my lord comyn he made one rush at me and despite my weakness bestowed upon me a bears hug  oh richard cried he when he had released me i give you my oath that i never hoped to see you rise from that bed when we laid you there but they say that love works wondrous cures and egad i believe that now tis love is curing you my lad  he held me off at arms length the oldtime affection beaming from his handsome face  what am i to say to you jack i answered and my voice was all but gone for the sight of him revived the memory of every separate debt of the legion i owed him how am i to piece words enough together to thank you for this supreme act of charity  ods you may thank your own devilish thick head said my lord comyn i should never have bothered my own about you were it not for her had it not been for her happiness do you imagine i would have picked you out of that crew of halfdead pirates in the texel fort  i must needs brush my cheek then with the sleeve of my nightrail  and will you give me some account of this last prodigious turn you have done her i said  he laughed and pinched me playfully  now are you coming to your senses said he there was cursed little to the enterprise richard and thats the truth i got down to dover and persuaded the master of a schooner to carry me to rotterdam that was not so difficult since your terror of the seas was locked up safe enough in the texel in rotterdam i had a travellingchaise stripped and set off at the devils pace for the texel you must know that the whole dutch nation was in an uproaras much of an uproar as those boors ever reachover the arrival of your infamous squadron the court party and our ambassador were for having you kicked out and the republicans for making you at home i heard that their high mightinesses had given paul jones the use of the texel fort for his wounded and his prisoners and thither i ran and i was even cursing the french sentry at the drawbridge in his own tongue when up comes your commodore himself you may quarter me if wasnt knocked off my feet when i recognized the identical peacock of a seacaptain we had pulled out of castle yard along with you and offered a commission in the royal navy  dolly hadnt told you  dolly tell me exclaimed his lordship scornfully she was in a state to tell me nothing the morning i left save only to bring you to england alive and repeat it over and over but to return to your captainhe too was taken all aback but presently he whipt out my name and i his without the jones and when i told him my errand he wept on my neck and said he had obtained unlimited leave of absence for you from the paris commissioners he took me up into a private room in the fort where you were and the surgeon who was there at the time said that your chances were as slim as any mans he had ever seen faith you looked it my lad at sight of your face i took one big gulp for i had no notion of getting you back to her and rather than come without you and look into her eyes i would have drowned myself in the straits of dover  despite the host of troubles he had on his hands your commodore himself came with us to rotterdam now i protest i love that man who has more humanity in him than most of the virtuous people in england who call him hard names if you could have seen him leaning over you and speaking to you and feeling every minute for your heartbeats egad you would have cried and when i took you off to the schooner he gave me an hundred directions how to care for you and then his sorrow bowled him all in a heap  and is the commodore still at the texel i asked after a space  ay that he is with our english cruisers thick as gulls outside waiting for a dead fish but he has spurned the french commission they have offered him saying that of the congress is good enough for him and he declares openly that when he gets ready he will sail out in the alliance under the stars and stripes and for this i honour him added he and charles honours him and so must all englishmen honour him when they come to their senses and by gads life i believe he will get clear for he is a marvel at seamanship  i pray with all my heart that he may said i fervently  god help him if they catch him my lord exclaimed you should see the bloody piratical portraits they are scattering over london  has the risk you ran getting me into england ever occurred to you jack i asked with some curiosity  faith not until the day after we got back richard says he when i met mr attorney general on the street sdeath i turned and ran the other way like the devil was after me for charles fox vows that conscience makes cowards of the best of us  so that is some of charless wisdom i cried and laughed until i was forced to stop from pain  come my hearty says jack you owe me nothing for fishing you out of hollandthat is her debt but i declare that you must one day pay me for saving her for you what have i not always sworn that she loved you did i not pull you into the coffeeroom of the star and garter years ago and tell you that same  my face warmed though i said nothing  oh you sly dog ill warrant there has been many a tender talk just where im sitting  not one said i  slife then what have you been doing he cries seeing her every day and not asking her to marry you my master of carvel hall  since i am permitted to use my tongue she has not come near me save when i slept i answered ruefully  nor will she ill be sworn says he shaken with laughter  ods have you no invention egad you must feign sleep and seize her unawares  i did not inform his lordship how excellent this plan seemed to me  and i possessed the love of such a woman richard he said in another tone i think i should die of happiness she will never tell you how these weeks past she has scarce left your side the threats combined of her mother and the doctor and charles and me would not induce her to take any sleep and time and time have i walked from here to brook street without recognizing a step of the way lifted clear out of myself by the sight of her devotion  what was my life indeed that such a blessing should come into it  when the crash came he continued twas she took command and tis gods pity she had not done so long before mr marmaduke was pushed to the bottom of the family where he belongs and was given only snuffmoney she would give him no opportunity to contract another debt and even charged charles and me to loan him nothing nor would she receive aught from us but he glanced at me uneasilybut she and mrs manners must take to cooking delicacies  yes yes i know i faltered  what has the puppy told you cried he  i nodded he was in here this morning with his woes  and did he speak of the bargain he tried to make with our old friend his grace of chartersea  he tried to sell her again i cried my breath catching i have feared as much since i heard of their misfortunes  yes replied comyn that was the first of it twas while they were still in arlington street and before mrs manners and dorothy knew mr marmaduke goes posting off to nottinghamshire and comes back inside the dukes own carriage and his grace goes to dine in arlington street for the first time in years dorothy had wind of the trouble then charles having warned her and not a word would she speak to chartersea the whole of the dinner nor look to the right or left of her plate and when the servants are gone up gets my lady with a sweep and confronts him  will your grace spare me a minute in the drawingroom says she  he blinked at her in vast astonishment and pushed back his chair when she was come to the door she turns with another sweep on mr marmaduke who was trotting after  you will please to remain here father she said what i am to say is for his graces ear alone  of what she spoke to the duke i can form only an estimate richard my lord concluded but ill lay a fortune twas greatly to the point for in a little while chartersea comes stumbling down the steps and he has never darkened the door since and the cream of it is said comyn that her father gave me this himself with a face a foot long for me to sympathize the little beast has strange bursts of confidence  and stranger confidants i ejaculated thinking of the morning and of courtenays letter long ago  but the story had made my blood leap again with pride of her the picture in my mind had followed his every sentence and even the very words she must have used were ringing in my ears  then as we sat talking in low tones the door opened and a hearty voice cried out  now where is this rebel this traitor they tell me one lies hid in this house slife i must have at him  mr fox i exclaimed  he took my hands in his and stood regarding me  for the convenience of my friends i was christened charles said he  i stared at him in amazement he was grown a deal stouter but my eye was caught and held by the blue coat and buff waistcoat he wore they were frayed and stained and shabby yet they seemed all of a piece with some new grandeur come upon the man  is all the world turning virtuous is the millennium arrived i cried  he smiled with his old boyish smile  you think me changed some since that morning we drove together to holland housedo you remember it after the night at st stephens  remember it i repeated with emphasis ill warrant i can give you every bit of our talk  i have seen many men since but never have i met your equal for a most damnable frankness richard carvel even jack here is not half so blunt and uncompromising but you took my fancygod knows whythat first night i clapped eyes on you in arlington street and i loved you when your simplicity made us that speech at brookss club so you have not forgotten that morning under the trees when the dew was on the grass faith i am glad of it what children we were he said and sighed  and yet you were a junior lord i said  which is more than i am now he answered somehowyou may laughsomehow i have never been able to shake off the influence of your words richard your cursed earnestness scared me  scared you i cried in astonishment  just that said charles jack will bear witness that i have said so to dolly a score of times for i had never imagined such a single character as yours you know we were all of us rakes at fifteen to whom everything good in the universe was a joke and do you recall the teamster we met by the park and how he arrested his salute when he saw who it was at another time i should have laughed over that but it cut me to have it happen when you were along  and ill lay an hundred guineas to a farthing the fellow would put his head on the block for charles now cut in his lordship with his hand on mr foxs shoulder behold o prophet he cried one who is become the champion of the people he reviled behold the friend of rebellion and lese majeste the viper in britannias bosom  oh have done jack said mr fox impatiently you have no more music in your soul than a cow damned little virtue attaches to it richard he went on north threw me out and the king would have nothing to do with me so i had to pick up with you rebels and traitors  you will not believe him richard cried my lord you have only to look at him to see that he lies take note of the ragged uniform of the rebel army he carries and then think of him en petite maitre with his cabriolet and his chestnuts egad he might be as rich as rigby were it not for those principles which he chooses to deride and i have seen him reduced to a crown for them i tell you richard said my lord by espousing your cause charles is become greater than the king for he has the hearts of the english people which george has not and the allegiance of you americans which george will never have and if you once heard him in parliament you should hear him now and see the speaker wagging his wig like a man bewitched and hear friends and enemies calling out for him to go on whenever he gives the sign of a pause  this speech of his lordships may seem cold in the writing my dears and you who did not know him may wonder at it it had its birth in an admiration few men receive and which in charles foxs devoted coterie was dangerously near to idolatry during the recital of it charles walked to the window and there stood looking out upon the gray prospect seemingly paying but little attention but when comyn had finished he wheeled on us with a smile  egad he will be telling you next that i have renounced the devil and all his works richard said he  oohs that i will not his lordship made haste to declare for they were born in him and will die with him  and you jack i asked how is it that you are not in arms for the king and commanding one of his frigates  why it is charless fault said my lord smiling were it not for him i should be helping sir george collier lay waste to your coast towns     chapter lv the love of a maid for a man  the next morning when dr barry had gone mrs manners propped me up in bed and left me for a little so she said then who should come in with my breakfast on a tray but my lady herself looking so fresh and beautiful that she startled me vastly  a penny for your thoughts richard she cried why you are as grave as a screechowl this brave morning  to speak truth dolly said i i was wondering how the commodore is to get away from the texel with half the british navy lying in wait outside  do not worry your head about that said she setting down the tray it will be mere childs play to him oh but i should like to see your commodore again and tell him how much i love him  i pray that you may have the chance i replied  with a marvellous quickness she had tied the napkin beneath my chin not so much as looking at the knot then she stepped to the mantel and took down one of mr wedgwoods cups and dishes and wiping them with her apron filled the cup with fragrant tea which she tendered me with her eyes sparkling  your excellency is the first to be honoured with this service says she with a curtsey  i was as a man without a tongue my hunger gone from sheer happinessand fright and yet eating the breakfast with a relish because she had made it she busied herself about the room dusting here and tidying there and anon throwing a glance at me to see if i needed anything my eyes followed her hither and thither when i had finished she undid the napkin and brushed the crumbs from the coverlet  you are not going i said with dismay  did you wish anything more sir she asked  oh dorothy i cried it is you i want and you will not come near me  for an instant she stood irresolute then she put down the tray and came over beside me  do you really want me sir  dorothy i began i must first tell you that i have some guess at the sacrifice you are making for my sake and of the trouble and danger which i bring you  without more ado she put her hand over my mouth  no she said reddening you shall tell me nothing of the sort  i seized her hand however it struggled and holding it fast continued  and i have learned that you have been watching with me by night and working by day when you never should have worked at all to think that you should be reduced to that and i not know it  her eyes sought mine for a fleeting second  why you silly boy i have made a fortune out of my cookery and fame too for now am i known from marylebone to chelsea while before my name was unheard of out of little mayfair indeed i would not have missed the experience for a ladyinwaitingship i have learned a deal since i saw you last sir i know that the world like our continental money must not be taken for the price that is stamped upon it and as for the watching with you said my lady that had to be borne with as cheerfully as might be since i had sent off for you i was in duty bound to do my share toward your recovery i was even going to add that this watching was a pleasureour curate says the sense of duty performed is sure to be but you used to cry out the most terrifying things to frighten me the pattering of blood and the bumping of bodies on the decks and the black rivulets that ran and ran and ran and never stopped and strange rough commands i could not understand and the name of your commodore whom you love so much and often you would repeat over and over i have not yet begun to fight i have not yet begun to fight  yes twas that he answered when they asked him if he had struck i exclaimed  it must have been an awful scene she said and her shoulders quivered when you were at your worst you would talk of it and sometimes of what happened to you in london of that ride in hyde park oror of vauxhall she continued hurriedly and when i could bear it no longer i would take your hand and call you by name and often quiet you thus  and did i speak of aught else i asked eagerly  oh yes when you were caliper it would be of your childhood of your grandfather and your birthdays of captain clapsaddle and of patty and her father  and never of dolly i suppose  she turned away her head  and never of dolly  i will tell you what you said once richard she answered her voice dropping very low i was sitting by the window there and the dawn was coming and suddenly i heard you cry patty when i return will you be my wife i got up and came to your side and you said it again twice  the room was very still and the vision of patty in the parlour of gordons pride knitting my woollen stocking rose before me  yes i said at length i asked her that the day before i left for the war god bless her she has the warmest heart in the world and the most generous nature do you know what her answer was dorothy  no twas only her lips moving that formed the word she was twisting absently the tassel of the bed curtain  she asked me if i loved her  my lady glanced up with a start then looked me searchingly through and through  and you she said in the same inaudible way  i could answer nothing twas because of her fathers dying wish i asked her and she guessed that same i would not tell her a lie for only the one woman lives whom i love and whom i have loved ever since we were children together among the strawberries need i say that that woman is you dorothy i loved you before we sailed to carvel hall between my grandfathers knees and i will love you till death claims me  then it seemed as if my heart had stopped beating but the snowy apron upon her breast fluttered like a sail stirring in the wind her head was high and her eyes were far away even my voice sounded in the distance as i continued  will you be the mistress of carvel hall dorothy hallowed is the day that i can ask it  what of this earth may excel in sweetness the surrender of that proud and noble nature and her words my dears shall be sacred to you too who are descended from her she bent forward a little those deep blue eyes gazing full into my own with a fondness to make me tremble  dear richard she said i believe i have loved you always if i have been wilful and wicked i have suffered more than you knoweven as i have made you suffer  and now our suffering is over dorothy  oh dont say that my dear she cried but let us rather make a prayer to god  down she got on her knees close beside me and i took both of her hands between my own but presently i sought for a riband that was around my neck and drew out a locket within it were pressed those lilies of the valley i had picked for her long years gone by on my birthday and she smiled though the tears shone like dewdrops on her lashes  when jack brought you to us for dead we did not take it off dear she said gently i wept with sorrow and joy at sight of it for i remembered you as you were when you picked those flowers and how lightly i had thought of leaving you as i wound them into my hair and then when i had gone aboard the annapolis i knew all at once that i would have given anything to stay and i thought my heart would break when we left the severn cliffs behind but that sir has been a secret until this day she added smiling archly through her tears  she took out one of the withered flowers and then as caressingly put it back beside the others and closed the locket  i forbade dr barry to take it off richard when you lay so white and still i knew then that you had been true to me despite what i had heard and if you were to die her voice broke a little as she passed her hand over my brow if you were to die my single comfort would have been that you wore it then  and you heard rumours of me dorothy  george worthington and others told me how ably you managed mr swains affairs and that you had become of some weight with the thinking men of the province richard i was proud to think that you had the courage to laugh at disaster and to become a factor i believe she said shyly twas that put the cooking into my head and gave me courage and when i heard that patty was to marry you heaven is my witness that i tried to be reconciled and think it for the best through my own fault i had lost you and i knew well she would make you a better wife than i  and you would not even let jack speak for me  dear jack she cried were it not for jack we should not be here richard  indeed dolly two people could scarce fall deeper in debt to another than are you and i to my lord viscount i answered with feeling his honesty and loyalty to us both saved you for me at the very outset  yes she replied thoughtfully i believed you dead and i should have married him i think for dr courtenay had sent me that piece from the gazette telling of the duel between you over patty swain  dr courtenay sent you that i interrupted  i was a wild young creature then my dear with little beside vanity under my cap and the notion that you could admire and love any girl but me was beyond endurance then his lordship arrived in england brimming with praise of you to assure me that the affair was not about patty at all this was far from making me satisfied that you were not in love with her and i may say now that i was miserable then as we were setting out for castle howard came the news of your death on the road to upper marlboro i could not go a step poor jack he was very honest when he proposed she added with a sigh  he loved you dorothy  she did not hear me so deep was she in thought  twas he who gave me news of you when i was starving at gordons  and ii starved too richard she answered softly dearest i slid very wrong there are some matters that must be spoken of between us whatever the pain they give and my heart aches now when i think of that dark day in arlington street when i gave you the locket and you went out of my life i knew that i had done wrong then richard as soon as ever the door closed behind you i should have gone with you for better for worse for richer for poorer i should have run after you in the rain and thrown myself at your feet and that would have been best for my father and for me  she covered her face with her hands and her words were stifled by a sob  dorothy dorothy i cried drawing her to me another time not now when we are so happy  now and never again dear she said yes i saw and heard all that passed in the drawingroom and i did not blame but praised you for it i have never spoken a word beyond necessity to my father since god forgive me she cried but i have despised him from that hour when i knew that he had plotted to sell me to that detestable brute working upon me to save his honour of which he has not the smallest spark that he had recognized and denied you friendless before our house and sent you into the darkness at vauxhall to be murdered then he was no father of mine i would that you might know what my mother has suffered from such a man richard  my dear i have often pitied her from my soul i said  and now i shall tell you something of the story of the duke of chartersea she went on and i felt her tremble as she spoke that name i think of all we have lord comyn to thank for next to saving your life twice was his telling you of the danger i ran and richard after refusing you that day on the balcony over the park i had no hope left you may thank your own nobility and courage that you remained in london after that richard she said do you recall my asking you in the coach on the way from castle yard for the exact day you met my father in arlington street  yes i replied in some excitement yes for i was at last to come at the bottom of this affair  the duke had made a formal offer for me when first we came to london i think my father wrote of that to dr courtenay i smiled at the recollection now then his grace persisted in following me everywhere and vowed publicly that he would marry me i ordered him from our house since my father would not at last one afternoon he came back to dine with us insolent to excess i left the table he sat with my father two hours or more drinking and singing and giving orders to the servants i shut my door that i might not hear after a while my mother came up to me crying saying that mr manners would be branded with dishonour and i did not consent to marry his gracea most terrible dishonour of which she could not speak that the duke had given my father a month to win my consent and that month was up richard the very afternoon you appeared with mr dix in arlington street  and you agreed to marry him dolly i asked breathlessly  by the grace of heaven i did not she answered quickly the utmost that i would consent to was a two months respite promising to give my hand to no one in that interval and so i was forced to refuse you richard you must have seen even then that i loved you dear though i was so cruel when you spoke of saving me from his grace i could not bear to think that you knew of any stain upon our family i thinki think i would rather have died or have married him that day i threw charterseas presents out of the window but my father made the servants gather them all which escaped breaking and put them in the drawingroom then i fell ill  she was silent i clinging to her and shuddering to think how near i had been to losing her  it was jack who came to cheer me i said presently  his faith in you was never shaken sweetheart but i went to newmarket and ampthill and behaved like the ingrate i was i richly deserved the scolding he had for me when i got back to town which sent me running to arlington street there i met dr james coming out who asked me if i was mr carvel and told me that you had called my name  and you goose you never suspected says she smiling  how was i to suspect that you loved a provincial booby like me when you had the choice of so many accomplished gentlemen with titles and estates  how were you to perceive indeed that you had qualities which they lacked  and you were forever vowing that you would marry a nobleman my lady for you said to me once that i should call you so and ride in the coach with the coroneted panels when i came home on a visit  and i said too retorted dolly with mischief in her eyes do you remember what i told you the new years eve when we sat out by the sundial at carvel hall when i was so proud of having fixed dr courtenays attentions i said that i should never marry you sir who was so rough and masterful and thrashed every lad that did not agree with you  alas so you did and a deal more i exclaimed  with that she broke away from me and getting to her feet made me a low curtsey with the grace that was hers alone  you are my lord and my king sir she said and my rough patriot squire all in one  are you happy dolly i asked tremulous from my own joy  i have never been happy in all my life before richard dear she said  in truth she was a being transformed and more wondrous fair than ever and even then i pictured her in the brave gowns and jewels i would buy her when times were mended when our dear country would be free all at once ere i could draw a breath she had stooped and kissed me ever so lightly on the forehead  the door opened upon aunt lucy she had but to look at us and her black face beamed at our blushes my lady threw her arms about her neck and hid her face in the ample bosom  now praise de good lawd cried mammy i knowed it dis longest time whats i done tole you miss dolly whats i done tole you honey  but my lady flew from the room presently i heard the spinet playing softly and the words of that air came out of my heart from long ago            love me little love me long           is the burthen of my song           love that is too hot and strong           burneth soon to waste           still i would not have thee cold           nor too backward nor too bold           love that lasteth till tis old           fadeth not in haste     chapter lvi how good came out of evil  twas about candlelight when i awoke and dorothy was sitting alone beside me her fingers were resting upon my arm and she greeted me with a smile all tenderness  and does my lord feel better afterafter his excitement today she asked  dorothy you have made me a whole man again i could walk to windsor and back  you must have your dinner or your supper first sir she answered gayly and do you rest quiet until i come back to feed you oh richard dear she cried how delightful that you should be the helpless one and dependent on me  as i lay listening for the rustle of her gown the minutes dragged eternally every word and gesture of the morning passed before my mind and the touch of her lips still burned on my forehead at last when i was getting fairly restless the distant tones of a voice deep and reverberating smote upon my ear jarring painfully some longforgotten chord that voice belonged to but one man alive and yet i could not name him even as i strained the tones drew nearer and they were mixed with sweeter ones i knew well and dorothys mothers voice whilst i was still searching the door opened the voices fell calm and dorothy came in bearing a candle in each hand as she set them down on the table i saw an agitation in her face which she strove to hide as she addressed me  will you see a visitor richard  a visitor i repeated with misgiving twas not so she had announced comyn  will you see mr allen  mr allen who was the rector of st annes mr allen in london and here  yes her breath seemed to catch at the word he says he must see you dear and will not be denied how he discovered you were with us i know not  see him i cried and i had but the half of my strength i would fling him downstairs and into the kennel will you tell him so for me dorothy  and i raised up in bed shaken with anger against the man in a trice she was holding me fearfully  richard richard you will open your wound i pray you be quiet  and mr allen has the impudence to ask to see me  listen richard your anger makes you forget many things remember that he is a dangerous man and now that he knows you are in london he holds your liberty perhaps your life in his hands  it was true and not mine alone but the lives and liberty of others  do you know what he wishes dorothy  no he will not tell us but he is greatly excited and says he must see you at once for your own good for your own good richard  i do not trust the villain but he may come in i said at length  she gave me the one lingering anxious look and opened the door  never had i beheld such a change in mortal man as there was in mr allen my old tutor and rector of st annes and twas a baffling intangible change twas as if the mask bad been torn from his face for he was now just a plain adventurer that need not have imposed upon a soul the coarse wine and coarse food of the lower coffeehouses of london had replaced the rich and abundant fare of maryland the next day was become one of the terrors of his life his clothes were of poor stuff but aimed at the fashion and yetand yet as i looked upon him a something was in his face to puzzle me entirely i had seen many stamps of men but this thing i could not recognize  he stepped forward with all of his old confidence and did not regard a farthing my cold stare  tis like gone days to see you again richard he cried and i perceive you have as ever fallen into the best of hands  i am mr carvel to my enemies if they must speak to me at all i said  but my dear fellow i am not your enemy or i should not be here this day and presently i shall prove that same he took snuff but first i must congratulate you on coming alive out of that great battle off flamborough you look as though you had been very near to death my lad a deal nearer than i should care to get  what to say to the man what to do save to knock him down and i could not do that  there can be no passing the time of day between you and me mr allen i answered hotly you whose machinations have come as near to ruining me as a mans can  and that was your own fault my dear sir said he as he brushed himself you never showed me a whit of consideration which is very dear to men in my position  my head swam then i saw dolly by the door regarding me curiously with something of a smile upon her lips but anxiety still in her eyes with a by your leave maam to her mr allen took the chair abreast me  you have but to call me when you wish richard said she  nay dorothy mr allen can have nothing to say to me that you may not hear i said instantly and you will do me a favour to remain  she sat down without a word where i could look at her mr allen raised his eyebrows at the revelation in our talk but by the grace of god he kept his mouth shut  and now mr allen i said to what do i owe the pain of this visit  the pain he exclaimed and threw back his head and gave way to a fit of laughter by the mass your politeness drowns me but i like you richard as i have said more than once i believe your brutal straightdealing has more to do with my predilection than aught else for i have seen a deal of rogues in my day  and they have seen a deal of you mr allen  so they have he cried and laughed the more egad miss dorothy you have saved all of him i think then he swung round upon me very careless has your uncle grafton called to express his sympathies richard he asked  that name brought a cry out of my head dolly seizing the arm of her chair  grafton carvel in london i exclaimed  ay in very pretty lodgings in jermyn street for he has put by enough ill warrant you despite the loss of his lands your aunt is with him and his dutiful son philip now broken of his rank in the english army they arrived before yesterday from new york  and to what is this an introduction i demanded  i merely thought it strange said mr allen imperturbably that he had not called to inquire after his nephews health  dolly was staring at him with eyes wide open  and pray how did he discover i was in london sir i said i was about to ask how you knew of it but that is one and the same thing  he shot at me a look not to be solved  it is not well to bite the hand that lifts you out of the fire richard said he  you had not gained admission to this house were i not on my back mr allen  and that same circumstance is a blessing for you he cried  twas then i saw dorothy making me mute signals of appeal  i cannot think why you are here mr allen i said when you consider all the harm you have done me and all the doubledealing i may lay at your door can you blame me for my feelings  no he answered with more soberness than he had yet used i honour you for them and perchance i am here to atone for some of that harm for i like you my lad and thats gods truth  all this is neither here nor there mr allen i exclaimed wholly out of patience if you have come with a message let me have it if not i beg you get out of my sight for i have neither the will nor the desire for palavering  oh richard do keep your temper implored dorothy can you not see that mr allen desires to do usto do youa service  of that i am not so sure i replied  it is his way miss manners said the rector and i hold it not against him to speak truth i looked for a worse reception and came steeled to withstand it and had my skin been thin i had left ere now he took more snuff it was mr dix he said to me slowly who informed mr carvel of your presence in london  and how the devil did mr dix know  he did not reply but glanced apprehensively at dorothy  and i have wondered since at his consideration  miss manners may not wish to hear he said uneasily  miss manners hears all that concerns me i answered  he shrugged his shoulders in comprehension  it was mr manners then who went to mr dix and told him under the pledge of secrecy  not a sound came from dorothy nor did i dare to look at her face the whole matter was clear to me now after his conversation with me mr marmaduke had lost no time in seeing mr dix in order to raise money on my prospects and the man of business had gone straight to grafton with the intelligence the suspicion flashed through me that mr allen had been sent to spy but his very next words disarmed it  and now richard he continued before i say what i have come to say and since you cannot now prosecute me i mean to confess to you something which you probably know almost to a certainty i was in the plot to carry you off and deprive you of your fortune i have been paid for it though not very handsomely fears for my own safety alone kept me from telling you and mr swain and i swear to you that i was sorry for the venture almost before i had embarked and ere i had received a shilling the scheme was laid out before i took you for a pupil indeed that was part of it as you no doubt have guessed as god hears me i learned to love you richard in those days at the rectory you were all of a man and such an one as i might have hoped to be had i been born like you you said what you chose and spoke from your own convictions and catered to no one you did not whine when the luck went against you but lost like a gentleman and thought no more of it you had no fear of the devil himself why should you while your cousin philip with his parrot talk and sneaking ways turned my stomach i was sick of him and sick of grafton i tell you but dread of your uncle drove me on and i had debts to frighten me  he paused twas with a strange medley of emotions i looked at him and dorothy too was leaning forward her lips parted and her eyes riveted upon his face  oh i am speaking the truth he said bitterly and i assume no virtue for the little justice it remains in my power to do it is the lot of my life that i must be false to some one always and even now i am false to your uncle yes i am come to do justice and tis a strange errand for me i know that estates have been restored to you by the maryland legislature richard and i believe in my heart that you will win this war here he fetched a memorandum from his pocket but to make you secure said he in the year 1710 and on the 9th of march old style your greatgrandfather mr george carvel drew up a document entailing the lands of carvel hall by this they legally pass to you  the family settlement mr swain suspected i exclaimed  just so he answered  and what am i to pay for this information i asked  hardly were the words spoken when dorothy ran to my bedside and seizing my hand faced him  hehe is not well mr allen she cried  the rector had risen and stood gazing down at us with the whole of his life written on his face that look was fearful to see and all of hell was expressed therein for what is hell if it is not hope dead and buried and galling regret for what might have been with mine own great happiness so contrasted against his torture my heart melted  i am not well indeed mr allen i said god knows how hard it is for me to forgive but i forgive you this night  one brief instant he stared at me and then tumbled suddenly down into his chair his head falling forward on his arms and the long sobs by which his frame was shaken awed our very souls dorothy drew back against me clasping my shoulder the tears wet upon her cheeks what we looked on there in the candlelight was the revelation itself  how long it endured none of us might say and when at last he raised his face it was haggard and worn in truth but the evil of it seemed to have fled again and again he strove to speak the words would not obey and when he had mastered himself his voice was shattered and gone  richard i have sinned heavily in my time and preached gods holy word with a sneer and unbelief in my heart he knows what i have suffered and what i shall yet suffer before his judgment comes for us all but i beg it is no sin to pray to him for your happiness and miss dorothys  he stumbled there and paused and then continued with more steadiness  i came here tonight to betray you and might have gone hence to your uncle to claim my pieces of silver i remain to tell you that grafton has an appointment at nine with his majestys chief secretary of state i need not mention his motives nor dwell upon your peril for the kings sentiments toward paul jones are well known you must leave london without delay and so must mr manners and his family  is it the generations which decide when i remember bow dorothy behaved that night i think so scarce had the rector ceased when she had released me and was standing erect before him pity was in her eyes but in her face that courage which danger itself begets in heroic women  you have acted a noble part this day mr allen she said to atone for the wrongs you have done richard may god forgive you and make you happier than you have been  he struggled to his feet listening as to a benediction then with a single glance to give me confidence she was gone and for a minute there was silence between us  how may you be directed to i asked  he leaped as out of a trance  just the world richard said he for i am adrift again and not very like to find a harbour now  you were to have been paid for this mr allen i replied and a man must live  a man must live he cried the devil coined that line and made it some mens history  i have you on my conscience mr allen i went on for i have been at fault as well as you i might have treated you better even as you have said and i command you to assign a place in london whence you may be reached  a letter to the mitre coffeehouse will be delivered he said  you shall receive it i answered and now i bid you goodby and thank you  he seized and held my hand then walked blindly to the door and turned abruptly  i do not tell you that i shall change my life richard for i have said that too many times before indeed i warn you that any money you may send will be spent in drink andand worse i will be no hypocrite to you but i believe that i am better this hour than i have been since last i knelt at my mothers knee in the little oxfordshire cottage where i was born  when dorothy returned to me there was neither haste in her step nor excitement in her voice her very coolness inspired me  do you feel strong enough for a journey richard she asked  to the worlds end dolly if you will but go with me  she smiled faintly i have sent off for my lord and mr fox and pray that one of them may be here presently  scarcely greater were the visible signs of apprehension upon mrs manners her first care and dorothys was to catechise me most particularly on my state and whilst they were so occupied mr marmaduke entered wholly frenzied from fright and utterly oblivious to his own blame in the matter he was sent out again directly after that with aunt lucy to assist they hurriedly packed what few things might be taken the costly relics of arlington street were untouched and the french clock was left on the mantel to tick all the night and for days to come in a silent and forsaken room or perhaps to greet impassively the kings officers when they broke in at the door but i caught my lady in the act of wrapping up the wedgwood cups and dishes  in the midst of these preparations mr fox was heard without and was met at the door by dorothy two sentences sufficed her to tell him what had occurred and two seconds for this man of action to make his decision  in an hour you shall have travelling chaises here dorothy he said you must go to portsmouth and take ship for lisbon and if jack does not arrive i will go with you  no charles you must not she cried her emotion conquering her for the nonce that might be to ruin your career and perchance to lose your life and suppose we were to escape what would they say of you  fish charles retorted to hide some feelings of his own once our rebel is out of the country they may speak their minds they have never lacked for names to call me and i have been dubbed a traitor before now my dear lady  he stepped hastily to the bed and laid his hand on me with affection  charles i said this is all of a piece with your old recklessness you were ever one to take any risk but i will not hear of such a venture as this do you think i will allow the hope of all england to be staked for a pirate and would you break our commander of her rank all that dorothy need do at portsmouth is to curtsey to the first skipper she meets and ill warrant he will carry us all to the antipodes  egad but that is more practical than it sounds he replied with a glance of admiration at my lady as she stood so tall before us she has a cool head richard carvel and a long head andand im thinking you are to come out of this the best of all of us you cannot get far off your course my lad with her at the helm  it was there his voice belied the jest in his words and he left us with precipitation  they lifted me out of my sheets i was appalled to discover my weakness and bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets my feet were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings and dorothy bound her own silk kerchief at my throat whispering anxious questions the while and when her mother and mammy went from the room her arms flew around my neck in a passion of solicitude then she ran away to dress for the journey and in a surprising short time was back again with her muff and her heavy cloak and bending over me to see if i gave any signs of failure  fifty and five minutes had been registered by the french clock when the rattle of wheels and the clatter of hoofs sounded below and charles fox panted up the stairs muffled in a huge wraprascal twas he and aunt lucy carried me down to the street dorothy walking at my side and propped me up in the padded corner of one of the two vehicles in waiting this was an ample travellingcarriage with a lamp hanging from its top by the light of which my lady tucked me in from head to foot and then took her place next me aunt lucy filled most of the seat opposite the baggage was hoisted up behind and charles was about to slam the door when a hackneychaise turned the corner at a gallop and pulled up in the narrow street abreast and the figure of my lord comyn suddenly leaped within the compass of the lanthorns rays he was dressed as for a ball with only a thin raincloak over his shoulders for the night was thick with mist he threw at us a startled look that was a question  jack richard is to be betrayed tonight by his uncle said charles shortly and i am taking them to portsmouth to get them off for lisbon  charles said his lordship sternly give me that greatcoat  it was just the one time that ever i saw uncertainty on mr foxs face he threw an uneasy glance into the chaise  i have brought money his lordship went on rapidly twas that kept me for i guessed at something of this kind give me the coat i say  mr fox wriggled out of it and took the oiled cape in return  thank you jack he said simply and stepped into the carriage who is to mend my waistcoats now he cried faith i shall treasure this against you richard goodby my lad and obey your rebel general alas i must even ask your permission to salute her  and he kissed the unresisting dorothy on both her cheeks god keep the two of you he said for i love you with all my heart  before we could answer he was gone into the night and my lord standing without had closed the carriage door and that was the last i saw of this noble man the true friend of america who devoted his glorious talents and his life to fighting the corruption that was rotting the greatness of england he who was followed by the prayers of the english race was ever remembered in our own humble ones     chapter lvii i come to my own again  twas a rough wild journey we made to portsmouth my dears and i think it must have killed me had not my lady been at my side we were no sooner started than she pulled the curtains and opened her portmanteau which i saw was near filled with things for my aid and comfort and i was made to take a spoonful of something never i believe was medicine swallowed with a greater willingness talk was impossible so i lay back in the corner and looked at her and now and anon she would glance at my face with a troubled guess in her own as to how i might stand the night for we were still in london that i knew by the trot of our horses and by the granite we traversed from time to time but at length we rumbled over a bridge there was a sharp call back from our postboy to him of the chaise behind and then began that rocking and pitching and swaying and creaking which was to last the whole night long save for the brief stops at the posthouses  after an hour of it i was holding my breath against the lurches like a seasick man against that bottomless fall of the ships bows on the ocean i had no painonly an over whelming exhaustionbut the joy of her touch and her presence kept me from failing and though aunt lucy dozed not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary twelve hours always alert was she solicitous beyond belief scanning ever the dial of her watch to know when to give me brandy and physic or reaching across to feel my temples for the fever the womanliness of that last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at but most marvellous of all was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfortof the leathery travelled smell of the carriage as a relief for this she charged her pocketnapkin with a most delicate perfume and held it to my face  when we drew up to shift horses jack would come to the door to inquire if there was aught she wanted and to know how i was bearing up and often mrs manners likewise at first i was for talking with them but this dorothy would not allow presently indeed it was beyond my power and i could only smile feebly at my lord when i heard dolly asking him that the hostlers might be more quiet toward morning a lethargy fell upon me once i awoke when the lamp had burned low to perceive the curtains drawn back a black blotch of trees without and the moonlight streaming in on my ladys features with the crack of a whip i was off again  when next consciousness came the tarry salt smell of a ship was in my nostrils and i knew that we were embarked i lay in a clean bunk in a fairsized and sunwashed cabin and i heard the scraping of ropes and the tramp of feet on the deck above my head framed against the irregular glass of the cabin window which was greened by the water beyond dorothy and my lord stood talking in whispers  jack i said  at the sound they turned and ran toward me asking how i felt  i feel that words are very empty jack to express such a gratitude as mine i answered twice you have saved me from death you have paid my debts and have been stanch to us both in our troubles and the effort was beyond me and i glanced appealingly at dolly  and it is to you dear jack she finished it is to you alone that we owe the great joy of our lives  her eyes were shining through her tears and her smile was like the sun out of a rainswept sky his lordship took one of her hands in his own and one of mine he scanned our faces in a long lingering look  you will cherish her richard he said brokenly for her like is not to be found in this world i knew her worth when first she came to london as arrant a baggage as ever led man a dance i saw then that a great love alone was needed to make her the highest among women and from the night i fought with you at the coffee house i have felt upon whom that love would fall o thou of little faith he cried what little i may have done has been for her no richard you do not deserve her but i would rather think of her as your wife than that of any man living  i shall not dwell upon that painful farewell which wrung our hearts and made us silent for a long long while after the ship was tossing in the short seas of the channel  nor is it my purpose to tell you of that long voyage across the atlantic we reached lisbon in safety and after a week of lodgings in that city by the best of fortune got passage in a swift bark bound for baltimore for the chesapeake commerce continued throughout the war and kept alive the credit of the young nation there were many excitements ere we sighted the sandspits of virginia and off the azores we were chased for a day and a night by a british sloop of war our captain however was a cool man and a seaman and slipped through the cruisers lying in wait off the capes very triumphantly  but the remembrance of those fair days at sea fills my soul with longing the weather was mild and bright for the season and morning upon morning two stout topmen would carry me out to a sheltered spot on the deck always chosen by my lady herself there i sat by the hour swathed in many layers of wool and tended by her hands alone every nook and cranny of our lives were revealed to the other she loved to hear of patty and my years at gordons and would listen with bated breath to the stories of the ranger and the bonhomme richard and of that strange man whom we both loved whose genius had made those cruises famous sometimes in low voices we talked of our future but often when the wind blew and the deck rocked and the sun flashed upon the waters a silence would fall between us that needed no word to interpret  mrs manners yielded to my wish for us all to go to carvel hall it was on a sparkling morning in february that we sighted the familiar toe of kent island and the goodnatured skipper put about and made for the mouth of our river then as of old the white cupola of carvel house gleamed a signal of greeting to which our full hearts beat a silent response once again the great windmill waved its welcome and the same memory was upon us both as we gazed of a hale old gentleman in the sheets of a sailing pinnace of a boy and a girl on his knees quivering with excitement of the days to come dorothy gently pressed my hand as the bark came into the wind and the boat was dropped into the green water slowly they lowered me into it for i was still helpless dorothy and her mother and aunt lucy were got down and finally mr marmaduke stepped gingerly from the sealadder over the gunwale the cutter leaped under the strong strokes up the river with the tide then as we rounded the bend we were suddenly astonished to see people gathered on the landing at the foot of the lawn where they had run no doubt in a flurry at sight of the ship below in the front of the group stood out a strangely familiar figure  why exclaimed dolly it is ivie rawlinson  ivie it was sure enough and presently when we drew a little closer he gave one big shout and whipped off the hat from his head and off too came the caps from the white heads of scipio and chess and johnson behind him our oars were tossed ivie caught our bows and reached his hand to dorothy it was fitting that she should be the first to land at carvel hall  twas yere bonny face i seed first miss dolly he cried the tears coursing down the scars of his cheeks an syne i kennt weel the young master was here noo god be praised for this blythe day that mr richards cam to his ain at last  but scipio and chess could only blubber as they helped him to lift me out dolly begging them to be careful as they carried me up the familiar path to the pillared porch the first i asked ivie was of patty and next why he had left gordons she was safe and well despite the tories and herself had sent him to take charge of carvel hall as soon as ever judge bordley had brought her the news of its restoration to me he had supplied her with another overseer thanks to the good judge and to colonel lloyd who had looked to my interests since grafton was fled ivie had found the old place in good order all the negroes quiet and impatient with joy against my arrival  it is time my children to bring this story to a close i would i might write of those delicious spring days i spent with dorothy at carvel hall waited on by the old servants of my grandfather at our whim my chair would be moved from one to another of the childhood haunts on cool days we sat in the sun by the dial where the flowers mingled their odours with the salt breezes off the chesapeake or anon when it was warmer in the summerhouse my mother loved or under the shade of the great trees on the lawn looking out over the river and once my lady went off very mysteriously her eyes brimful of mischief to come back with the first strawberries of the year staining her apron  we were married on the fifteenth of june already an anniversary for us both in the long drawingroom general clapsaddle was there from the army to take dorothy in his arms even as he had embraced another bride on the same spot in years gone by she wore the wedding gown that was her mothers but when the hour was come to dress her aunt lucy and aunt hester failed in their task and it was patty who performed the most of that office and hung the necklace of pearls about her neck  dear patty she hath often been with us since you have heard your mothers and fathers speak of aunt patty my dears and they will tell you how she spoiled them when they went avisiting to gordons pride  ere i had regained my health the war for independence was won i pray god that time may soften the bitterness it caused and heal the breach in that noble race whose motto is freedom that the stars and stripes and the union jack may one day float together to cleanse this world of tyranny     afterword  the author makes most humble apologies to any who have or think they have an ancestor in this book he has drawn the foregoing with a very free hand and in the maryland scenes has made use of names rather than of actual personages his purpose however poorly accomplished was to give some semblance of reality to this part of the story hence he has introduced those names in the setting choosing them entirely at random from the many prominent families of the colony  no one may read the annals of these men who were at once brave and courtly and of these women who were ladies by nature as well as by birth and not love them the fascination of that free and hospitable life has been so strong on the writer of this novel that he closes it with a genuine regret and the hope that its perusal may lead others to the pleasure he has derived from the history of maryland  as few liberties as possible have been taken with the lives of charles james fox and of john paul jones the latter hero actually made a voyage in the brigantine john about the time he picked up richard carvel from the black moll after the episode with mungo maxwell at tobago the scotch scene of course is purely imaginary accuracy has been aimed at in the account of the fight between the bonhomme richard and the serapis while a little different arrangement might have been better for the medium of the narrative to be sure it was mr mease the purser instead of richard carvel who so bravely fought the quarterdeck guns and in reality midshipman mayrant commodore joness aide was wounded by a pike in the thigh after the surrender no injustice is done to the second and third lieutenants who were absent from the ship during the action  the author must acknowledge that the only good anecdote in the book and the only verse worth printing are stolen the story on page concerning mr garrick and the archbishop of york may be found in fitzgeralds life of the actor much better told the verse in chapter x is by an unknown author in the annapolis gazette and is republished in mr elihu rileys excellent history of annapolis        pg editors bookmarks       a bold front is half the battle      a man ought never to be frightened by appearances      affections warm despite absence and years and interest      ever been my nature to turn forward instead of back      genius honored but never encouraged      god bless their backs which is the only part i ever care to see      he was our macaroni of annapolis      human multitude with its infinity of despairs and joys      it is sorrow which lifts us nearest to heaven      no real prosperity comes out of doubledealing      shaped his politics according to the company he was in      sight of happiness is often a pleasure for those who are sad      sir i have not yet begun to fight      the worse the disease the more remarkable the cure      their lines belonged rather to the landscape cottages      thy politics are not over politic      tis no so bad it michtna be waur      within every mans province to make himself what he will      ya maun ken th incentives the maist o the battle      youth is in truth a mystery
