boys at the doctors door                                171      how did you know carrots lived here teddy asked     sternly                                                     197      what are you

his friends who were seated on a curbstone not far from the newsboys lodging house gravely discussing a business proposition which had been made by sid barker  whats the matter reddy jackson asked replacing his fragment of a hat  come over here an you must be quick about it or the show will be ended  skip was so excited that his acquaintances and friends concluded it must be something of considerable importance to cause him to move in such a lively manner and they followed him a short distance down the street until it was possible to have a full view of the fountain  there the cause of master jellisons agitation could be seen  seated on the edge of the iron basin with a newspaper parcel unrolled in front of him was a boy apparently about twelve years of age who to the newsboy spectators looked painfully neat and clean skip and his friends saw that the boy was a stranger in the city  the newcomer had taken from their newspaper wrappings a small cake of yellow soap and a piece of cotton cloth  laying these on the iron edge of the fountain basin he calmly proceeded to wash his face and hands using a plentiful amount of soap and then to the intense astonishment of the spectators applied the impromptu towel vigorously  well that fellers too good for downtown skip said in what he intended for a sarcastic tone he blongs up at the fif avenoo  oh hes jest got in from the country an is goin to buy brooklyn bridge sid suggested  look at him jest look at him skip cried in mingled excitement and anger that the boy should be so criminally neat  the stranger had taken from his valise of paper a comb which he calmly proceeded to use the water in the basin serving as a mirror and then to the surprise and disdain of the spectators he gave his clothes a vigorous brushing with a whiskbroom  well see here and skip spoke in the tone of one who is uncertain whether it is best to laugh or be angry that fellers makin me tired sposn we go over an give him a shakin up jest for fun come on and skip led the way across the street at full speed  the stranger looked up calmly when they approached but betrayed neither astonishment nor alarm and skip involuntarily halted a few paces away as he asked gruffly say young feller whatre you tryin to do  cant you see  i thought i did but these chaps here made sure there must be some mistake about it  the boy gazed critically at those who were surrounding him and then replied  well cordin to the looks of the whole crowd i should think you might be sprised to see a fellow wash his face an comb his hair  now dont get too fresh sid said threateningly as he stepped forward to skips side we didnt come here to git the pinion of any country jay  then why did you want er know  cause say youd better mind your eye young feller if you count on stayin round this city very long there was a chap jest like you come down here last week tryin to put on airs an his folks are huntin for him now  well you neednt be worried anybodyll be lookin for me cause theres nobody wants to know where i am so go ahead if ive been doin anything you perfessors dont like  sid apparently decided that it was hardly advisable for him to make too many threatening gestures because the stranger was not at all disturbed by them and even seemed disposed to court the possibly dreadful encounter  he finished brushing his clothes and then packed his valise by rolling the different articles carefully in the newspaper then instead of going away as skip and his friends seemed to think he should have done as soon as they arrived he stood with his hands on his hips as if waiting for them to take their departure for a minute no one spoke and the silence was really painful  the newsboys were mentally taking the measure of this stranger who appeared ready to defy them and the latter finally asked impatiently well whatre you fellers countin on doin i reckon im no great sight for you to stand lookin at  do you live here skip asked  im goin to now had it tough enough gettin here an dont feel like leavin till ive found out what there is in this city  where did you come from  up saranac way  rode down in a parlorcar i spose  then you spose wrong cause i walked  you dont look it and once more skip scrutinised the stranger carefully  i dont reckon i do i count on keepin myself kind er decent it doesnt cost anything for a feller to wash his face comb his hair or have his clothes clean an theres many a time when itll put him through in great shape  illustration youd better mind your eye if you count on stayin round this city very long said skip  goin to live on the interest of your money i spose  well you spose right this time was the quiet reply thats my calkerlation but itll be on what i earn not what ive got  dead broke  not quite and the boy took from his pocket a number of pennies holding them in one hand while he guarded himself against a possible attack there were twenty of em when i come cross the ferry an i blieve none of em have got away since  what are you goin to do here sid asked beginning to fancy that possibly this stranger was a boy whom it would be worth his while to cultivate and in order to show his friendliness he seated himself in a studied attitude of careless ease on the edge of the basin while the others immediately followed his example  whatever will bring in money enough for my keep an a little over  thinkin of sellin papers reddy asked  i reckon thatll be bout the first job cause ive got to make money enough for my supper or dig too big a hole in my capital  whats your name  teddy thurston  do you spose the fellers down here what run the newspaper business are goin to have you comin in takin the bread an butter out er their mouths sid asked angrily  no i dont reckon they will but you see im not after that exacly you fellersll never find me tryin to get your bread an butter but ill tell you what you can count on for a fact and now the stranger spoke in a very decided tone im reckonin on stickin to the newspaper business if theres any money in it jest as long as i want to i didnt travel all the way down here to get scared the first day you see i figger it bout like this sam thompson he came to the city last summer an some fellersi dont know whether it was you or notmade it hot for him it wasnt moren a week before he was glad to walk back although he came down in the cars now i thought id begin right where sam left off id walk the first way an then perhaps stand a better chance of ridin the other if i had to go but its got to be boys what are bigger than i am to scare me out er the plan ive come to stay  oh you have and there was no mistaking the fact that skip was sarcastic we may have something to say bout that  then you want er talk quick cause after im settled down itll be a pretty hard job to make any trade with me  where you goin to begin business  i dont know yet ill look round a while an catch on before night somewhere i reckon there are fellers in this town that would show a green hand how to get his papers an where the best places were eh  thats jest cordin to how you start in young feller and sid arose to his feet in order to make his words more expressive if you want to go to work an mind your eye i dont know but it can be done but you wont get along this way youre puttin on too many frillsthats whats the matter with you an theyll have to be taken off  well perhaps they will and teddy turned as if to leave his new acquaintances you see im pretty green an may be countin on doin too much ill try it a spell anyhow  we allers low when its greed a new hand can go to work that he stands treat the first thing  oh i see well i dont have to do that cause it aint been greed yet when i want you fellers to tell me what i can do perhaps i may come down cordin to your idees but jest now ive got too much business on hand and the stranger walked away as if these young gentlemen who claimed to control the newspaper business of new york city were of no especial importance in his eyes  look here fellers skip said wildly for he always contrived to work himself into a state of intense excitement over the most trifling matters the way hes goin on now hell be the boss of newspaper row before mornin less we take a hand in it  what are you goin to do sid asked in much too quiet a tone to suit his excited friend  thump his head the very first time he tries to sell a paper to start with an run him out er town before termorrer night  i dont see how you can tackle him now when he aint doin anything  of course not but he brags hes goin to an the first time he tucks a bundle of papers under his arm ill give him one to remember  look out you dont git it the sames you did last week over in brooklyn teenie massey cried in his shrillest tones which hardly ever failed to excite master skips anger  dont you mind how i got it over in brooklyn ill tend to my business you tend to yours if we waited for you to do anything wed all be baldheaded was skips answer to this taunt but teenie was not at all abashed it was his favourite amusement to arouse skips anger and rely upon his diminutive stature to escape a whipping for master jellison prided himself upon his ability to flog any fellow of his size in new york you fellers meet me in front of the times office at noon an ill show him up in great shape less he comes to hisself before then which i reckon he will cause hell never have the nerve to stand up agin the whole crowd of us said skip  meanwhile the stranger was apparently giving no heed to the young tyrant who had decided it would be impossible for him to remain in the city but continued on his way downtown ignorant of and perhaps careless regarding the fact that he was to be debarred from earning a livelihood by selling newspapers if skip jellisons power was as great as he would have others believe     chapter ii  the assault   the appearance of the cleanlooking boy even though his clothes were rather shabby attracted no particular attention among the small army of newsboys and bootblacks to be found in the vicinity of city hall park and teddy thurston was enabled to survey the scene around him without interruption  during a few moments he interested himself in what to the country lad must have been a bewildering scene and then mentally pulling himself together he began to watch the young gentlemen who were selling papers  near by him were several bootblacks who appeared to be doing a flourishing business and he said to himself jingling the coins in his pocket as if trying to revive his courage  if i had money enough to buy brushes an a box i blieve id black boots for a while it seems as if there was a good deal of profit in it one of those fellows has earned fifteen cents since i stood here an im sure the papersellers arent doin so well  just at that moment a small boy with particularly red hair and a stubby nose on which was a large smudge of blacking finished his work of polishing a gentlemans boots and pocketed with an air of satisfaction the three extra pennies which had been given him  then standing very near teddy he whistled in the most contented manner possible  the boy from saranac looked at him a moment as if trying to decide whether the city fellow would be willing to give the desired information and then asked  say what do the brushes cost  i paid ikey cain forty cents for these two the stranger replied without hesitation as he displayed the articles last mentioned theyre good ones i couldnt have got em lessn a dollar down on fulton street  that settles me teddy said as if speaking to himself and then without particular animation he inquired whats the cost of the boxes  oh the fellers dont buy these they make em all youve got to do is ask some man in a store for one an if he gives it to you find a chunk of wood an whittle out this top part its the blackin what takes the profits off i paid twenty cents for that bottle last monday an its moren half gone already  teddy ceased jingling his coins and was about to turn away when his new acquaintance asked was you thinkin of shinin  eh  i mean was you goin inter the business  no i cant havent got money enough i reckon ill have to sell papers for a while  youll be jest as rich the small boy said as he added another smudge of blacking to his nose by rub bing it in a thoughtful manner you see when it rains the fellers can sell papers all the same but we have to lay off cause nobody wants their boots shined in wet weather where do you live  well about anywhere now you see i jest come down from saranac to find out how i could earn my livin  what was you doin up there  i worked for farmer taylor a spell but he wouldnt give me moren my clothes an when a feller has to work a year on the farm for sich a rigout as ive got here it dont seem as if hed get rich very soon  i aint so sure the boy with the blackened nose said as he surveyed the stranger you seem to be rigged out pretty swell an i guess they fed you well enoughgave you all you wanted eh  oh yes i got enough to eat an a fair place to sleep in but it seems as though a feller like me ought er have moren that if he works hard all day for it  well i spose he had but you see theres a good many times when business is dull round here an if you havent got the cash to pay right up to dots for a room youll have a chance to sleep where you can ive been thinkin of goin on to a farm myself but i dont seem to get ahead fast enough to make a break  teddy was rather pleased with his new acquaintance the redhaired boy was the first in the city who had treated him with the slightest degree of friendliness and it would have been gross carelessness to neglect him  whats your name he asked as he moved slowly toward one of the benches with an air which invited the bootblack to sit down  well its joseph williams but nobody round here calls me that the fellers sing out carrots when they want me cause you see my hair is red  yes i could tell that in the dark teddy said with a smile as he looked at master williamss flamecolored head  i dont care what they call me if it does em any good to sing out carrots whenever i go by why let em do it but thats what makes me think bout goin to farmin  what is  cause they yell so much bout carrots i dont know as id like sich things for i never eat any but it seems as if a feller thats so redheaded as i am blongs in the country  i dont know how you make that out  neither do i but thats the way it looks to me must be nice to be where theres grass sos you can get up in the mornin an run round in the fields  yes but thats what you wouldnt be doin if you was livin on a farm youd have to hustle an theres enough work in the mornin without runnin round the fields i tell you  what did you use ter do  well first place i fed the cows we didnt keep any sheep but i looked after the hosses an pigs an then there was a pesky little calf that gave me lots o trouble but look here teddy added quickly theres plenty of time for me to tell you bout a farm jest now i want er do somethin to earn my livin can you show me where to get some papers  are you goin into the business sure  only for a little while i dont count on sellin papers all my life you see i low to make money enough sos i can go inter somethin reglar for myself  oh you do eh and master carrots indulged in a bit of sarcasm well i reckon itll be a pretty long while before you earn that much youll be mighty lucky to have all you want er eat an a place to sleep what have you got in your pocket  nothin perticlar thats my baggage and in order to prove his friendliness toward the redhaired stranger teddy displayed the contents of the newspaper parcel greatly to the surprise of his new acquaintance  whats that little brush for  why to clean my teeth of course  carrots looked at his new friend in surprise which amounted almost to bewilderment  well teddy asked whats the matter  well seems as if you was puttin on a good deal of style for a feller that hasnt got money enough to buy the outfit for the bootblack trade  i dont know as theres anything so queer bout that but you fellers seem to think theres no call to keep yourselves lookin clean  well you see we dont claim to be swells  yes so i see teddy replied then he added say these fellers seem to be sellin a good many papers sposn you show me where to buy some  all right come along and slinging his box over his shoulder carrots started across printing house square threading his way in and out of the vehicles in a manner which seemed to teddy almost criminally reckless  more than once before the short journey was ended did the boy from saranac fancy he would be trampled under the feet of the horses but by dint of his own exertions aided now and then by a vigorous pull from his guide he was soon standing in an illventilated room where half a dozen fellows were clamouring for round flat pieces of brass  herei dont want those teddy said as carrots led the way to the desk where the disks were being sold  but youve got to have the checks if you count on gettin papers give me your money how many do you want  ill take twenty cents worth anyhow an see what i can do with them as a starter and teddy handed the pennies confidently to his new acquaintance  carrots laid the coins in front of the busy man at the desk received the bits of brass and with them went to the counter on which large numbers of newspapers were lying where he received teddys first stock in trade  find out what the news is an yell the best you know how carrots said pushing the young gentleman from saranac toward the streetdoor and five minutes later the new merchant was following his friends advice to the letter by crying his wares in such a manner as excited the mirth of the other dealers  it seems to me i aint doin this jest right teddy said to himself and then he waited a moment listening to the more experienced venders  it was not long before he succeeded in imitating their cries and had already sold four papers when skip jellison who was accompanied by his friends sid barker and teenie massey appeared in view  there he is teenie cried in his shrillest tones now lets see you go for him hes actin as if he owned the whole town  skip prepared for battle by rolling up his coatsleeves and settling his dilapidated cap more firmly on his head then running swiftly forward he confronted teddy as he was on the point of selling a paper to a gentleman through a horsecar window  skip did not wait to be attacked for he believed in striking the first blow as a means of confusing the enemy and before teddy recognized the boy who had threatened him he received a severe blow in the face which caused him to reel backward  the paper fell from his hand the horsecar continued its way and this important transaction in news was nipped in the bud to the serious loss of the young merchant  teddy was bewildered for an instant as skip had expected and he did not recover his selfpossession until master jellison had struck him once more this time without serious effect since the blow being a hasty one glanced from the boys shoulder  it sufficed however to throw teddys stock of papers into the mud of the street thereby ruining several so that they would not sell to fastidious customers and this more than the injury received aroused teddys ire  the boy from saranac may have been ignorant concerning the customs of the city but he was thoroughly well aware that it was necessary to defend himself and an instant later skip found he had quite as much on hand as he could attend to properly  teddy giving no heed to his wares struck out with more strength than science and forced his adversary to beat a swift retreat  now youve got it teenie shrieked as if delighted that skip had met an opponent who was a match for him  but skip paid no heed to teenie and raising his fists as an invitation to teddy to come on awaited the conclusion of the battle confident as to who would be the victor  teddy had no idea of holding back for this attack was but the beginning of a series which was intended to drive him out of business and it was necessary it should be repulsed if he wished to earn his livelihood by the sale of newspapers  therefore he advanced boldly and aimed what was intended for a stinging blow at his antagonists face but it was met by skips arm and before teddy could raise his hand again teenie squeaked loudly and shrilly enough to have been heard at the postoffice  cops hi fellers heres de cops  illustration teddy is arrested while his enemies escape  teddy was wholly at a loss to know what was meant by this cry although he understood it was one of warning and as he looked around to ascertain the cause skip turned and immediately started at full speed across the park intent only on escaping from the bluecoated guardians of the peace  with a cry of triumph teddy followed in pursuit but before he had traversed twenty yards a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder and he found himself in the clutches of one of the park guards  ive made up my mind that this sort of things been going on long enough the officer said shaking the boy from saranac as he led him toward the approaching policeman you little ragamuffins seem to think this parks kept for you to fight in but now im going to show you whats what  just let me get hold of the fellow who knocked my papers in the mud and ill show you whats what teddy cried not understanding that he had been arrested they arent goin to drive me away from this town if i know myself  well now there wont be anybody able to do that till after you settle with the court the guard said as he handed his prisoner over to the policeman and teddys face grew pale as he realized that his attempted entrance into the business community of new york city was to be checked in an ignominious manner     chapter iii  the arrest   the policeman marched teddy along while he whistled a remarkably merry tune which the young prisoner thought out of place  if anybody had shown sufficient curiosity regarding him to have asked teddy if he had any friends in the city his reply would have been that he had none but he would have been wrong as events proved  master joseph williams otherwise known as carrots had witnessed the affray from a distance but was not able to take an active part in it during the brief time it lasted owing to the fact of his being occupied just at that moment in blacking a customers boots but when teddy had been dragged less than a block on the road to his dungeon cell by the whistling officer he had completed his task and what was more to the purpose received therefor the amount of money which it was customary to expect  now this boy from saranac had no claim upon the redheaded blackenednosed young bootblack but despite the fact that carrotss face was not cleanly and that his general appearance was generally disreputable he was ever ready to assist others  slinging his box over his shoulder he ran to the scene of the assault just in time to rescue teddys stock of newspapers from beneath the feet of a drayhorse and followed with all speed after the officer and prisoner  teddy plunged into a very slough of despond was suffering himself to be taken through the streets like a criminal when he was startled by hearing a hoarse whisper directly behind him at the same instant his hand was grasped by another  say cant you wriggle out er that cops fist carrots asked but teddy shook his head mournfully  this is what comes of bein brought up in the country the bootblack muttered to himself regretfully  dont lose your pluck he said aloud im goin to stand by you through this thing cause its all come out er that skip jellisons gang an hes forever pickin on somebody  i dont know what you can do teddy replied mournfully speaking in an ordinary tone then glancing around the policeman noticed that his prisoner was holding a conversation with a seeming friend  now then what do you want young chap the officer asked  nothin at all said carrots it aint agin the law to speak to a fellow is it when hes walkin through the streets  is this boy a friend of yours  bet your life he is offcer carrots replied earnestly why were jest like twins you dont spose im goin to see him lugged away when he aint been doin nothin at all do you  illustration now then what do you want young chap the officer asked  if you boys who loaf near city hall keep on doing this nothing at all business more of you will be arrested before a great while the officer said grimly you seem to think that parks made for you to fight in but it wont take long to show you youre mistaken  but this fellow wasnt fightin carrots replied in a positive tone i was only a little ways off when skip jellison come up hit him a clip an knocked his papers out er his hands what kind of a duffer would he be if he hadnt tried to square things the only trouble is he didnt have a chance to do any fightin before that crookednosed park guard got hold of him say it dont seem to me jest right that a reglar policeman should help that gray thing along in the way hes actin  why dont you come up before the commissioners and give them an idea of how the police force of the city ought to be run the officer asked sarcastically  well i would but you see i aint got the time when a fellers doin sich a business ez i am it keeps him right down to dots carrots replied gravely  its really a pity the way you must be rushed the officer said with a laugh and made bold by this apparent friendliness carrots ventured to make a request  say where are you goin to take him  down to the stationhouse of course  well said carrots it wouldnt be any harm if i walked alongside of him an talked over a little business would it  its nothing to me so long as you dont help him escape  you neednt be fraid i wouldnt raise my hand gainst you cause youre a pretty good kind of a man an that sort is mighty scarce round this part of the city  i suppose now that i have won your good opinion it wont be long before im a captain will it the officer asked laughingly  if i had my way youd be a general before night but i aint standin in with the commissioners like i ought to be carrots said with mock gravity  thenfor they were getting dangerously near the stationhe whispered to teddy  look here old man you want ter keep your upper lip mighty stiff jest now an ill get you out er this scrape somehow i spose therell have to be a reglar trial down to the tombs and ill bring the fellers there to swear you didnt do anything well show up that skip jellison gang in great shape tomorrow mornin less i can coax you off from this cop  its no use to try it teddy replied mournfully i reckon ill have to go to prison  now see here thats just the way you fellers from the country aint got any sand about you thats whats the matter dont get down in the mouth over this thing cause as i said before im goin to see you through  but what can you do against a lot of policemen  wait and see praps i havent lived in this city a good many years an dont know how to fix things carrots replied as if he were positive how the matter might be arranged yet at the same time he had not the remotest idea what it would be possible to do toward aiding this boy  teddy was not reassured by the remark  although a stranger in the city he knew that young carrots would not be able to do very much to help him and felt sure his business career was ruined  how much money have you got carrots whispered  not moren ten cents you see i had jest begun to sell papers when they nabbed me how much do you want  ive got enough i was only thinkin bout you here take this it may come in handy before mornin and the bootblack pressed several coins into the prisoners hand  i dont want it teddy replied as he attempted in vain to return the money you mustnt give your cash away like this an besides what good will it do me  thats jest what we dont know its allers better to have a little stuff in your pocket no matter what happens ive got your papers an am goin to sell em so ill get my money back you jest let me run this thing an see how quick well have it shipshape  there was no opportunity for further discussion for by this time the three had arrived at the door of the stationhouse and carrots who had a wholesome dread of such places made no attempt to enter  ill see you tonight if they hold on to you but if the sergeant turns out to be an easy kind of a feller an lets you go come right up to city hall to find me  i reckon there wont be any chance of his getting on the streets this afternoon the officer said as he halted for a moment to give his prisoners friend a bit of kindly advice hell have to go down to the tombs for trial in the morning and if you boys can prove that he wasnt really fighting but only trying to prevent another fellow from taking his papers hell stand a good show of slipping off ill see that the case isnt shoved very hard  youre a dandy next time you want your boots shined come right where i am an if i dont do it for nothin itll be cause my blackin has run out carrots cried enthusiastically and then wheeling suddenly he ran at full speed in the opposite direction  it seems to me im gettin a pretty big job on my hands he muttered to himself when he was at printing house square once more ive promised to help that boy out er this scrape an dont see how its goin to be done the fellers wont dare to go up and say anything against skip jellison cause hes sich a terrible fighter guess he can get the best of anybody round here in lessn three rounds i wish i dared to tackle him i dont blieve he can do as much as he makes out then carrots suddenly bethought himself of the papers which yet remained under his arm and added jiminy i most forgot bout these its time they were worked off or else theyll be too old to sell and soon he was crying the news again  half an hour later the substitute newsboy was hailed by teenie massey who asked  what are you up to now carrots shifted business  say teenie was you round here when skip jellison hit that feller from the country  yes an if the cops hadnt come along so soon skip would have been sorry he tackled sich a job i blieve that new feller can fight  so do i but he didnt stand any show at all the way things were these are his papers an im sellin em for him  where is he now  jailed  well that settles him  i aint so sure of it you know an i know an all the rest of the fellers know that skip jellison didnt have any business to run round punchin him jest cause he was a new hand im goin to see if there aint some chance of gettin him clear  whatll you do break into the stationhouse an pull him out teenie asked excitedly believing any of his friends capable of doing such a thing because of the style of reading in which he indulged wherein such deeds are often performed in print by the smallest and most feeble boys  well i dont count on doin quite so well as that carrots replied thoughtfully rubbing his nose once more and thereby adding to the smudge of blacking which already nearly covered his face i kind er lowed wed get a lot of the fellers an go down to court termorrer mornin when hes brought up sos to tell the story jest as it is the judge is bound to let him off then an i wouldnt be sprised if skip jellison found hisself in a scrape  teenie shook his head very decidedly  dont think it can be done eh  whore you goin to get to tell that yarn in court skip would about knock the head off er the feller that did him that turn  i know that he is terrible hes jest terrible carrots replied reflectively but i dont see why it is the fellers round here let skip jump on em so if three or four of us turned to we could thump him and do it easy an yet all hands lie down like lambs whenever he happens to want to wink  why dont you give him a pounding  you see i cant do it alone id be willin to go in if anybodyd start in with me cause its got pretty nigh time somethin was done or else that fellerll own the whole town say will you go down to court with me an tell what you know bout this thing  teenie gazed at his toes several seconds before replying and then said  i dont know whether ill have time carrots but ill see you tonight an let you know  carrots muttered to himself as his acquaintance was lost to view among the crowd of busy pedestrians  that fellers pretty nigh scared out er his life bout skip there aint any use thinkin hell help in this trouble  half an hour later when carrots had disposed of the stock of papers purchased by teddy and was congratulating himself skip jellison approached looking very fierce as he asked in a threatening tone  see here carrots what is it you are up to now  me carrots replied in surprise why im shinin boots sames ever  now dont try to be too smart you know what i mean  well if i do im a duffer what are you drivin at skip anyhow  aint you been tellin what you was goin to do to help that feller from the country that i settled this forenoon  didnt strike me as if you settled him very much if hed had half a chance hed a settled you  youve got to be took down a peg or two skip said threateningly as he doubled his fist and brandished it before carrotss face  want ter git another feller rested do you well i aint goin to fight  youd better not if you know whats good for yourself  i wont scrap cause i dont want to git jailed but you cant frighten me no matter how bad you jump round  look out for yourself thats all im sayin master jellison replied angrily im watchin you an the very first time you go to meddlin with that feller from the country whats got to be drove out this city ill make you sorry for it  its very polite o you to give me a friendly warnin carrots replied in the most innocent and pleasant tone  skip had nothing more to say but walked away with a dignity befitting one who considers it his mission in life to regulate the business affairs of a large city     chapter iv  the prisoner   although carrots had pretended that skips threats neither frightened nor disturbed him he was thoroughly uncomfortable in mind  he knew by past experience what master jellison could and would do with no provocation whatever save only a desire to exercise that authority which he had assumed  carrots believed however that in case of an encounter with a boy who was ready and forced to defend himself skip would not prove so great a master of the manly art of selfdefense as he claimed to be  but such a champion had not as yet been found  teenie massey had chanced to be in brooklyn about a week before the arrival of teddy in the city and upon his return home he had stated that he had seen master jellison attack a boy not nearly so large as himself on pineapple street in that city and receive a sound beating  he wasnt in it at all from the time they begun teenie had stated to his friends and on more than one occasion he had referred to this defeat in the presence of skip himself  it is but fair to say however that skip jellison positively denied the truth of any such statement in explanation of the blackened eye and badly swollen lip he brought from brooklyn he announced that he had been set upon by a crowd of young ruffians  of course a fellers goin to get some clips when he tackles a dozen or fifteen fellers at once skip explained to an admiring audience shortly after master masseys story had been noised about the streets but every one of em got it worsen i did an it wasnt moren five minutes before all hands were runnin lickertysplit up fulton street i reckon they didnt stop till they got to prospect park teenie wants to make out a good story but its all a whopper an he knows it  now although carrots believed that master massey had told the truth in regard to what really occurred in brooklyn carrots did not feel competent to take upon himself the task of cowing the bully and he felt reasonably certain skip would carry his threats into effect should occasion arise  carrots was also quite positive the occasion would arise because he did not intend to desert teddy  im goin right ahead with what i greed to do he said to himself if skip wants to thump me for it i spose ill have to let him  these reflections were interrupted by reddy jackson who asked as he approached and halted in front of carrots  seen skip lately  he jest went away been round kinder reglatin the town goin to rest hisself cause hes most played out workin so hard  did he tell you anything  yes thought i was rather meddlin with his business but i dont see how that is  now look here carrots im a friend of yours an dont want ter see any trouble come out er this thing skips jest wild bout what youve told the other fellers an i reckon hell do as he says if you try to help that feller what got rested  you lowed you was a friend of mine didnt you reddy  thats what i said  well then why dont you show it by helpin me stand up gainst sich a bully as skip jellison is stead of comin here and tellin me what hes goin to do to hear some of you fellers talk anybodyd think he was a reglar rhinoceros huntin round to eat folks now its jest like this ive got to help that feller cause i promised him  but you dont even know who he is  i didnt ask him to write out a history bout hisself an swear to it sos i could tell you fellers but hes like all the rest of us got to hustle for a livin an has come down here to do it now what business is that of skip jellisons he doesnt own this townaint even got a mortgage on ityet he makes out this feller cant stay an tries to lick him now i spose you think its mighty smart to try an shove that country feller down  you dont know anything bout it carrots he put on more frills this mornin than you ever saw in a circus procession we aint goin to stand that of course not  i spose it broke your heart cause his face was clean didnt it and it was apparent from carrotss tone that he was losing his temper  oh well go ahead an see how youll come out thats all i jest thought id tell you sos you wouldnt get into a fuss with skip but if this is the way youre goin on why let her flicker for all i care  im much obliged to you for bein so willin an when i want another favor ill call round an see you carrots replied as he turned on his heel while reddy walked rapidly away  it looks as if id got to put this thing through alone carrots said to himself an if thats so itll be a good idea for me to keep away from where skip is cause if he should get a whack at me im afraid i wouldnt be in a condition to do much of anything for a day or two  carrots visited all of his acquaintances in whom he felt he could confide trying to enlist their sympathies in the work which he had undertaken  unfortunately for his purpose however he did not find any who were willing simply because of the stranger to brave the doughty skips wrath and nearly every one advised carrots to give it up before he got into trouble  not until nearly nightfall was the welldisposed bootblack willing to cease his efforts in this particular direction  then he repaired to a certain restaurant on baxter street where he appeared to be well acquainted with the waiters and called for a hearty meal of corned beef and potatoes at the expense of fifteen centsan unusual amount for him as could have been told by the remark which the waiter made  aint you spreadin yourself some tonight carrots  well it does look a little that way but you see ive got a lot of business on hand and i need to be braced up a bit  bought out some other bootblack or found a bigger line of customers  well no im buyin stocks now the wall street men are kind er fraid ill down em an theyre makin me hustle  ohgone into the stock exchange eh  well i havent been any further than the gallery yet but thats all right you dont want ter put in a piece of pie with this corned beef an take the chance of a rise in western union for the pay do you  no i guess not it would be too much like speculatin  well i didnt spose you would but im comin round here in the mornin to give your boss some points about runnin his business carrots replied and handing over his money he walked with a majestic air into the street  having thus refreshed the inner man carrots bent his way in the direction of the stationhouse  it was his intention to ask for an interview with the prisoner who had been arrested in city hall park and he felt extremely doubtful whether this request would be granted until he entered the building and recognized in the sergeant behind the desk an old customer  his surprise at meeting a friend when he had expected to see the stern visage of a mere servant of justice was quite as great as it was pleasing and he marched up to the desk and said familiarly  if id knowed you was here id a come before  i dont want my boots shined now see you outside in the morning said the sergeant  but i aint shinin im on business  oh you are eh well whats up  one of the pleecemen round city hall arrested a feller this mornin what had jest walked down from saranac an its all wrong i tell youall wrong  hes a friend of yours i suppose  well you cant exactly call him that i never spoke to him till jest before this thing happened i want ter git him right out on portant business  im afraid you will have to wait a little while and explain the whole affair to the judge in the morning i havent any authority to do a thing like that  couldnt you fix it with the judge  no indeed the officer replied laughingly the best way is for you to go to the court yourself and explain how it happened unless he is really guilty in which case i suppose he will have to go to the island i fancy a week up there wouldnt do him any harm  but you see it was jest this wayand carrots assumed an attitude such as one takes when about to begin a long story  never mind it now i cant stop to listen and besides it wouldnt do any good  carrots looked up as if surprised that an old friend should assume a dictatorial tone and then suddenly remembering that he had another favour to ask added  well you can let me see him cant you  what good will that do  why i jest want to brace him up a little you see hes pretty green an he must be feelin awful bad by this time i wont stay moren five minutes if youll let me see him  all right go downstairs youll find him in one of the cells and if the turnkey says anything tell him i sent you  carrots did not wait for further instructions but fearful lest the permission should be withdrawn hurried down the stairs at once and was making a tour of the cells with the purpose of finding his friend when the officer in charge stopped him  what do you want here  the sergeant sent me down to see a friend of mine thats all an im lookin for him  the boy they brought in this noon  thats the very one  hes over there third cell from the end  carrots walked quickly to the place looked in through the grated door and saw teddy lying on a wooden bench which served the double purpose of a seat and a bed the young prisoners face was covered by his hands  come old man carrots said soothingly you ought ter have more sand than to give up like this besides aint i here to help you  teddy leaped to his feet immediately and came to the door through which carrots thrust a very grimy hand as he said  shake hands brace up an have some style about you ive been tendin to your business pretty nigh ever since you was gone an thought id jest run in to let you know everything will be all right but youll have to stay here till mornin  till mornin teddy repeated in dismay  yes that aint sich a very long while an itll take me till then to get things fixed  how did they happen to let you in  oh you see the sergeant is an old friend of mine ive blacked his boots on an off for most a year  then carrots with the hope of cheering his friend began to explain what might be done toward effecting the prisoners release and when it was time to bring the interview to a close he had so far succeeded that teddy was really quite hopeful believing there was no serious obstacle in the way of his freedom  bidding teddy adieu carrots left the stationhouse  it was now so nearly dark that carrots turned in the direction of his own home for the purpose of gaining as much rest as possible before beginning what looked like a hard piece of work  now carrots was a householder in his own right or at least by right of discovery  more than one of his acquaintances had been eager to know where he lived but he avoided all questions on the subject save to one personteenie massey  in addition to his being a trusted friend teenie lived with his parents therefore when carrots revealed the secret it was with the knowledge that master massey would not wish to share the dwelling with him  to avoid interference carrots always approached his home in the most cautious manner and this occasion was no exception  he walked leisurely along in the direction of canal street as if going nowhere in particular for the purpose of misleading any friends whom he might meet and on arriving at an alleyway which ran between two shops he halted for an instant to make sure the coast was clear  he recognized no one in the immediate vicinity and wheeling sharply around ran swiftly up the narrow passage climbed over a board fence and dropped lightly into a yard in the rear of a business establishment  here was an enormous collection of packingcases some stacked in regular order and others lying carelessly around wherever they might have chanced to fall when taken from the shop by the employés to car rots however the yard was as familiar as any of the city streets  he knew exactly where each case should be unless perchance there had been some addition made to the collection since his departure from home and although it was dark proceeded without difficulty until he arrived at one corner of the yard where by pulling out an unusually large box he disclosed a narrow passage running along the side of the fence  it was not possible to walk upright through this opening owing to the lumber above but once master carrots arrived at the further end he found as snug and comfortable a dwelling as it would be reasonable for any boy in master carrotss walk of life to desire  two cases facing each other at an interval sufficiently wide for a small person to enter formed an apartment four or five feet square and although it was impossible for carrots even to stand erect he could sit or lie down in a most comfortable fashion  a small bundle of straw taken from some of the other cases made a bed for the bootblack and directly opposite this impromptu couch were carrotss household treasures  a bottle which served as a candlestick a cigarbox as pantry in case he chanced to lay in a stock of provisions a wellworn brush several empty blackingboxes and a miscellaneous collection of odds and ends were packed in one corner with the utmost neatness  illustration teenie masseys evening call at carrotss residence  on arriving at his home carrots lighted the candle in order to render the apartment more cheerful and then he sat down with his chin in his hands trying to decide how it would be possible to keep the promise made to teddy  before he had succeeded in solving the problem however a shrill whistle was heard from the alleyway and carrots muttered to himself as he crawled through the passage out from among the boxes  i wonder what teenie massey wants a feller thats got so much business on his hands as i have cant ford to waste a great deal of time with visitors  hi carrots are you there teenie asked  of course i am where do you spose a feller would be at this time of night  im comin over  well come then an dont make so much noise about it nobody knows who may be round here and master carrots retraced his steps to the packingcase dwelling     chapter v  a suggestion   it could be understood that teenie was a frequent visitor by the familiar manner in which he threaded his way amid the obstacles before reaching carrotss very retired residence  old man said teenie this is ever so much nicer a place to live in than a reglar house  yes the host replied grimly specially when the nights are cold or it rains i spose youd rather have the water comin in on you than not when youre asleep wouldnt you  well i didnt mean it jest that way teenie replied but when you get in here an have the candle lighted it allers seems mighty fine i got mother to let me come down an stay all night with you  there thats jest what i thought you was up to carrots said in rather a cross tone  why whats the matter dont you want me teenie asked in surprise  of course im glad to have you come teenie but i am busy tonight an talkin with you is bound to upset things  what are you doin  you see i took the job of gettin that feller from saranac out er the stationhouse an its goin to be a pretty hard one im fraid as things are lookin now if i can get him clear of the scrape youll see some fun one of these days cause this thing aint goin to stop here ill tell you that i only wish i knew what ought ter be done  how have you been tryin to fix it  well ive talked with some of the fellers that saw the row to get em to go down to court an tell how it happened but theyre so terribly fraid of skip they dont dare to say their souls are their own  well i do teenie replied bravely i saw the whole of the scrap cause i was there before it began  will you tell that when the chaps brought inter court tomorrow mornin  course i will if youll stand by me in case skip tries to come his funny business cause thats what he says hes goin to do to anybody who helps the feller from the country  ill stand by you teenie if thats what you want an if we do get teddy clear therell be three of us skip wont dare to tackle as big a crowd as that  no but you see the feller aint out an i cant figger how its goin to be done  well tell the judge jest what we saw  i dont blieve well get the chance they wouldnt let you go anywhere near him less you had a lawyer  weve got to fix it somehow  why not get a lawyer  now youre goin crazy teenie massey it costs as much as a dollar to get one of them fellows to go to court they come high  dont you spose you could hire one an let him take it out in trade  by jiminy i never thought of that i wonder if i couldnt  it wouldnt do any harm to try i sell papers to a man that would come an tend to the whole business i guess if youd gree to black his boots so many times a week  id gree to black him all over if hed do what i want where does he hang out  ill show you in the mornin been to supper  yes had a little spread up to delmonicos it wasnt much an charlotte roosters an sich things as that aint fillin you know  i kinder thought you might be hungry so i got mother to do up a lunch and teenie drew from his pocket a small parcel of cold roast meat adding to it from another pocket five boiled eggs  say well have a reglar layout wont we carrots said as he surveyed the food with the keenest pleasure  now i reckon you can kind er ease up on your business long enough to tend to this stuff cant you teenie answered  well i should say so youre a brick teenie an i wish youd come every night  business would have to be pretty good if i was goin to have such a spread as this right along ive been to supper so you pitch in  spose we put it away for a while it hasnt been so long since i ate that lot o quails you know and i can hold on a spell an well be hungry before were ready to go to sleep  teenie was satisfied and he reclined carelessly in one corner of the packingcase home enjoying himself to the utmost  carrots followed his example and soon the two were busily engaged discussing the probable outcome of teddys case as well as the possibility of engaging a lawyer upon the condition of his being willing to accept the fee in trade  not until a late hour was the lunch disposed of and then nestling into the straw the two were ready for slumber  owing to the peculiar location of his home and the necessity of keeping his whereabouts a profound secret carrots was obliged to arise at a very early hour in order to leave the residence before any of the clerks in the shop should arrive therefore it was that the host and his guest were on the street shortly after sunrise  of course it would have been folly to look for the attorney in his office at such an hour and the possibility of doing any business before seven or eight oclock was so slight that carrots with the recklessness of a spendthrift invited his friend to a breakfast at mose pearsons even though it involved an expenditure of fully onefifth of his entire wealth  well kind er need somethin to brace us up he said in explanation of his generous invitation  as a matter of course master massey was not proof against the kind hospitality and so he very willingly followed his friend to mr pearsons establishment which was located in the basement of a dwelling on baxter street  when the boys leisurely and with the air of capitalists sauntered out on the street once more they looked thoroughly contented with the world in general and themselves in particular  wed better get up somewhere near the lawyers office before that skip jellison comes round teenie said  carrots recognized the wisdom of this advice at once and the two keeping a sharp lookout lest master jellison should spring upon them unawares made their way to centre street where for an hour and a half they waited in the hallway of the building in which the lawyer with whom teenie was acquainted had an office  on his arrival it was evident the gentleman did not recognize them as two possible clients for he passed without even a nod to the boy who claimed to be his friend entered the office and closed the door behind him  why he doesnt even know you carrots exclaimed in a tone of reproach  oh yes he does but you see its kind er dark in here an i spose he couldnt see my face very well or he didnt notice  what are you goin to do bout it  wait till he gets settled an then well go up an call on him you do the talkin while i stand back an gree to all you say  now that they were where the scheme could be carried into execution carrots was by no means confident it would be a success and actually felt rather timid about making the attempt but urged on by teenie he finally mustered up courage to open the door of the office he stood on the threshold gazing first at the attorney and then back at his friend  well what do you want the gentleman asked looking inquiringly at the boy  this question appeared to restore to carrots a certain portion of his selfpossession and he entered the room standing in the middle of the floor as he beckoned to his friend to follow  what do you want the lawyer asked again impatiently  well you seei comewe want  out with it what did you come for  teenie nudged his friend from behind as a sign that he should speak up promptly and carrots catching his breath much as one does after a plunge in cold water began  theres a feller what walked down from saranac thats goin to be took inter the tombs court this mornin for fightin in city hall park an weve come to see how much it would cost to hire you to git him out  i might defend him but i couldnt agree to get him out that depends on the judge  well you could make the talk an i reckon when the things put up right theyll have to let him go cause he didnt do anything  illustration it was jest like this said carrots  suppose you tell me the whole story and i shall be better able to judge what they may be obliged to do  it was jest like this you see skip he come up an hit teddy in the jaw and teddy tried to hit back skip let out with a lefthander teddy warded it off then skip jumped down went the papers skip got frightened of a cop he started to run teddy after him an teddy was rested and thats all there is bout it  that may be the whole of the story but i must confess i dont understand it yet  why its plain enough you see skip he struck out an teddy warded it off  now wait a moment tell me which boy is arrested  why teddy of course you dont spose wed come here if it had been skip i wish it was hed stay there a good while for all id care  who is this teddy  hes a feller what walked down from saranac an got here yesterday mornin but jest as he was goin to sell papers up jumped skip cause he thinks he owns the whole town an lowed he was goin to clean teddy right out now i never did think skip could fight any great deal cause how was it when he was over to brooklyn an that feller tackled him  try to tell me the story as i want to hear it you say teddy was arrested  why its worsen that hes in the stationhouse  certainly if he is arrested on what charge was he taken  eh  i mean why did the officer take him  why cause the park policeman said he was fightin but he wasnt he was only beginnin he might uv licked skip too if theyd let him alone i know by the way he put up his hands  then it seems according to your story that he really was fighting  how could he when he hadnt even commenced skip hit him an knocked the papers out er his hands an then he was goin to lick skip but didnt have time  the attorney was a patient man and possibly the boys manner of telling the story amused him therefore he continued asking questions preventing any detailed account of previous quarrels which skip might have had until he was in possession of all the important facts when he asked  do you know what a lawyer usually charges for such a case as this  now youre comin right down to dots carrots said beginning to feel more at ease since the attorney treated him in such a friendly fashion you see this feller hasnt got any money an i dont claim to be a millionaire myself i know lawyers charge a good deal for doin a little o nothin but i thought if youd kind er take it out in trade we might make a bargain  what business are you in  i shine boots an if youll get this feller out er the scrape ill come in here an black your boots every mornin this year for nothin you cant make a better traden that if you should look round a good while  that is quite a contract you are proposing  i know it but you see i want ter make it an object for you to get teddy out  that can be done only in the proper manner the question is whether you have any witnesses to prove that this boy was not really fighting and that he had sufficient provocation to excuse his trying to thrash the other one  sufficient what  provocation that is whether what had been done was enough to warrant an attempt to whip this other boy for as i understand it that is really what he did try to do  why of course he had to howd you like it if a feller sneaked up an whacked you in the face when you wasnt doin anything an knocked your papers in the mud  it wouldnt be very pleasant ill admit but how can you prove that such was the case who saw the beginning of the trouble  i did an teenie an lots of other fellers but they wouldnt dare to tell it for fear skip might thump em he calls hisself a fighter  then you two are willing to run the risk and tell your story in court are you  of course we are but will you go an get him out  suppose i should take this case and spend an hour or two on it how do i know you would come here each morning to black my boots as you propose  how do you know why aint teenie here an dont he hear what i say thats enough to make a trade if youve got a witness aint it  yes i suppose it is the lawyer replied laughingly i dont see any other way for me but to take the case go to the tombs and wait there until i come  youll be sure to be on hand before they bring him down eh  i wont neglect it  with this assurance the boys left the office and once on the outside carrots said to his friend in a tone of relief  well now thats fixed an i guess we neednt bother any more bout teddys gettin out but therell be an awful row when skip hears what weve done an you an ive got to stand right longside of each other if he tries any funny business we must look out for him  this suggestion that they would stand together against teddys enemy was far from displeasing to master massey  in the seclusion of the packingcase home he could talk boldly about what skip might yet be able to do but once on the street where it was possible to meet the bully at any moment the matter assumed a different aspect and he began to realize the danger in which he had thus voluntarily placed himself  it wont do for us to hang round here cause hes likely to come any minute teenie said in a tremulous tone i think wed better go down to the tombs an then well be on hand when the lawyer wants us  this was a very good idea and carrots led the way at a rapid pace both taking heed lest they should accidentally meet skip     chapter vi  the trial   carrots and teenie succeeded in reaching the tombs without being intercepted by skip and once there they were unable to determine whether the court was in session  in the vicinity of the judges desk a number of men were standing apparently talking on different subjects and in the seats reserved for the spectators a few unfortunatelooking persons lounged  well the feller aint been brought in yet thats certain carrots said gazing around the room in a vain search for his new acquaintance  do you spose they will put handcuffs on him teenie asked in a tone of awe i reckon hed be jest about crazy if theyd send him up to the island  it would start most anybody up to take a dose like that but of course it wont happen now weve got the lawyer i tell you hell be sprised to see how weve fixed things wont he  indeed he will an skipll be hoppin mad when he knows we want ter keep pretty close together while were workin this  the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the sergeant who had been seen at the stationhouse and carrots went swiftly toward him asking as he halted in front of the officer  did you bring that feller down yet  he will come in the van with the rest of the prisoners  you wont forget that you promised to try an fix it  i said i would see that the officer wasnt hard on him i cant fix anything have you got your witnesses here  yes teenies one an im another an weve hired a reglar lawyer  you have who  a man by the name of varney  well if he is coming i reckon you will be all right unless you have a bad case and from what the roundsman told me the fighting didnt amount to much  there wasnt any of it you see skip he give teddy one in the face an then sent in a lefthander an teddy he  never mind the story i dont want to hear it for i havent the time the officer said as he started toward the judges bench  half an hour elapsed and then the boys suddenly saw their new friend within a sort of iron cage at one end of the room  there he is teenie whispered excitedly how do you spose he got in without our seein him  carrots stood erect and gazed at the prisoner a moment as if debating whether to approach him or not  teddy presented a most forlorn appearance standing aloof from the other prisoners as far as possible and clinging to the iron bars his usually clean face begrimed with dirt through which the flowing tears had plowed tiny canals until he looked not unlike a smallsized indian in warpaint  this picture of sorrow made a deep impression on carrotss tender heart and regardless of whether he might be able to regain his seat he marched toward the prisoners cage  teddy had seen him coming and stepped forward in the hope of speaking with this boy who had proved himself to be a real friend but before a single word could be uttered the officer interrupted the visitor by saying roughly  get back there  but ive got to talk with that feller  get back there do you hear what i tell you and he made a threatening gesture which was not at all terrifying to the selfpossessed carrots  ive got to talk with this feller hes a friend of mine an i aint seen him since last night hes goin to get right out too cause he didnt do anything an wouldnt have been brought here if hed had sense enough to run when they hollered cops it was jest this way skip he struck out an hit him in the face an then come in with a lefthander  carrots had been advancing while speaking and at this point the officer seized him by one shoulder spinning him around until he was heading in the direction from which he had come  if you make any attempt to speak to that boy ill put you in with him what are you doing here anyhow are you a witness  course i am what else do you spose why ive got to tell the judge all bout how this thing happened you see i was right there an when skip come in with a lefthander an teddy he warded it off  carrots did not finish the sentence for the officer gave him a push which might have thrown him headlong but for the fact that teenie chanced to be in the way and thus prevented the fall  i guess wed better get back to the settee carrots said looking at the officer an instant as if to make out whether the latter was really in earnest in this last movement  carrots was whispering to teenie his opinion of the officer in charge of the prisoners when the lawyer arrived and then for the first time did teddys friends learn that court had been in session all the while since they entered  it was a positive relief to see the attorney and lest the latter should think those who employed him had not followed the directions given carrots made his presence known by going up to the gentleman in the most confidential manner and announcing cheerfully were here  yes i see you are sit down ill call you when youre wanted  but are you sure you remember what i told you bout how it happened you dont want to forget that skip jumped in an hit teddy in the face and then come in with a left  you shall be asked to tell that story my boy presently but just now i dont care to hear it and havent the time sit down until your name is called  im afraid that lawyer dont mount to much carrots whispered to teenie as he obeyed the gentlemans command it seems like hes puttin on a good many airs an dont want ter listen to how the thing happened now i dont blieve any man can fix it with the judge less hes got the whole thing down fine  the sergeant said he was all right an he ought ter know so i reckon we can ford to wait teenie replied contentedly  it seemed to the impatient carrots as if it must have been nearly noon when he heard the clerk call the name theodore thurston and an instant later the young prisoner from saranac was conducted to the dock  almost at the same moment skip jellison accompanied by several of his most intimate friends entered the room and immediately became aware that carrots and teenie were in attendance  without hesitation and as if such scenes were perfectly familiar to him master skip approached teddys friends in an easy careless fashion as he asked  what are you two doin here  came down to see how the new feller gets along dont spose youve got any bjections have you carrots replied  i dont know whether i have or not  well after you find out jest give me the word cause were bound to dust whenever you give us the tip  it was evident to master jellison that carrots was speaking sarcastically and he took no further notice of this insolence save to say warningly  you want to mind your eye thats all the feller what tries to help that chump along is goin to get inter trouble  sames you did over to brooklyn the other day eh carrots asked coolly  wait till i catch you outside an well see if youve got anything more to say bout brooklyn and with this threat master jellison and his friends advanced to a settee nearer the judge where they seated themselves with a great show of what was probably intended to be dignity  hes come to see if were goin to tell anything bout the row teenie whispered and it could plainly be seen that master massey was very much frightened regarding the probable outcome of thus attempting to aid the stranger  at that moment carrots was startled out of his selfpossessionalthough he had come especially as a witnessby hearing his name called in a loud tone  three times the clerk shouted joseph williams and then carrots exclaimed  by jiminy he means me doesnt he  of course he does go long quick or else that fellerll be up on the island before they know youre here said teenie  it was necessary the witness should pass skip jellison on his way to the stand and in so doing he saw teddys enemy scowl and shake his fist in the most threatening manner  dont get excited carrots stopped long enough to say youre comin out of it all right even if you dont feel very good now  then he continued on until some one directed him which way to go and for the first time in his life he laid his hand on a bible and swore to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  if as is extremely probable skip had come for the purpose of hearing what was said he was disappointed as are nearly all the visitors to the tombs court where it is an impossibility for one on the spectators benches to distinguish any remark made either by the judge or the witness unless the latter chances to have a particularly clear voice  those inside the railing however could understand quite distinctly all that was said and judging from their mirth carrotss examination must have been to them an amusing one  on being asked his name the witness replied carrots and then the judge glowered down upon him until he realized that he previously answered to that of joseph williams  after having made the proper correction and before it was possible for any one to ask him a question carrots leaned toward the magistrate in a confidential and friendly manner as he began  you see judge it was jest like this skip he jumped in an hit teddy one in the face an then come back with a lefthander but teddy warded it off an then  stop the judge cried severely when i want you to tell the story i will ask for it did you see this boy fighting in the park  he wasnt fightin at all he didnt have time for the park policeman caught him you see it was jest this way skip he jumped in an smashed teddy in the face an then come with a lefthander  again was the witness interrupted and this time mr varney stepped forward to where he could say in a low tone to carrots  you must simply answer the judges questionsnot attempt to tell the story yourself  yes sir but howll he know whats what if i dont give him the whole right through carrots asked in a hoarse whisper  attend to what he says and dont try to tell anything else  what was this boy doing when the policeman arrested him the judge asked as he looked sternly at the witness  he wasnt doin nothin cause he didnt have time you see skip run as soon as he hit him an knocked his papers down an then  did the prisoner go in pursuit of the boy whom you call skip  course he did cause you see skip knocked his papers in the mud an hit him once in the face an he would have come in with a lefthander if teddy hadnt warded it off  what was the prisoner doing when this boy struck him  he was sellin a paper to a man in a horsecar you see skip he lowed that teddy couldnt run the business in new york but teddy he walked way down from saranac jest to get a livin an skip dont have any right to tell fellers whether theyre to work or not  had the prisoner said anything to this boy who struck him  no you see he didnt have time skip jumped right in an hit him once in the face an  now dont tell that story again had there been any quarrel between these two  no sir you see teddy didnt come in town till this mornin an he never knew skip from a side of soleleather  is he a friend of yours  well i spose he is carrots replied hesitatingly you see when he got into trouble somebody had to help him out an there didnt seem to be anybody willin but me he ought ter be my friend if im goin to black the lawyers boots a whole year jest to pay for this racket  if your honor will allow me i will tell the story as i have managed to extract iti use the word extract advisedlyfrom this witness and his friend the lawyer said as he advanced a few paces amid the smiles of all those near the bench  do you wish to explain about your fee the judge asked laughingly  perhaps that is hardly necessary since lawyers are seldom known to refuse anything offered in the way of payment that was the proposition made by the witness and witnessed by his friend  then the attorney related what had occurred in his office to the no slight amusement of those who could hear him and when he concluded the judge turned to carrots again looking very much more friendly than before  then you assure me on your oath that the prisoner did not fight with the other boy in city hall park  why no how could he he didnt get the chance you see skip hit him in the face an then come in with a lefthander but teddy warded it off and then skip run the policeman grabbed teddy too quick you see i reckon hed have paid skip off in great shape cause i blieve he can do it  then you admit that he would have fought if he had had the opportunity  of course he would sposin a feller smashed you in the neck an knocked your papers in the mud wouldnt you fight i guess you would  i will do the questioning and you can confine yourself to answering said the judge  thats all i was doin sir carrots replied a trifle abashed by the change which came over the judges face at his free manner of speaking  then it seemed as if the witness was entirely for gotten nobody paid the slightest attention to him until fully five minutes later when the lawyer beckoned for him to come down from the stand to where he was speaking in a low tone with teddy  you can go now the gentleman said and i shall be curious to learn how long you will keep the promise made in regard to blacking my boots  well what are you goin to do with teddy carrots asked a look of disappointment coming over his face as he fancied that the prisoner was not to be set free  he has been discharged it is all right now go out with him and be careful not to get into any more trouble on the street for it might go hard with you if either came here the second time  hes dischargeddid you say carrots repeated does that mean he can go anywhere he wants to  certainly  well youre a dandy ill live right up to the greement i made an dont you forget it carrots replied enthusiastically and then as the lawyer turned away presumably to attend to his own business the amateur good samaritan led teddy from the room closely followed by teenie who said when they were once more on the outside of the building  it wont do to loaf round here skip jellison an his gang were jest gettin up when i come out theyll be after us if we dont dust mighty lively  lets go down by the ferry where we can kind er straighten things an see what we re goin to do carrots suggested  teddy was not disposed to run from the enemy but his companions insisted it would be more than foolish to risk an encounter and he allowed himself to be led away at a rapid pace  why not go over to your house carrots teenie asked theyll never find us there  i couldnt get in without somebody seein me an i dont want to give the snap away else the whole thing will be broke up we can do all the chinnin we want ter round the ferry  seems to me i ought ter go to work i cant ford to fool so much time away now after ive been kept still so long teddy said gravely i came here countin on makin money enough every day to live on an began by losin my stock the first thing  you aint lost it yet i sold every one of your papers an have got the money in my pocket to give you  youre a mighty good feller carrots an if ever i can do anything to help you ill be glad of the chance  all i ask is that you stand longside of me when skip an his crowd come round cause ill need a friend pretty bad then  he shant touch you when im near but i dont see how its goin to be stopped if they rest fellers for fightin in the city teddy replied in a tone of perplexity and straightway the three were plunged into a maze of bewilderment that the law should interfere by arresting a fellow when he attempted to defend himself and allow the beginner of the trouble to go free  it seemed to be one of those tangles in the web woven by justice which older heads than theirs have failed to unravel     chapter vii  the warning   as a matter of course business was not to be thought of on this day and for two very good reasons  first there was every cause to believe skip jellison and his followers would do all they could to prevent the boy from saranac from engaging in any business and secondly because it seemed absolutely necessary carrots and his friends should discuss the situation  the boys were forced to earn such food as they might need or go hungry and yet skip jellison would try to prevent their doing business on the street  of course they could stand up and battle for their rights probably receiving assistance from some of those boys whom master jellison had disciplined by the same methods pursued with teddy but such a struggle would hinder their business affairs  if it became necessary to fight every time teddy sold a paper not only would the moneymaking be sadly curtailed but danger of arrest would be very great  i reckon i wouldnt get off as easy if i was hauled up before that judge agin teddy said to his companion when the two had taken leave of teenie massey and were walking in the direction of the waterfront but i dont see how im goin to get along without fightin less im willin to lie right down an let skip jellison tread on me  see here carrots said suddenly as if believing he had a thoroughly good plan in mind youve allers lived on a farm havent you  yes  well now i have an idea it would be nice to stay in the country sposin you an me go right off an get a job on some farm that would settle skip in great shape an wed have a mighty good time  it would settle skip theres no question bout that teddy replied but when it comes to havin a good time youd find youd made a big mistake ive had all the farmin i want a feller neverd get ahead in the world if he worked round for nothin but his board an clothes on a farm  you cant get even that much in the city less you have money to start a reglar stand  thats jest it thats jest what a feller wants to do he ought ter make up his mind hes goin to have a place an buy it after that he can low to have a store an get one too all he has to do is to work hard an save his money for a while  i dont know bout that carrots replied with a grave shake of his head ive tried as hard as any feller to get long but dont own moren ninety cents in the world today  well im going to try it in the city till i make up my mind it cant be done an prhaps then id be willin to go out on a farm but itll be a good while before that time comes carrots where are you goin now  down on one of these piers where we can talk without skips crowd sneakin up on us  by this time they were near fulton ferry and carrots had but little difficulty familiar as he was with the locality in finding what he sought  a pile of merchandise near the end of a pier afforded many convenient openings in which two boys could stow themselves snugly away without fear of being seen and entering one carrots proceeded to make himself comfortable by crawling to the very farthest corner and there lighting a cigarette  say youre an awful good feller carrots teddy began as if he had suddenly made a very important discovery youve taken right hold to help me jest the sames if wed allers knowed each other an done a good deal moren any chum of mine i ever had now i dont see any way to pay you back yet awhile  i dont want to be paid back carrots replied decidedly i tried to help you through this thing cause it was a shame to let skip jellison have his way as he allers counts on an what ive done isnt much  indeed it is id been on my way to jail now if you hadnt taken hold of this thing weve got to straighten matters somehow in the first place i want to give back the money you handed me when i was rested  better keep it it may be two or three days before we can do any work  but id rather start square teddy replied as he counted out the pennies which he had kept carefully apart from his own hoard and literally forced them upon his companion  well if youre goin to square up so straight ive got a little settlement to make and carrots began a problem in arithmetic using a bit of smooth board as paper and making the figures thereon with a very short fragment of a leadpencil now i sold them papers of yours and heres the money he added  but some of em was so muddy you could not have sold them teddy objected  yes i did every one you see i wiped the mud off an then folded em inside sos it wouldnt show it dont pay to let papers spoil jest cause theres a little dirt on em  but it isnt right i should take it teddy replied gravely you stopped your work yesterday and today jest to help me along an of course havent earned a cent now the best way will be to give me what i paid out for the papers an take the profit yourself cause it really blongs to you  i wont do anything of the kind carrots replied in a tone of determination it aint certain as i should have worked yesterday  course you would youd begun when i first saw you an had earned some money  well then thats jest it i got enough yesterday to keep me an by night well have some plan to get the best of skip jellison  teddy insisted that his companion should take the profits resulting from the sale of the newspapers and carrots quite as strongly refused to do anything of the kind therefore the matter necessarily remained unsettled the boy from saranac holding the money in trust as it were  have a cigarette carrots asked with the air of a man of leisure as he pulled several from his pocket  i dont want any carrots i never smoke  what  i dont smoke and whats more i aint goin to after all youve done for me it seems kind er tough that i should turn round an talk to you bout spendin money but theres one of the very reasons why you aint got a stand instead of hustlin to make a nickel you spend one buyin cigarettes or else waste a good deal of time standin on the street smokin it would make a big difference if you didnt like sich things an besides it hurts a boy to smoke em  carrots looked at teddy in surprise  he failed to understand why a fellow could not amuse himself smoking cigarettes and was thoroughly bewildered to hear an argument made as to the expense  well ill be jiggered it looks to me like as if youd come down here tryin to be awful too good i wish i had money enough to buy a glass case to put you in i reckon i could sell the lot up to the museum  thats right laugh jest as much as youve a mind to carrots you cant make me mad after all youve done but what i said is true jest the same an dont you forget it  all right carrots replied placidly i reckon it wont cost very much till thesere gone so sposin we talk bout how were going inter business skips got it in for me now an ill have to shin round as lively as you do  theres only one thing bout it we must tend to work the sames if he wasnt livin  but hell jump down on us an then well get into another fight  i spose thats so aint there some place in the town jest as good for papersellin as round the city hall  well i dont know you see ive allers worked there an am quainted with the fellers so it seems to me its bout the only spot if you should try down by south ferry or round here anywhere everybodyd do their best to drive you out sames skip did i blong up to city hall so they cant shove me away from there an the bootblacks in any place else would raise a row if i come takin trade away  it dont seem as though theyd dare to do such things said teddy thoughtfully youve as much right on one street as another  thats the way i spose it looks to a stranger but it aint so jest the same now if a new feller come where i was workin id turn in with the others to drive him off of course  then how does a new boy like me start  he has ter hustle an take it rough sames youre doin when the others find out youre bound to stick theyll let you alone  then in that case the sooner we tend to business the better if were goin to have a row lets get over with it as soon as we can  thats what i was countin on but ill tell you wed better not work today its no use to rush an by tomorrow skipll be over his mad fit a little most likely he wont do anything but hunt for us till night an in the mornin hell need money so bad hell have to go to work  teddy realized that carrotss advice must be good since he was thoroughly acquainted with the ways of the city yet at the same time he was impatient because of the enforced idleness when it seemed necessary he should be at work  then carrots proceeded to explain to his newlymade friend some of the peculiarities of his associates and gave him an insight into their manner of living  now im countin on your takin half of my house carrots said you see youve got either to go to the newsboys lodging house or else hire a room somewhere if you want ter swell an thats dreadful expensive when the weather aint too cold boys can sleep round most anywhere  how does it happen that you have a house do you live with your folks  i aint got any an never had but the place where i stop is mighty swell i can tell you though we cant go home till after dark cause i dont want the folks what hire the property to think i came for the rent  teddy was mystified by this reply but thought it advisable not to ask for particulars  i suppose you get your grub anywhere he said interrogatively  yes when ive got the money when i aint i go without seein s how neither of us has had any breakfast what do you say to huntin for a place where we can git fivecent soup  this seemed to teddy like a necessity inasmuch as he had had neither supper nor breakfast and a few moments later the boys were busily employed over two plates of soup  when the meal was ended the two whose only business on this day was to keep beyond the reach of skip jellison walked uptown that teddy might see as much of the city as possible during his enforced idleness and they did not return until a late hour  after a great many precautions and an unusual amount of scurrying to and fro carrots conducted his friend to the residence in the rear of the shop and was delighted by hearing it praised in no stinted terms  its great teddy said approvingly a feller thats got a place like this dont need to hire any rooms id rather have it than a reglar house any day  so had i the proud proprietor replied but one thing is that you cant get here in the daytime i reckon if they knew a feller was livin in these boxes theyd fire him out  then carrots brought forth such of the provisions as had been left over from the previous evenings feast and before he had finished this task a shrill whistle from the alleyway caused him to leap to his feet quickly as he exclaimed  now theres teenie massey agin i do wish hed stay away once in a while there wont be any room for three of us to sleep here an im goin to tell him so  as he ceased speaking carrots gave vent to a prolonged whistle and a few seconds later the sound as of some one climbing over the fence told that master massey was in what might be called the vestibule of carrotss residence  it was evident that teenie was not wholly at ease when he made his appearance even one who had never seen him before would have understood there was something on his mind and he greeted his friends in such a peculiar manner as to cause carrots to ask  whats the matter with you aint any of your folks dead is there  oh im all right teenie replied what made you think there was anything wrong  why you look sokind er queer  teenie was silent for a few moments as if revolving some weighty question in his mind and then with the air of one who is determined to have the worst over said  look here carrots ive allers been a friend of yours aint i even if i have stood in with skip jellison once in a while  illustration teenie brings the committees warning  course you have teenie whats troublin you  you might think i wasnt actin jest square so i wanted to have it straight  have what straight carrots asked impatiently  bout how you an i stand now you see i met skip this afternoon  didnt tell him where i lived did you carrots asked sternly  course not what do you take me for but he had a good deal to say bout you  if he dont ever hurt me any worsen he can with his tongue i reckon ill get along all right  he says hes goin to drive both of you fellers out er the city if he dont do anything else the rest of the year  then hell have a chance to get through with a good bit of loafin for were not goin to get up an dust jest to please him  but hes awful mad  that dont hurt me any he can boil over if he wants to for all i care  well now carrots he wanted me to do somethin an i couldnt get out er promisin  what was it the host asked impatiently  you wont get mad  course not less youre givin somethin away agin me  he wanted me to bring a letter down here you see he kind er thinks i know where you live an so he told me id got to take it i couldnt help myself carrots cause he hung right on an jest as likelys not hed have given me a thumpin if i hadnt done it  oh thats all right fish up your letter  teenie drew from his pocket a piece of soiled paper and gave it to carrots who with the candle in his hand opened it carefully and with an air of the utmost gravity  fortunately so far as the better understanding of this story is concerned the important document was preserved by teddy therefore we are enabled to give an exact copy of it  illustration    beware   git or dy   this is the larst   wornin   the nex time   comes   deth   the commite     chapter viii  the partners   it was fully five minutes before carrots succeeded in deciphering the letter brought by teenie and then he pretended to treat the matter as a huge joke  why skip must have spent pretty nigh the whole day gettin up that thing he said as he handed the missive to teddy i wonder what he made the moon there for  moon teenie repeated why he told me it was a skull with a dagger underneath it and with bones on the sides sames pirates have on their flags an the two coffins was for you an the other feller  who are the two duffers down there at the bottom a couple of pirates  no theyre the committee teenie explained i spose one of ems skip an the others sid  so sids taken a hand in this hes gone to drivin boys out er the town has he well sids a nice plum to do anything of the kind t isnt moren a month ago since he was gettin right down on his knees coaxin skip to let him stay to black boots it would be a mighty long while before id ask skip jellison to low me to do anything  them two are awful thick now kind er stand in pardners i reckon sid says hes goin to run fulton ferry on the brooklyn side an skips to take care of this end as soon as they drive the feller from saranac away  oh they are eh well prhaps itll be a good while before they finish up the job theyve got on hand so i guess they wont hurt theirselves workin this season what do you think about it teddy  the young gentleman from saranac made no reply but folded the paper carefully and put it in his pocket as if for future reference  whatre you goin to do bout it teenie asked so earnestly that carrots looked at him suspiciously  do bout it the latter replied why let him go ahead what else can we do ive seen a good many betterlookin pictures than he made there an if thats all he does he wont hurt anybody  but see here carrots skip says youll have to leave this town if you stand in with teddy an hes goin to make it awful hot  well i spose if he can do that he will so whats the use talkin bout it we cant help anything as i see  teenie understood that his friend was not absolutely satisfied regarding his connection with the matter and therefore refused to make any explanation as to what his future course might be this lack of confidence troubled the messenger for carrots was a particular friend of his and he did not wish anything to impair the kindly feeling existing between them  so he was glad when carrots said  i aint blamin you teenie but i can tell you one thing sure what aint known cant be told if skip jellison should low he was jest about goin to thump the life out er you if you didnt repeat everything i said why you might have to give up so i dont think its best for us to have any talk of course im sure you wont tell where im livin  i wouldnt say a word bout that carrots an you know it  i blieve you teenie i blieve you but you understand how things are workin teddy an me are in a pretty bad hole jest now an weve got to be careful if you could kind er tell us once in a while what skip was thinkin of doin it might help along but i wont ask it in case youre fraid cause i dont want ter get any other feller in a scrape  ill do all i can carrots an now i reckon id better be goin mother told me i must come home tonight  all right old man be sure when you get on the street that skip aint watchin sos to find out where youve been  he cant be round here cause i went up to supper first an walked right down from the house without seein him  then teenie took his departure and the victims of master skips wrath were left alone to discuss the situation which was certainly beginning to look serious for them  now what do you think bout it carrots asked after seeing teenie over the fence  well i dont see as its any different from what it was before we knew he was bound to drive me away an it wasnt likely hed stop after what little hes done now carrots theres jest this much about it you wouldnt be in any fuss with him if it wasnt for me an you can square things up this very minute by sayin youve shook me why not do it  cause i kind er like you teddy an then agin i wouldnt give skip the satisfaction of knowin hed made me do what he wanted  better that than have to go out of the business  i shant do anything of the kind i reckon you an i can fix things up somehow an ill tell you what id like teddy it seems as if you knew how to manage bettern i an why wouldnt it be a good idea to go inter pardnership i can earn as much money in pleasant weather blackin boots as you will by sellin papers an ill gree not to spend a cent moren you you shall take care of the cash an say what well have for grub an all that sort of thing  you want us to go inter business eh  thats jest it teddy an carrots my name dont sound very well might call it joseph but then nobodyd know who you meant  it ought ter be thurston an williams of course pardners dont use their first names  now youve struck it carrots cried in delight is it a whack  it is teddy replied gravely and thus was a very weighty matter settled a business connection formed which might possibly not receive any great amount of attention from the newspaper reporters but a solid one in the opinion of the members composing the firm  then heres the money weve got on hand and carrots emptied his pockets immediately you keep the whole an we can tell every night jest how we stand  but you mustnt put in all your money carrots you see i havent got as much an that wouldnt be fair  then teddy counted his wealth which consisted including the profits made on the newspapers of fortythree cents  thats the size of it you put in jest as much an well start fair said teddy  carrots insisted that it would be better for him to contribute the entire amount of his capital but teddy refused to listen to anything of the kind and finally the question was settled by the cashiers putting into one particular pocket which was to be reserved for the use of the firm the sum of eightysix cents  now then when are you goin to work teddy asked with a businesslike air it wont do for us to spend this money for grub cause we shall want somethin to eat tomorrow what do you say to tryin it round south ferry  if we do that skip will be sure he has driven us out i think wed better go right up to city hall an start in straight but the first thing is wherell we live  whats the matter with this place  i aint so certain but teeniell give the snap away if skip gets hold of him he can make him tell most anything  no need of movin till we find out that skip really knows where we are i aint so sure but it would be a good idea to stay right here anyhow an let him do whatever he can  but you see hed tell the folks in the store an theyd drive us out  that might be teddy replied thoughtfully but weve got plenty of time to think it over now what we want is to earn a newsstand the very first thing then well have to get a chair outside an you could tend shop while i was selling papers anywhere trade happened to be the best  wont that be fine carrots cried in a tone of enthusiasm how the fellers eyes would stick out if we were runnin a reglar shop but then he added reflectively i dont see how thats goin to be done its been a pretty tight squeeze for me to get enough to buy grub with to say nothin of swellin an if that wouldnt be swellin i dont know what to call it  tend right to your work carrots an dont spend money on cigarettes or such things as that an it wont take long to get what we need i dont reckon one of them stands costs any moren ten dollars  ten dollars carrots exclaimed why dont you buy the city hall an start in in great shape ten dollars why we couldnt earn that much in a month  well sposin we couldnt sposin it took two months wouldnt that be bettern the way youre workin now  yes i reckon it would but i dont blieve wed ever get that much together  you do as i want you to an well see whatll happen now look at it jest this way carrots if you made twentythree cents for me yesterday afternoon sellin papers sposin you put in the whole day at it couldnt you have made moren fifty cents  i could do bettern that blackin boots even when business wasnt good  well there you are if you earn fifty cents an enough to buy grub an i do the same it wouldnt take us but ten days to have the money we wanted  carrots rubbed his nose reflectively thereby adding to the smudge of blacking which now extended nearly from ear to ear and noticing it teddy asked earnestly  say why dont you wash your face  what would be the good of that  youd look more decent anyhow i blieve folksd rather buy things of a feller whos clean than of one lookin like an injun  but when a man has his boots shined he doesnt care whether my face is white or red so longs he gets a polish  you ought ter care carrots isnt there any water round here  yes theres a hydrant in the other corner of the yard  take this piece of soap an my towel an go over there try it once an see how much better youll feel  as he spoke teddy unrolled his newspaper valise took from it the articles mentioned and handed them to his friend who looked at the collection in a suspicious sort of manner as if questioning whether it would be exactly safe for him to make the experiment suggested  ill do it by jinks ill do it jest once for luck he said and five minutes later the operation had been completed  carrots with every freckle showing on his face his skin glowing from the unwonted use of soap and water and a broad streak of dirt left just in front of his ears and extending under his chin returned to the dwelling almost shamefaced  there if you feel as much better as you look you must be jest humpin yourself teddy said admiringly only you didnt wash far enough back  whats the matter now carrots asked in surprise  it seems to me as if youd shoved the dirt back instead of washin it off  well see here teddy i did this thing to please you didnt i  yes  well ive sworn off now i dont blieve in puttin on frills anyhow an all this talk bout water makin you feel good is all in your eye if weve got to earn ten dollars in ten days i reckon itll take all my time shinin stead of tryin to look so mighty fine that a mand think i wouldnt dare to pull the stopper out er a blackinbottle for fear of smuttin my fingers i spose if i lived on a farm sames you did id wash when i saw the others an then it wouldnt come so unhandy thats where i wish i was nowin the country he added as he clasped his hands around one knee and rocked himself to and fro on the impromptu bed  you wouldnt wish that very long if you had one taste of it  i aint so sure of that i tell you when a fellers got a bed to get inter an plenty of stuff to eat its a pretty soft snap id like to try it bout a month  that would be long enough teddy said and then by way of putting an end to the conversation he nestled into the straw as if to go to sleep  carrots moved about very gingerly as if his whole nature had been changed by the washing of his face  at last he blew out the candle snuffed the glowing end with his thumb and finger and followed his friends example  next morning carrots was aroused by the sun shining upon his face and after awakening his friend he explained why it was necessary for them to leave the packingcase home at such an early hour  from the companys funds was spent sufficient to buy two bowls of soup and then advised by carrots teddy agreed to remain in the vicinity of south ferry rather than to make an attempt to do business around city hall park until master jellisons anger should have had time to subside  ill see you when you come up for the afternoon papers carrots said as they parted but you can count on my hustlin the best i know how toward gettin todays share of the ten dollars  be sure you dont have any trouble with skip teddy cautioned his friend and then the two separated each intent on swelling the companys funds to the greatest possible extent before night  when noon came and it was necessary for teddy to replenish his stock he failed to find his partner around the newspaper offices  this absence of carrots did not trouble him particularly since teddy was quite confident the boy was attending to his own business and he felt positive it would not be safe for him to search very long after the missing partner lest he should encounter the enemy  therefore it was that he returned to his labors without consultation with his business associate and when it was so late that there could be no danger the occupants of the store would see him entering the dwelling in the corner of the yard he again clambered over the fence  master carrots was at home and as could be told from his face labouring under the most intense excitement  ive done it he cried to teddy before the latter had time to speak ive done it an well have to give up the pardnership business cause this is the best chance ill get  done what teddy asked in surprise  got a place to work on a farm  are you goin to leave the city teddy asked anxiously  ill have to of course if i do that you see it happened this way every feller i met this mornin told me what skip had threatened to do an i reckon he means business he says weve both got to leave this town before he goes to work agin an whats more he an sid barker wouldnt let me stay round printin house square at all i had to take a sneak or else stand the chance of gettin rested for fightin so i went down to vesey street market trade wasnt so awful good there an i was kind er loafin round when a farmer come up an says hello son dont know of any boy round here what wants to go out in the country do you well you know that struck me jest right i said of course i knew a boy an i showed him right up cause it was me an i hadnt far to go to find myself well the farmer acted as if he was tickled most to death an he said as how i was the very kind of a feller he was lookin for that hed give me a good home an make it cheerful besides id have lots of fun runnin in the fields  how much is he goin to pay you teddy asked  well you see we aint settled on that yet he thought id better come out and try it for a while sos he could tell how much i was worth an then wed talk bout wages afterward  an are you willin to go on them promises  willin why its a reglar snap id like to stay here an try to buy that stand with you but whats the use if skips goin to raise sich a row besides if weve got to sneak round all the poorest places to work we shant make enough to pay for our grub an out there ill have all i can eat  well carrots im sorry to have you go jest when weve got acquainted an it seemed as though wed get along well together but if youre set on farmin youll have to try it i reckon ill stay here an keep on workin sos when you get ready to come back therell be somethin to eat less skip jellison succeeds in doin what he counts on  i may drop round in a month or two jest to see how youre gettin along carrots replied with an air of condescension but of course im bound to stay out there a year anyhow when i start in once  when are you goin  tomorrow noon  come down to south ferry before you go an when you get back carrots i guess youll find me at the same place cause trade was pretty fair today  illustration i said i knew a boy an i showed him right up  oh youll be up round city hall by that time  itll take me longern a week to get things straightened out an you wont stay there six days less youre a different feller from what i think you are teddy replied with an air of conviction that surprised his friend     chapter ix  the prodigals return   it seemed absolutely necessary for carrots to talk at great length about the farm before he was willing to settle down to business as his partner wished and then the two made a hearty supper from a bologna sausage some buns and some seedcakes which the proprietor of the house had purchased in order to prepare a parting feast  well now lets come down to the business thats got to be settled carrots teddy said gravely as he took from his pocket a collection of coins you want back the fortythree cents you paid inter the concern an then of course what you made today all goes to yourself i dont have any interest in it  that aint the right thing to do i took in sixtyfive cents an half of it belongs to you  theres no need of dividin it cause i made fiftytwo myself so let each feller keep his profits an itll be fair now heres the rest of your money and teddy pushed toward him a small pile of nickels and pennies  i dont want to take it carrots objected mournfully when im away id rather think some of my money was here an prhaps when i come back on a vacation ill need a little then you can let me have it  teddy would have preferred to settle the business at once but carrots appeared so anxious to have a pecuniary interest in the city that he said in conclusion  well well let it go your way carrots an when you come back ill be here less somethin happens to me  then the two talked further of the farm and suddenly carrots was reminded of a very important piece of business  well ill be jiggered if i didnt forget all bout that lawyer now it wouldnt do to slip up on him would it  of course not  why couldnt you go over every mornin and fix the thing  i can carrots an i will its no moren right cause you made the debt on my account an i ought ter pay it say i dont spose youd care if i should use your box while youre gone would you ive been thinkin perhaps by carryin the outfit with me i might get a chance to black boots when business was dull  of course you can but you must keep your eye peeled pretty slick cause the fellers dont like to see a boy try to run both kinds of work an theyll be apt to make a row  ill risk that part of it now is there anything else i can do for you  no i blieve thats all of course youll keep the house nobody knows of it but teenie an prhaps he wont tell  i must take the chances of that but i reckon skip jellisons goin to make it mighty hot for me ill keep an eye out for him  by this time the boys were sleepy and until morning carrots dreamed of the ideal life which he was to lead in the country  at an early hour next day they betook themselves to the basement restaurant on baxter street where carrots who fancied he would always have plenty of money now he had been engaged as a farmer insisted on paying the entire cost of both breakfasts and then the two separated with the promise of meeting at eleven oclock at south ferry  during the forenoon teddy was not interrupted in his labors perhaps because he did not go near the city hall and business was so flourishing that he felt sorry when carrots came to say it was time they started for the market to meet the farmer  the young gentleman who was about to take up his residence in the country unslung his blackingbox from his shoulder as he said  i told that lawyer youd be there after this an he said all right i dont spose he cares so longs he gets his boots blacked who does it  ill tend to him in great shape so you neednt worry  then the two walked briskly along the waterfront until they were at the market when carrots pointed toward an old wagon drawn by two mules as he exclaimed that team blongs out to the farm where im goin i tell you ill have them mules lookin bettern they do now before next week  take care they dont kick you carrots theyre great on showin their heels teddy replied warningly  id like to see the mule that could get away with me master carrots said contemptuously and just then the farmer came out of a neighbouring shop looking around as if in search of some one or something  hes after you teddy said i reckon id better say goodby now youll find me in the packincase if you come after dark  itll be a good while before you see me carrots replied confidently as he shook his friends hand warmly and then the two parted  during the three days following carrotss departure teddy succeeded in the work beyond his most sanguine expectations  he had been careful to remain away from the places most frequented by skip jellison but was forced to change his business location several times owing to the trouble which he had with boys who as carrots had predicted were jealous because he both blacked boots and sold newspapers  still he had succeeded in saving two dollars and twentyfive cents in addition to which he had quite a store of provisions packed snugly away in a box and as he said in a tone of satisfaction on this third night after counting his funds and examining the contents of the larder had been playin in mighty big luck  during all this time he had seen nothing of teenie massey who now that carrots was away was the only boy he knew well  neither had he met any of the party whom he saw on his introduction to the city and it seemed as if they might not give him any further trouble  i reckon i can pick up what money i need to start the stand by keepin on the same way ive begun he said to himself it may be business is better round city hall but it doesnt stand to reason i could earn so very much more up there than im doin now an shiftin about so often ill have a better chance for findin out where a stand ought ter be put  it can thus be seen that master thurston was on very good terms with himself and feeling perfectly satisfied with his attempt to earn a livelihood in the metropolis as carrots had dreamed of the farm so teddy had often pictured to himself how he would live and conduct his business when once the stand was an assured fact and while in the midst of these pleasing anticipations he was startled almost frightened by a sound as of some person making his way across the litter with which the yard was strewn  his first act was to extinguish the candle lest the rays of light should betray his whereabouts for he had no doubt that the intruder was skip jellison with probably a number of followers  with such thoughts in his mind it cannot be wondered at that he was startled beyond the power of speech when he heard the familiar voice of carrots in a cautious tone  its only me dont get flustered and an instant later the wouldbe farmer was once more inside the packingcase dwelling  good gracious whered you come from teddy cried after standing like a statue for several seconds  from the farm thats where i come from carrots replied in an angry tone  got through so soon as this have you  you can jest bet your sweet life i have why i wouldnt stay out there a month if theyd give me the whole place an all the animals there was on it that man was a reglar oldoldhes an old skeesicks thats what he is  sit down sos to tell me all bout it and teddy relighted the candle in order to have a good look at the amateur farmer  carrots was disconsolate and discouraged and the dust on his boots told of a long walk over country roads  got anything to eat he asked and even his voice sounded hungry  teddy opened the cigarbox refrigerator revealing to view a plentiful supply of provisions  the newcomer did not need an invitation to begin the meal  he attacked the food as if he had had nothing to eat since leaving the city and teddy refrained from asking any questions until his hunger should be appeased  well carrots said after an enormous meal what do you think of me now  id say you was hungry an i guess that comes pretty nigh bein the truth  thats a fact an i shouldnt be lyin so very bad if i told you i hadnt had anything to eat since i left talk bout good livin in the country why a fellerd starve to death there in a week i never saw sich a place bout the time you go to sleep they call you to get up an i do blieve yesterday it wasnt moren late in the evenin when that farmer yelled for me to turn out an feed the stock feed the stock well now ill tell you whati wanted to feed myself but didnt get the chance  so you found out that livin on a farm wasnt so pleasant as you thought teddy said laughingly for he had a very good idea of what carrotss experiences might have been  its a reglar swindle an humbug thats what it is an if all farmers are like that old feller i went out with i dont see how they keep anybody with em  sposin you begin at the start an tell me all bout it  well i will and arming himself with a few slices of bologna in case his appetite should get the best of him carrots began the story that man was sweeter than pie all the time i was ridin home with him an youd thought he loved me most to death till we got to the farm then i helped unharness them plaguy old mules an one of em fetched me a kick with his heels that left a blackanblue spot on my leg biggern the whole front of the city hall i up with a club an was goin to knock the life out er him but the farmer caught me by the collar an shook me till i thought my head would fly off  he wanted to sort of introduce you to the place i spose  well i reckon he did it pretty well my heels knocked together like a pair of clappers an it seemed to me i could hear my head crack the same way a whip does when you snap it well after the old feller got through paralyzin me an i was kind er steady on my feet once more he told me to go to work an clean out the stable why teddy the job he set me at would have taken three men a month an he lowed i was to have it all done before night you see i didnt have any dinner an had heard so much bout how they lived in the country that i thought id kind er like to sample the cookin so i asked him if he didnt think it would be best to have some grub before i tackled sich a job as that i dont know what he thought bout it cause he didnt say a word jest walked right away an left me jiminy crickets how i did sweat but i thought to myself ill do my level best so hell know hes got a mighty good man an ill be blamed if when that old duffer came out he didnt act as if he thought i must have been loafin  how long did he leave you workin  from the time we got there till pretty nigh night then he said i was to go down to the pasture an bring up the cows well now im a dandy to bring up cows never saw one before i wasnt goin to let on that i didnt know the whole thing so i walked down big as life he told me where the pasture was an i cleaned her right out took every blamed thing in there an drove em up well you jest bet he was mad he wanted to know why i didnt leave the oxen behind an what i was doin with the sheep an how i ever expected to catch them two colts agin i asked him to tell me how i was goin to sort em out when they was runnin all round said i was hungry an didnt have time for sich jobs why teddy there was one of them sheep what had horns on i couldnt have got rid of it if id stayed there a month knocked me down twice before i could even get the bars fixed he acted like the goats you see up in shantytown an looked a good deal like skip jellison in the face i didnt figger on sheep bein ugly i wasnt so awful scared at first for i lowed he was playin an got up soons i could the next thing i was down agin like one of them babies at a fair what you throw balls at  it was an old ram i spose i should have thought youd looked out for him  you jest bet i did after that but i hadnt time then you see why he was all over that pasture quickern you could wink after a while i got round by the other side of the fence let down the bars an then sneaked up through the bushes till i got the whole lot of em inter line then i kept clubs flyin so they jest had to scoot an afterwardan afterward teddy what do you spose  why how do i know  illustration why he was all over that pasture quickern you could wink  that old skinflint said i hadnt any business runnin cows jest before they was milked i spose he thought i ought to stood there and let that ram have fun with me well it took him an me pretty nigh an hour to get em untangled an then he told me to drive em back to the pasture i told him id go home before id trust myself in the lane alone with that blackfaced sheep of his agin then he said i couldnt have any supper so i started down once more picked up plenty of rocks an after a while got em in then i came back to the house hungriern a bear he had the nerve after all that to tell me he was a man of his word an so long as hed promised i shouldnt have any supper hed stick to it i didnt get any either why i could have eaten a brick that night if thered been butter on it  didnt you have a thing to eat  not so much as a bite i didnt want to come back an say i got tired in lessn a day so thought id make the best of it an prhaps in the mornin things would be better  of course then you got your breakfast  oh yes then i got my breakfast want to know what i had well if mose pearson flashed up sich grub an asked me to pay five cents for it id tell him to go off somewhere an lose hisself there was three slices of some kind er bread all full of hard lumps it tasted bad when you got one of em in your mouth i thought they was plums first an took four of em you ought ter seen me when i found out my mistake then there was some fried porkan jiminy crickets wasnt it salt  was that all they had  there was a big dish of somethin i called puddin i reckon it was made of apples smashed up an i guess there was some molasses in it only i couldnt taste any i spread a little on the bread an had to eat it of course then i put some on the pork an got sick i was through breakfast an all hands went outdoors why look here teddy it wasnt daylight an id been up as much as threequarters of an hour the farmer asked me if i could feed the calf i told him if the calf didnt get any more to eat than i had since id been there i could feed him an not half try that made him kind er mad but he didnt say much an showed me how to go to work if i had to feed that calf for a week i wouldnt have moren one hand left an not the whole of that  i know what it is teddy said sympathetically well what else did you do  little of most everything till it seemed as if my legs an arms would drop off got somethin to eat at dinner though an that helped along but when i turned in last nightsay teddy i allers wanted to know what a bed was like but when you tell bout gettin comfort out er a blanket stretched over a lot of ropes why i aint in it at all when i went upstairs last night it seemed as if i was goin all to pieces an i thought of you jest as snug in here as a bug takin your comfort countin the money an i says to myself the farms no place for me if my name is carrots so ill take a sneak i got out of the window after the folks was asleep an ive walked ever since  how far was it  a man said it was sixteen miles but if it wasnt fifty my names dennis now im here an im goin to stay say aint it time to go to bed  i reckon it is for you carrots so turn in an ill keep awake a little longer see you in the mornin old man  so long carrots replied sleepily and almost before the words had been uttered his eyes were closed in slumber     chapter x  skips vengeance   it was necessary to shake the amateur farmer very rudely next morning before he could be awakened and even after he had opened his eyes teddy was obliged to repeat several times the wellknown fact that they ought to get out of the yard before the shop was opened  seems to me its taken half an hour to get you awake he said an now its time we was over the fence ive got stuff enough for breakfast in my pocket an well eat as we go  by this time carrots was fully alive to the surroundings and in a twinkling assumed his old character which he fancied had been thrown off nevermore to be resumed  as soon as they were in the street and had begun breakfast while walking toward south ferry he asked his companion regarding business during his absence and received a most satisfactory reply  ive been gettin along firstclass teddy said an weve got a good big capital to begin on  but im dead broke carrots replied mournfully i spent some of my money when i went out with the farmer an the rest of it while i was walkin in yesterday  you cant be broke so longs youve still kept your interest in the firm an that eightysix cents has grown to moren two dollars  but i dont own a share of it  course you do an we wont have any talk bout it either i lowed youd stay longern you did and so wanted you to take the whole of the cash but you wouldnt an were pardners jest the sames if youd been here all the time cause your money was in town even if you wasnt  but i didnt do any work did i  it doesnt make any more difference now than it did when i was locked up in the stationhouse i didnt work then but you made me take all the profits it seems to me it would be a good idea to buy another box and brushes ive had such luck with this an earned so much moren i did with only the papers that wed better keep the two goin  all right carrots replied enthusiastically ill get a new one an sell papers too  do you spose you can buy a box readymade  i reckon so let me have some money an ill snoop round city hall or down to fulton ferry some of the fellers will know of an outfit for sale  teddy handed him a dollar as he asked  wholl tend to the lawyer this mornin  i guess youd better cause i mightnt get my box in time an tomorrow ill start in reglar wherell i see you this noon  come down to the ferry  ill be there sure  with this promise the two parted and teddy quite as cautious regarding the possibility of meeting skip as ever went after his mornings stock of papers  half an hour later he was busily at work when teenie massey came running towards him evidently in the highest state of excitement  say carrots got home last night  well dont you spose i know it  yes an so does skip jellison  howd you hear of it  reddy saw him down on fulton street an skips just wild says hes goin to thump the head off er carrots if he shows hisself round this town today youd better come right up to city hall an see if you cant help him  help who  why carrots of course sid barker said he told one of the fellers that he was goin up there to work this forenoon an if somebody dont stop him therell be trouble  skip wont dare to do any fightin after the fuss with me  he says he will an hes goin to smash carrotss box so youd better go up  it seems as if id only make the matter worse teddy said half to himself i dont blieve carrotsll be fool enough to show his nose round where skip is an if i go therell be some kind of a row sure why cant you manage this thing teenie  what could i do  see carrots an tell him to keep away  ill try it teenie said doubtfully but i dont blieve hell listen to me you see after i carried him that letter hes got a idea im standin in with skip an i aint at all  this reminder of the warning caused teddy to think there was more in the threat of master jellisons than he had at first believed  the letter which teenie brought on the day prior to carrotss departure for the farm had for a while escaped his mind  now however it seemed evident and only reasonable that after making such a threat skip should try to carry it into effect  he was sadly at a loss to know exactly what he ought to do but urged teenie to go in search of carrots and when that young gentleman had departed at full speed he muttered to himself  its too bad to knock off now when business is so good but i spose its got to be done an yet id be in an awful scrape if i should get rested agin for more fightin  while he was thus debating in his mind the meeting which he wished to prevent was already taking place  on leaving his friend carrots had visited fulton ferry for the purpose of calling upon an old acquaintance to inquire if he knew where a secondhand box could be found for sale  it was during this interview that reddy saw him and reported the fact of his arrival to skip  failing in his purpose at this point carrots went boldly up to the city hall with never a thought in his mind of the peremptory order to leave town which he had received  one by one he greeted the acquaintances whom he met repeating the story which he had already told teddy relative to his experiences on the farm and asked concerning the welfare of those friends whom he had left behind  as a matter of course all this required considerable time and the forenoon was nearly half spent when he reached city hall park  business in the newspaper line was usually dull at this hour and he found quite a party of his brother merchants in the vicinity of the park with apparently no other idea than that of passing the time as pleasantly as possible  carrots approached as he would have done a week previous and was soon in the centre of the interested throng who were listening to his views of country life in general and his own experience in particular when a stranger approached him and whispered  did you get that box you wanted to buy  no carrots replied have you got one to sell  a feller i know of has an its a dandy  where is it  down on rose street under the bridge  ill go there in a minute and carrots turned to continue his story when the stranger whispered  youll have to come quick or hell be gone and this is the biggest trade you ever saw  it is probable carrots would not have interrupted himself in the pleasing task of describing the incidents which happened on the farm during his presence there but for the fact that he remembered what teddy had said regarding the necessity of being industrious and realizing that he had already wasted more time than his partner might approve of he hurried away with the stranger without once thinking to inquire how the latter could have learned he was in need of a bootblacks outfit  the messenger went rapidly toward the point designated and carrots followed never thinking of possible danger  on reaching rose street he saw no boy near the bridge and was about to ask his guide if the alleged owner of the box had not gone to some other portion of the city when he was suddenly seized from behind and turning his head slightly he saw skips face  so you had the nerve to come back here did you master jellison asked working himself into a passion which was not a very difficult task for him  come back here where else could i go carrots asked frightened and at the same time determined that the enemy should not see any signs of fear on his face  it doesnt make any difference to me where you ought ter gone so longs you come here now im goin to serve you jest as i threatened hold him sid while i see what hes got in his clothes  illustration carrots falls into the hands of the enemy  at this instant sid reddy and another boy came out from their hidingplaces and the transfer of the prisoner was quickly made  sid held carrots by the hands in such a manner as to prevent the slightest movement save at the expense of considerable pain and the stranger volunteered to act as sentinel during the punishment  skip understood that it was necessary for him to work very rapidly lest he should be interrupted by the guardians of the peace and no pickpocket could have been more skilful than he in searching the prisoner  here dont you take thatit aint mine carrots cried as his enemy seized the dollar which teddy had given him  then if it aint yours i reckon its mine  ill have you rested for stealin if you dont put that right back carrots threatened struggling in vain to release himself from sids detaining grasp  i reckon you wont be able to do much of anything by the time i get through with you skip replied with an exasperating chuckle this is jest about as much as i need to pay for the swell dinner we fellers want an when i see the owner ill give it back to him if i feel like it  then without further parley he began to beat the helpless boy in the most cruel manner and probably would have continued until carrots had received serious injury had it not been for a warning cry from the sentinel  master jellison was very careful of his own precious body he had no idea of allowing himself to be captured since he might be brought before the same judge to whom carrots had told the story of his attack on teddy and therefore he delayed his flight only long enough to say threateningly  now if you an that chump from saranac dont get out er this part of the city before tomorrow mornin ill fix you sos you cant even wiggle and with a blow by way of emphasis he started at full speed toward the waterfront sid reddy and the sentinel following close at his heels  poor carrots was in a sad plight his nose was bleeding his cheek cut and his head buzzing like a millwheel from the effects of the blows  he seated himself on the curbstone and was giving full sway to the grief and anger of his heart when some one touched him gently on the shoulder  looking up quickly he saw teenie massey who asked in surprise  why whats the matter did skip catch you  yes he did an he stole a dollar that belonged to teddy  the enormity of this last offense caused master massey more surprise than if he had seen his friend in a much worse bodily condition he had feared carrots might get a whipping but never believed skip would be so bold as to commit downright robbery  how did it happen he asked solicitously  carrots told his story in the fewest possible words and concluded by making the most dismal and bloodthirsty threats relative to what he would do to master jellison when the proper time should arriveall of which had but little effect on teenie  when from sheer lack of breath the victim was forced to cease speaking master massey asked in a matteroffact tone  where do you spose youll live now  where will i live why the same place i allers have of course  but you wont dare to if skips goin to cut up this way  ill have him rested for stealin an then well see how hell act i guess hell get sick of tryin to run fellers out er town  teenie made no reply to this threat because he did not believe it would be carried into effect but said in what he intended should be a soothing tone  it aint likely hell try to do anythin more today so youd better brace up an get some of the blood off of your face ive jest been down to tell teddy what i heard skip say he was goin to do an you ought ter get round to the ferry cause hell be huntin for you  im goin to see that lawyer first an find out what can be done with skip  well you want ter kind of spruce up a bit before you do that for you dont look very fine now carrots  ill jest leave the blood all over my face till the judge sees it  then youll stand a good chance of bein rested for a pirate cause you look like one and teenie understanding that it would be useless to argue further with carrots while he was in such a frame of mind believed it his duty to notify the victims partner that it was useless for him to neglect business since the mischief had already been done  leaving the disconsolate victim of skips vengeance on the curbstone master massey walked slowly toward the city hall but before he was very far from the scene of the late encounter he met teddy  a few words sufficed to acquaint the latter with all that had happened  it certainly was discouraging to say the least that master thurston should be obliged to spend so much time just at this hour when trade was most flourishing but he did not neglect what was manifestly his duty even though it cost him so much in the way of prospective profits  his first thought on approaching his partner was to attempt to soothe him but after a few moments he realized how useless such a task would be and proceeded at once to more heroic measures  now see here carrots this wont do at all it aint any good for you to try to have skip rested for takin that dollar an the lawyerll be mad jest as likely as not if you go to him bout it course its pretty hard to git sich a thumpin but its over now an weve got to figger how we can git the best of that villain ourselves  hes worsen a villainhes a heathen carrots yelled  well call it a heathen then well square up with him before were much older an thats a good deal bettern tryin to get somebody else to do it for us ill bet he has to give up that money before a week an we can ford to wait two or three days for the sake of doin the thing right  i dont see how well ever get the best of skip hes always got his gang with him  well find some way before long so youd better fix yourself up and get to work theres all the more need of hustlin now weve lost a dollar  i didnt lose it it was stole  well its gone an weve got to make it up now be a man an tonight well talk this thing over  teddy spoke so sternly that carrots was forced to obey and walking slowly and mournfully to city hall park he washed his face in the basin of the fountain drying it as well as he could with the sleeve of his coat for teddy no longer carried his newspaper valise since he had a dwellingplace in which to leave it  as a matter of course carrotss friends who chanced to be in the vicinity insisted on knowing exactly what had happened and on being informed of the outrage denounced the perpetrator of the villainy in no measured terms  hell get hisself into trouble if he keeps on this way very long one of the listeners said when the story had been told in all its details ive got tired seein him tryin to run the whole town an it strikes me there oughter be enough other fellers that feel the same way to set down on him  more than one expressed the same opinion and teddy was made happy by hearing suggestions as to what should be done to curb master jellisons ambitions but although very much advice was given no one volunteered anything in the way of assistance toward righting the wrong that had been done  vain threats and denunciations would not bring back the stolen money and to teddy this was more important than squaring himself with skip therefore after having waited for carrots to talk with his friends as long as he thought absolutely necessary he whispered  now see here old man ive got to go to work we mustnt fool any more time away lets earn what we can the rest of the day an tonight well fix up some kind of a plan  carrots would have been better pleased to remain with his friends but his partner was so peremptory that he could not refuse to go to work and half an hour later the business associates were industriously engaged either in selling papers or blacking boots according to the demands of their customers     chapter xi  a friendly argument   teddy was the first to arrive at the packingcase home on the evening of the robbery but before he had time to get supperthat is spread out in the most tempting array possible the provisions he had brought homea noise near the gate told that his partner had come  carrotss face was sadly swollen he entered the box and threw himself down wearily in one corner on the pile of straw  anything else gone wrong teddy asked in a friendly tone as he lighted another candle for the purpose of increasing the cheerfulness of the apartment by an extra illumination  anything wrong carrots repeated i should think when a feller couldnt go round bout his business without bein robbed there was a good many things out er the way  but i mean have you got inter any more trouble since then  no that was enough to last me the rest of this week i guess  now see here carrots it doesnt do any good to go fussin bout that an the sooner you brace up the better itll be for all hands skips got the money an youve got the thumpin i know but you cant change it by worryin an lookin so glum  do you count on a fellers grinnin like a cat jest cause his face is swelled as big as a squash carrots asked dolefully  no but i dont count on his thinkin bout it all the time weve got somethin else to do besides botherin with skip jellison sposin you turn to an give up everythin for the next month jest to pay him back an then do it what have you made why nothin at allyou re jest where you are today now weve got a comfortable place to live in and money enough to feed us for the next two or three days even if we dont do any business an as good a chance to earn ourselves a stand as any other fellers ever had  so you ve laid right down an are goin to let them keep that money are you  well yes jest now for theres nothin else we can do cordin to my way of thinkin weve got to keep on workin an waitin till the chance comes then well lay inter skip as hard as you like but i dont see the sense of whinin yet awhile  whats to prove he wont jump in an do the same thing over agin tomorrow  ive been thinkin most likely hed try the game an wed better stick together now heres my way in the mornin you take your box while i tend to the papers an well go right up to city hall if he comes there we mustnt fight him cause well be rested but theres nothin ll prevent our keepin him off if he tries any funny business i guess it wouldnt be a great while before some one come along as a witness on our side if he fools round two or three days tryin to drive us off hell get inter trouble an well be clear of it  the only way in which carrotss reply to this remark can be described is by saying that he snorted  it was not a groan neither was it a spoken word but rather a general snort of disdain for the plan proposed and defiance to the boy who had wronged him  teddys suggestion was so tame and so unworthy the cause that carrots began to think he had made a mistake by going into business with one who was willing to act so cowardly a part  teddy understood this quite as well as if his companion had given words to the thoughts and without losing his temper in the slightest degree he asked if you dont like that plan what do you want to do  go out an lambaste skip  all right theres nothin to hinder shall i stay here or do you want me to help  well it looks to me as if it was as much your fight as mine  very well lets go i reckon that we can find him somewhere cant we  yes hes most allers up round grand street an the bowery  well said teddy if youre bound to try an thump skip why im with you but you know as well as i do how itll turn out he counts on jest what you think of doin an is sure to have his gang with him all the time  then will you do jest as i say  right up to the dot  this satisfied carrots to such a degree that he immediately cast off the look of anger he had worn and began to appear more cheerful  carrots had so far unbent that he was willing to discuss the business of the day and on counting the profits it was found that between them they had earned eightyone cents despite the many interruptions and difficulties  according to the arrangements previously made teddy took possession of the funds wrapped the pennies and silver pieces carefully in a piece of brown paper and deposited the package in a hidingplace under one of the boxes which served them as a home  what are you doin that for carrots asked in surprise  i dont want to stand any chance of losin it  but its safer in your pocket than anywhere else  not if we meet skip in case he an his crowd get the best of us in a row theyll be sure to do what they did this afternoon an we mustnt lose all the money weve got  carrots made no reply  this preparing for a flogging was not agreeable to him and it is possible he began to think that perhaps his scheme for getting even was hardly as wise as he had supposed it  teddy deposited the cash where it would not be found until after a long and careful search and then their supper having been finished said now im ready whenever you are and he extinguished one of the candles  its no use to go up there so soon carrots replied wed better hold on till he gets his supper  teddy made no comment upon this delay of justice but began speaking of the work to be done on the following day and the probability that trouble would ensue always prefacing his remarks with the proviso  if we go out at all tomorrow  what do you keep saying that for carrots finally asked of course well go out tomorrow  ive seen the time since i struck this town that i couldnt get out when i wanted to go an prhaps we shall be in the same fix tonight but if we aint well dive inter business mighty strong  it was some time before carrots showed the slightest disposition to venture forth for the purpose of wreaking vengeance  then it could have been observed that he was not nearly so eager as when he first came home  twice he leaped to his feet as if to propose that they start and twice he sat down again  one would almost have fancied he was waiting for teddy to make the suggestion but the latter remained silent  then it seemed as if it were absolutely necessary he should do something and he said with an evident effort  now if youre ready i reckon wed better go  all right teddy replied cheerily as he led the way from the packingcases to the street  carrots followed at a leisurely pace and as the two walked toward grand street by way of the bowery one would have said it was teddy who had insisted on the expedition  the nearer they approached the place where it was supposed master jellison would be found the slower did carrots walk and finally when they were yet more than a block away he came to a standstill  what is it teddy asked knowing full well the cause of the halt  ive been thinkin prhaps it would be better if we didnt go up there tonight course hes got his crowd with him an they could get the best of us  yes an hell be in the same fix for the next week  well i spose carrots said hesitatingly we ought ter wait till he thinks we aint goin to do anything  thats jest what i proposed old man before we started out but you seemed to think it ought ter be done tonight an i was willin to give in  i guess ill let it go as you say cause it would be hard luck for both of us to get rested and sent up to the island  now that carrots had decided on delaying his vengeance he was in the utmost haste to get away from the dangerous locality for there was a chance that his enemy might appear and then perhaps instead of being revenged he would receive another thrashing  with such thoughts in his mind he walked rapidly toward his dwelling and when they were once safely inside the fence all his former goodnature appeared to have returned  he was the same carrots as before and so far as could be seen the loss of the dollar had ceased to trouble him  teddy was not willing that very much time should be spent in idle conversation he believed it necessary they should be at their work very early in the morning and curled himself on the bed of straw before the neighbouring clocks proclaimed the hour of eight  when the sun rose once more and the two merchants were preparing for business carrots no longer entertained ideas of thrashing his enemy but seemed only to fear that he might receive further injury at skips hands  so excessive was his prudence that he did not allow himself to stray more than half a dozen paces from teddys side no matter what business might demand  the morning trade opened in the most prosperous fashion and the partners had already sold eight papers and put on four shines when master jellison and his companions appeared on the scene  look out for em carrots said nervously they are going to make a fuss now sure  keep right on with your work an dont pay any tention no matter what they say teddy replied and the three boys who claimed the right to control business in that section of the city approached until they were offensively near those who had been warned to leave town  didnt you get enough yesterday to serve you out skip asked angrily of carrots  the latter made no reply  i reckon you know what i said bout your workin roun here the bully continued stepping yet closer and shaking his fist in carrotss face  at this point teddy thought best to interfere and taking the box from his companions hand he stepped between carrots and skip  now ive got somethin to say in this business he began an i want you to remember it jest as much as well remember what youve said bout our goin i came down to this town to earn a livin an to leave other folks alone sames i told you over there by the fountain yesterday you pounded carrots an stole a dollar of my money from him now do you think im such a chump as to stand that  well why dont you do somethin bout it skip asked with a sneer as he put himself in an attitude of defense  illustration teddy defends his partner  if you think im so much of a fool as to fight you an stand the chance of gettin rested while youre coward enough to run away its a mistake an the sooner you find it out the better this is what i want ter say an i mean every word of it jest as true as you touch us or interfere in any way im goin to that judge where i was taken up before an have you hauled in you know what thatll mount to an these fellers who are with you stand the chance of gettin the same as youll get the judge said that instead of fightin a boy ought to make a complaint to the police an theyd see he was taken care of now ive come to this city to stay and thats what im goin to do if we were out in the country id be glad to stand up with you an the feller that got the worst of it would have to leave but were where the policemen will rest us an i cant ford to take chances  teddy spoke in such a decided tone and appeared so determined to insist upon his rights that perhaps for the first time in his life master jellison was cowed if not absolutely frightened  he knew only too well that the statements made were correct that he would be punished severely by the law for having robbed carrots and in the bewilderment caused by the bold stand teddy had taken he retired a few paces to consult his friends  the boy from saranac had not said all he intended to and thinking it would be better to continue the conversation before the bully had time to regain his courage he continued  i dont want you to think youre goin to get off with that money even if we keep quiet now when the time comes right youll pay it back to carrots or have trouble an ill give you somewhere bout a week to make up your mind less you want ter kick up a row now youd better sneak off before that policeman comes along for ill begin my end of the business by tellin him the whole story jest as soon as he gets here  as teddy spoke he motioned involuntarily with his head in the direction of the approaching officer and turning quickly skip saw the same guardian of the peace who had taken teddy to the stationhouse  it would be awkward for him to remain if the true story were to be told and the bully concluded his wisest course was to leave that neighbourhood at once  therefore he and his friends moved hastily away until they were on the opposite side of the street where they could hide themselves behind the vehicles whenever it became necessary and at the same time see all that was going on  teddy did not intend to recede one whit from the stand he had taken  as soon as the policeman came up he told all that had occurred during the previous twentyfour hours  so that boy is going to drive you out of town eh the officer said laughingly  no he isnt goin to do anything of the kind thats what he says but ive got something to say bout it i cant thump him cause youll rest me but the chances are hell hit me whenever he can i shant stand an take it a great while an thats why i want you to know jest how im fixed  if you dont provoke a quarrel and he makes any trouble pitch in then come to me and ill see you through but your best way would be to enter a complaint against him on the charge of stealing money  thats what i wouldnt like less i had to teddy replied if hell give it back an i reckon he will before long that part of it will be all right im a stranger in the city an dont want to get inter a fuss with the fellers cause ive got to work longside of em but it stands me in hand to have somebody know exactly how things are  come to me if you get into any trouble providing you keep yourself straight the officer said in a kindly tone as he moved on and from across the street master jellison and his party noted with no slight uneasiness the apparently friendly talk between the boy from saranac and the policeman  carrots was undecided as to what might result from this bold speech of his partners  during all his experience in the city he had never known a newsboy or a bootblack to appeal to the authorities for protection and teddys method of taking care of himself rather startled him  itll make skip worsen ever im afraid he said in a low tone and teddy replied  it wont do for him to get very fresh now cause after he strikes the first blow im goin to pitch in an if there aint too many of his gang round youll see me lug him into the stationhouse i dont blieve in fightin where there are officers to rest you but i wouldnt let any fellow get the best of me if i could help it no matter who was in the way now weve fixed ourselves an the sooner skip jellison begins the better ill like it  carrots gazed with admiration upon his partner  he realized that by thus stating his case to the policeman teddy had put himself in a position where it would be safe to defend himself against any attack which might be made and this was certainly much better than carrotss plan of the previous evening which fortunately had not been carried into effect  now get to work carrots we mustnt let them fellers knock us out of business for weve got to make more than a dollar today  carrots did set to work most vigorously  his fear of skip was quieted to a certain degree and he darted here and there without reference to his partners whereabouts getting very much more trade than he would otherwise have done because of the fact that his brother bootblacks and many of their acquaintances in the newspaper line were so busily engaged discussing the plan adopted by the boy from saranac that they had no time to attend to the details of business  for at least half an hour teddy and carrots were the only boys in the immediate vicinity who attempted to do any very great amount of work and the result was that before the clock had struck ten their profits amounted to nearly as much as teddy had expected that they would earn during the entire day     chapter xii  carrotss charity   during the remainder of the day neither carrots nor teddy saw skip  it appeared very much as if master jellison had grown alarmed after seeing his intended victim conversing with the policeman  the other merchants in the newspaper and the bootblacking business neglecting everything else discussed the very remarkable state of affairs brought about by the boy from saranac until the partners had succeeded in rolling up profits that made carrotss eyes open wide with surprise  then their brother merchants began to realize that while effecting nothing so far as the controversy between skip and teddy was concerned they were losing an opportunity of earning money and so they at once resumed their labors and carrots soon was aware of a depression in his department of the bootblacking industry which caused him no slight amount of sorrow  if skip jellison had hung round here the rest of the day sos to give the other fellers more chance to talk wed have come nigh to earnin enough to pay for the stand before night he said as teddy returned from purchasing his fourth supply of papers  that shows how much a feller can lose unless he keeps his eyes open teddy replied  thats a fact said carrots it didnt seem much to loaf round a little while but it counts up when you come to look at it  you can jest bet it does an if youll keep watch of yourself for another week well be in mighty good shape to set ourselves up in business theres plenty of money to be earned round here an if a feller doesnt spend it as fast as he gets it it wont be long before hes on his feet  ever since he began to follow the occupation of a bootblack carrots had desired to own such an outfit as was in the possession of a certain italian on centre street in his eyes it was simply magnificent a chair upholstered in red velvet stood on a platform covered with sheet brass and studded plentifully with largeheaded nails of the same metal as footrests there were two deformed camels in bronzed iron each bearing on its back a piece of iron fashioned in the shape of the sole of a boot even in his wildest dreams however he had never allowed himself to believe it was possible for him to become the owner of such a gorgeous establishment for he had learned from a reliable source that the italians outfit had cost not less than twenty dollarsan amount which in carrotss eyes was so large as to be within reach of only the very wealthy  now however he began to think such a thing might be possible for he had realized what could be accomplished by industry in his minds eye he saw the firms newsstand in one corner of which could be placed a small stove during the cold weather with a space under the counter sufficiently large for the two boys to sleep in and the outside of the establishment painted a vivid green carrots was very particular as to the color he had decided as soon as the matter was broached by teddy that if they ever did succeed in buying a stand it must be painted green and this was because a friend of his in jersey city had told him in the strictest secrecy that such a color was very lucky  how industriously he labored during the remainder of the afternoon so eager was he to reach the packingcase home in order to count the money on hand that he proposed to stop work for the night an hour before the demand for bootblacks services had wholly ceased  well have to wait a while longer teddy said decidedly it wont do to knock off yet cause we ought to make enough to pay for our suppers between now an dark sposin you take some of these papers you can sell em when theres no show for shinin  carrots obeyed without a murmur for the green newsstand and the brassstudded platform and chair still remained before his eyes and not until eight oclock was it decided that they could afford to close up shop by going home  on gaining the packingcases the proceeds of the days work were thrown into one pile and then began the very pleasing occupation of counting their earnings  carrots was well aware that they had done a good business but he was really astonished on learning that the firm had earned two dollars and eleven cents or in other words a trifle more than one tenth the estimated cost of the stand  there said teddy in a tone of satisfaction that is what i call humpin ourselves it wont take a great many days like this before well be on our feet in fine shape  that is if skip dont bother us  well this time his botherin did us good cause while the other fellers were talkin bout it we were jest shovelin the money in now well put the two dollars away an use the leven cents for supper i reckon we can get enough bologna an crackers for that  aint there anything on hand  not a crumb will you go and get the supper or shall i  ill go while you put the money away and carrots was out of the dwelling like a flash but he did not return as soon as teddy expected from his hurried departure  more than once teddy went to the gate to listen for him and at last it seemed certain carrots must have met with an accident  i ought to have gone with him teddy muttered to himself cause the chances are that skip has turned up an is thumpin him  after waiting ten minutes more teddy decided that it would be necessary to go in search of his partner who might be hurt and unable to get home but just as he was about to climb the fence the sound of hurried footsteps in the alleyway told that carrots was returning  did you think i was never comin back the young gentleman asked as he arrived  well it did begin to look that way what kept you so long  wait till i get in the box an ill tell you all about it carrots replied breathlessly and when they were once more inside the improvised dwelling he began his story even before unrolling the packages he had bought  say do you know ikey cain the feller i bought that box and brushes of  no  well hes a little feller not much biggern teenie massey an i met him out here by the grocery store i tell you hes been in awful hard luck an hes all banged up  whats the matter with him some more of skip jellisons work  no it aint that but he got hurt a while ago down to pier 10 where they was unloadin bananas and he was layin for a chance to get some now theres a sore on his leg so he cant hardly walk an he hasnt been able to do any work for moren three weeks  where does he live teddy asked  he stayed at the newsboys lodgin house till his money gave out an since then hes been stoppin anywhere say teddy he aint had a thing to eat today  why didnt you give him some of that leven cents  thats what i wanted to do but i was fraid you wouldnt like it  you ought to know bettern that ive been hungry myself too many times since i left saranac not to understand how a feller feels  ill tell you what i was thinkin of but of course i dont want you to go into the plan less youre willin it struck me as how it wouldnt be any bother if ikey stayed here with us till he gets better an jest as soons hes well hell be willin to pay us back what itll cost for his grub he isnt much of an eater anyway i could put down three times more stuff than he an not half try why he thinks hes filled way up to the chin if he gets one bowl of soup said carrots scornfully  there wasnt any need of your askin me carrots if he could come here said teddy smiling this is your shanty  its as much yours as mine since we went inter partnership  it doesnt make any difference who owns it i think wed better let him in if hes a decent kind of a boy an has been havin hard luck  then spose i go after him hes down by the grocery store an when i left was lookin at a smoked herrin s if hed draw the backbone right out of it  shall i go with you teddy asked  illustration ikey before the grocers window  no i can get him up here alone if youll stand by the gate sos to catch him when i hist him over said carrots cause hes lame an cant do much shinnin himself  carrots not waiting to make further explanation ran out from the nest of boxes clambered over the fence and soon the sound of footsteps told that he was running down the alley  five minutes later an unusual noise warned teddy that the invalid was approaching and he took up his stand on the inside of the fence ready to assist  are you there teddy carrots asked in a hoarse whisper  yes let him come  ill give him a boost an you catch hold of his hands was carrotss reply  by moving one of the cases nearer the gate teddy was able to reach sufficiently high to grasp the hand of the lame boy and then by the aid of carrotss boost the new member of the family was soon inside  teddy assisted the stranger to the box which served as a home and when carrots had lighted both candles he had an opportunity to see the boy thus introduced to the household  ikey could never have been called a prepossessing lad and his recent hardships had in no wise tended to improve his appearance  a pair of large black eyes seemed even larger than nature had made them by contrast with his pallid face and the closely cropped hair which literally stood on end in every direction giving him an expression such as one fancies would be proper for some bloodthirsty revolutionist but although he looked so thoroughly ferocious ikey was by no means a dangerous character as carrots had said he was shorter than teenie massey and the pallor of his thin face was emphasized by the many streaks and spots of dirt and the illfitting ragged garments gave him the appearance of being several sizes smaller than he really was  jiminy youve got it swell here ikey said in a tone of admiration as he gazed around at the snug quarters and especially at the bottles used as candlesticks it seemed to him that if they could afford double the necessary amount of light their manner of living must certainly border on extravagance  well it is pretty fair carrots replied with the air of one who thinks it modest to belittle his own property we manage to get along here somehow an are goin to squeeze you in youre so thin ikey that a sardinebox would make a firstrate bed for you  youre awful good to help me fellers jest before carrots came along i was tryin to make out what i was goin to do said ikey  well take hold an fill yourself up with what weve got here prhaps well find some way to fix you sos you can walk bettern you do now teddy said as he unrolled the packages of provisions carrots had brought but finding there was not sufficient for three very hungry boys he excused himself long enough to purchase a few additions to the collection  his sympathies were thoroughly roused and he determined ikey should have as he afterward explained one square outandout feed if no more three smoked herring three seedcakes and a fivecent pie comprised the list of provisions teddy brought back that he was guilty of extravagance in purchasing these articles shows how deeply he felt for ikeys sufferings  this is what you call livin high carrots said as he arranged the feast in the most favorable light i reckon youll get well if you stay here very long ikey  if i dont i ought ter be choked master cain replied emphatically as he proceeded to devour one of the herring first breaking off the head and stripping with the touch of an artist each side of the fish from the backbone  theres one bad thing bout it carrots said as he suddenly thought of what might be an awkward predicament for himself you know the folks what keep the store dont have any idea im livin here cause if they did id be fired mighty quick of course you cant go round town while youve got that thing on your leg an youre bound to stay till it gets well but you see ikey it wont do to make the least little mite of a noise do you think you can manage it all day with never so much as a squeak  i reckon it wouldnt be very hard work master cain replied id be thinkin how much better this was than loafin round the streets an then i couldnt yip if i wanted to when id know i might lose the snap  and dont show your nose outside this box cause that would be jest as bad as hollerin  dont you worry bout me ill get along all right an wont make any fuss for you the invalid replied decidedly as he made a pleasing combination of the dried fish and pie by way of a finishing touch to the meal  when their guests hunger had been satisfied the hosts made arrangements for the night by giving to the crippled boy the entire pile of straw on which to lie while they slept upon the bare boards of the adjoining box  on the following morning carrots was awake unusually early for he thought of the necessity of finding something in which to bring water that ikey might be able to satisfy his thirst during the day and without arousing either of his companions he attended to this important business  after a short absence he returned with a clean tomatocan as a drinkingvessel and this he filled from the hydrant  teddy was awake when this task was finished there were provisions enough for the invalids meals and the two boys set out intending to prepare for the day by purchasing two bowls of mose pearsons slatecolored soup  you wont have anythin to do but eat ikey an theres grub enough for that carrots said as he left the dwelling take hold an enjoy yourself we shant be back till pretty nigh dark so dont worry bout us an be sure to keep your mouth shut  ill get along all right an nobody shall know im here ikey replied and an instant later the two merchants vaulted the fence     chapter xiii  a medical friend   this unexpected addition to their family had a good effect on carrots because it made him more careful of his money almost uncomfortably so teddy thought when having reached mose pearsons the junior member of the firm questioned whether it would not be better to have no breakfast in order to save time  you see now weve got ikey on hand well have to be careful of the money else we shant get that stand very soon  were bound to eat carrots if you want to be so awful careful of your money you might give up smokin cigarettes teddy replied  oh i swore off buyin any yesterday i dont smoke now less some feller gives me one of course you cant reckon id refuse it but this soup will be ten cents gone an wed be jest as hungry by noon besides weve got to buy somethin for supper cause were feedin three now you know  well get the breakfast an work enough harder to pay for it teddy replied as he led the way into the restaurant and again did carrotss new ideas of economy appear as he swallowed the soup almost at the risk of choking himself in order to save a few moments  he was the first boy on the street prepared to black boots that morning and no fellow ever worked more industriously until nearly twelve oclock when he approached his partner in a mysterious manner beckoning him to follow where they could converse without fear of being overheard  say did you know lamb was awful good for sick people carrots asked with an air of great importance  no i didnt know that who told you  when old miss carter was sick she said a little bit of lamb would do her a power of good an the boys chipped in an bought some  but itll come pretty high now carrots you see its kinder out of season  pretty high eh well what would you say if i got a bangup good mess of lamb for five cents  why id say it either wasnt lamb or else the man what sold it didnt know what he was about  well its lamb an i paid the reglar price for it teddy carrots said triumphantly as he drew from his pocket a small package wrapped in brown paper and opening it displayed to the astonished gaze of his companion two pickled lambs tongues  there what do you think of that talk bout lamb for sick folks if it does any good im goin to have ikey well as ever by tomorrow ill make him eat all this before he goes to bed you see its jest as cheap as anythin we can get he added he couldnt stuff down moren six in a day to save his life an i reckon we can spend that much  teddy was not positive whether lamb was good for the invalid neither did he think the tongue carrots had purchased would be beneficial but as the latter had said it would serve as food and certainly was not a waste of money and therefore he replied  i dont know as itll do him any good old man but itll keep him from bein hungry anyhow  are you goin down there this noon  no i wouldnt dare to in the daytime we shall have to wait till night have you seen anythin of skip  not a smitch i reckon he got scared when he saw you talkin to that policeman yesterday an i think he will give us a wide berth for a while  i dont think youre right he hasnt stopped tryin to drive us out er town jest cause i told the officer but is waitin till he can catch us where we dont know anybody keep your eye peeled for him  ill be careful enough you can be sure of that carrots replied i neverd gone to the market for this lamb if it hadnt been that a couple of fellers i know were goin down an they wouldnt let skip pitch inter me  this days business was not so large as the previous one owing to the fact that both in the bootblacking and newsselling departments of the concern there was active competition but both considered they had earned very good wages and were in the best of humor when they started home with a sufficient addition to their larder to provide a generous meal for all three  ill tell you what ive been thinkin of carrots teddy said as they walked slowly along ikey is in a pretty bad way an it seems to me we ought ter do somethin moren jest feed him up on lamb if he ever expects to get out  want to try the bread an milk  no i dont know anythin bout that business but this is what i was kind er figgerin on it costs terrible to get a doctor of course but dont you spose we might make the same trade with one that we did with the lawyer if wed gree to give him a paper an black his boots till the bill was paid i dont reckon it would take long to fix ikey in great shape  thats a good idee carrots replied enthusiastically why ill bet you could get any quantity of em at that rate say theres one up on rivington street i used to black his boots last year when i worked round that way but havent seen him since hes awful nice aint so very old either an a good many times give me something extra when i got though with my job  suppose we go there tonight  all right im with you well fill ikey up with this lamb get him to bed an then take a sneak we can be back in half an hour say how would it do to carry him along with us  i wouldnt like to do that cause you see prhaps the doctor might not be willin an wed have dragged the poor feller round for nothin besides if we should happen to meet skip while he was along it would be kind er hard lines to take care of a lame boy an fight at the same time  i never thought of that i reckon id better let you tend to things anyhow you seem to know moren i do  the invalid welcomed them very cordially as might have been expected from one who had been forced not only to remain inactive but absolutely silent during the many hours of their absence  in reply to carrotss questions he represented himself as being comparatively comfortable and stated that although the time had seemed long he was more than glad to be there rather than on the streets enduring such suffering as must necessarily be his while moving around  the first duty of the evening was to count the money and it was learned that they had earned one dollar and twentysix cents exclusive of the amount spent for food procured on their way home  that makes us pretty nigh five dollars teddy said as he placed these profits with the others if nothin happens it wont be so very long before well be in great shape for doin business  again carrots had visions of the green newsstand and brasscovered bootblacking outfit and from this reverie he was awakened when teddy prepared the evening meal by unwrapping the papers in which the food had been brought  this reminded carrots of the scheme formed for the benefit of the invalid and he handed the sheeps tongues to ikey as he said  there old man i want you to fill yourself right up on that cause miss carter said they was awful good for sick people an i low theyll straighten you out in pretty nigh lessn no time  then carrots explained what they intended to do in regard to securing a doctor and ikeys eyes glistened as he thought of getting relief from his sufferings which must have been great judging from the expression he constantly wore  im fraid you cant do much he said with a sigh  it wont do any harm to try carrots replied as he began to satisfy his own hunger and when the meal was brought to a close owing to the fact that neither of the partners could eat any more teddy led the way to the street again the invalid expressing his earnest hope that the doctor might accede to their wishes  fortunately for their purpose upon arriving at the doctors office they found him at home and not busy  singular as it may seem he did not recognize carrots until he had been told of the previous business connection and even then appeared almost indifferent in regard to seeing his friend again  teddy had supposed master carrots was to attend to this portion of the task owing to his acquaintance with the physician but instead of doing so his young partner after entering the office stood first on one foot and then on the other staring at the medical gentleman in a manner well calculated to make a nervous person uncomfortable  well what can i do for you the doctor asked  carrots looked around at teddy as he said in a hoarse whisper  you tell him old man you can fix things up bettern i can  master thurston opened negotiations by proceeding at once to the heart of the matter  we want ter hire a doctor he said you see ikey cains got a lame leg an we havent done anything for it yet except to give him some lamb which i dont low is goin to make him better very soon now what we thought bout doin was to get you to look out for him an let us pay in trade i sell papers an carrots blacks boots if youll gree to fix ikey up as he ought ter be well come here every mornin till the bills paid  where is the boy the doctor asked looking amused rather than grave  down where we live  give me the address and i will call there tomorrow morning  oh you mustnt do that carrots cried in alarm if you should go there in broad daylight and shin over that fence the folks in the shop would know jest where we live  the doctor was at a loss to understand the meaning of this remark and teddy explained by saying  you see weve got a couple of boxes down here back of a store an the folks who own em dont know anything bout our livin there we cant go in till after dark when the shops shut up an have to come out in the mornin before its open  i understand the gentleman replied with a smile then it will be necessary to bring the boy here  couldnt you fix him tonight carrots asked  i fancy so unless there should be a call from some patient  i spose we can get him over the fence but itll hurt him a good bit teddy said musingly  we can rig that all right carrots replied carelessly if hes goin to have his leg done up hes got to come out an we cant help it if it does hurt him and then turning to the doctor he asked eagerly say how much you goin to charge for doin that  what should you think it would be worth or in other words how many shines would you give me we wont say anything about the newspapers because i already have a young man who serves me with them  well try to come to your terms if we can carrots replied an youre the one that ought ter set the figger  what should you think would be a good price if you were going to pay money  carrots hesitated looked around at teddy then again at the doctor and finally said  i reckon id be willin to go as high as twentyfive cents if he was fixed up in good shape cause i know hell pay it back jest as soon as he gets to work course he cant do anything now  very well bring your friend here whenever you please and when i chance to be where you are working i will call on you for one of the shines  then the gentleman took up the book he had been reading as a sign that there was no need to prolong the interview and the boys went at full speed after the invalid  on being told that he would receive attention from a regular doctor ikey announced his willingness to climb over the fence a dozen times if it should be necessary and without delay the journey was begun  fortunately the physician was still at home when they returned he examined the injured member took something from his pocket which the others could not see at first and before the invalid was aware of his purpose had passed the keen blade of the lancet through the swelling  ikey felt faint with pain for an instant and then looked wonderfully relieved as the doctor said soothingly  there my boy you will be all right in a few days i will bandage it and you must be careful not to catch cold  carrots watched the operation intently and when the physician intimated that his services were at an end he drew a long breath of relief as he said  illustration the boys at the doctors door  by jiminy if i could earn twentyfive cents as quick as that it wouldnt take teddy an me long to buy that stand  you see my boy that medical men have to charge a very large amount of money for their services because it takes them so long to learn the business of course you would think i should get rich very rapidly if i had many such customers at twentyfive cents but you can see that they are scarce tonight  thats a fact carrots replied thoughtfully as if this phase of the case was something which he had not previously understood and after gravely assuring the gentleman that his face was good for a shine any time master williams led the way out of the house  how do you feel old man teddy asked when they were on the sidewalk  he hurt me a good bit with his knife but jest as soons that was over it seemed like as if the pain had all gone i reckon ill get well now eh  if you dont there wont be any sense in puttin out twentyfive cents agin on you carrots said as if he should consider a continuation of ikeys illness as a personal affront  the three arrived at home without having seen anything of their enemies and in a short time were busily engaged discussing their future  ill tell you what it is teddy ikeyll make an awful good clerk for us when we buy our stand an after we get him mended he can sell papers or shine boots with the best of em for ive seen him work  teddy suggested that they might not have a sufficient amount of business to warrant their hiring a clerk but carrots had his own ideas on the subject and could not easily be persuaded that an assistant would not be an absolute necessity when the greenpainted establishment with its bootblacking outfit was opened  the idea that he was to have an opportunity for working without being forced to run around the streets pleased master cain wonderfully and this in addition to the relief from pain served to put him in the best possible humor  he promised to repay the boys not only the twentyfive cents which was to be given the doctor in the form of bootpolishing but also for such provisions as he might eat while one of their household and agreed in case teddy finally concluded it would be desirable to hire him as a clerk to do his work faithfully and honestly  well have the stand before two weeks go by an i reckon youll be right there helpin us with it carrots said enthusiastically as he once more prepared the bed for the invalid and saw to it that there was food enough on hand to satisfy his wants during the coming day  it was later than their usual time for retiring when the boys finally lay down to sleep but despite this fact they were awake next morning as early as on any previous occasion and before leaving carrots again cautioned ikey against allowing his presence in the box to be known  you neednt be worried the invalid replied now my leg doesnt ache so bad i can keep mighty still no matter what happens yesterday i had to turn over pretty often to rest it an was fraid sometimes the folks would hear me  then the boys clambered over the fence once more and another days work was begun     chapter xiv  the plot   shortly after the boys arrived at city hall park and before the business of the day had fairly begun teenie massey approached to inquire if they had lately heard anything regarding skip  havent seen nor heard of him carrots replied what makes you ask  nothin only i heard he was tearin round dreadful yesterday tellin what he was goin to do to you fellers  i guess hell keep under cover for a while carrots replied confidently and teenie said as he shook his head warningly  now dont be too sure of that old man i guess you want to keep your eyes open all the time an if you get to thinkin he cant do any harm youll find him jumpin right down on you some day  ill risk all the harm he can do carrots replied with a laugh hes too much fraid the police will rest him for stealin to come round where we are  well i happen to know from what reddy jackson said that he hasnt given up hopes of drivin you off yet  carrots did not think this warning worthy his attention but yet he repeated the same to teddy when he found an opportunity  i reckon teenies not far wrong master thurston said greatly to the surprise of his partner it didnt stand to reason that we was goin to scare skip so quick an i think hell make one more try to git rid of us  i dont see what he can do carrots said musingly and teddy chimed in  neither do i an thats just why were bound to be pretty careful you see if we could know what he was up to it would be different  there was no further opportunity to discuss the matter owing to the sudden demand for the bootblacks services and by noon both the partners had almost forgotten the warning given by teenie  this days business brought them more money than the previous one but not so much as on the occasion when skip last made his threats  on counting up the cash immediately after their return home it showed an addition of a dollar and seventyone cents to the fund and when this had been ascertained carrots found time to inquire as to the condition of their invalid friend  im feelin firstclass ikey said an reckon my legll be all right tomorrow say who do you spose has been sneakin round here today  it cant be skip jellison carrots replied quickly  thats jest who it was an reddy jackson come with him course they didnt know i was in here an i lay low and i heard every word they said  what did they talk bout  you see i was thinkin how nice it felt to be out er pain when there was a rattlin among the boxes as if somebody was awalkin on em first i thought one of the men from the store had come out an i kept mighty quiet then two fellers began to talk an i knew who it was the minute they spoke so i listened reddy he said to skip heres where them fellers live skip he lowed he couldnt see any place an reddy said he knowed it was cause he followed you home last night then he figured out that you slept in one of the boxes an that satisfied skip  did they hunt to see if they could find where we stopped  no i reckon they didnt dare for fear somebodyd catch em they was settin up there on the fence an if one of the clerks had showed his nose they could have jumped over on the other side mighty quick i tell you them fellers are up to some mischief  what do you mean teddy asked quickly  i heard skip say he was goin to burn you out an reddy asked if he counted on doin it tonight he lowed he wouldnt cause hed got to go over to jersey city but hes bound to the very first evenin he can get away without anybodys knowin what hes up to he says he could put a lot of papers an shavins in these boxes an youd be scorched some before you got out  carrots was on the point of laughing at this revelation of skips plot much as if he questioned the latters courage to do such a thing when he observed teddy who was silent and looking very grave  why you dont blieve theyd dare to burn us out he asked in surprise  i aint so sure bout that skip jellisons a feller that dares to do most anything if he thinks he can get through with it an not be caught it would be a mighty serious scrape for us if the boxes should get on fire while we were here if any one saw us comin out theyd say sure we did it you might talk till you were blue in the face if they knew that we had had candles here an not make em think we didnt do the mischief  by jiminy youre right carrots exclaimed as he began to realize what their position would be under such circumstances dont you think wed better tell the folks in the store what skips countin on doin  that wouldnt do any good hed swear it wasnt so an all wed make out of it would be our havin to leave  it seems as if that was what wed got to do anyhow if hes goin to set this place on fire  of course  carrots was surprised that his partner should agree with him so readily and asked  do you really think we ought ter go away from here  thats jest the size of it cordin to my way of figurin were apt to get ourselves into a fuss by stayin an although itll be hard work to find as snug a place i reckon its safer to go  carrots was instantly plunged into the lowest depths of sorrow  never before had the packingcase home seemed so beautiful as now when it appeared necessary to leave it  id like to see somebody thrash that skip hes hardly fit to live  the best ways to let him alone hell bring himself up with a short turn before long teddy replied confidently and then relapsed into thoughtful silence  well when are we goin to move carrots asked after a pause during which he gazed intently at the flame of the candle trying very hard to see there the picture of the establishment which he fondly hoped would soon belong to the thriving young firm of thurston and williams  wed better look round the first thing tomorrow i began to think skip was up to somethin cause we didnt see him if he hadnt had an idea in his head bout how to serve us out hed been up round city hall today  then it was carrotss turn to remain silent and not a word was spoken until ikey timidly ventured to ask if they had decided not to eat supper on this night  this caused them to remember that they were hungry but neither felt disposed to linger long over the meal and at an unusually early hour the candle was put out as the inmates of the box laid themselves down to rest for what all three believed would be the last time in that locality  it was teddy who awakened the others next morning and as carrots opened his eyes he exclaimed petulantly  whats the use of turnin a feller out now the sun aint up yet  but it will be pretty soon an weve got a good deal on hand today teddy replied ikey must go with us for he mightnt get a chance to get away in the daytime an it wont do to stay here another night  it was a sadvisaged party that filed out of the narrow passage leading to the street in the growing light of the early dawn and made its way without special aim or purpose toward the customary place of business  it was decided ikey should be left upon one of the settees in the park while the others went on a tour of investigation for the purpose of finding new lodgings and then the party separated with the understanding that they would meet an hour later to partake of breakfast  carrots was the first to keep this appointment and he looked exceedingly lowspirited when he seated himself by the side of the invalid who had not yet sufficiently recovered to be able to take very much exercise in the way of walking  find anything ikey asked  not a thing i reckon itll be many a long day before well get another place sich as we had down there and then master carrots indulged once more in harsh words against his enemies  his tirade was interrupted by the arrival of teddy who looked as joyous as his partner looked despondent causing the latter to say in a querulous tone  it doesnt seem as if you cared very much bout what them fellers are makin us do  well i reckon youre right carrots prhaps its the best thing ever happened that we had to clear out this mornin  what do you mean  what do you spose ive found  do you mean a place to sleep  yes  aint been buyin the astor house or anything like that  comes pretty nigh it carrots ive found a stand  i can find dozens of em but thats all the good itll do  but i mean one we can buy  yes when weve got the money carrots replied impatiently where we goin to stay till we earn as much as well need  i can make a trade for this one with what weve got by greein to come up with fifty cents every day  what and carrots sprang to his feet his face expressive of mingled joy and astonishment do you mean to say you know of a feller thatll trust us for the money  thats jest it  lets get right to him before he has time to back out a feller what can make sich a chump of hisself as that might get sneaked off to the sylum before wed have time to finish up the trade  theres no need of hurryin so awful fast cause this bargainll wait for us an hour anyhow in the first place old man prhaps it aint what youre countin on its a good stand enough an seems to me is in a pretty fair neighbourhood but the feller what it blongs to couldnt make a go out er it so had to give it up to the man who owns the buildin  where is it  on mulberry street jest off er grand you see some feller built it against the corner store an greed to pay a dollar a week for the trouble of havin it there he couldnt raise the rent an after hed stayed three months the shopkeeper took it now i happened to see the place an went in an talked with the man he said it cost twenty dollars an hed sell it for ten if wed gree to pay a dollar every week for rent an fifty cents a day on what we owe him  how much you got to put down cash carrots asked his face clouded somewhat as he learned that the establishment was not as desirable as he had hoped their future place of residence would be  all we can raise  whatll that mount to  pretty nigh five dollars but one of those dollars goes for rent you know  is it big enough to sleep in  yes we three could get under the counter without much trouble an theres a stove blongs to it that goes in with the trade  but if we open up there wont be anything to sell  ive lowed that well keep back bout a dollar to buy papers with an then if both of us work mighty hard it wont be moren three or four days before we can have a pretty good lot of stuff youll keep right on shinin an ill do my level best with papers while ikey tends to the stand till he gets well cordin to my way of thinkin we can build up a good trade there if we hustle an thats what weve got to do wherever we go now what do you say to it  lets go an see the place carrots said after a moments pause and ikey slid down from the settee as if to intimate that he intended to accompany the party  teddy started off at once for it was his belief there should be no time lost in case they concluded to make the trade because of the fact that the hour for regular business was close at hand  on arriving at the stand carrotss first impression was very favourable toward the purchase  it was painted green not as bright as if the colour had just been laid on but sufficiently so to satisfy him regarding the supposed luck and quite as roomy inside as teddy had stated  the only apparent drawback was regarding the business location for it was a short distance off the regular line of travel and this fact master carrots noted at once  thats so teddy replied when the objections were stated and i thought about all that while i was comin down to tell you it seems to me as if we might get up a good trade round among these stores by greein to bring the papers just as soon as they was out an with three of us to pitch in we could live right up to all our promises as i said before weve got to work a good deal harder than weve been doin  it doesnt seem to me as if we could do that ive been humpin myself the best i knew how the last two days  thats so carrots but you could run round a little more i reckon if by doin it we was to own a stand right away  oh im willin to go in an you shall be the boss  then well buy it teddy said decidedly ive got to rush down after the money  did you leave it under the boxes  yes i didnt want to lug it round all day  but i thought wed greed not to go back  i lowed to go down the first thing after we knocked off its all safe enough anyhow you stay here till i get back  teddy was off like a flash and impatient though carrots was to have the business arrangements completed his partner returned before he thought there had been sufficient time for teddy to make the journey  the preliminaries were quickly arranged once they were ready to pay over the money and leaving ikey in charge of the empty stand the proud proprietors went hurriedly downtown teddy saying as he parted with the clerk ill come back soons i can with the mornin papers and well open right up  ill get things fixed before then if i can borrow a broom cause the inside of the place must be cleaned up the new clerk replied thus showing that he was attentive to the interests of his employers  if carrots had done as he wished every newsboy and bootblack in the lower portion of the city would have known that he and teddy had gone regularly into business but the latter was adverse to proclaiming the news so soon  better hold on a day or two an see how it pans out the cautious merchant advised you see if it should bust up the first thing the fellers would laugh at us were bound to stay a week now the moneys paid but how long a time is that to brag bout i want ter know if were goin to stick before i say anything  when will you gree to tell the fellers  if we can pay our bills an have enough left to keep the stock up by a week from today you shall go round to spread the news an i wont open my mouth till youve seen every feller you know  this was satisfactory to the junior partner and he promised to attend to his work in the lower portion of the city as if nothing out of the usual course of events had happened even though the firm of thurston and williams had actually sprung into existence in a proper and a businesslike manner     chapter xv  the conflagration   it is doubtful if carrots often had a harder task than that of remaining silent on the subject of the newsstand when he went downtown to work immediately after it had been purchased  he had allowed himself to dwell upon the possibility of owning an interest in a stand with a magnificent chair attached for the benefit of customers to the bootblacking portion of the establishment from the moment teddy first spoke of the scheme and now that it was really a fact with the exception of the chair it seemed particularly hard that he must keep the startling and pleasing information a profound secret  prhaps its jest as well not to flash it up on the boys till after we get the whole thing in stylebootblacks quarters an all he said to himself in the hope of cheering his mind when shes in shape i reckon some of the fellers in this town will find out that i can do a thing or two even if my hair is red  the fact that he was soon to become famous in the eyes of his friends if not of the entire world did not prevent carrots from plunging into the vortex of business with his whole heart for he understood how necessary it was to earn the extra money which would be needed until the business establishment was in a proper financial condition and he worked most industriously  it was hard to keep his thoughts upon the cleaning of muddy boots when he knew that at that moment ikey was presiding over the stand with a whole dollars worth of stock in front of him and more than once was he tempted to leave his business sufficiently long to take just one peep at the place  i could sneak up there an look round the corner without anybodys seein me he said to himself once when trade was dull but remembering what teddy had told him regarding the necessity of hustling he put the temptation far from his mind  he did however so far give an inkling of the change in his business prospects as to say when teenie massey spoke about the difficulty of finding customers  prhaps theres some in this town what wont have to run round after trade very long but can sit down an wait for boots to come to them  what do you mean teenie asked excitedly  nothin much but youll see somethin to stonish you before many years  i reckon i will teenie replied with a sigh as he thought how the time might drag if he should be forced to wait so long before seeing anything astonishing heard from skip this mornin  no an im takin mighty good care to keep out of his way when the three of us aint together i wonder if hell have the nerve to set them boxes afire  i shouldnt wonder where are you goin to sleep tonight  well you see its hard to say cause all the swell places might be full when we get through business i didnt know but id telephone up to the hoffman for quarters yet theres a good deal of trouble in doin sich a thing  yes teenie replied sarcastically an it might be quite a bother to pay the bill for the message  id be willin to hang it up if i was countin on doin anything of that kind  yes but the other folks might have somethin to say bout it itll be cheaper to hunt for a cart somewhere or go down to the lodgin house  if teenie had questioned him more closely carrots might have been tempted to tell his friend some ridiculous yarn rather than reveal the secret of the stand but fortunately there was no necessity of his doing anything of the kind for just at that moment the bootblacking industry received a decided impetus by the arrival of three gentlemen from the country who required the services of carrots and his friend  not until nearly noon did master williams see his partner and then he met him by chance on the way to the newspaper offices for a fresh stock  hows trade teddy asked  firstclass ive taken in eighty cents since i began but its slackenin off a little now howre you gettin along  great it seems as if it wasnt any trouble to sell papers today say at this rate we can get in a bigger stock by night  thats what we want carrots replied gravely looking as serious as if he had just been called upon to decide a very important question relative to some business policy we ought ter make as big a show as we can cause folks will see the stand has been opened agin an theyll look round the first thing to find out if weve got much of a stock of course were goin to keep all the weekly papers aint we  i dont know if we ought ter put out so much money yet a while  course we ought pitch in an have things fine we can ford to invest whats been made today and youd better buy the stuff right away carrots said as he handed teddy the money he had earned ill get more between now an night to buy the supper with so you dont want ter tend to anything like that  teddy was undecided as to whether this would be a wise move so soon after taking upon themselves the expense of paying rent but his partner was so eager it should be done that he finally consented and hurried away to buy the additional stock while carrots searched for customers  it seemed strange to both the merchants that skip jellison made no effort to annoy them on this day and they could account for it only on the supposition that he did really intend to carry out his plan of destroying the packingcase home by fire  no one should censure carrots for ceasing his labors at an unusually early hour because of the fact that he was exceedingly anxious to see his place of business in full operation with a clerk behind the counter  in addition to this desire he had promised himself that if trade should be brisk he would purchase a regular feast as a sort of housewarming a task which would require no slight amount of time  and business had been sufficiently good to warrant his indulging in his treat  he did not remember ever having made so much money in the same length of time as on this day the stand was opened  he had given to teddy his entire receipts of the forenoon and yet an hour before sunset he had taken in sixty cents more which was at least twice as much as he thought would be necessary for his purpose  so determined was he that the feast should be a perfect success that fully an hour was spent in selecting the different articles and then he walked swiftly toward their new establishment  it did not suit carrotss purpose to go directly to the stand  he wished to view it first at a distance and from the most favorable point therefore he came up grand street and stood on the opposite corner fully ten minutes enjoying the scene before making known his presence to the clerk  well he said to himself in a tone of satisfaction as he surveyed the stand critically if theres a betterlookin place in this city id like to see it thats all why it seems to be chuck full of papers an dont the pictures show up great well i should say they did i wish it was a little greener but if business gits good we can give it a new coat of paint some night an i own half of all that im comin it mighty strong cordin to my way ofjiminyikeys sellin somethin now  carrots could not remain concealed  money was actually being paid into his establishment by a customer who had come there of his own free will and the junior partner of the firm of thurston and williams felt it impossible to stay away from the enchanting place any longer  running swiftly across the street he threw his many packages on the counter with the air of a proprietor just in time to see ikey pass the gentleman ten cents in change  what did he give you carrots asked excitedly  a quarter  whata quarter the young merchant exclaimed in surprise do you mean to tell me he bought fifteen cents worth all at one time  course i do ikey replied as if he was accustomed to making such large sales why i had one man who got twenty cents worth an he asked me if the stand was goin to be kept open right along now  did you tell him who owned it  of course an he said hed buy his papers here all the time  well im a dutchman if i thought business was so big with a stand i cant see what made the other feller give it up how much money did you take in altogether  lets see and ikey knit his brow as he called upon his memory to aid him in the account there was two dollars n fortytwo cents an now ive got fifteen more that makesfortytwo an ten is fiftytwo an five is fiftyseventwo dollars n fiftyseven cents  well ill be jiggered and carrots found it necessary to enter the stand for the purpose of seeing and handling the money before he could be convinced his clerk had told him no more than the truth  well cordin to the looks of things weve struck a reglar gold mine here an it wont be very long before i can git a chair thatll knock theitalians all out er sight  if my leg wasnt so lame i could make a good deal more but you see i dont dare to jump on an off the cars  put those things under the counter an give me a pile of papers carrots cried well soon know what this kind of trade is worth  when teddy returned from downtown believing business to be finished for the day carrots was still actively engaged and not until nearly eight oclock did either of the partners think it prudent to cease work  thats what i call makin things hum carrots said as the two entered the stand after shutting up shop by raising the shutter which served as a counter during the day ive sold sixteen papers since i come up tonight an might a done a good deal more if the stock hadnt run out how much do you spose weve made  well soon know after i go for a candle teddy replied  i bought three sos we could have a reglar blowout for the first night carrots said as he produced the articles in question you figure up an ill get the grub together  it was necessary teddy should take an account of the stock on hand before the profits could be ascertained and then to the surprise of his partner and clerk he announced that the amount which had been made in both branches of the business was three dollars and sixtyone cents  now if that aint getting rich fast id like to know what youd call it carrots exclaimed as he ceased his labor of slicing a bologna sausage to verify his partners figures if things keep on at this rate it wont be sich a dreadful while before well have to rent a reglar store  its a good deal biggern i expected teddy admitted an we mustnt count on doin the same every day half as well will satisfy me  but we shall make twice as much if the hosscars an stores are worked jest wait till i get a chair here sos i can keep the trade hummin when there isnt any shinin to be done an youll see how the moneys bound to come tumblin in the feller what gave up this stand must a been a chump  i dont spose he tended to business teddy said solemnly as he placed the stock on a shelf and prepared to join in the feast this place is goin to be mighty snug to live in but it isnt so handy as the yard cause a fellers got to hunt round for water when he wants to wash his face  if trade keeps on like this ill gree not to let a drop of water come near me for a year carrots exclaimed  an the customers would keep away too i reckon but say carrots isnt this goin it rather strong for supper teddy asked almost sternly as he gazed at the newspaper spread on the floor of the stand and heaped high with such delicacies as bolivars bolognas and pickled sheeps tongues  i reckon it is but you see its the first night an i counted on spreadin myself some theres three of us you know so it takes a lot of grub to go round  it wont do to keep this thing up teddy said as he shook his head gravely  course not but tonight doesnt count now pitch right in both of you an lets have a high old time  ikey had already begun to do his share and as the others joined him the silence within the stand was broken only by carrotss gasps for he ate so eagerly that he hardly gave himself time to breathe properly  the candle was standing in one corner in a bottle while under the counter was a pile of straw which ikey had gathered to serve as beds and these gave the place such an air of home as according to carrotss ideas it would be hard to find elsewhere  i shant go to the hoffman house agin he said in a tone of content as he gazed around complacently after it was absolutely impossible to eat any more this is about the swellest place in this city an the fellersd be wild if they could see us mighty lucky for you ikey that we got this stand jest as we did for now you wont have to lay low while your legs gettin well  its a dandy ikey replied enthusiastically an i wouldnt ask anythin bettern to stay here all the time  if trade keeps on as its begun i reckon we can ford to hire you right along eh teddy  before master thurston could reply the clang and rattle of a fireengine broke upon the stillness and all three rushed out of the stand in the shortest possible time  its down near where i used to live carrots cried as he saw the engine turning the corner do you spose skip has really dared to do what he threatened  ikey youll have to stay here cause you cant run teddy said hurriedly keep the door locked an carrots and ill come right back  then the partners started at full speed and although they had been warned that such might be the case both were astonished almost beyond the power of speech at finding that the blaze actually proceeded from the backyard where carrots had spent so many nights  illustration how did you know carrots lived here teddy asked sternly  hes really gone an done it master williams exclaimed in a tone of awe and just at that moment reddy jackson stepped from among the network of hose whence he had evidently been trying to peer into the yard  why how did you come here he cried in astonishment i thought there wasnt any other way but this to get out from where you sleep  how did you know carrots lived here teddy asked sternly  why some of the fellers told me of course master jackson replied hesitatingly  they didnt cause nobody knew except teenie massey an im sure he hasnt said anything carrots cried ive heard bout skips threatenin to burn this place an it was skip that started the fire  whatre you yellin so for reddy cried nervously do you want everybody to hear  i dont care if they do said carrots sturdily  skipll be after you if he knows youre sayin sich things he aint through with you an this country jay yet  no nor he wont be till he gives up that dollar he stole teddy said sternly if he isnt rested for settin this place on fire you tell him ill be down front of city hall by seven oclock tomorrow mornin sos he can begin the drivin let him git all his friends there an show em the fun  oh yes youll be there o course reddy replied with a sneer  dont make any mistake bout it im comin down to give him his chance  want ter git inter the stationhouse agin eh they must a treated you mighty fine  dont you worry about my bein rested an if skip jellison cares to see me after what hes done tonight let him be there teddy said in a dignified tone as he motioned for carrots to follow him to the opposite side of the street where they could be nearly alone  what kind of a row are you goin to git inter now carrots asked his voice literally trembling with fear of course skipll be in front of city hall cause theres where he always hangs out you must keep clear of that place  i want him to see me when theres a big crowd round an im goin to get some of that money he stole between now an tomorrow night teddy said in such a positive tone that carrots was plunged into bewilderment     chapter xvi  the challenge   the fireman were able to put out the fire before it had done serious damage save to the packingcases and teddy had hardly sent the challenge to skip jellison before one by one the engines were hauled away  reddy did not follow when they crossed to the other side of the street he was probably afraid he might be charged with having taken some part in starting the blaze and did not care to remain near those who had no hesitation about saying what they thought  we might as well go back teddy said several moments after the firemen began to disperse well go round by broadway for fear some of the fellers will find out where were livin now  then for the first time since receiving teddys promise that skip should be forced to return the money he had stolen was it possible for carrots to speak freely  if you havent got yourself in a fine mess then i dont know he exclaimed jest as likely as not thisll break up the stand  dont you worry bout that carrots i shall come out all right its got to be fixed right away else theres no knowin what skip jellison may do i didnt count on beginning so soon but now hes shown that he dares to set fires id be worried for our new place if something wasnt done  but what do you reckon on doin  you come with me and youll hear and see the whole thing its going to spoil our days work but that cant be helped for its time he was straightened out well get the papers for ikey an then have a look at this bully whos willing to risk burning us up  teddy evidently had a welldefined scheme in his mind but he did not intend to confide in any one until the proper moment  by going a long way round the boys were able to reach their new home without meeting any acquaintances and once there preparations were made for the night carrots meanwhile explaining to ikey what they had seen and heard  that skip will try to break up this stand just as soon as he knows youve got it the clerk said positively  carrots expected teddy would make some reply to this remark but the boy from saranac did not speak and before long his companions were asleep  it was daylight next morning when teddy woke his partner and leaving their clerk still asleep the two hurried to the newspaper offices for the days supply  few other newsboys had begun work when messrs thurston and williams had the stand open with a stock sufficient to satisfy all the customers ikey might have  a breakfast was made on the remainder of the previ ous nights feast and then teddy and carrots worked the hosscars as the latter expressed it until a quarter before seven  come on its time to go teddy said as he deposited his share of the stock on the counter keep your eyes open while were gone ikey because it may be quite a while before we get back  carrots followed his partner in silence and the clocks were striking seven when they arrived at the city hall  dont go over there yet carrots said nervously as he pointed toward a group of boys skip has got every feller in town with him youre certain to get the worst of it  he cant have too many to please me teddy replied boldly and then to carrotss surprise he turned and walked directly toward the enemy  here he comes an now well see what a country jay looks like when he gits ready to leave town was skips greeting and his particular cronies thought the remark so very funny that they laughed long and loud  im not thinking about going out of the city teddy said firmly so im afraid it wont be such an awful good show  then what are you coming round here for skip asked as he advanced threateningly  in the first place ive come for that money you stole from carrots and when that has been given up ill tell you what else i want said teddy quietly  youll be grayheaded before you get anything out of me cept a whack on the head  yes youre said to be a great fighter i know was teddys remark but youd better make all your fight round here where you know the police will stop a row before anybody has a chance to hurt you its safer  ill make my fight anywhere i please skip blustered  then if youve got half the pluck you claim show us a place where it can be done in shape answered teddy sharply im here with nothing to do but settle matters im going to stay in the town right along and i cant be bothered with you all the time if you get the best of me when were where nobodyll interfere with us ill leave an if i get the best of you why then ill get back my dollar an youll have to behave yourself  boys like pluck and even skips friends applauded this remark teddys businesslike offer pleased them wonderfully and they had no doubt the bully would agree at once but to the surprise of all skip remained silent  he dont dare do it teenie jeered hes afraid of gettin the worst of itsames he did that day over in brooklyn  hold your tongue master jellison answered looking angrily around him do you fellers spose that im scared of him  if you aint why dont you do as he says asked teenie  ive got to tend to my work skip stammered thats why i cant but ill give him a poundin now an let that settle it  if you try to touch me here where were sure of being arrested ill have you locked up for stealin teddy said sternly i could do that anyway but id rather manage my own affairs i dont see how you can be too busy to leave for an hour because you havent done any work since you said youd drive me out of town ill go wherever you say an the rest of the fellers shall promise to leave us alone till one of us says hes had enough  of course hes goin to tackle the countryman reddy jackson said in reply to some of his friends who at this moment began to express in an undertone their belief that skip was scared  then reddy took skip aside and began to talk to him very earnestly the others meanwhile discussing whether the bully was afraid  it must have been plain to skip that if he did not wish to be despised by all whom he had cowed so long it was necessary to accept teddys challenge for there were at least a dozen in the throng who had some grudge against the young tyrant and if he showed the white feather so publicly there could be no question that the injured ones would try to revenge themselves believing it could be done safely  im willin to go an thrash this feller of course skip said suddenly as he stepped forward once more i did count on doin a good days work cause ive been takin it easy so long but i reckon i can spare the little time i need to settle him off see here nowi dont want any one in the crowd to beg off for him after i get started  neither do i added teddy promptly he says i cant stay in the town an i want that settled once for all so the rest of the crowd are to hold back never mind whos havin the worst of the trade  you can count on fair play a member of the party said decidedly and as this speaker had always been believed to be one of skips warmest supporters there seemed to be no question that teddy would be treated well during the coming conflict  do you spose you can get the best of him carrots asked in an anxious whisper as under the guidance of one of the party all hands started toward a certain quiet and secluded spot which had been suggested by sid barker  well ill try mighty hard said teddy i dont take much stock in fightin carrots but this is somethin thats got to be done or wed never be able to run the stand  this remark sounded to carrots very much as if his partner had serious doubts regarding the outcome of the engagement and secretly the junior partner began to indulge in the most gloomy forebodings  teddy had very little to say but skip who walked among the leaders of the party took pains to boast in a very loud tone of what he proposed to do with the greenhorn after hed broken him all up  sid conducted the throng to an untenanted stable in the rear of some dwellings on west broadway and said as he led them through a convenient opening  i reckon you might fight here a month without anybody hearing you could you find anything bettern this  most of the boys were loud in their praises of the spot but it really seemed as if skip fancied it too retired  hed rather be where the cops would come carrots whispered to teddy i do believe hes afraid already an i tell you teddy if you can thrash skip well itll be the biggest kind of a thing for a lot of fellers i know of in this town  i reckon ill be all right dont you even say a word no matter what happens and i think when our little scrap is finished he wont have anything more to say about our leaving the city  it did not require many moments to settle the terms of combat  half a dozen of the larger members of the party arranged the details by promising to whip any fellow who should attempt to interfere and then the word was given  teddy did not immediately put himself in an attitude of defence but addressing the spectators said  i dont want any feller to think i came here cause im fond of fight skip jellison has said ive got to leave town and that carrots must too just because he helped me he tried to drive me away by stealing a dollar of my money from carrots and then he set the box pile on fire last night to smoke us out or something worse all i want of him is to give up the cash and agree to let us alone if hes willing to do that theres no need of this row but if he dont i shall fight him the best i know how  skips only reply was to rush forward angrily and an instant later the battle was on  it is very doubtful if even carrots could have told much about the struggle so suddenly was it begun and so soon ended  carrots told ikey that same morning  it didnt seem as if skip had a chance to put up his hands before he was flat on his back and every time he tried to stand up he got another dose of the same medicine till it was over  in less than five minutes teddy was the conqueror without a scratch and skip lying at full length on the stable floor was howling frantically for some one to hold that saranac jay  he hasnt thumped you half enough sid barker said angrily to the prostrate bully what are you yellin like that for teddy aint anywhere near you to think that we fellers have let you pretty nigh run this town for as much as a year when you wouldnt fight a mouse unless you got the first clip at him  after a time skip was made to understand that teddy had no idea of administering more punishment and he was about to scramble to his feet when the boy from saranac stopped him by saying  part of what i came here for was the dollar you stole and as soon as you give that up the row will be over but you dont leave this place till i get it  i havent kept a cent reddy an sid got the same as i did skip cried cringing now as shamefully as he had ever bullied  illustration what are you yellin like that for said sid  all i know is that you took it an youve got to give it up teddy remarked decidedly  ill let you have some tomorrow skip replied with a whine  weve come here to settle matters teddy insisted an this is the place to square up i cant afford to lose another mornings work on account of you  skip finally found eighteen cents and then tried to borrow the rest from those whom he had counted as friends but not one of his late admirers would have anything to do with him he had shown himself to be a coward as well as a bully and now his bitterest enemies were those with whom he had seemed most popular teddy soon understood that skip had told the truth and that he could not regain the whole amount stolen so he said as he took the eighteen cents on account  this will do for now but youve got to come up with the balance by tomorrow night or therell be trouble while you were talking so loud about pounding me it would have looked as if i was scared an didnt dare to do anything but go to the police if id had you arrested but now that every feller knows how much your brag amounts to ill have you right into court if the money isnt paid at the time i said while im in court it wouldnt be very queer if i should have somethin to say bout the fire we saw last night  ill pay back every cent just as soon as i can get it skip wailed  youll have till tomorrow night said teddy firmly but no longer i dont think theres any need to tell you whatll be done if you try to bother carrots or me again  then although many of skips friends were eager to cultivate his acquaintance teddy left the barn in the same quiet way he had entered and carrots followed close behind saying when they were where the words could not be overheard  well teddy whod a thought you was such a fighter  but im not teddy replied sharply i dont believe in that sort of thing but the way matters were going i thought it was somethin that had to be done  and you did it in great shape carrots insisted even if we never get another cent of our dollar back ill be satisfied cause that bully skips done for in this town now he cant scare any more fellers an i reckon all teenie massey said about that brooklyn fight was true  dont lets talk of it carrots im goin to work an youd better do the same cause weve got a mighty big contract on our hands now with so much rent to pay an a clerk to feed  carrots would have liked nothing better than to have remained there discussing all the incidents of the short battle during the next hour or two but teddy put an end to the talk by hurrying away for a stock of papers and the bootblack could do no less than go in search of customers  he had every chance to talk about teddys prowess during the remainder of that day however  every boy who knew skip had something to say about the fallen bully and naturally such remarks were followed by praise for teddy who had settled his troubles in such a businesslike fashion  teenie massey was so excited because of skips downfall that it was almost impossible for him to attend to any business during the next twentyfour hours he told the story over and over again to such of his friends as were so unlucky as not to have witnessed the great combat  none of carrotss friends saw skip during the remainder of that day he disappeared from view as completely as if the earth had opened and swallowed him and there was no sorrow because of his absence     chapter xvii  prosperity   if teddy believed that his new admirers would allow him to go on quietly with his business immediately after punishing skip jellison he was mistaken  the bully had terrorized the bootblacks and newsboys who pursued their callings in the vicinity of the city hall during the previous year without having been called upon to defend himself against one of his own size and strength  as a matter of course it had been necessary to engage in several fights for the purpose of sustaining his reputation as a dangerous character but he had always been careful to attack some boy smaller than himself or as in the case of his first assault upon teddy had contented himself with striking two or three blows suddenly when the victim could be taken unawares  until the day when teenie massey brought the news from brooklyn that skip had been whipped by a boy not more than half his size every fellow believed master jellison to be bold and skilful in the use of his fists  even then most of skips followers fancied teenie had colored the story to suit his own purposes they were willing to give the bully the benefit of the doubt and consequently the surprise of all was very great that teddy had vanquished him so easily  since teddys victory however the opinion of every street merchant in the vicinity of skips usual haunts was that he could not fight a little bit and no one was silent on the subject  the newspaper business was much neglected that morning in order that the details of the battle might be told to those who were not present and more than one gentleman with muddy boots wondered what had become of the small army of bootblacks who were usually so eager for work  teddys praises were warmly sung for even skips most intimate friends felt a certain sense of relief now that his reign was over  that feller has got plenty of sand sid barker said admiringly after he had repeated his story of the bullys downfall for at least the twentieth time an i think we ought to tell him just how we look at this thing  do you spose hell get his money back teenie asked in his shrill voice  not a bit of it skip neverll show up round here again an if he did howll he raise the cash  he says you an reddy got a share  i wont say that we didnt sid replied promptly an im goin to give teddy back my part before noon  so am i reddy added ive got it now an am willin to hunt him up this minute if you say the word  come on sid replied as he started in the direction of south ferry for it was well known by all that teddy was doing business in that part of the city  as a matter of course every fellow who heard this offer was eager to be present when the payment was made to teddy and the crowd of newsboys who marched down broadway was so large as to attract considerable attention  when the small army arrived at the head of cortlandt street carrots met them and it is needless to say he halted in astonishment and some alarm  his first thought was that skips friends had come together for the purpose of taking revenge upon the boy who had chastised the bully and he remained motionless an instant wondering whether it would not be the better part of valour to seek safety in flight  a hail from sid soon dispelled his fears  come on carrots were goin down to find your pardner sos to kinder square things youd better come too  what do you mean to do carrots asked as he joined the throng  theyre goin to give him back part of the money skip stole teenie squeaked an then i reckon hell work up round the city hall  a few moments previous to this meeting it had seemed to carrots as if he desired nothing more because he was partowner of a stand and skips tyrannical reign had come to an end but now if such a thing could be possible he was even more elated than before and all idea of business was forgotten as he followed those who but a short time previous were his enemies  it was a regular triumphal march for the amateur farmer and the promises of friendship from every side gave him much pleasure  i knew you fellers would like teddy when you got acquainted with him he said gleefully  it wouldnt have taken us long to find that out if hed started in different reddy jackson replied why didnt he pitch right inter skip the first thing  how could he when he got in the stationhouse said carrots he wouldnt a let skip get away then if that policeman hadnt been there  but after he got out there wasnt anything done sid objected  you couldnt expect him to jump into trouble again right away he had to wait sos to fix things an then he came out like a little man  thats a fact an now he can go into any part of this town that he likes  carrots was strongly tempted to add to the glory of the march by telling the story of the stand but he remembered that as yet his word was pledged to his partner and remained silent  illustration carrots displays the establishment of messrs thurston and williams  when the party reached south ferry teddy was found hard at work and like carrots he was at first inclined to believe the advancing force boded evil for him but sid barker said as he handed teddy twentyfive cents  what skip jellison told bout our havin some of your money was straight an so weve come here to give it up heres all i got an if id knowd what you really were the money wouldnt a been kept so long as this  an heres my share reddy added as he slipped another coin into teddys hand  but it was skip who stole the money the boy from saranac said with some confusion an he ought to give it back  i reckon you wont see him very soon said reddy skip hasnt got the nerve to show his face round here agin for he knows nearly every feller has something against him we used the money he gave us so its no moren right we should give it back  an youd better work round city hall reddy added youre a dandy an if theres anything we can do to help you along just say the word  teddy protested that business was good enough near the ferries to warrant his remaining where he was but his new friends would listen to nothing of the kind  they insisted so strongly on teddys going with them that he was finally forced to yield and not until the party was marching up broadway did carrots get a chance to speak privately with his partner then he whispered  why not tell them about the stand theyre all glad cause you thumped skip an we neednt be fraid any more that theyll try to make trouble for us  id rather have waited till we had a bigger stock an youd paid for the chair said teddy but i spose the best way is to give the news out now cause theyre bound to see the place before long you can tell em  carrots felt very proud when he announced the fact that he and teddy had gone inter business reglar and he concluded by inviting every member of the party up to see the stand that evening  the one incident of this triumph which did not please teddy was the fact that he was forced to waste so much time when he might have been adding to his capital but there did not seem any way to prevent it and he submitted with the best grace he could  as a matter of course every member of the party promised to visit the partners establishment before nightfall and after the news had been thoroughly discussed several times more most of the young merchants went about their business  teddy never worked harder than during the remainder of that day and no one can blame him for being secretly proud of the victory he had won  to describe the informal reception held by messrs thurston and williams on this evening would be too great a task  from five oclock in the afternoon until late at night the stand was the centre of attraction for all teddys carrotss or skips acquaintances and master williams fairly outdid himself as host  illustration prosperity  he explained what they meant to do showed the new chair which they had bought described how the establishment would look when the new coat of green paint was put on and received more offers of assistance in this artistic work than he could well accept  the partners were thoroughly tired when the last guest took his departure and teddy said in a tone of satisfaction as he curled himself up on his portion of the straw  well carrots i reckon were here to stay this time  yes sir i reckon we are an now im beginnin to think it wont be such a dreadful long while before we get a store say thatll be great wont it i can have my chair inside when it storms an what a place well rig up to sleep in ill know what a bed feels like then an it wont be all ropes sames that one out to the farm  teddy was too nearly asleep to be capable of making any reply and ikey had been snoring several moments therefore master williams giving up his attempt at conversation laid his red head on his arm and joined his companions in their journey to the land of nod  it seems hardly necessary to say that skip has not been seen since his friends forsook him in the stable where his reign as a bully came to an end and even those to whom he owes money have felt no regret because of his long absence  it is quite likely some of the fellows whom he bullied would like a short interview for the purpose of squaring accounts but since master jellison is well aware of this fact he will probably remain in seclusion                                       it is a matter of fact that every satisfactory story ends only when the principal characters are settled in life rich and happy but unfortunately that cannot be in this case for it is not many months since the day on which skip was conquered and in so short a time one could hardly expect the young merchants to have made very rapid strides toward wealth  there is a great difference in the appearance of the stand however it has had at least two coats of the most vivid green paint carrots could purchase and at one end stands the chairall paid forwith so much brasswork about it as to render it quite dazzling on a sunny day  carrots feels very positive it lays way over theitalians and in this he is correct  ikey still holds his position as clerk although his lame leg is healed and he can run about the streets as nimbly as either of his employers  teddy and carrots decided several weeks ago that it would pay them to hire a clerk regularly since both could then go around town in search of customers when trade was dull nearer to the stand and ikey receives as wages his board his lodging and fifty cents each week a great improvement over his former state when he was forced to seek such locations for business as the other boys did not want  carrots still dreams of the reglar store and there appears to be no reason why his hopes may not be fulfilled  the amount of capital is larger each day thanks to the partners industry and their stock is increasing too therefore they will be able to make quite a respectable showing when they move into more roomy quarters  few firms seem likely to be more prosperous than that of teddy and carrots
