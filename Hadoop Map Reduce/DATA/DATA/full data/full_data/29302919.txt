in diagrams on the pages of county histories mostly appear at first sight to be as barren of any touch of nature as a table of logarithms  but given a cluethe faintest tradition of what went on behind the scenes and this dryness as of dust may be transformed into a palpitating drama  more the careful comparison of dates alonethat of birth with marriage of marriage with death of one marriage birth or death with a kindred marriage birth or deathwill often effect the same transformation and anybody practised in raising images from such genealogies finds himself unconsciously filling into the framework the motives passions and personal qualities which would appear to be the single explanation possible of some extraordinary conjunction in times events and personages that occasionally marks these reticent family records  out of such pedigrees and supplementary material most of the following stories have arisen and taken shape  i would make this preface an opportunity of expressing my sense of the courtesy and kindness of several brighteyed noble dames yet in the flesh who since the first publication of these tales in periodicals six or seven years ago have given me interesting comments and conjectures on such of the narratives as they have recognized to be connected with their own families residences or traditions in which they have shown a truly philosophic absence of prejudice in their regard of those incidents whose relation has tended more distinctly to dramatize than to eulogize their ancestors  the outlines they have also given of other singular events in their family histories for use in a second group of noble dames will i fear never reach the printingpress through me but i shall store them up in memory of my informants good nature  t h  june 1896     dame the firstthe first countess of wessex by the local historian   kingshintock court said the narrator turning over his memoranda for referencekingshintock court is as we know one of the most imposing of the mansions that overlook our beautiful blackmoor or blakemore vale on the particular occasion of which i have to speak this building stood as it had often stood before in the perfect silence of a calm clear night lighted only by the cold shine of the stars  the season was winter in days long ago the last century having run but little more than a third of its length  north south and west not a casement was unfastened not a curtain undrawn eastward one window on the upper floor was open and a girl of twelve or thirteen was leaning over the sill  that she had not taken up the position for purposes of observation was apparent at a glance for she kept her eyes covered with her hands  the room occupied by the girl was an inner one of a suite to be reached only by passing through a large bedchamber adjoining  from this apartment voices in altercation were audible everything else in the building being so still  it was to avoid listening to these voices that the girl had left her little cot thrown a cloak round her head and shoulders and stretched into the night air  but she could not escape the conversation try as she would  the words reached her in all their painfulness one sentence in masculine tones those of her father being repeated many times  i tell ee there shall be no such betrothal  i tell ee there shant a child like her  she knew the subject of dispute to be herself  a cool feminine voice her mothers replied  have done with you and be wise  he is willing to wait a good five or six years before the marriage takes place and theres not a man in the county to compare with him  it shall not be  he is over thirty  it is wickedness  he is just thirty and the best and finest man alivea perfect match for her  he is poor  but his father and elder brothers are made much of at courtnone so constantly at the palace as they and with her fortune who knows  he may be able to get a barony  i believe you are in love with en yourself  how can you insult me so thomas  and is it not monstrous for you to talk of my wickedness when you have a like scheme in your own head  you know you have  some bumpkin of your own choosingsome petty gentleman who lives down at that outlandish place of yours fallsparkone of your potcompanions sons  there was an outburst of imprecation on the part of her husband in lieu of further argument  as soon as he could utter a connected sentence he said you crow and you domineer mistress because you are heiressgeneral here  you are in your own house you are on your own land  but let me tell ee that if i did come here to you instead of taking you to me it was done at the dictates of convenience merely  h im no beggar  hant i a place of my own  hant i an avenue as long as thine  hant i beeches that will more than match thy oaks  i should have lived in my own quiet house and land contented if you had not called me off with your airs and graces  faith ill go back there ill not stay with thee longer  if it had not been for our betty i should have gone long ago  after this there were no more words but presently hearing the sound of a door opening and shutting below the girl again looked from the window footsteps crunched on the gravelwalk and a shape in a drab greatcoat easily distinguishable as her father withdrew from the house  he moved to the left and she watched him diminish down the long east front till he had turned the corner and vanished  he must have gone round to the stables  she closed the window and shrank into bed where she cried herself to sleep  this child their only one betty beloved ambitiously by her mother and with uncalculating passionateness by her father was frequently made wretched by such episodes as this though she was too young to care very deeply for her own sake whether her mother betrothed her to the gentleman discussed or not  the squire had often gone out of the house in this manner declaring that he would never return but he had always reappeared in the morning  the present occasion however was different in the issue next day she was told that her father had ridden to his estate at fallspark early in the morning on business with his agent and might not come back for some days        fallspark was over twenty miles from kingshintock court and was altogether a more modest centrepiece to a more modest possession than the latter  but as squire dornell came in view of it that february morning he thought that he had been a fool ever to leave it though it was for the sake of the greatest heiress in wessex  its classic front of the period of the second charles derived from its regular features a dignity which the great battlemented heterogeneous mansion of his wife could not eclipse  altogether he was sick at heart and the gloom which the denselytimbered park threw over the scene did not tend to remove the depression of this rubicund man of eightandforty who sat so heavily upon his gelding  the child his darling betty there lay the root of his trouble  he was unhappy when near his wife he was unhappy when away from his little girl and from this dilemma there was no practicable escape  as a consequence he indulged rather freely in the pleasures of the table became what was called a three bottle man and in his wifes estimation less and less presentable to her polite friends from town  he was received by the two or three old servants who were in charge of the lonely place where a few rooms only were kept habitable for his use or that of his friends when hunting and during the morning he was made more comfortable by the arrival of his faithful servant tupcombe from kingshintock  but after a day or two spent here in solitude he began to feel that he had made a mistake in coming  by leaving kingshintock in his anger he had thrown away his best opportunity of counteracting his wifes preposterous notion of promising his poor little bettys hand to a man she had hardly seen  to protect her from such a repugnant bargain he should have remained on the spot  he felt it almost as a misfortune that the child would inherit so much wealth  she would be a mark for all the adventurers in the kingdom  had she been only the heiress to his own unassuming little place at falls how much better would have been her chances of happiness  his wife had divined truly when she insinuated that he himself had a lover in view for this pet child  the son of a dear deceased friend of his who lived not two miles from where the squire now was a lad a couple of years his daughters senior seemed in her fathers opinion the one person in the world likely to make her happy  but as to breathing such a scheme to either of the young people with the indecent haste that his wife had shown he would not dream of it years hence would be soon enough for that  they had already seen each other and the squire fancied that he noticed a tenderness on the youths part which promised well  he was strongly tempted to profit by his wifes example and forestall her matchmaking by throwing the two young people together there at falls  the girl though marriageable in the views of those days was too young to be in love but the lad was fifteen and already felt an interest in her  still better than keeping watch over her at kings hintock where she was necessarily much under her mothers influence would it be to get the child to stay with him at falls for a time under his exclusive control but how accomplish this without using main force  the only possible chance was that his wife might for appearance sake as she had done before consent to betty paying him a days visit when he might find means of detaining her till reynard the suitor whom his wife favoured had gone abroad which he was expected to do the following week  squire dornell determined to return to kingshintock and attempt the enterprise  if he were refused it was almost in him to pick up betty bodily and carry her off  the journey back vague and quixotic as were his intentions was performed with a far lighter heart than his setting forth  he would see betty and talk to her come what might of his plan  so he rode along the dead level which stretches between the hills skirting fallspark and those bounding the town of ivell trotted through that borough and out by the kingshintock highway till passing the villages he entered the milelong drive through the park to the court the drive being open without an avenue the squire could discern the north front and door of the court a long way off and was himself visible from the windows on that side for which reason he hoped that betty might perceive him coming as she sometimes did on his return from an outing and run to the door or wave her handkerchief  but there was no sign  he inquired for his wife as soon as he set foot to earth  mistress is away  she was called to london sir  and mistress betty said the squire blankly  gone likewise sir for a little change  mistress has left a letter for you  the note explained nothing merely stating that she had posted to london on her own affairs and had taken the child to give her a holiday  on the flyleaf were some words from betty herself to the same effect evidently written in a state of high jubilation at the idea of her jaunt squire dornell murmured a few expletives and submitted to his disappointment  how long his wife meant to stay in town she did not say but on investigation he found that the carriage had been packed with sufficient luggage for a sojourn of two or three weeks  kingshintock court was in consequence as gloomy as fallspark had been he had lost all zest for hunting of late and had hardly attended a meet that season  dornell read and reread bettys scrawl and hunted up some other such notes of hers to look over this seeming to be the only pleasure there was left for him  that they were really in london he learnt in a few days by another letter from mrs dornell in which she explained that they hoped to be home in about a week and that she had had no idea he was coming back to kingshintock so soon or she would not have gone away without telling him  squire dornell wondered if in going or returning it had been her plan to call at the reynards place near melchester through which city their journey lay  it was possible that she might do this in furtherance of her project and the sense that his own might become the losing game was harassing  he did not know how to dispose of himself till it occurred to him that to get rid of his intolerable heaviness he would invite some friends to dinner and drown his cares in grog and wine  no sooner was the carouse decided upon than he put it in hand those invited being mostly neighbouring landholders all smaller men than himself members of the hunt also the doctor from evershead and the likesome of them rollicking blades whose presence his wife would not have countenanced had she been at home  when the cats away said the squire  they arrived and there were indications in their manner that they meant to make a night of it  baxby of sherton castle was late and they waited a quarter of an hour for him he being one of the liveliest of dornells friends without whose presence no such dinner as this would be considered complete and it may be added with whose presence no dinner which included both sexes could be conducted with strict propriety  he had just returned from london and the squire was anxious to talk to himfor no definite reason but he had lately breathed the atmosphere in which betty was  at length they heard baxby driving up to the door whereupon the host and the rest of his guests crossed over to the diningroom  in a moment baxby came hastily in at their heels apologizing for his lateness  i only came back last night you know he said and the truth ot is i had as much as i could carry  he turned to the squire  well dornellso cunning reynard has stolen your little ewe lamb  ha ha  what said squire dornell vacantly across the diningtable round which they were all standing the cold march sunlight streaming in upon his fullclean shaven face  surely thst know what all the town knowsyouve had a letter by this timethat stephen reynard has married your betty  yes as im a living man  it was a carefullyarranged thing they parted at once and are not to meet for five or six years  but lord you must know  a thud on the floor was the only reply of the squire  they quickly turned  he had fallen down like a log behind the table and lay motionless on the oak boards  those at hand hastily bent over him and the whole group were in confusion  they found him to be quite unconscious though puffing and panting like a blacksmiths bellows  his face was livid his veins swollen and beads of perspiration stood upon his brow  whats happened to him said several  an apoplectic fit said the doctor from evershead gravely  he was only called in at the court for small ailments as a rule and felt the importance of the situation  he lifted the squires head loosened his cravat and clothing and rang for the servants who took the squire upstairs  there he lay as if in a drugged sleep  the surgeon drew a basinfull of blood from him but it was nearly six oclock before he came to himself the dinner was completely disorganized and some had gone home long ago but two or three remained  bless my soul baxby kept repeating i didnt know things had come to this pass between dornell and his lady  i thought the feast he was spreading today was in honour of the event though privately kept for the present  his little maid married without his knowledge  as soon as the squire recovered consciousness he gasped tis abduction tis a capital felony  he can be hung  where is baxby  i am very well now  what items have ye heard baxby  the bearer of the untoward news was extremely unwilling to agitate dornell further and would say little more at first  but an hour after when the squire had partially recovered and was sitting up baxby told as much as he knew the most important particular being that bettys mother was present at the marriage and showed every mark of approval everything appeared to have been done so regularly that i of course thought you knew all about it he said  i knew no more than the underground dead that such a step was in the wind  a child not yet thirteen  how sue hath outwitted me  did reynard go up to lonon with em dye know  i cant say  all i know is that your lady and daughter were walking along the street with the footman behind em that they entered a jewellers shop where reynard was standing and that there in the presence o the shopkeeper and your man who was called in on purpose your betty said to reynardso the story goes pon my soul i dont vouch for the truth of itshe said will you marry me or i want to marry you will you have menow or never she said  what she said means nothing murmured the squire with wet eyes  her mother put the words into her mouth to avoid the serious consequences that would attach to any suspicion of force  the words be not the childs she didnt dream of marriagehow should she poor little maid go on  well be that as it will they were all agreed apparently  they bought the ring on the spot and the marriage took place at the nearest church within halfanhour        a day or two later there came a letter from mrs dornell to her husband written before she knew of his stroke  she related the circumstances of the marriage in the gentlest manner and gave cogent reasons and excuses for consenting to the premature union which was now an accomplished fact indeed  she had no idea till sudden pressure was put upon her that the contract was expected to be carried out so soon but being taken half unawares she had consented having learned that stephen reynard now their soninlaw was becoming a great favourite at court and that he would in all likelihood have a title granted him before long  no harm could come to their dear daughter by this early marriagecontract seeing that her life would be continued under their own eyes exactly as before for some years  in fine she had felt that no other such fair opportunity for a good marriage with a shrewd courtier and wise man of the world who was at the same time noted for his excellent personal qualities was within the range of probability owing to the rusticated lives they led at kingshintock  hence she had yielded to stephens solicitation and hoped her husband would forgive her  she wrote in short like a woman who having had her way as to the deed is prepared to make any concession as to words and subsequent behaviour  all this dornell took at its true value or rather perhaps at less than its true value  as his life depended upon his not getting into a passion he controlled his perturbed emotions as well as he was able going about the house sadly and utterly unlike his former self  he took every precaution to prevent his wife knowing of the incidents of his sudden illness from a sense of shame at having a heart so tender a ridiculous quality no doubt in her eyes now that she had become so imbued with town ideas  but rumours of his seizure somehow reached her and she let him know that she was about to return to nurse him  he thereupon packed up and went off to his own place at fallspark  here he lived the life of a recluse for some time  he was still too unwell to entertain company or to ride to hounds or elsewhither but more than this his aversion to the faces of strangers and acquaintances who knew by that time of the trick his wife had played him operated to hold him aloof  nothing could influence him to censure betty for her share in the exploit  he never once believed that she had acted voluntarily  anxious to know how she was getting on he despatched the trusty servant tupcombe to evershead village close to kingshintock timing his journey so that he should reach the place under cover of dark  the emissary arrived without notice being out of livery and took a seat in the chimneycorner of the sowandacorn  the conversation of the droppersin was always of the nine days wonderthe recent marriage  the smoking listener learnt that mrs dornell and the girl had returned to kingshintock for a day or two that reynard had set out for the continent and that betty had since been packed off to school  she did not realize her position as reynards childwifeso the story wentand though somewhat awestricken at first by the ceremony she had soon recovered her spirits on finding that her freedom was in no way to be interfered with  after that formal messages began to pass between dornell and his wife the latter being now as persistently conciliating as she was formerly masterful  but her rustic simple blustering husband still held personally aloof  her wish to be reconciledto win his forgiveness for her stratagemmoreover a genuine tenderness and desire to soothe his sorrow which welled up in her at times brought her at last to his door at fallspark one day  they had not met since that night of altercation before her departure for london and his subsequent illness  she was shocked at the change in him  his face had become expressionless as blank as that of a puppet and what troubled her still more was that she found him living in one room and indulging freely in stimulants in absolute disobedience to the physicians order  the fact was obvious that he could no longer be allowed to live thus uncouthly  so she sympathized and begged his pardon and coaxed  but though after this date there was no longer such a complete estrangement as before they only occasionally saw each other dornell for the most part making falls his headquarters still  three or four years passed thus  then she came one day with more animation in her manner and at once moved him by the simple statement that bettys schooling had ended she had returned and was grieved because he was away  she had sent a message to him in these words ask father to come home to his dear betty  ah  then she is very unhappy said squire dornell  his wife was silent  tis that accursed marriage continued the squire  still his wife would not dispute with him  she is outside in the carriage said mrs dornell gently  whatbetty  yes  why didnt you tell me  dornell rushed out and there was the girl awaiting his forgiveness for she supposed herself no less than her mother to be under his displeasure  yes betty had left school and had returned to kingshintock  she was nearly seventeen and had developed to quite a young woman  she looked not less a member of the household for her early marriagecontract which she seemed indeed to have almost forgotten  it was like a dream to her that clear cold march day the london church with its gorgeous pews and greenbaize linings and the great organ in the west galleryso different from their own little church in the shrubbery of kingshintock courtthe man of thirty to whose face she had looked up with so much awe and with a sense that he was rather ugly and formidable the man whom though they corresponded politely she had never seen since one to whose existence she was now so indifferent that if informed of his death and that she would never see him more she would merely have replied indeed  bettys passions as yet still slept  hast heard from thy husband lately said squire dornell when they were indoors with an ironical laugh of fondness which demanded no answer  the girl winced and he noticed that his wife looked appealingly at him as the conversation went on and there were signs that dornell would express sentiments that might do harm to a position which they could not alter mrs dornell suggested that betty should leave the room till her father and herself had finished their private conversation and this betty obediently did  dornell renewed his animadversions freely  did you see how the sound of his name frightened her he presently added  if you didnt i did zounds what a future is in store for that poor little unfortunate wench o mine  i tell ee sue twas not a marriage at all in morality and if i were a woman in such a position i shouldnt feel it as one  she might without a sign of sin love a man of her choice as well now as if she were chained up to no other at all  there thats my mind and i cant help it  ah sue my man was best  hed ha suited her  i dont believe it she replied incredulously  you should see him then you would  hes growing up a fine fellow i can tell ee  hush not so loud she answered rising from her seat and going to the door of the next room whither her daughter had betaken herself  to mrs dornells alarm there sat betty in a reverie her round eyes fixed on vacancy musing so deeply that she did not perceive her mothers entrance  she had heard every word and was digesting the new knowledge  her mother felt that fallspark was dangerous ground for a young girl of the susceptible age and in bettys peculiar position while dornell talked and reasoned thus  she called betty to her and they took leave the squire would not clearly promise to return and make kingshintock court his permanent abode but bettys presence there as at former times was sufficient to make him agree to pay them a visit soon  all the way home betty remained preoccupied and silent  it was too plain to her anxious mother that squire dornells free views had been a sort of awakening to the girl  the interval before dornell redeemed his pledge to come and see them was unexpectedly short  he arrived one morning about twelve oclock driving his own pair of blackbays in the curriclephaeton with yellow panels and red wheels just as he had used to do and his faithful old tupcombe on horseback behind  a young man sat beside the squire in the carriage and mrs dornells consternation could scarcely be concealed when abruptly entering with his companion the squire announced him as his friend phelipson of elmcranlynch  dornell passed on to betty in the background and tenderly kissed her sting your mothers conscience my maid he whispered  sting her conscience by pretending you are struck with phelipson and would ha loved him as your old fathers choice much more than him she has forced upon ee  the simplesouled speaker fondly imagined that it as entirely in obedience to this direction that bettys eyes stole interested glances at the frank and impulsive phelipson that day at dinner and he laughed grimly within himself to see how this joke of his as he imagined it to be was disturbing the peace of mind of the lady of the house  now sue sees what a mistake she has made said he  mrs dornell was verily greatly alarmed and as soon as she could speak a word with him alone she upbraided him  you ought not to have brought him here  oh thomas how could you be so thoughtless  lord dont you see dear that what is done cannot be undone and how all this foolery jeopardizes her happiness with her husband  until you interfered and spoke in her hearing about this phelipson she was as patient and as willing as a lamb and looked forward to mr reynards return with real pleasure  since her visit to fallspark she has been monstrous close mouthed and busy with her own thoughts  what mischief will you do  how will it end  own then that my man was best suited to her  i only brought him to convince you  yes yes i do admit it  but oh do take him back again at once  dont keep him here  i fear she is even attracted by him already  nonsense sue  tis only a little trick to tease ee  nevertheless her motherly eye was not so likely to be deceived as his and if betty were really only playing at being lovestruck that day she played at it with the perfection of a rosalind and would have deceived the best professors into a belief that it was no counterfeit  the squire having obtained his victory was quite ready to take back the too attractive youth and early in the afternoon they set out on their return journey  a silent figure who rode behind them was as interested as dornell in that days experiment  it was the staunch tupcombe who with his eyes on the squires and young phelipsons backs thought how well the latter would have suited betty and how greatly the former had changed for the worse during these last two or three years  he cursed his mistress as the cause of the change  after this memorable visit to prove his point the lives of the dornell couple flowed on quietly enough for the space of a twelvemonth the squire for the most part remaining at falls and betty passing and repassing between them now and then once or twice alarming her mother by not driving home from her fathers house till midnight        the repose of kingshintock was broken by the arrival of a special messenger  squire dornell had had an access of gout so violent as to be serious  he wished to see betty again why had she not come for so long  mrs dornell was extremely reluctant to take betty in that direction too frequently but the girl was so anxious to go her interests latterly seeming to be so entirely bound up in fallspark and its neighbourhood that there was nothing to be done but to let her set out and accompany her  squire dornell had been impatiently awaiting her arrival  they found him very ill and irritable  it had been his habit to take powerful medicines to drive away his enemy and they had failed in their effect on this occasion  the presence of his daughter as usual calmed him much even while as usual too it saddened him for he could never forget that she had disposed of herself for life in opposition to his wishes though she had secretly assured him that she would never have consented had she been as old as she was now  as on a former occasion his wife wished to speak to him alone about the girls future the time now drawing nigh at which reynard was expected to come and claim her  he would have done so already but he had been put off by the earnest request of the young woman herself which accorded with that of her parents on the score of her youth  reynard had deferentially submitted to their wishes in this respect the understanding between them having been that he would not visit her before she was eighteen except by the mutual consent of all parties  but this could not go on much longer and there was no doubt from the tenor of his last letter that he would soon take possession of her whether or no  to be out of the sound of this delicate discussion betty was accordingly sent downstairs and they soon saw her walking away into the shrubberies looking very pretty in her sweeping green gown and flapping broadbrimmed hat overhung with a feather  on returning to the subject mrs dornell found her husbands reluctance to reply in the affirmative to reynards letter to be as great as ever  she is three months short of eighteen he exclaimed  tis too soon  i wont hear of it  if i have to keep him off sword in hand he shall not have her yet  but my dear thomas she expostulated consider if anything should happen to you or to me how much better it would be that she should be settled in her home with him  i say it is too soon he argued the veins of his forehead beginning to swell  if he gets her this side o candlemas ill challenge enill take my oath ont  ill be back to kingshintock in two or three days and ill not lose sight of her day or night  she feared to agitate him further and gave way assuring him in obedience to his demand that if reynard should write again before he got back to fix a time for joining betty she would put the letter in her husbands hands and he should do as he chose  this was all that required discussion privately and mrs dornell went to call in betty hoping that she had not heard her fathers loud tones  she had certainly not done so this time  mrs dornell followed the path along which she had seen betty wandering but went a considerable distance without perceiving anything of her  the squires wife then turned round to proceed to the other side of the house by a short cut across the grass when to her surprise and consternation she beheld the object of her search sitting on the horizontal bough of a cedar beside her being a young man whose arm was round her waist  he moved a little and she recognized him as young phelipson  alas then she was right  the socalled counterfeit love was real  what mrs dornell called her husband at that moment for his folly in originally throwing the young people together it is not necessary to mention  she decided in a moment not to let the lovers know that she had seen them  she accordingly retreated reached the front of the house by another route and called at the top of her voice from a window betty  for the first time since her strategic marriage of the child susan dornell doubted the wisdom of that step  her husband had as it were been assisted by destiny to make his objection originally trivial a valid one  she saw the outlines of trouble in the future  why had dornell interfered  why had he insisted upon producing his man  this then accounted for bettys pleading for postponement whenever the subject of her husbands return was broached this accounted for her attachment to fallspark  possibly this very meeting that she had witnessed had been arranged by letter  perhaps the girls thoughts would never have strayed for a moment if her father had not filled her head with ideas of repugnance to her early union on the ground that she had been coerced into it before she knew her own mind and she might have rushed to meet her husband with open arms on the appointed day  betty at length appeared in the distance in answer to the call and came up pale but looking innocent of having seen a living soul  mrs dornell groaned in spirit at such duplicity in the child of her bosom  this was the simple creature for whose development into womanhood they had all been so tenderly waitinga forward minx old enough not only to have a lover but to conceal his existence as adroitly as any woman of the world  bitterly did the squires lady regret that stephen reynard had not been allowed to come to claim her at the time he first proposed  the two sat beside each other almost in silence on their journey back to kingshintock  such words as were spoken came mainly from betty and their formality indicated how much her mind and heart were occupied with other things  mrs dornell was far too astute a mother to openly attack betty on the matter  that would be only fanning flame  the indispensable course seemed to her to be that of keeping the treacherous girl under lock and key till her husband came to take her off her mothers hands  that he would disregard dornells opposition and come soon was her devout wish  it seemed therefore a fortunate coincidence that on her arrival at kingshintock a letter from reynard was put into mrs dornells hands it was addressed to both her and her husband and courteously informed them that the writer had landed at bristol and proposed to come on to kingshintock in a few days at last to meet and carry off his darling betty if she and her parents saw no objection  betty had also received a letter of the same tenor  her mother had only to look at her face to see how the girl received the information  she was as pale as a sheet  you must do your best to welcome him this time my dear betty her mother said gently  butbuti  you are a woman now added her mother severely and these postponements must come to an end  but my fatheroh i am sure he will not allow this  i am not ready  if he could only wait a year longerif he could only wait a few months longer  oh i wishi wish my dear father were here  i will send to him instantly  she broke off abruptly and falling upon her mothers neck burst into tears saying o my mother have mercy upon mei do not love this man my husband  the agonized appeal went too straight to mrs dornells heart for her to hear it unmoved  yet things having come to this pass what could she do  she was distracted and for a moment was on bettys side  her original thought had been to write an affirmative reply to reynard allow him to come on to kingshintock and keep her husband in ignorance of the whole proceeding till he should arrive from falls on some fine day after his recovery and find everything settled and reynard and betty living together in harmony  but the events of the day and her daughters sudden outburst of feeling had overthrown this intention betty was sure to do as she had threatened and communicate instantly with her father possibly attempt to fly to him  moreover reynards letter was addressed to mr dornell and herself conjointly and she could not in conscience keep it from her husband  i will send the letter on to your father instantly she replied soothingly  he shall act entirely as he chooses and you know that will not be in opposition to your wishes  he would ruin you rather than thwart you  i only hope he may be well enough to bear the agitation of this news  do you agree to this  poor betty agreed on condition that she should actually witness the despatch of the letter  her mother had no objection to offer to this but as soon as the horseman had cantered down the drive toward the highway mrs dornells sympathy with bettys recalcitration began to die out  the girls secret affection for young phelipson could not possibly be condoned  betty might communicate with him might even try to reach him  ruin lay that way  stephen reynard must be speedily installed in his proper place by bettys side  she sat down and penned a private letter to reynard which threw light upon her plan        it is necessary that i should now tell you she said what i have never mentioned beforeindeed i may have signified the contrarythat her fathers objection to your joining her has not as yet been overcome as i personally wish to delay you no longeram indeed as anxious for your arrival as you can be yourself having the good of my daughter at heartno course is left open to me but to assist your cause without my husbands knowledge  he i am sorry to say is at present ill at falls park but i felt it my duty to forward him your letter  he will therefore be like to reply with a peremptory command to you to go back again for some months whence you came till the time he originally stipulated has expird  my advice is if you get such a letter to take no notice of it but to come on hither as you had proposed letting me know the day and hour after dark if possible at which we may expect you  dear betty is with me and i warrant ye that she shall be in the house when you arrive        mrs dornell having sent away this epistle unsuspected of anybody next took steps to prevent her daughter leaving the court avoiding if possible to excite the girls suspicions that she was under restraint but as if by divination betty had seemed to read the husbands approach in the aspect of her mothers face  he is coming exclaimed the maiden  not for a week her mother assured her  he is thenfor certain  well yes  betty hastily retired to her room and would not be seen  to lock her up and hand over the key to reynard when he should appear in the hall was a plan charming in its simplicity till her mother found on trying the door of the girls chamber softly that betty had already locked and bolted it on the inside and had given directions to have her meals served where she was by leaving them on a dumbwaiter outside the door  thereupon mrs dornell noiselessly sat down in her boudoir which as well as her bedchamber was a passageroom to the girls apartment and she resolved not to vacate her post night or day till her daughters husband should appear to which end she too arranged to breakfast dine and sup on the spot  it was impossible now that betty should escape without her knowledge even if she had wished there being no other door to the chamber except one admitting to a small inner dressingroom inaccessible by any second way  but it was plain that the young girl had no thought of escape  her ideas ran rather in the direction of intrenchment she was prepared to stand a siege but scorned flight  this at any rate rendered her secure  as to how reynard would contrive a meeting with her coy daughter while in such a defensive humour that thought her mother must be left to his own ingenuity to discover  betty had looked so wild and pale at the announcement of her husbands approaching visit that mrs dornell somewhat uneasy could not leave her to herself  she peeped through the keyhole an hour later  betty lay on the sofa staring listlessly at the ceiling  you are looking ill child cried her mother  youve not taken the air lately  come with me for a drive  betty made no objection  soon they drove through the park towards the village the daughter still in the strained strungup silence that had fallen upon her  they left the park to return by another route and on the open road passed a cottage  bettys eye fell upon the cottagewindow  within it she saw a young girl about her own age whom she knew by sight sitting in a chair and propped by a pillow  the girls face was covered with scales which glistened in the sun  she was a convalescent from smallpoxa disease whose prevalence at that period was a terror of which we at present can hardly form a conception  an idea suddenly energized bettys apathetic features  she glanced at her mother mrs dornell had been looking in the opposite direction betty said that she wished to go back to the cottage for a moment to speak to a girl in whom she took an interest  mrs dornell appeared suspicious but observing that the cottage had no backdoor and that betty could not escape without being seen she allowed the carriage to be stopped  betty ran back and entered the cottage emerging again in about a minute and resuming her seat in the carriage  as they drove on she fixed her eyes upon her mother and said there i have done it now  her pale face was stormy and her eyes full of waiting tears  what have you done said mrs dornell  nanny priddle is sick of the smallpox and i saw her at the window and i went in and kissed her so that i might take it and now i shall have it and he wont be able to come near me  wicked girl cries her mother  oh what am i to do  whatbring a distemper on yourself and usurp the sacred prerogative of god because you cant palate the man youve wedded  the alarmed woman gave orders to drive home as rapidly as possible and on arriving betty who was by this time also somewhat frightened at her own enormity was put into a bath and fumigated and treated in every way that could be thought of to ward off the dreadful malady that in a rash moment she had tried to acquire  there was now a double reason for isolating the rebellious daughter and wife in her own chamber and there she accordingly remained for the rest of the day and the days that followed till no ill results seemed likely to arise from her wilfulness        meanwhile the first letter from reynard announcing to mrs dornell and her husband jointly that he was coming in a few days had sped on its way to fallspark  it was directed under cover to tupcombe the confidential servant with instructions not to put it into his masters hands till he had been refreshed by a good long sleep  tupcombe much regretted his commission letters sent in this way always disturbing the squire but guessing that it would be infinitely worse in the end to withhold the news than to reveal it he chose his time which was early the next morning and delivered the missive  the utmost effect that mrs dornell had anticipated from the message was a peremptory order from her husband to reynard to hold aloof a few months longer  what the squire really did was to declare that he would go himself and confront reynard at bristol and have it out with him there by word of mouth  but master said tupcombe you cant  you cannot get out of bed  you leave the room tupcombe and dont say cant before me  have jerry saddled in an hour  the longtried tupcombe thought his employer demented so utterly helpless was his appearance just then and he went out reluctantly  no sooner was he gone than the squire with great difficulty stretched himself over to a cabinet by the bedside unlocked it and took out a small bottle  it contained a gout specific against whose use he had been repeatedly warned by his regular physician but whose warning he now cast to the winds  he took a double dose and waited half an hour  it seemed to produce no effect  he then poured out a treble dose swallowed it leant back upon his pillow and waited  the miracle he anticipated had been worked at last  it seemed as though the second draught had not only operated with its own strength but had kindled into power the latent forces of the first  he put away the bottle and rang up tupcombe  less than an hour later one of the housemaids who of course was quite aware that the squires illness was serious was surprised to hear a bold and decided step descending the stairs from the direction of mr dornells room accompanied by the humming of a tune  she knew that the doctor had not paid a visit that morning and that it was too heavy to be the valet or any other manservant  looking up she saw squire dornell fully dressed descending toward her in his drab caped ridingcoat and boots with the swinging easy movement of his prime  her face expressed her amazement  what the devil beest looking at said the squire  did you never see a man walk out of his house before wench  resuming his hummingwhich was of a defiant sorthe proceeded to the library rang the bell asked if the horses were ready and directed them to be brought round  ten minutes later he rode away in the direction of bristol tupcombe behind him trembling at what these movements might portend  they rode on through the pleasant woodlands and the monotonous straight lanes at an equal pace  the distance traversed might have been about fifteen miles when tupcombe could perceive that the squire was getting tiredas weary as he would have been after riding three times the distance ten years before  however they reached bristol without any mishap and put up at the squires accustomed inn  dornell almost immediately proceeded on foot to the inn which reynard had given as his address it being now about four oclock  reynard had already dinedfor people dined early thenand he was staying indoors  he had already received mrs dornells reply to his letter but before acting upon her advice and starting for kingshintock he made up his mind to wait another day that bettys father might at least have time to write to him if so minded  the returned traveller much desired to obtain the squires assent as well as his wifes to the proposed visit to his bride that nothing might seem harsh or forced in his method of taking his position as one of the family  but though he anticipated some sort of objection from his fatherinlaw in consequence of mrs dornells warning he was surprised at the announcement of the squire in person  stephen reynard formed the completest of possible contrasts to dornell as they stood confronting each other in the best parlour of the bristol tavern  the squire hottempered gouty impulsive generous reckless the younger man pale tall sedate selfpossesseda man of the world fully bearing out at least one couplet in his epitaph still extant in kingshintock church which places in the inventory of his good qualities     engaging manners cultivated mind    adornd by letters and in courts refind  he was at this time about fiveandthirty though careful living and an even unemotional temperament caused him to look much younger than his years  squire dornell plunged into his errand without much ceremony or preface  i am your humble servant sir he said  i have read your letter writ to my wife and myself and considered that the best way to answer it would be to do so in person  i am vastly honoured by your visit sir said mr stephen reynard bowing  well whats done cant be undone said dornell though it was mighty early and was no doing of mine  shes your wife and theres an end ont  but in brief sir shes too young for you to claim yet we mustnt reckon by years we must reckon by nature  shes still a girl tis onpolite of ee to come yet next year will be full soon enough for you to take her to you  now courteous as reynard could be he was a little obstinate when his resolution had once been formed  she had been promised him by her eighteenth birthday at latestsooner if she were in robust health  her mother had fixed the time on her own judgment without a word of interference on his part  he had been hanging about foreign courts till he was weary  betty was now as woman if she would ever be one and there was not in his mind the shadow of an excuse for putting him off longer  therefore fortified as he was by the support of her mother he blandly but firmly told the squire that he had been willing to waive his rights out of deference to her parents to any reasonable extent but must now in justice to himself and her insist on maintaining them  he therefore since she had not come to meet him should proceed to kings hintock in a few days to fetch her  this announcement in spite of the urbanity with which it was delivered set dornell in a passion  oh dammy sir you talk about rights you do after stealing her away a mere child against my will and knowledge  if wed begged and prayed ee to take her you could say no more  upon my honour your charge is quite baseless sir said his sonin law  you must know by this timeor if you do not it has been a monstrous cruel injustice to me that i should have been allowed to remain in your mind with such a stain upon my characteryou must know that i used no seductiveness or temptation of any kind  her mother assented she assented  i took them at their word  that you was really opposed to the marriage was not known to me till afterwards  dornell professed to believe not a word of it  you shant have her till shes dree sixes fullno maid ought to be married till shes dree sixesand my daughter shant be treated out of nater  so he stormed on till tupcombe who had been alarmedly listening in the next room entered suddenly declaring to reynard that his masters life was in danger if the interview were prolonged he being subject to apoplectic strokes at these crises  reynard immediately said that he would be the last to wish to injure squire dornell and left the room and as soon as the squire had recovered breath and equanimity he went out of the inn leaning on the arm of tupcombe  tupcombe was for sleeping in bristol that night but dornell whose energy seemed as invincible as it was sudden insisted upon mounting and getting back as far as fallspark to continue the journey to kingshintock on the following day  at five they started and took the southern road toward the mendip hills  the evening was dry and windy and excepting that the sun did not shine strongly reminded tupcombe of the evening of that march month nearly five years earlier when news had been brought to kingshintock court of the child bettys marriage in londonnews which had produced upon dornell such a marked effect for the worse ever since and indirectly upon the household of which he was the head  before that time the winters were lively at fallspark as well as at kingshintock although the squire had ceased to make it his regular residence  huntingguests and shootingguests came and went and open house was kept  tupcombe disliked the clever courtier who had put a stop to this by taking away from the squire the only treasure he valued  it grew darker with their progress along the lanes and tupcombe discovered from mr dornells manner of riding that his strength was giving way and spurring his own horse close alongside he asked him how he felt  oh bad damn bad tupcombe  i can hardly keep my seat  i shall never be any better i fear  have we passed threemangibbet yet  not yet by a long ways sir  i wish we had  i can hardly hold on  the squire could not repress a groan now and then and tupcombe knew he was in great pain  i wish i was undergroundthats the place for such fools as i  id gladly be there if it were not for mistress betty  hes coming on to kingshintock tomorrowhe wont put it off any longer hell set out and reach there tomorrow night without stopping at falls and hell take her unawares and i want to be there before him  i hope you may be well enough to do it sir  but really  i must tupcombe  you dont know what my trouble is it is not so much that she is married to this man without my agreeingfor after all theres nothing to say against him so far as i know but that she dont take to him at all seems to fear himin fact cares nothing about him and if he comes forcing himself into the house upon her why twill be rank cruelty  would to the lord something would happen to prevent him  how they reached home that night tupcombe hardly knew  the squire was in such pain that he was obliged to recline upon his horse and tupcombe was afraid every moment lest he would fall into the road  but they did reach home at last and mr dornell was instantly assisted to bed        next morning it was obvious that he could not possibly go to kingshintock for several days at least and there on the bed he lay cursing his inability to proceed on an errand so personal and so delicate that no emissary could perform it  what he wished to do was to ascertain from bettys own lips if her aversion to reynard was so strong that his presence would be positively distasteful to her  were that the case he would have borne her away bodily on the saddle behind him  but all that was hindered now and he repeated a hundred times in tupcombes hearing and in that of the nurse and other servants i wish to god something would happen to him  this sentiment reiterated by the squire as he tossed in the agony induced by the powerful drugs of the day before entered sharply into the soul of tupcombe and of all who were attached to the house of dornell as distinct from the house of his wife at kingshintock  tupcombe who was an excitable man was hardly less disquieted by the thought of reynards return than the squire himself was  as the week drew on and the afternoon advanced at which reynard would in all probability be passing near falls on his way to the court the squires feelings became acuter and the responsive tupcombe could hardly bear to come near him  having left him in the hands of the doctor the former went out upon the lawn for he could hardly breathe in the contagion of excitement caught from the employer who had virtually made him his confidant  he had lived with the dornells from his boyhood had been born under the shadow of their walls his whole life was annexed and welded to the life of the family in a degree which has no counterpart in these latter days  he was summoned indoors and learnt that it had been decided to send for mrs dornell her husband was in great danger  there were two or three who could have acted as messenger but dornell wished tupcombe to go the reason showing itself when tupcombe being ready to start squire dornell summoned him to his chamber and leaned down so that he could whisper in his ear  put peggy along smart tupcombe and get there before him you knowbefore him  this is the day he fixed  he has not passed falls crossroads yet  if you can do that you will be able to get betty to comedye seeafter her mother has started shell have a reason for not waiting for him  bring her by the lower roadhell go by the upper your business is to make em miss each otherdye seebut thats a thing i couldnt write down  five minutes after tupcombe was astride the horse and on his waythe way he had followed so many times since his master a florid young countryman had first gone wooing to kingshintock court  as soon as he had crossed the hills in the immediate neighbourhood of the manor the road lay over a plain where it ran in long straight stretches for several miles  in the best of times when all had been gay in the united houses that part of the road had seemed tedious  it was gloomy in the extreme now that he pursued it at night and alone on such an errand  he rode and brooded  if the squire were to die he tupcombe would be alone in the world and friendless for he was no favourite with mrs dornell and to find himself baffled after all in what he had set his mind on would probably kill the squire  thinking thus tupcombe stopped his horse every now and then and listened for the coming husband  the time was drawing on to the moment when reynard might be expected to pass along this very route  he had watched the road well during the afternoon and had inquired of the tavernkeepers as he came up to each and he was convinced that the premature descent of the strangerhusband upon his young mistress had not been made by this highway as yet  besides the girls mother tupcombe was the only member of the household who suspected bettys tender feelings towards young phelipson so unhappily generated on her return from school and he could therefore imagine even better than her fond father what would be her emotions on the sudden announcement of reynards advent that evening at kingshintock court  so he rode and rode desponding and hopeful by turns  he felt assured that unless in the unfortunate event of the almost immediate arrival of her sonin law at his own heels mrs dornell would not be able to hinder bettys departure for her fathers bedside  it was about nine oclock that having put twenty miles of country behind him he turned in at the lodgegate nearest to ivell and kingshintock village and pursued the long north driveitself much like a turnpike roadwhich led thence through the park to the court  though there were so many trees in kingshintock park few bordered the carriage roadway he could see it stretching ahead in the pale night light like an unrolled deal shaving  presently the irregular frontage of the house came in view of great extent but low except where it rose into the outlines of a broad square tower  as tupcombe approached he rode aside upon the grass to make sure if possible that he was the first comer before letting his presence be known  the court was dark and sleepy in no respect as if a bridegroom were about to arrive  while pausing he distinctly heard the tread of a horse upon the track behind him and for a moment despaired of arriving in time here surely was reynard  pulling up closer to the densest tree at hand he waited and found he had retreated nothing too soon for the second rider avoided the gravel also and passed quite close to him  in the profile he recognized young phelipson  before tupcombe could think what to do phelipson had gone on but not to the door of the house  swerving to the left he passed round to the east angle where as tupcombe knew were situated bettys apartments dismounting he left the horse tethered to a hanging bough and walked on to the house  suddenly his eye caught sight of an object which explained the position immediately  it was a ladder stretching from beneath the trees which there came pretty close to the house up to a firstfloor windowone which lighted miss bettys rooms  yes it was bettys chamber he knew every room in the house well  the young horseman who had passed him having evidently left his steed somewhere under the trees also was perceptible at the top of the ladder immediately outside bettys window  while tupcombe watched a cloaked female figure stepped timidly over the sill and the two cautiously descended one before the other the young mans arms enclosing the young woman between his grasp of the ladder so that she could not fall  as soon as they reached the bottom young phelipson quickly removed the ladder and hid it under the bushes  the pair disappeared till in a few minutes tupcombe could discern a horse emerging from a remoter part of the umbrage  the horse carried double the girl being on a pillion behind her lover  tupcombe hardly knew what to do or think yet though this was not exactly the kind of flight that had been intended she had certainly escaped  he went back to his own animal and rode round to the servants door where he delivered the letter for mrs dornell  to leave a verbal message for betty was now impossible  the court servants desired him to stay over the night but he would not do so desiring to get back to the squire as soon as possible and tell what he had seen  whether he ought not to have intercepted the young people and carried off betty himself to her father he did not know however it was too late to think of that now and without wetting his lips or swallowing a crumb tupcombe turned his back upon kingshintock court  it was not till he had advanced a considerable distance on his way homeward that halting under the lantern of a roadsideinn while the horse was watered there came a traveller from the opposite direction in a hired coach the lantern lit the strangers face as he passed along and dropped into the shade  tupcombe exulted for the moment though he could hardly have justified his exultation  the belated traveller was reynard and another had stepped in before him  you may now be willing to know of the fortunes of miss betty  left much to herself through the intervening days she had ample time to brood over her desperate attempt at the stratagem of infectionthwarted apparently by her mothers promptitude  in what other way to gain time she could not think  thus drew on the day and the hour of the evening on which her husband was expected to announce himself  at some period after dark when she could not tell a tap at the window twice and thrice repeated became audible  it caused her to start up for the only visitant in her mind was the one whose advances she had so feared as to risk health and life to repel them  she crept to the window and heard a whisper without  it is icharley said the voice  bettys face fired with excitement  she had latterly begun to doubt her admirers staunchness fancying his love to be going off in mere attentions which neither committed him nor herself very deeply  she opened the window saying in a joyous whisper oh charley i thought you had deserted me quite  he assured her he had not done that and that he had a horse in waiting if she would ride off with him  you must come quickly he said for reynards on the way  to throw a cloak round herself was the work of a moment and assuring herself that her door was locked against a surprise she climbed over the windowsill and descended with him as we have seen  her mother meanwhile having received tupcombes note found the news of her husbands illness so serious as to displace her thoughts of the coming soninlaw and she hastened to tell her daughter of the squires dangerous condition thinking it might be desirable to take her to her fathers bedside  on trying the door of the girls room she found it still locked  mrs dornell called but there was no answer  full of misgivings she privately fetched the old housesteward and bade him burst open the dooran order by no means easy to execute the joinery of the court being massively constructed  however the lock sprang open at last and she entered bettys chamber only to find the window unfastened and the bird flown  for a moment mrs dornell was staggered  then it occurred to her that betty might have privately obtained from tupcombe the news of her fathers serious illness and fearing she might be kept back to meet her husband have gone off with that obstinate and biassed servitor to falls park  the more she thought it over the more probable did the supposition appear and binding her own headman to secrecy as to bettys movements whether as she conjectured or otherwise mrs dornell herself prepared to set out  she had no suspicion how seriously her husbands malady had been aggravated by his ride to bristol and thought more of bettys affairs than of her own  that bettys husband should arrive by some other road tonight and find neither wife nor motherinlaw to receive him and no explanation of their absence was possible but never forgetting chances mrs dornell as she journeyed kept her eyes fixed upon the highway on the offside where before she had reached the town of ivell the hired coach containing stephen reynard flashed into the lamplight of her own carriage  mrs dornells coachman pulled up in obedience to a direction she had given him at starting the other coach was hailed a few words passed and reynard alighted and came to mrs dornells carriagewindow  come inside says she  i want to speak privately to you  why are you so late  one hindrance and another says he  i meant to be at the court by eight at latest  my gratitude for your letter  i hope  you must not try to see betty yet said she  there be far other and newer reasons against your seeing her now than there were when i wrote  the circumstances were such that mrs dornell could not possibly conceal them entirely nothing short of knowing some of the facts would prevent his blindly acting in a manner which might be fatal to the future moreover there are times when deeper intriguers than mrs dornell feel that they must let out a few truths if only in selfindulgence  so she told so much of recent surprises as that bettys heart had been attracted by another image than his and that his insisting on visiting her now might drive the girl to desperation  betty has in fact rushed off to her father to avoid you she said  but if you wait she will soon forget this young man and you will have nothing to fear  as a woman and a mother she could go no further and bettys desperate attempt to infect herself the week before as a means of repelling him together with the alarming possibility that after all she had not gone to her father but to her lover was not revealed  well sighed the diplomatist in a tone unexpectedly quiet such things have been known before  after all she may prefer me to him some day when she reflects how very differently i might have acted than i am going to act towards her  but ill say no more about that now  i can have a bed at your house for tonight  tonight certainly  and you leave tomorrow morning early  she spoke anxiously for on no account did she wish him to make further discoveries  my husband is so seriously ill she continued that my absence and bettys on your arrival is naturally accounted for  he promised to leave early and to write to her soon  and when i think the time is ripe he said ill write to her  i may have something to tell her that will bring her to graciousness  it was about one oclock in the morning when mrs dornell reached falls park  a double blow awaited her there  betty had not arrived her flight had been elsewhither and her stricken mother divined with whom she ascended to the bedside of her husband where to her concern she found that the physician had given up all hope  the squire was sinking and his extreme weakness had almost changed his character except in the particular that his old obstinacy sustained him in a refusal to see a clergyman  he shed tears at the least word and sobbed at the sight of his wife  he asked for betty and it was with a heavy heart that mrs dornell told him that the girl had not accompanied her  he is not keeping her away  no no  he is going backhe is not coming to her for some time  then what is detaining hercruel neglectful maid  no no thomas she is she could not come  hows that  somehow the solemnity of these last moments of his gave him inquisitorial power and the too cold wife could not conceal from him the flight which had taken place from kingshintock that night  to her amazement the effect upon him was electrical  whatbettya trump after all  hurrah  shes her fathers own maid shes game  she knew he was her fathers own choice  she vowed that my man should win  well done bethaw haw  hurrah  he had raised himself in bed by starts as he spoke and now fell back exhausted  he never uttered another word and died before the dawn people said there had not been such an ungenteel death in a good county family for years        now i will go back to the time of bettys riding off on the pillion behind her lover  they left the park by an obscure gate to the east and presently found themselves in the lonely and solitary length of the old roman road now called longash lane  by this time they were rather alarmed at their own performance for they were both young and inexperienced  hence they proceeded almost in silence till they came to a mean roadside inn which was not yet closed when betty who had held on to him with much misgiving all this while felt dreadfully unwell and said she thought she would like to get down  they accordingly dismounted from the jaded animal that had brought them and were shown into a small dark parlour where they stood side by side awkwardly like the fugitives they were  a light was brought and when they were left alone betty threw off the cloak which had enveloped her no sooner did young phelipson see her face than he uttered an alarmed exclamation  why lord lord you are sickening for the smallpox he cried  ohi forgot faltered betty  and then she informed him that on hearing of her husbands approach the week before in a desperate attempt to keep him from her side she had tried to imbibe the infectionan act which till this moment she had supposed to have been ineffectual imagining her feverishness to be the result of her excitement  the effect of this discovery upon young phelipson was overwhelming betterseasoned men than he would not have been proof against it and he was only a little over her own age  and youve been holding on to me he said  and suppose you get worse and we both have it what shall we do  wont you be a fright in a month or two poor poor betty  in his horror he attempted to laugh but the laugh ended in a weakly giggle  she was more woman than girl by this time and realized his feeling  whatin trying to keep off him i keep off you she said miserably do you hate me because i am going to be ugly and ill  ohno no he said soothingly  but ii am thinking if it is quite right for us to do this  you see dear betty if you was not married it would be different  you are not in honour married to him weve often said still you are his by law and you cant be mine whilst hes alive and with this terrible sickness coming on perhaps you had better let me take you back andclimb in at the window again  is this your love said betty reproachfully  oh if you was sickening for the plague itself and going to be as ugly as the ooser in the churchvestry i wouldnt  no no you mistake upon my soul  but betty with a swollen heart had rewrapped herself and gone out of the door  the horse was still standing there  she mounted by the help of the uppingstock and when he had followed her she said do not come near me charley but please lead the horse so that if youve not caught anything already youll not catch it going back  after all what keeps off you may keep off him  now onward  he did not resist her command and back they went by the way they had come betty shedding bitter tears at the retribution she had already brought upon herself for though she had reproached phelipson she was staunch enough not to blame him in her secret heart for showing that his love was only skindeep  the horse was stopped in the plantation and they walked silently to the lawn reaching the bushes wherein the ladder still lay  will you put it up for me she asked mournfully  he reerected the ladder without a word but when she approached to ascend he said goodbye betty  goodbye said she and involuntarily turned her face towards his  he hung back from imprinting the expected kiss at which betty started as if she had received a poignant wound  she moved away so suddenly that he hardly had time to follow her up the ladder to prevent her falling  tell your mother to get the doctor at once he said anxiously  she stepped in without looking behind he descended withdrew the ladder and went away  alone in her chamber betty flung herself upon her face on the bed and burst into shaking sobs  yet she would not admit to herself that her lovers conduct was unreasonable only that her rash act of the previous week had been wrong  no one had heard her enter and she was too worn out in body and mind to think or care about medical aid  in an hour or so she felt yet more unwell positively ill and nobody coming to her at the usual bedtime she looked towards the door  marks of the lock having been forced were visible and this made her chary of summoning a servant she opened the door cautiously and sallied forth downstairs  in the diningparlour as it was called the now sick and sorry betty was startled to see at that late hour not her mother but a man sitting calmly finishing his supper  there was no servant in the room  he turned and she recognized her husband  wheres my mamma she demanded without preface  gone to your fathers  is that  he stopped aghast  yes sir  this spotted object is your wife  ive done it because i dont want you to come near me  he was sixteen years her senior old enough to be compassionate  my poor child you must get to bed directly  dont be afraid of meill carry you upstairs and send for a doctor instantly  ah you dont know what i am she cried  i had a lover once but now hes gone  twasnt i who deserted him  he has deserted me because i am ill he wouldnt kiss me though i wanted him to  wouldnt he  then he was a very poor slacktwisted sort of fellow betty ive never kissed you since you stood beside me as my little wife twelve years and a half old  may i kiss you now  though betty by no means desired his kisses she had enough of the spirit of cunigonde in schillers ballad to test his daring  if you have courage to venture yes sir said she  but you may die for it mind  he came up to her and imprinted a deliberate kiss full upon her mouth saying may many others follow  she shook her head and hastily withdrew though secretly pleased at his hardihood  the excitement had supported her for the few minutes she had passed in his presence and she could hardly drag herself back to her room  her husband summoned the servants and sending them to her assistance went off himself for a doctor  the next morning reynard waited at the court till he had learnt from the medical man that bettys attack promised to be a very light oneor as it was expressed very fine and in taking his leave sent up a note to her  now i must be gone  i promised your mother i would not see you yet and she may be angerd if she finds me here  promise to see me as soon as you are well  he was of all men then living one of the best able to cope with such an untimely situation as this  a contriving sagacious gentlemannered man a philosopher who saw that the only constant attribute of life is change he held that as long as she lives there is nothing finite in the most impassioned attitude a woman may take up  in twelve months his girlwifes recent infatuation might be as distasteful to her mind as it was now to his own  in a few years her very flesh would changeso said the scientificher spirit so much more ephemeral was capable of changing in one  betty was his and it became a mere question of means how to effect that change  during the day mrs dornell having closed her husbands eyes returned to the court  she was truly relieved to find betty there even though on a bed of sickness  the disease ran its course and in due time betty became convalescent without having suffered deeply for her rashness one little speck beneath her ear and one beneath her chin being all the marks she retained  the squires body was not brought back to kingshintock  where he was born and where he had lived before wedding his sue there he had wished to be buried  no sooner had she lost him than mrs dornell like certain other wives though she had never shown any great affection for him while he lived awoke suddenly to his many virtues and zealously embraced his opinion about delaying bettys union with her husband which she had formerly combated strenuously  poor man how right he was and how wrong was i  eighteen was certainly the lowest age at which mr reynard should claim her childnay it was too low  far too low  so desirous was she of honouring her lamented husbands sentiments in this respect that she wrote to her soninlaw suggesting that partly on account of bettys sorrow for her fathers loss and out of consideration for his known wishes for delay betty should not be taken from her till her nineteenth birthday  however much or little stephen reynard might have been to blame in his marriage the patient man now almost deserved to be pitied  first bettys skittishness now her mothers remorseful volteface it was enough to exasperate anybody and he wrote to the widow in a tone which led to a little coolness between those hitherto firm friends  however knowing that he had a wife not to claim but to win and that young phelipson had been packed off to sea by his parents stephen was complaisant to a degree returning to london and holding quite aloof from betty and her mother who remained for the present in the country in town he had a mild visitation of the distemper he had taken from betty and in writing to her he took care not to dwell upon its mildness it was now that betty began to pity him for what she had inflicted upon him by the kiss and her correspondence acquired a distinct flavour of kindness thenceforward  owing to his rebuffs reynard had grown to be truly in love with betty in his mild placid durable wayin that way which perhaps upon the whole tends most generally to the womans comfort under the institution of marriage if not particularly to her ecstasy  mrs dornells exaggeration of her husbands wish for delay in their living together was inconvenient but he would not openly infringe it  he wrote tenderly to betty and soon announced that he had a little surprise in store for her the secret was that the king had been graciously pleased to inform him privately through a relation that his majesty was about to offer him a barony  would she like the title to be ivell  moreover he had reason for knowing that in a few years the dignity would be raised to that of an earl for which creation he thought the title of wessex would be eminently suitable considering the position of much of their property as lady ivell therefore and future countess of wessex he should beg leave to offer her his heart a third time  he did not add as he might have added how greatly the consideration of the enormous estates at kingshintock and elsewhere which betty would inherit and her children after her had conduced to this desirable honour  whether the impending titles had really any effect upon bettys regard for him i cannot state for she was one of those close characters who never let their minds be known upon anything  that such honour was absolutely unexpected by her from such a quarter is however certain and she could not deny that stephen had shown her kindness forbearance even magnanimity had forgiven her for an errant passion which he might with some reason have denounced notwithstanding her cruel position as a child entrapped into marriage ere able to understand its bearings  her mother in her grief and remorse for the loveless life she had led with her rough though openhearted husband made now a creed of his merest whim and continued to insist that out of respect to his known desire her soninlaw should not reside with betty till the girls father had been dead a year at least at which time the girl would still be under nineteen  letters must suffice for stephen till then  it is rather long for him to wait betty hesitatingly said one day  what said her mother  from you not to respect your dear father  of course it is quite proper said betty hastily  i dont gainsay it i was but thinking thatthat  in the long slow months of the stipulated interval her mother tended and trained betty carefully for her duties  fully awake now to the many virtues of her dear departed one she among other acts of pious devotion to his memory rebuilt the church of kingshintock village and established valuable charities in all the villages of that name as far as to littlehintock several miles eastward  in superintending these works particularly that of the churchbuilding her daughter betty was her constant companion and the incidents of their execution were doubtless not without a soothing effect upon the young creatures heart  she had sprung from girl to woman by a sudden bound and few would have recognized in the thoughtful face of betty now the same person who the year before had seemed to have absolutely no idea whatever of responsibility moral or other  time passed thus till the squire had been nearly a year in his vault and mrs dornell was duly asked by letter by the patient reynard if she were willing for him to come soon  he did not wish to take betty away if her mothers sense of loneliness would be too great but would willingly live at kingshintock awhile with them  before the widow had replied to this communication she one day happened to observe betty walking on the south terrace in the full sunlight without hat or mantle and was struck by her childs figure  mrs dornell called her in and said suddenly have you seen your husband since the time of your poor fathers death  wellyes mamma says betty colouring  whatagainst my wishes and those of your dear father  i am shocked at your disobedience  but my father said eighteen maam and you made it much longer  why of courseout of consideration for you  when have ye seen him  well stammered betty in the course of his letters to me he said that i belonged to him and if nobody knew that we met it would make no difference  and that i need not hurt your feelings by telling you  well  so i went to casterbridge that time you went to london about five months ago  and met him there  when did you come back  dear mamma it grew very late and he said it was safer not to go back till next day as the roads were bad and as you were away from home  i dont want to hear any more  this is your respect for your fathers memory groaned the widow  when did you meet him again  ohnot for more than a fortnight  a fortnight  how many times have ye seen him altogether  im sure mamma ive not seen him altogether a dozen times  a dozen  and eighteen and a half years old barely  twice we met by accident pleaded betty  once at abbotscernel and another time at the red lion melchester  o thou deceitful girl cried mrs dornell  an accident took you to the red lion whilst i was staying at the white hart  i rememberyou came in at twelve oclock at night and said youd been to see the cathedral by the light o the moon  my everhonoured mamma so i had  i only went to the red lion with him afterwards  oh betty betty  that my child should have deceived me even in my widowed days  but my dearest mamma you made me marry him says betty with spirit and of course ive to obey him more than you now  mrs dornell sighed  all i have to say is that youd better get your husband to join you as soon as possible she remarked  to go on playing the maiden like thisim ashamed to see you  she wrote instantly to stephen reynard i wash my hands of the whole matter as between you two though i should advise you to openly join each other as soon as you canif you wish to avoid scandal  he came though not till the promised title had been granted and he could call betty archly my lady  people said in after years that she and her husband were very happy however that may be they had a numerous family and she became in due course first countess of wessex as he had foretold  the little white frock in which she had been married to him at the tender age of twelve was carefully preserved among the relics at kingshintock court where it may still be seen by the curiousa yellowing pathetic testimony to the small count taken of the happiness of an innocent child in the social strategy of those days which might have led but providentially did not lead to great unhappiness  when the earl died betty wrote him an epitaph in which she described him as the best of husbands fathers and friends and called herself his disconsolate widow  such is woman or rather not to give offence by so sweeping an assertion such was betty dornell        it was at a meeting of one of the wessex field and antiquarian clubs that the foregoing story partly told partly read from a manuscript was made to do duty for the regulation papers on deformed butterflies fossil ox horns prehistoric dungmixens and such like that usually occupied the more serious attention of the members  this club was of an inclusive and intersocial character to a degree indeed remarkable for the part of england in which it had its beingdear delightful wessex whose statuesque dynasties are even now only just beginning to feel the shaking of the new and strange spirit without like that which entered the lonely valley of ezekiels vision and made the dry bones move where the honest squires tradesmen parsons clerks and people still praise the lord with one voice for his best of all possible worlds  the present meeting which was to extend over two days had opened its proceedings at the museum of the town whose buildings and environs were to be visited by the members  lunch had ended and the afternoon excursion had been about to be undertaken when the rain came down in an obstinate spatter which revealed no sign of cessation  as the members waited they grew chilly although it was only autumn and a fire was lighted which threw a cheerful shine upon the varnished skulls urns penates tesserae costumes coats of mail weapons and missals animated the fossilized ichthyosaurus and iguanodon while the dead eyes of the stuffed birdsthose neverabsent familiars in such collections though murdered to extinction out of doorsflashed as they had flashed to the rising sun above the neighbouring moors on the fatal morning when the trigger was pulled which ended their little flight  it was then that the historian produced his manuscript which he had prepared he said with a view to publication  his delivery of the story having concluded as aforesaid the speaker expressed his hope that the constraint of the weather and the paucity of more scientific papers would excuse any inappropriateness in his subject  several members observed that a stormbound club could not presume to be selective and they were all very much obliged to him for such a curious chapter from the domestic histories of the county  the president looked gloomily from the window at the descending rain and broke a short silence by saying that though the club had met there seemed little probability of its being able to visit the objects of interest set down among the agenda  the treasurer observed that they had at least a roof over their heads and they had also a second day before them  a sentimental member leaning back in his chair declared that he was in no hurry to go out and that nothing would please him so much as another county story with or without manuscript  the colonel added that the subject should be a lady like the former to which a gentleman known as the spark said hear hear  though these had spoken in jest a rural dean who was present observed blandly that there was no lack of materials  many indeed were the legends and traditions of gentle and noble dames renowned in times past in that part of england whose actions and passions were now but for mens memories buried under the brief inscription on a tomb or an entry of dates in a dry pedigree  another member an old surgeon a somewhat grim though sociable personage was quite of the speakers opinion and felt quite sure that the memory of the reverend gentleman must abound with such curious tales of fair dames of their loves and hates their joys and their misfortunes their beauty and their fate  the parson a trifle confused retorted that their friend the surgeon the son of a surgeon seemed to him as a man who had seen much and heard more during the long course of his own and his fathers practice the member of all others most likely to be acquainted with such lore  the bookworm the colonel the historian the vicepresident the churchwarden the two curates the gentlemantradesman the sentimental member the crimson maltster the quiet gentleman the man of family the spark and several others quite agreed and begged that he would recall something of the kind  the old surgeon said that though a meeting of the midwessex field and antiquarian club was the last place at which he should have expected to be called upon in this way he had no objection and the parson said he would come next  the surgeon then reflected and decided to relate the history of a lady named barbara who lived towards the end of the last century apologizing for his tale as being perhaps a little too professional  the crimson maltster winked to the spark at hearing the nature of the apology and the surgeon began     dame the secondbarbara of the house of grebe by the old surgeon   it was apparently an idea rather than a passion that inspired lord uplandtowers resolve to win her  nobody ever knew when he formed it or whence he got his assurance of success in the face of her manifest dislike of him  possibly not until after that first important act of her life which i shall presently mention  his matured and cynical doggedness at the age of nineteen when impulse mostly rules calculation was remarkable and might have owed its existence as much to his succession to the earldom and its accompanying local honours in childhood as to the family character an elevation which jerked him into maturity so to speak without his having known adolescence  he had only reached his twelfth year when his father the fourth earl died after a course of the bath waters  nevertheless the family character had a great deal to do with it determination was hereditary in the bearers of that escutcheon sometimes for good sometimes for evil  the seats of the two families were about ten miles apart the way between them lying along the now old then new turnpikeroad connecting havenpool and warborne with the city of melchester a road which though only a branch from what was known as the great western highway is probably even at present as it has been for the last hundred years one of the finest examples of a macadamized turnpiketrack that can be found in england  the mansion of the earl as well as that of his neighbour barbaras father stood back about a mile from the highway with which each was connected by an ordinary drive and lodge  it was along this particular highway that the young earl drove on a certain evening at christmastide some twenty years before the end of the last century to attend a ball at chene manor the home of barbara and her parents sir john and lady grebe  sir johns was a baronetcy created a few years before the breaking out of the civil war and his lands were even more extensive than those of lord uplandtowers himself comprising this manor of chene another on the coast near half the hundred of cockdene and wellenclosed lands in several other parishes notably warborne and those contiguous  at this time barbara was barely seventeen and the ball is the first occasion on which we have any tradition of lord uplandtowers attempting tender relations with her it was early enough god knows  an intimate friendone of the drenkhardsis said to have dined with him that day and lord uplandtowers had for a wonder communicated to his guest the secret design of his heart  youll never get hersure youll never get her this friend had said at parting  shes not drawn to your lordship by love and as for thought of a good match why theres no more calculation in her than in a bird  well see said lord uplandtowers impassively  he no doubt thought of his friends forecast as he travelled along the highway in his chariot but the sculptural repose of his profile against the vanishing daylight on his right hand would have shown his friend that the earls equanimity was undisturbed  he reached the solitary wayside tavern called lornton innthe rendezvous of many a daring poacher for operations in the adjoining forest and he might have observed if he had taken the trouble a strange postchaise standing in the haltingspace before the inn  he duly sped past it and halfanhour after through the little town of warborne  onward a mile farther was the house of his entertainer  at this date it was an imposing edificeor rather congeries of edificesas extensive as the residence of the earl himself though far less regular  one wing showed extreme antiquity having huge chimneys whose substructures projected from the external walls like towers and a kitchen of vast dimensions in which it was said breakfasts had been cooked for john of gaunt  whilst he was yet in the forecourt he could hear the rhythm of french horns and clarionets the favourite instruments of those days at such entertainments  entering the long parlour in which the dance had just been opened by lady grebe with a minuetit being now seven oclock according to the traditionhe was received with a welcome befitting his rank and looked round for barbara  she was not dancing and seemed to be preoccupiedalmost indeed as though she had been waiting for him barbara at this time was a good and pretty girl who never spoke ill of any one and hated other pretty women the very least possible  she did not refuse him for the countrydance which followed and soon after was his partner in a second  the evening wore on and the horns and clarionets tootled merrily barbara evinced towards her lover neither distinct preference nor aversion but old eyes would have seen that she pondered something however after supper she pleaded a headache and disappeared  to pass the time of her absence lord uplandtowers went into a little room adjoining the long gallery where some elderly ones were sitting by the firefor he had a phlegmatic dislike of dancing for its own sakeand lifting the windowcurtains he looked out of the window into the park and wood dark now as a cavern  some of the guests appeared to be leaving even so soon as this two lights showing themselves as turning away from the door and sinking to nothing in the distance  his hostess put her head into the room to look for partners for the ladies and lord uplandtowers came out  lady grebe informed him that barbara had not returned to the ballroom she had gone to bed in sheer necessity  she has been so excited over the ball all day her mother continued that i feared she would be worn out early    but sure lord uplandtowers you wont be leaving yet  he said that it was near twelve oclock and that some had already left  i protest nobody has gone yet said lady grebe  to humour her he stayed till midnight and then set out  he had made no progress in his suit but he had assured himself that barbara gave no other guest the preference and nearly everybody in the neighbourhood was there  tis only a matter of time said the calm young philosopher  the next morning he lay till near ten oclock and he had only just come out upon the head of the staircase when he heard hoofs upon the gravel without in a few moments the door had been opened and sir john grebe met him in the hall as he set foot on the lowest stair  my lordwheres barbaramy daughter  even the earl of uplandtowers could not repress amazement  whats the matter my dear sir john says he  the news was startling indeed  from the baronets disjointed explanation lord uplandtowers gathered that after his own and the other guests departure sir john and lady grebe had gone to rest without seeing any more of barbara it being understood by them that she had retired to bed when she sent word to say that she could not join the dancers again before then she had told her maid that she would dispense with her services for this night and there was evidence to show that the young lady had never lain down at all the bed remaining unpressed circumstances seemed to prove that the deceitful girl had feigned indisposition to get an excuse for leaving the ballroom and that she had left the house within ten minutes presumably during the first dance after supper  i saw her go said lord uplandtowers  the devil you did says sir john  yes  and he mentioned the retreating carriagelights and how he was assured by lady grebe that no guest had departed  surely that was it said the father  but shes not gone alone dye know  ahwho is the young man  i can ony guess  my worst fear is my most likely guess  ill say no more  i thoughtyet i would not believeit possible that you was the sinner  would that you had been  but tis tother tis tother by g i must een up and after em  whom do you suspect  sir john would not give a name and stultified rather than agitated lord uplandtowers accompanied him back to chene  he again asked upon whom were the baronets suspicions directed and the impulsive sir john was no match for the insistence of uplandtowers  he said at length i fear tis edmond willowes  whos he  a young fellow of shottsfordforuma widowwomans son the other told him and explained that willowess father or grandfather was the last of the old glasspainters in that place where as you may know the art lingered on when it had died out in every other part of england  by g thats badmighty bad said lord uplandtowers throwing himself back in the chaise in frigid despair  they despatched emissaries in all directions one by the melchester road another by shottsfordforum another coastwards  but the lovers had a tenhours start and it was apparent that sound judgment had been exercised in choosing as their time of flight the particular night when the movements of a strange carriage would not be noticed either in the park or on the neighbouring highway owing to the general press of vehicles  the chaise which had been seen waiting at lornton inn was no doubt the one they had escaped in and the pair of heads which had planned so cleverly thus far had probably contrived marriage ere now  the fears of her parents were realized  a letter sent by special messenger from barbara on the evening of that day briefly informed them that her lover and herself were on the way to london and before this communication reached her home they would be united as husband and wife she had taken this extreme step because she loved her dear edmond as she could love no other man and because she had seen closing round her the doom of marriage with lord uplandtowers unless she put that threatened fate out of possibility by doing as she had done  she had well considered the step beforehand and was prepared to live like any other countrytownsmans wife if her father repudiated her for her action  d her said lord uplandtowers as he drove homeward that night  d her for a foolwhich shows the kind of love he bore her  well sir john had already started in pursuit of them as a matter of duty driving like a wild man to melchester and thence by the direct highway to the capital  but he soon saw that he was acting to no purpose and by and by discovering that the marriage had actually taken place he forebore all attempts to unearth them in the city and returned and sat down with his lady to digest the event as best they could  to proceed against this willowes for the abduction of our heiress was possibly in their power yet when they considered the now unalterable facts they refrained from violent retribution  some six weeks passed during which time barbaras parents though they keenly felt her loss held no communication with the truant either for reproach or condonation  they continued to think of the disgrace she had brought upon herself for though the young man was an honest fellow and the son of an honest father the latter had died so early and his widow had had such struggles to maintain herself that the son was very imperfectly educated  moreover his blood was as far as they knew of no distinction whatever whilst hers through her mother was compounded of the best juices of ancient baronial distillation containing tinctures of maundeville and mohun and syward and peverell and culliford and talbot and plantagenet and york and lancaster and god knows what besides which it was a thousand pities to throw away  the father and mother sat by the fireplace that was spanned by the four centred arch bearing the family shields on its haunches and groaned aloudthe lady more than sir john  to think this should have come upon us in our old age said he  speak for yourself she snapped through her sobs  i am only oneand forty    why didnt ye ride faster and overtake em  in the meantime the young married lovers caring no more about their blood than about ditchwater were intensely happyhappy that is in the descending scale which as we all know heaven in its wisdom has ordained for such rash cases that is to say the first week they were in the seventh heaven the second in the sixth the third week temperate the fourth reflective and so on a lovers heart after possession being comparable to the earth in its geologic stages as described to us sometimes by our worthy president first a hot coal then a warm one then a cooling cinder then chillythe simile shall be pursued no further  the long and the short of it was that one day a letter sealed with their daughters own little seal came into sir john and lady grebes hands and on opening it they found it to contain an appeal from the young couple to sir john to forgive them for what they had done and they would fall on their naked knees and be most dutiful children for evermore  then sir john and his lady sat down again by the fireplace with the four centred arch and consulted and reread the letter  sir john grebe if the truth must be told loved his daughters happiness far more poor man than he loved his name and lineage he recalled to his mind all her little ways gave vent to a sigh and by this time acclimatized to the idea of the marriage said that what was done could not be undone and that he supposed they must not be too harsh with her  perhaps barbara and her husband were in actual need and how could they let their only child starve  a slight consolation had come to them in an unexpected manner  they had been credibly informed that an ancestor of plebeian willowes was once honoured with intermarriage with a scion of the aristocracy who had gone to the dogs  in short such is the foolishness of distinguished parents and sometimes of others also that they wrote that very day to the address barbara had given them informing her that she might return home and bring her husband with her they would not object to see him would not reproach her and would endeavour to welcome both and to discuss with them what could best be arranged for their future  in three or four days a rather shabby postchaise drew up at the door of chene manorhouse at sound of which the tenderhearted baronet and his wife ran out as if to welcome a prince and princess of the blood  they were overjoyed to see their spoilt child return safe and soundthough she was only mrs willowes wife of edmond willowes of nowhere  barbara burst into penitential tears and both husband and wife were contrite enough as well they might be considering that they had not a guinea to call their own  when the four had calmed themselves and not a word of chiding had been uttered to the pair they discussed the position soberly young willowes sitting in the background with great modesty till invited forward by lady grebe in no frigid tone  how handsome he is she said to herself  i dont wonder at barbaras craze for him  he was indeed one of the handsomest men who ever set his lips on a maids  a blue coat murrey waistcoat and breeches of drab set off a figure that could scarcely be surpassed  he had large dark eyes anxious now as they glanced from barbara to her parents and tenderly back again to her observing whom even now in her trepidation one could see why the sang froid of lord uplandtowers had been raised to more than lukewarmness  her fair young face according to the tale handed down by old women looked out from under a gray conical hat trimmed with white ostrichfeathers and her little toes peeped from a buff petticoat worn under a puce gown  her features were not regular they were almost infantine as you may see from miniatures in possession of the family her mouth showing much sensitiveness and one could be sure that her faults would not lie on the side of bad temper unless for urgent reasons  well they discussed their state as became them and the desire of the young couple to gain the goodwill of those upon whom they were literally dependent for everything induced them to agree to any temporizing measure that was not too irksome  therefore having been nearly two months united they did not oppose sir johns proposal that he should furnish edmond willowes with funds sufficient for him to travel a year on the continent in the company of a tutor the young man undertaking to lend himself with the utmost diligence to the tutors instructions till he became polished outwardly and inwardly to the degree required in the husband of such a lady as barbara  he was to apply himself to the study of languages manners history society ruins and everything else that came under his eyes till he should return to take his place without blushing by barbaras side  and by that time said worthy sir john ill get my little place out at yewsholt ready for you and barbara to occupy on your return  the house is small and out of the way but it will do for a young couple for a while  if twere no bigger than a summerhouse it would do says barbara  if twere no bigger than a sedanchair says willowes  and the more lonely the better  we can put up with the loneliness said barbara with less zest  some friends will come no doubt  all this being laid down a travelled tutor was called ina man of many gifts and great experienceand on a fine morning away tutor and pupil went  a great reason urged against barbara accompanying her youthful husband was that his attentions to her would naturally be such as to prevent his zealously applying every hour of his time to learning and seeingan argument of wise prescience and unanswerable  regular days for letterwriting were fixed barbara and her edmond exchanged their last kisses at the door and the chaise swept under the archway into the drive  he wrote to her from le havre as soon as he reached that port which was not for seven days on account of adverse winds he wrote from rouen and from paris described to her his sight of the king and court at versailles and the wonderful marblework and mirrors in that palace wrote next from lyons then after a comparatively long interval from turin narrating his fearful adventures in crossing mont cenis on mules and how he was overtaken with a terrific snowstorm which had wellnigh been the end of him and his tutor and his guides  then he wrote glowingly of italy and barbara could see the development of her husbands mind reflected in his letters month by month and she much admired the forethought of her father in suggesting this education for edmond  yet she sighed sometimesher husband being no longer in evidence to fortify her in her choice of himand timidly dreaded what mortifications might be in store for her by reason of this mesalliance she went out very little for on the one or two occasions on which she had shown herself to former friends she noticed a distinct difference in their manner as though they should say ah my happy swains wife youre caught  edmonds letters were as affectionate as ever even more affectionate after a while than hers were to him  barbara observed this growing coolness in herself and like a good and honest lady was horrified and grieved since her only wish was to act faithfully and uprightly  it troubled her so much that she prayed for a warmer heart and at last wrote to her husband to beg him now that he was in the land of art to send her his portrait ever so small that she might look at it all day and every day and never for a moment forget his features  willowes was nothing loth and replied that he would do more than she wished he had made friends with a sculptor in pisa who was much interested in him and his history and he had commissioned this artist to make a bust of himself in marble which when finished he would send her what barbara had wanted was something immediate but she expressed no objection to the delay and in his next communication edmund told her that the sculptor of his own choice had decided to increase the bust to a fulllength statue so anxious was he to get a specimen of his skill introduced to the notice of the english aristocracy  it was progressing well and rapidly  meanwhile barbaras attention began to be occupied at home with yewsholt lodge the house that her kindhearted father was preparing for her residence when her husband returned  it was a small place on the plan of a large onea cottage built in the form of a mansion having a central hall with a wooden gallery running round it and rooms no bigger than closets to follow this introduction  it stood on a slope so solitary and surrounded by trees so dense that the birds who inhabited the boughs sang at strange hours as if they hardly could distinguish night from day  during the progress of repairs at this bower barbara frequently visited it  though so secluded by the dense growth it was near the high road and one day while looking over the fence she saw lord uplandtowers riding past  he saluted her courteously yet with mechanical stiffness and did not halt  barbara went home and continued to pray that she might never cease to love her husband  after that she sickened and did not come out of doors again for a long time  the year of education had extended to fourteen months and the house was in order for edmonds return to take up his abode there with barbara when instead of the accustomed letter for her came one to sir john grebe in the handwriting of the said tutor informing him of a terrible catastrophe that had occurred to them at venice  mr willowes and himself had attended the theatre one night during the carnival of the preceding week to witness the italian comedy when owing to the carelessness of one of the candlesnuffers the theatre had caught fire and been burnt to the ground  few persons had lost their lives owing to the superhuman exertions of some of the audience in getting out the senseless sufferers and among them all he who had risked his own life the most heroically was mr willowes  in reentering for the fifth time to save his fellow creatures some fiery beams had fallen upon him and he had been given up for lost  he was however by the blessing of providence recovered with the life still in him though he was fearfully burnt and by almost a miracle he seemed likely to survive his constitution being wondrously sound  he was of course unable to write but he was receiving the attention of several skilful surgeons  further report would be made by the next mail or by private hand  the tutor said nothing in detail of poor willowess sufferings but as soon as the news was broken to barbara she realized how intense they must have been and her immediate instinct was to rush to his side though on consideration the journey seemed impossible to her  her health was by no means what it had been and to post across europe at that season of the year or to traverse the bay of biscay in a sailingcraft was an undertaking that would hardly be justified by the result  but she was anxious to go till on reading to the end of the letter her husbands tutor was found to hint very strongly against such a step if it should be contemplated this being also the opinion of the surgeons  and though willowess comrade refrained from giving his reasons they disclosed themselves plainly enough in the sequel  the truth was that the worst of the wounds resulting from the fire had occurred to his head and facethat handsome face which had won her heart from herand both the tutor and the surgeons knew that for a sensitive young woman to see him before his wounds had healed would cause more misery to her by the shock than happiness to him by her ministrations  lady grebe blurted out what sir john and barbara had thought but had had too much delicacy to express  sure tis mighty hard for you poor barbara that the one little gift he had to justify your rash choice of himhis wonderful good looksshould be taken away like this to leave ee no excuse at all for your conduct in the worlds eyes    well i wish youd married totherthat do i  and the lady sighed  hell soon get right again said her father soothingly  such remarks as the above were not often made but they were frequent enough to cause barbara an uneasy sense of selfstultification  she determined to hear them no longer and the house at yewsholt being ready and furnished she withdrew thither with her maids where for the first time she could feel mistress of a home that would be hers and her husbands exclusively when he came  after long weeks willowes had recovered sufficiently to be able to write himself and slowly and tenderly he enlightened her upon the full extent of his injuries  it was a mercy he said that he had not lost his sight entirely but he was thankful to say that he still retained full vision in one eye though the other was dark for ever  the sparing manner in which he meted out particulars of his condition told barbara how appalling had been his experience  he was grateful for her assurance that nothing could change her but feared she did not fully realize that he was so sadly disfigured as to make it doubtful if she would recognize him  however in spite of all his heart was as true to her as it ever had been  barbara saw from his anxiety how much lay behind  she replied that she submitted to the decrees of fate and would welcome him in any shape as soon as he could come  she told him of the pretty retreat in which she had taken up her abode pending their joint occupation of it and did not reveal how much she had sighed over the information that all his good looks were gone  still less did she say that she felt a certain strangeness in awaiting him the weeks they had lived together having been so short by comparison with the length of his absence  slowly drew on the time when willowes found himself well enough to come home  he landed at southampton and posted thence towards yewsholt barbara arranged to go out to meet him as far as lornton innthe spot between the forest and the chase at which he had waited for night on the evening of their elopement  thither she drove at the appointed hour in a little ponychaise presented her by her father on her birthday for her especial use in her new house which vehicle she sent back on arriving at the inn the plan agreed upon being that she should perform the return journey with her husband in his hired coach  there was not much accommodation for a lady at this wayside tavern but as it was a fine evening in early summer she did not mindwalking about outside and straining her eyes along the highway for the expected one but each cloud of dust that enlarged in the distance and drew near was found to disclose a conveyance other than his postchaise  barbara remained till the appointment was two hours passed and then began to fear that owing to some adverse wind in the channel he was not coming that night  while waiting she was conscious of a curious trepidation that was not entirely solicitude and did not amount to dread her tense state of incertitude bordered both on disappointment and on relief  she had lived six or seven weeks with an imperfectly educated yet handsome husband whom now she had not seen for seventeen months and who was so changed physically by an accident that she was assured she would hardly know him can we wonder at her compound state of mind  but her immediate difficulty was to get away from lornton inn for her situation was becoming embarrassing  like too many of barbaras actions this drive had been undertaken without much reflection  expecting to wait no more than a few minutes for her husband in his postchaise and to enter it with him she had not hesitated to isolate herself by sending back her own little vehicle  she now found that being so well known in this neighbourhood her excursion to meet her longabsent husband was exciting great interest  she was conscious that more eyes were watching her from the innwindows than met her own gaze  barbara had decided to get home by hiring whatever kind of conveyance the tavern afforded when straining her eyes for the last time over the now darkening highway she perceived yet another dustcloud drawing near  she paused a chariot ascended to the inn and would have passed had not its occupant caught sight of her standing expectantly  the horses were checked on the instant  you hereand alone my dear mrs willowes said lord uplandtowers whose carriage it was  she explained what had brought her into this lonely situation and as he was going in the direction of her own home she accepted his offer of a seat beside him  their conversation was embarrassed and fragmentary at first but when they had driven a mile or two she was surprised to find herself talking earnestly and warmly to him her impulsiveness was in truth but the natural consequence of her late existencea somewhat desolate one by reason of the strange marriage she had made and there is no more indiscreet mood than that of a woman surprised into talk who has long been imposing upon herself a policy of reserve  therefore her ingenuous heart rose with a bound into her throat when in response to his leading questions or rather hints she allowed her troubles to leak out of her  lord uplandtowers took her quite to her own door although he had driven three miles out of his way to do so and in handing her down she heard from him a whisper of stern reproach it need not have been thus if you had listened to me  she made no reply and went indoors  there as the evening wore away she regretted more and more that she had been so friendly with lord uplandtowers  but he had launched himself upon her so unexpectedly if she had only foreseen the meeting with him what a careful line of conduct she would have marked out  barbara broke into a perspiration of disquiet when she thought of her unreserve and in selfchastisement resolved to sit up till midnight on the bare chance of edmonds return directing that supper should be laid for him improbable as his arrival till the morrow was  the hours went past and there was dead silence in and round about yewsholt lodge except for the soughing of the trees till when it was near upon midnight she heard the noise of hoofs and wheels approaching the door  knowing that it could only be her husband barbara instantly went into the hall to meet him  yet she stood there not without a sensation of faintness so many were the changes since their parting and owing to her casual encounter with lord uplandtowers his voice and image still remained with her excluding edmond her husband from the inner circle of her impressions  but she went to the door and the next moment a figure stepped inside of which she knew the outline but little besides  her husband was attired in a flapping black cloak and slouched hat appearing altogether as a foreigner and not as the young english burgess who had left her side when he came forward into the light of the lamp she perceived with surprise and almost with fright that he wore a mask  at first she had not noticed thisthere being nothing in its colour which would lead a casual observer to think he was looking on anything but a real countenance  he must have seen her start of dismay at the unexpectedness of his appearance for he said hastily i did not mean to come in to you like thisi thought you would have been in bed  how good you are dear barbara  he put his arm round her but he did not attempt to kiss her  o edmondit is youit must be she said with clasped hands for though his figure and movement were almost enough to prove it and the tones were not unlike the old tones the enunciation was so altered as to seem that of a stranger  i am covered like this to hide myself from the curious eyes of the inn servants and others he said in a low voice  i will send back the carriage and join you in a moment  you are quite alone  quite  my companion stopped at southampton  the wheels of the postchaise rolled away as she entered the diningroom where the supper was spread and presently he rejoined her there  he had removed his cloak and hat but the mask was still retained and she could now see that it was of special make of some flexible material like silk coloured so as to represent flesh it joined naturally to the front hair and was otherwise cleverly executed  barbarayou look ill he said removing his glove and taking her hand  yesi have been ill said she  is this pretty little house ours  oyes  she was hardly conscious of her words for the hand he had ungloved in order to take hers was contorted and had one or two of its fingers missing while through the mask she discerned the twinkle of one eye only  i would give anything to kiss you dearest now at this moment he continued with mournful passionateness  but i cannotin this guise the servants are abed i suppose  yes said she  but i can call them  you will have some supper  he said he would have some but that it was not necessary to call anybody at that hour  thereupon they approached the table and sat down facing each other  despite barbaras scared state of mind it was forced upon her notice that her husband trembled as if he feared the impression he was producing or was about to produce as much as or more than she  he drew nearer and took her hand again  i had this mask made at venice he began in evident embarrassment  my darling barbaramy dearest wifedo you think youwill mind when i take it off  you will not dislike mewill you  o edmond of course i shall not mind said she  what has happened to you is our misfortune but i am prepared for it  are you sure you are prepared  o yes  you are my husband  you really feel quite confident that nothing external can affect you he said again in a voice rendered uncertain by his agitation  i think i amquite she answered faintly  he bent his head  i hope i hope you are he whispered  in the pause which followed the ticking of the clock in the hall seemed to grow loud and he turned a little aside to remove the mask  she breathlessly awaited the operation which was one of some tediousness watching him one moment averting her face the next and when it was done she shut her eyes at the hideous spectacle that was revealed  a quick spasm of horror had passed through her but though she quailed she forced herself to regard him anew repressing the cry that would naturally have escaped from her ashy lips  unable to look at him longer barbara sank down on the floor beside her chair covering her eyes  you cannot look at me he groaned in a hopeless way  i am too terrible an object even for you to bear  i knew it yet i hoped against it  oh this is a bitter fatecurse the skill of those venetian surgeons who saved me alive    look up barbara he continued beseechingly view me completely say you loathe me if you do loathe me and settle the case between us for ever  his unhappy wife pulled herself together for a desperate strain  he was her edmond he had done her no wrong he had suffered  a momentary devotion to him helped her and lifting her eyes as bidden she regarded this human remnant this ecorche a second time  but the sight was too much  she again involuntarily looked aside and shuddered  do you think you can get used to this he said  yes or no  can you bear such a thing of the charnelhouse near you  judge for yourself barbara  your adonis your matchless man has come to this  the poor lady stood beside him motionless save for the restlessness of her eyes  all her natural sentiments of affection and pity were driven clean out of her by a sort of panic she had just the same sense of dismay and fearfulness that she would have had in the presence of an apparition  she could nohow fancy this to be her chosen onethe man she had loved he was metamorphosed to a specimen of another species  i do not loathe you she said with trembling  but i am so horrifiedso overcome  let me recover myself  will you sup now  and while you do so may i go to my room toregain my old feeling for you  i will try if i may leave you awhile  yes i will try  without waiting for an answer from him and keeping her gaze carefully averted the frightened woman crept to the door and out of the room  she heard him sit down to the table as if to begin supper though heaven knows his appetite was slight enough after a reception which had confirmed his worst surmises  when barbara had ascended the stairs and arrived in her chamber she sank down and buried her face in the coverlet of the bed  thus she remained for some time  the bedchamber was over the dining room and presently as she knelt barbara heard willowes thrust back his chair and rise to go into the hall  in five minutes that figure would probably come up the stairs and confront her again itthis new and terrible form that was not her husbands  in the loneliness of this night with neither maid nor friend beside her she lost all selfcontrol and at the first sound of his footstep on the stairs without so much as flinging a cloak round her she flew from the room ran along the gallery to the back staircase which she descended and unlocking the back door let herself out  she scarcely was aware what she had done till she found herself in the greenhouse crouching on a flowerstand  here she remained her great timid eyes strained through the glass upon the garden without and her skirts gathered up in fear of the fieldmice which sometimes came there  every moment she dreaded to hear footsteps which she ought by law to have longed for and a voice that should have been as music to her soul  but edmond willowes came not that way  the nights were getting short at this season and soon the dawn appeared and the first rays of the sun  by daylight she had less fear than in the dark  she thought she could meet him and accustom herself to the spectacle  so the muchtried young woman unfastened the door of the hothouse and went back by the way she had emerged a few hours ago  her poor husband was probably in bed and asleep his journey having been long and she made as little noise as possible in her entry  the house was just as she had left it and she looked about in the hall for his cloak and hat but she could not see them nor did she perceive the small trunk which had been all that he brought with him his heavier baggage having been left at southampton for the roadwaggon  she summoned courage to mount the stairs the bedroomdoor was open as she had left it  she fearfully peeped round the bed had not been pressed  perhaps he had lain down on the diningroom sofa  she descended and entered he was not there  on the table beside his unsoiled plate lay a note hastily written on the leaf of a pocketbook  it was something like this     my everbeloved wifethe effect that my forbidding appearance has    produced upon you was one which i foresaw as quite possible  i hoped    against it but foolishly so  i was aware that no human love could    survive such a catastrophe  i confess i thought yours divine but    after so long an absence there could not be left sufficient warmth to    overcome the too natural first aversion  it was an experiment and it    has failed  i do not blame you perhaps even it is better so  good    bye  i leave england for one year  you will see me again at the    expiration of that time if i live  then i will ascertain your true    feeling and if it be against me go away for ever  e w  on recovering from her surprise barbaras remorse was such that she felt herself absolutely unforgiveable  she should have regarded him as an afflicted being and not have been this slave to mere eyesight like a child  to follow him and entreat him to return was her first thought but on making inquiries she found that nobody had seen him he had silently disappeared  more than this to undo the scene of last night was impossible  her terror had been too plain and he was a man unlikely to be coaxed back by her efforts to do her duty  she went and confessed to her parents all that had occurred which indeed soon became known to more persons than those of her own family  the year passed and he did not return and it was doubted if he were alive  barbaras contrition for her unconquerable repugnance was now such that she longed to build a churchaisle or erect a monument and devote herself to deeds of charity for the remainder of her days  to that end she made inquiry of the excellent parson under whom she sat on sundays at a vertical distance of twenty feet  but he could only adjust his wig and tap his snuffbox for such was the lukewarm state of religion in those days that not an aisle steeple porch east window tencommandment board lionandunicorn or brass candlestick was required anywhere at all in the neighbourhood as a votive offering from a distracted soulthe last century contrasting greatly in this respect with the happy times in which we live when urgent appeals for contributions to such objects pour in by every mornings post and nearly all churches have been made to look like new pennies  as the poor lady could not ease her conscience this way she determined at least to be charitable and soon had the satisfaction of finding her porch thronged every morning by the raggedest idlest most drunken hypocritical and worthless tramps in christendom  but human hearts are as prone to change as the leaves of the creeper on the wall and in the course of time hearing nothing of her husband barbara could sit unmoved whilst her mother and friends said in her hearing well what has happened is for the best  she began to think so herself for even now she could not summon up that lopped and mutilated form without a shiver though whenever her mind flew back to her early wedded days and the man who had stood beside her then a thrill of tenderness moved her which if quickened by his living presence might have become strong  she was young and inexperienced and had hardly on his late return grown out of the capricious fancies of girlhood  but he did not come again and when she thought of his word that he would return once more if living and how unlikely he was to break his word she gave him up for dead  so did her parents so also did another personthat man of silence of irresistible incisiveness of still countenance who was as awake as seven sentinels when he seemed to be as sound asleep as the figures on his family monument  lord uplandtowers though not yet thirty had chuckled like a caustic fogey of threescore when he heard of barbaras terror and flight at her husbands return and of the latters prompt departure  he felt pretty sure however that willowes despite his hurt feelings would have reappeared to claim his brighteyed property if he had been alive at the end of the twelve months  as there was no husband to live with her barbara had relinquished the house prepared for them by her father and taken up her abode anew at chene manor as in the days of her girlhood  by degrees the episode with edmond willowes seemed but a fevered dream and as the months grew to years lord uplandtowers friendship with the people at chenewhich had somewhat cooled after barbaras elopementrevived considerably and he again became a frequent visitor there  he could not make the most trivial alteration or improvement at knollingwood hall where he lived without riding off to consult with his friend sir john at chene and thus putting himself frequently under her eyes barbara grew accustomed to him and talked to him as freely as to a brother  she even began to look up to him as a person of authority judgment and prudence and though his severity on the bench towards poachers smugglers and turnipstealers was matter of common notoriety she trusted that much of what was said might be misrepresentation  thus they lived on till her husbands absence had stretched to years and there could be no longer any doubt of his death  a passionless manner of renewing his addresses seemed no longer out of place in lord uplandtowers  barbara did not love him but hers was essentially one of those sweetpea or withwind natures which require a twig of stouter fibre than its own to hang upon and bloom  now too she was older and admitted to herself that a man whose ancestor had run scores of saracens through and through in fighting for the site of the holy sepulchre was a more desirable husband socially considered than one who could only claim with certainty to know that his father and grandfather were respectable burgesses  sir john took occasion to inform her that she might legally consider herself a widow and in brief lord uplandtowers carried his point with her and she married him though he could never get her to own that she loved him as she had loved willowes  in my childhood i knew an old lady whose mother saw the wedding and she said that when lord and lady uplandtowers drove away from her fathers house in the evening it was in a coachandfour and that my lady was dressed in green and silver and wore the gayest hat and feather that ever were seen though whether it was that the green did not suit her complexion or otherwise the countess looked pale and the reverse of blooming  after their marriage her husband took her to london and she saw the gaieties of a season there then they returned to knollingwood hall and thus a year passed away  before their marriage her husband had seemed to care but little about her inability to love him passionately  only let me win you he had said and i will submit to all that  but now her lack of warmth seemed to irritate him and he conducted himself towards her with a resentfulness which led to her passing many hours with him in painful silence  the heirpresumptive to the title was a remote relative whom lord uplandtowers did not exclude from the dislike he entertained towards many persons and things besides and he had set his mind upon a lineal successor  he blamed her much that there was no promise of this and asked her what she was good for  on a particular day in her gloomy life a letter addressed to her as mrs willowes reached lady uplandtowers from an unexpected quarter  a sculptor in pisa knowing nothing of her second marriage informed her that the longdelayed lifesize statue of mr willowes which when her husband left that city he had been directed to retain till it was sent for was still in his studio  as his commission had not wholly been paid and the statue was taking up room he could ill spare he should be glad to have the debt cleared off and directions where to forward the figure  arriving at a time when the countess was beginning to have little secrets of a harmless kind it is true from her husband by reason of their growing estrangement she replied to this letter without saying a word to lord uplandtowers sending off the balance that was owing to the sculptor and telling him to despatch the statue to her without delay  it was some weeks before it arrived at knollingwood hall and by a singular coincidence during the interval she received the first absolutely conclusive tidings of her edmonds death  it had taken place years before in a foreign land about six months after their parting and had been induced by the sufferings he had already undergone coupled with much depression of spirit which had caused him to succumb to a slight ailment  the news was sent her in a brief and formal letter from some relative of willowess in another part of england  her grief took the form of passionate pity for his misfortunes and of reproach to herself for never having been able to conquer her aversion to his latter image by recollection of what nature had originally made him the sad spectacle that had gone from earth had never been her edmond at all to her  o that she could have met him as he was at first  thus barbara thought  it was only a few days later that a waggon with two horses containing an immense packingcase was seen at breakfasttime both by barbara and her husband to drive round to the back of the house and byandby they were informed that a case labelled sculpture had arrived for her ladyship  what can that be said lord uplandtowers  it is the statue of poor edmond which belongs to me but has never been sent till now she answered  where are you going to put it asked he  i have not decided said the countess  anywhere so that it will not annoy you  oh it wont annoy me says he  when it had been unpacked in a back room of the house they went to examine it  the statue was a fulllength figure in the purest carrara marble representing edmond willowes in all his original beauty as he had stood at parting from her when about to set out on his travels a specimen of manhood almost perfect in every line and contour  the work had been carried out with absolute fidelity  phoebusapollo sure said the earl of uplandtowers who had never seen willowes real or represented till now  barbara did not hear him  she was standing in a sort of trance before the first husband as if she had no consciousness of the other husband at her side  the mutilated features of willowes had disappeared from her minds eye this perfect being was really the man she had loved and not that later pitiable figure in whom love and truth should have seen this image always but had not done so  it was not till lord uplandtowers said roughly are you going to stay here all the morning worshipping him that she roused herself  her husband had not till now the least suspicion that edmond willowes originally looked thus and he thought how deep would have been his jealousy years ago if willowes had been known to him  returning to the hall in the afternoon he found his wife in the gallery whither the statue had been brought  she was lost in reverie before it just as in the morning  what are you doing he asked  she started and turned  i am looking at my husb my statue to see if it is well done she stammered  why should i not  theres no reason why he said  what are you going to do with the monstrous thing  it cant stand here for ever  i dont wish it she said  ill find a place  in her boudoir there was a deep recess and while the earl was absent from home for a few days in the following week she hired joiners from the village who under her directions enclosed the recess with a panelled door  into the tabernacle thus formed she had the statue placed fastening the door with a lock the key of which she kept in her pocket  when her husband returned he missed the statue from the gallery and concluding that it had been put away out of deference to his feelings made no remark  yet at moments he noticed something on his ladys face which he had never noticed there before  he could not construe it it was a sort of silent ecstasy a reserved beatification  what had become of the statue he could not divine and growing more and more curious looked about here and there for it till thinking of her private room he went towards that spot  after knocking he heard the shutting of a door and the click of a key but when he entered his wife was sitting at work on what was in those days called knotting  lord uplandtowers eye fell upon the newlypainted door where the recess had formerly been  you have been carpentering in my absence then barbara he said carelessly  yes uplandtowers  why did you go putting up such a tasteless enclosure as thatspoiling the handsome arch of the alcove  i wanted more closetroom and i thought that as this was my own apartment  of course he returned  lord uplandtowers knew now where the statue of young willowes was  one night or rather in the smallest hours of the morning he missed the countess from his side  not being a man of nervous imaginings he fell asleep again before he had much considered the matter and the next morning had forgotten the incident  but a few nights later the same circumstances occurred  this time he fully roused himself but before he had moved to search for her she entered the chamber in her dressinggown carrying a candle which she extinguished as she approached deeming him asleep  he could discover from her breathing that she was strangely moved but not on this occasion either did he reveal that he had seen her  presently when she had lain down affecting to wake he asked her some trivial questions  yes edmond she replied absently  lord uplandtowers became convinced that she was in the habit of leaving the chamber in this queer way more frequently than he had observed and he determined to watch  the next midnight he feigned deep sleep and shortly after perceived her stealthily rise and let herself out of the room in the dark  he slipped on some clothing and followed  at the farther end of the corridor where the clash of flint and steel would be out of the hearing of one in the bedchamber she struck a light  he stepped aside into an empty room till she had lit a taper and had passed on to her boudoir  in a minute or two he followed  arrived at the door of the boudoir he beheld the door of the private recess open and barbara within it standing with her arms clasped tightly round the neck of her edmond and her mouth on his  the shawl which she had thrown round her nightclothes had slipped from her shoulders and her long white robe and pale face lent her the blanched appearance of a second statue embracing the first  between her kisses she apostrophized it in a low murmur of infantine tenderness  my only lovehow could i be so cruel to you my perfect oneso good and truei am ever faithful to you despite my seeming infidelity  i always think of youdream of youduring the long hours of the day and in the nightwatches  o edmond i am always yours  such words as these intermingled with sobs and streaming tears and dishevelled hair testified to an intensity of feeling in his wife which lord uplandtowers had not dreamed of her possessing  ha ha says he to himself  this is where we evaporatethis is where my hopes of a successor in the title dissolveha ha  this must be seen to verily  lord uplandtowers was a subtle man when once he set himself to strategy though in the present instance he never thought of the simple stratagem of constant tenderness  nor did he enter the room and surprise his wife as a blunderer would have done but went back to his chamber as silently as he had left it  when the countess returned thither shaken by spent sobs and sighs he appeared to be soundly sleeping as usual  the next day he began his countermoves by making inquiries as to the whereabouts of the tutor who had travelled with his wifes first husband this gentleman he found was now master of a grammarschool at no great distance from knollingwood  at the first convenient moment lord uplandtowers went thither and obtained an interview with the said gentleman  the schoolmaster was much gratified by a visit from such an influential neighbour and was ready to communicate anything that his lordship desired to know  after some general conversation on the school and its progress the visitor observed that he believed the schoolmaster had once travelled a good deal with the unfortunate mr willowes and had been with him on the occasion of his accident  he lord uplandtowers was interested in knowing what had really happened at that time and had often thought of inquiring  and then the earl not only heard by word of mouth as much as he wished to know but their chat becoming more intimate the schoolmaster drew upon paper a sketch of the disfigured head explaining with bated breath various details in the representation  it was very strange and terrible said lord uplandtowers taking the sketch in his hand  neither nose nor ears  a poor man in the town nearest to knollingwood hall who combined the art of signpainting with ingenious mechanical occupations was sent for by lord uplandtowers to come to the hall on a day in that week when the countess had gone on a short visit to her parents  his employer made the man understand that the business in which his assistance was demanded was to be considered private and money insured the observance of this request  the lock of the cupboard was picked and the ingenious mechanic and painter assisted by the schoolmasters sketch which lord uplandtowers had put in his pocket set to work upon the godlike countenance of the statue under my lords direction  what the fire had maimed in the original the chisel maimed in the copy  it was a fiendish disfigurement ruthlessly carried out and was rendered still more shocking by being tinted to the hues of life as life had been after the wreck  six hours after when the workman was gone lord uplandtowers looked upon the result and smiled grimly and said  a statue should represent a man as he appeared in life and thats as he appeared  ha ha  but tis done to good purpose and not idly  he locked the door of the closet with a skeleton key and went his way to fetch the countess home  that night she slept but he kept awake  according to the tale she murmured soft words in her dream and he knew that the tender converse of her imaginings was held with one whom he had supplanted but in name  at the end of her dream the countess of uplandtowers awoke and arose and then the enactment of former nights was repeated  her husband remained still and listened  two strokes sounded from the clock in the pediment without when leaving the chamberdoor ajar she passed along the corridor to the other end where as usual she obtained a light  so deep was the silence that he could even from his bed hear her softly blowing the tinder to a glow after striking the steel  she moved on into the boudoir and he heard or fancied he heard the turning of the key in the closetdoor  the next moment there came from that direction a loud and prolonged shriek which resounded to the farthest corners of the house  it was repeated and there was the noise of a heavy fall  lord uplandtowers sprang out of bed  he hastened along the dark corridor to the door of the boudoir which stood ajar and by the light of the candle within saw his poor young countess lying in a heap in her nightdress on the floor of the closet  when he reached her side he found that she had fainted much to the relief of his fears that matters were worse  he quickly shut up and locked in the hated image which had done the mischief and lifted his wife in his arms where in a few instants she opened her eyes  pressing her face to his without saying a word he carried her back to her room endeavouring as he went to disperse her terrors by a laugh in her ear oddly compounded of causticity predilection and brutality  hohoho says he  frightened dear one hey  what a baby tis only a joke sure barbaraa splendid joke  but a baby should not go to closets at midnight to look for the ghost of the dear departed  if it do it must expect to be terrified at his aspecthohoho  when she was in her bedchamber and had quite come to herself though her nerves were still much shaken he spoke to her more sternly  now my lady answer me do you love himeh  nono she faltered shuddering with her expanded eyes fixed on her husband  he is too terribleno no  you are sure  quite sure replied the poor brokenspirited countess  but her natural elasticity asserted itself  next morning he again inquired of her do you love him now  she quailed under his gaze but did not reply  that means that you do still by g he continued  it means that i will not tell an untruth and do not wish to incense my lord she answered with dignity  then suppose we go and have another look at him  as he spoke he suddenly took her by the wrist and turned as if to lead her towards the ghastly closet  nono  ohno she cried and her desperate wriggle out of his hand revealed that the fright of the night had left more impression upon her delicate soul than superficially appeared  another dose or two and she will be cured he said to himself  it was now so generally known that the earl and countess were not in accord that he took no great trouble to disguise his deeds in relation to this matter  during the day he ordered four men with ropes and rollers to attend him in the boudoir  when they arrived the closet was open and the upper part of the statue tied up in canvas  he had it taken to the sleepingchamber  what followed is more or less matter of conjecture  the story as told to me goes on to say that when lady uplandtowers retired with him that night she saw near the foot of the heavy oak fourposter a tall dark wardrobe which had not stood there before but she did not ask what its presence meant  i have had a little whim he explained when they were in the dark  have you says she  to erect a little shrine as it may be called  a little shrine  yes to one whom we both equally adoreeh  ill show you what it contains  he pulled a cord which hung covered by the bedcurtains and the doors of the wardrobe slowly opened disclosing that the shelves within had been removed throughout and the interior adapted to receive the ghastly figure which stood there as it had stood in the boudoir but with a wax candle burning on each side of it to throw the cropped and distorted features into relief  she clutched him uttered a low scream and buried her head in the bedclothes  oh take it awayplease take it away she implored  all in good time namely when you love me best he returned calmly you dont quite yeteh  i dont knowi thinko uplandtowers have mercyi cannot bear ito in pity take it away  nonsense one gets accustomed to anything  take another gaze  in short he allowed the doors to remain unclosed at the foot of the bed and the waxtapers burning and such was the strange fascination of the grisly exhibition that a morbid curiosity took possession of the countess as she lay and at his repeated request she did again look out from the coverlet shuddered hid her eyes and looked again all the while begging him to take it away or it would drive her out of her senses  but he would not do so as yet and the wardrobe was not locked till dawn  the scene was repeated the next night  firm in enforcing his ferocious correctives he continued the treatment till the nerves of the poor lady were quivering in agony under the virtuous tortures inflicted by her lord to bring her truant heart back to faithfulness  the third night when the scene had opened as usual and she lay staring with immense wild eyes at the horrid fascination on a sudden she gave an unnatural laugh she laughed more and more staring at the image till she literally shrieked with laughter then there was silence and he found her to have become insensible  he thought she had fainted but soon saw that the event was worse she was in an epileptic fit  he started up dismayed by the sense that like many other subtle personages he had been too exacting for his own interests  such love as he was capable of though rather a selfish gloating than a cherishing solicitude was fanned into life on the instant  he closed the wardrobe with the pulley clasped her in his arms took her gently to the window and did all he could to restore her  it was a long time before the countess came to herself and when she did so a considerable change seemed to have taken place in her emotions  she flung her arms around him and with gasps of fear abjectly kissed him many times at last bursting into tears  she had never wept in this scene before  youll take it away dearestyou will she begged plaintively  if you love me  i dooh i do  and hate him and his memory  yesyes  thoroughly  i cannot endure recollection of him cried the poor countess slavishly it fills me with shamehow could i ever be so depraved  ill never behave badly again uplandtowers and you will never put the hated statue again before my eyes  he felt that he could promise with perfect safety  never said he  and then ill love you she returned eagerly as if dreading lest the scourge should be applied anew  and ill never never dream of thinking a single thought that seems like faithlessness to my marriage vow  the strange thing now was that this fictitious love wrung from her by terror took on through mere habit of enactment a certain quality of reality  a servile mood of attachment to the earl became distinctly visible in her contemporaneously with an actual dislike for her late husbands memory  the mood of attachment grew and continued when the statue was removed  a permanent revulsion was operant in her which intensified as time wore on  how fright could have effected such a change of idiosyncrasy learned physicians alone can say but i believe such cases of reactionary instinct are not unknown  the upshot was that the cure became so permanent as to be itself a new disease  she clung to him so tightly that she would not willingly be out of his sight for a moment  she would have no sittingroom apart from his though she could not help starting when he entered suddenly to her her eyes were wellnigh always fixed upon him  if he drove out she wished to go with him his slightest civilities to other women made her frantically jealous till at length her very fidelity became a burden to him absorbing his time and curtailing his liberty and causing him to curse and swear  if he ever spoke sharply to her now she did not revenge herself by flying off to a mental world of her own all that affection for another which had provided her with a resource was now a cold black cinder  from that time the life of this scared and enervated ladywhose existence might have been developed to so much higher purpose but for the ignoble ambition of her parents and the conventions of the timewas one of obsequious amativeness towards a perverse and cruel man  little personal events came to her in quick successionhalf a dozen eight nine ten such eventsin brief she bore him no less than eleven children in the eight following years but half of them came prematurely into the world or died a few days old only one a girl attained to maturity she in after years became the wife of the honourable mr beltonleigh who was created lord dalmaine as may be remembered  there was no living son and heir  at length completely worn out in mind and body lady uplandtowers was taken abroad by her husband to try the effect of a more genial climate upon her wasted frame  but nothing availed to strengthen her and she died at florence a few months after her arrival in italy  contrary to expectation the earl of uplandtowers did not marry again such affection as existed in himstrange hard brutal as it wasseemed untransferable and the title as is known passed at his death to his nephew  perhaps it may not be so generally known that during the enlargement of the hall for the sixth earl while digging in the grounds for the new foundations the broken fragments of a marble statue were unearthed  they were submitted to various antiquaries who said that so far as the damaged pieces would allow them to form an opinion the statue seemed to be that of a mutilated roman satyr or if not an allegorical figure of death  only one or two old inhabitants guessed whose statue those fragments had composed  i should have added that shortly after the death of the countess an excellent sermon was preached by the dean of melchester the subject of which though names were not mentioned was unquestionably suggested by the aforesaid events  he dwelt upon the folly of indulgence in sensuous love for a handsome form merely and showed that the only rational and virtuous growths of that affection were those based upon intrinsic worth in the case of the tender but somewhat shallow lady whose life i have related there is no doubt that an infatuation for the person of young willowes was the chief feeling that induced her to marry him which was the more deplorable in that his beauty by all tradition was the least of his recommendations every report bearing out the inference that he must have been a man of steadfast nature bright intelligence and promising life        the company thanked the old surgeon for his story which the rural dean declared to be a far more striking one than anything he could hope to tell  an elderly member of the club who was mostly called the bookworm said that a womans natural instinct of fidelity would indeed send back her heart to a man after his death in a truly wonderful manner sometimesif anything occurred to put before her forcibly the original affection between them and his original aspect in her eyeswhatever his inferiority may have been social or otherwise and then a general conversation ensued upon the power that a woman has of seeing the actual in the representation the reality in the dreama power which according to the sentimental member men have no faculty of equalling  the rural dean thought that such cases as that related by the surgeon were rather an illustration of passion electrified back to life than of a latent true affection  the story had suggested that he should try to recount to them one which he had used to hear in his youth and which afforded an instance of the latter and better kind of feeling his heroine being also a lady who had married beneath her though he feared his narrative would be of a much slighter kind than the surgeons  the club begged him to proceed and the parson began     dame the thirdthe marchioness of stonehenge by the rural dean   i would have you know then that a great many years ago there lived in a classical mansion with which i used to be familiar standing not a hundred miles from the city of melchester a lady whose personal charms were so rare and unparalleled that she was courted flattered and spoilt by almost all the young noblemen and gentlemen in that part of wessex for a time these attentions pleased her well  but as in the words of good robert south whose sermons might be read much more than they are the most passionate lover of sport if tied to follow his hawks and hounds every day of his life would find the pursuit the greatest torment and calamity and would fly to the mines and galleys for his recreation so did this lofty and beautiful lady after a while become satiated with the constant iteration of what she had in its novelty enjoyed and by an almost natural revulsion turned her regards absolutely netherward socially speaking  she perversely and passionately centred her affection on quite a plainlooking young man of humble birth and no position at all though it is true that he was gentle and delicate in nature of good address and guileless heart  in short he was the parishclerks son acting as assistant to the landsteward of her father the earl of avon with the hope of becoming some day a landsteward himself  it should be said that perhaps the lady caroline as she was called was a little stimulated in this passion by the discovery that a young girl of the village already loved the young man fondly and that he had paid some attentions to her though merely of a casual and goodnatured kind  since his occupation brought him frequently to the manorhouse and its environs lady caroline could make ample opportunities of seeing and speaking to him  she had in chaucers phrase all the craft of fine loving at her fingers ends and the young man being of a readilykindling heart was quick to notice the tenderness in her eyes and voice  he could not at first believe in his good fortune having no understanding of her weariness of more artificial men but a time comes when the stupidest sees in an eye the glance of his other half and it came to him who was quite the reverse of dull  as he gained confidence accidental encounters led to encounters by design till at length when they were alone together there was no reserve on the matter  they whispered tender words as other lovers do and were as devoted a pair as ever was seen  but not a ray or symptom of this attachment was allowed to show itself to the outer world  now as she became less and less scrupulous towards him under the influence of her affection and he became more and more reverential under the influence of his and they looked the situation in the face together their condition seemed intolerable in its hopelessness  that she could ever ask to be allowed to marry him or could hold her tongue and quietly renounce him was equally beyond conception  they resolved upon a third course possessing neither of the disadvantages of these two to wed secretly and live on in outward appearance the same as before  in this they differed from the lovers of my friends story  not a soul in the parental mansion guessed when lady caroline came coolly into the hall one day after a visit to her aunt that during that visit her lover and herself had found an opportunity of uniting themselves till death should part them  yet such was the fact the young woman who rode fine horses and drove in ponychaises and was saluted deferentially by every one and the young man who trudged about and directed the treefelling and the laying out of fishponds in the park were husband and wife  as they had planned so they acted to the letter for the space of a month and more clandestinely meeting when and where they best could do so both being supremely happy and content  to be sure towards the latter part of that month when the first wild warmth of her love had gone off the lady caroline sometimes wondered within herself how she who might have chosen a peer of the realm baronet knight or if seriousminded a bishop or judge of the more gallant sort who prefer young wives could have brought herself to do a thing so rash as to make this marriage particularly when in their private meetings she perceived that though her young husband was full of ideas and fairly well read they had not a single social experience in common  it was his custom to visit her after nightfall in her own house when he could find no opportunity for an interview elsewhere and to further this course she would contrive to leave unfastened a window on the groundfloor overlooking the lawn by entering which a back staircase was accessible so that he could climb up to her apartments and gain audience of his lady when the house was still  one dark midnight when he had not been able to see her during the day he made use of this secret method as he had done many times before and when they had remained in company about an hour he declared that it was time for him to descend  he would have stayed longer but that the interview had been a somewhat painful one  what she had said to him that night had much excited and angered him for it had revealed a change in her cold reason had come to his lofty wife she was beginning to have more anxiety about her own position and prospects than ardour for him  whether from the agitation of this perception or not he was seized with a spasm he gasped rose and in moving towards the window for air he uttered in a short thick whisper oh my heart  with his hand upon his chest he sank down to the floor before he had gone another step  by the time that she had relighted the candle which had been extinguished in case any eye in the opposite grounds should witness his egress she found that his poor heart had ceased to beat and there rushed upon her mind what his cottagefriends had once told her that he was liable to attacks of heartdisease one of which the doctor had informed them might some day carry him off  accustomed as she was to doctoring the other parishioners nothing that she could effect upon him in that kind made any difference whatever and his stillness and the increasing coldness of his feet and hands disclosed too surely to the affrighted young woman that her husband was dead indeed  for more than an hour however she did not abandon her efforts to restore him when she fully realized the fact that he was a corpse she bent over his body distracted and bewildered as to what step she next should take  her first feelings had undoubtedly been those of passionate grief at the loss of him her second thoughts were concern at her own position as the daughter of an earl  oh why why my unfortunate husband did you die in my chamber at this hour she said piteously to the corpse  why not have died in your own cottage if you would die  then nobody would ever have known of our imprudent union and no syllable would have been breathed of how i mismated myself for love of you  the clock in the courtyard striking the hour of one aroused lady caroline from the stupor into which she had fallen and she stood up and went towards the door  to awaken and tell her mother seemed her only way out of this terrible situation yet when she put her hand on the key to unlock it she withdrew herself again  it would be impossible to call even her mothers assistance without risking a revelation to all the world through the servants while if she could remove the body unassisted to a distance she might avert suspicion of their union even now  this thought of immunity from the social consequences of her rash act of renewed freedom was indubitably a relief to her for as has been said the constraint and riskiness of her position had begun to tell upon the lady carolines nerves  she braced herself for the effort and hastily dressed herself and then dressed him  tying his dead hands together with a handkerchief she laid his arms round her shoulders and bore him to the landing and down the narrow stairs  reaching the bottom by the window she let his body slide slowly over the sill till it lay on the ground without  she then climbed over the windowsill herself and leaving the sash open dragged him on to the lawn with a rustle not louder than the rustle of a broom  there she took a securer hold and plunged with him under the trees  away from the precincts of the house she could apply herself more vigorously to her task which was a heavy one enough for her robust as she was and the exertion and fright she had already undergone began to tell upon her by the time she reached the corner of a beechplantation which intervened between the manorhouse and the village  here she was so nearly exhausted that she feared she might have to leave him on the spot  but she plodded on after a while and keeping upon the grass at every opportunity she stood at last opposite the poor young mans garden gate where he lived with his father the parishclerk  how she accomplished the end of her task lady caroline never quite knew but to avoid leaving traces in the road she carried him bodily across the gravel and laid him down at the door  perfectly aware of his ways of coming and going she searched behind the shutter for the cottage door key which she placed in his cold hand  then she kissed his face for the last time and with silent little sobs bade him farewell  lady caroline retraced her steps and reached the mansion without hindrance and to her great relief found the window open just as she had left it  when she had climbed in she listened attentively fastened the window behind her and ascending the stairs noiselessly to her room set everything in order and returned to bed  the next morning it was speedily echoed around that the amiable and gentle young villager had been found dead outside his fathers door which he had apparently been in the act of unlocking when he fell  the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to justify an inquest at which syncope from heartdisease was ascertained to be beyond doubt the explanation of his death and no more was said about the matter then but after the funeral it was rumoured that some man who had been returning late from a distant horsefair had seen in the gloom of night a person apparently a woman dragging a heavy body of some sort towards the cottagegate which by the light of after events would seem to have been the corpse of the young fellow  his clothes were thereupon examined more particularly than at first with the result that marks of friction were visible upon them here and there precisely resembling such as would be left by dragging on the ground  our beautiful and ingenious lady caroline was now in great consternation and began to think that after all it might have been better to honestly confess the truth  but having reached this stage without discovery or suspicion she determined to make another effort towards concealment and a bright idea struck her as a means of securing it  i think i mentioned that before she cast eyes on the unfortunate stewards clerk he had been the beloved of a certain village damsel the woodmans daughter his neighbour to whom he had paid some attentions and possibly he was beloved of her still  at any rate the lady carolines influence on the estates of her father being considerable she resolved to seek an interview with the young girl in furtherance of her plan to save her reputation about which she was now exceedingly anxious for by this time the fit being over she began to be ashamed of her mad passion for her late husband and almost wished she had never seen him  in the course of her parishvisiting she lighted on the young girl without much difficulty and found her looking pale and sad and wearing a simple black gown which she had put on out of respect for the young mans memory whom she had tenderly loved though he had not loved her  ah you have lost your lover milly said lady caroline  the young woman could not repress her tears  my lady he was not quite my lover she said  but i was hisand now he is dead i dont care to live any more  can you keep a secret about him asks the lady one in which his honour is involvedwhich is known to me alone but should be known to you  the girl readily promised and indeed could be safely trusted on such a subject so deep was her affection for the youth she mourned  then meet me at his grave tonight halfanhour after sunset and i will tell it to you says the other  in the dusk of that spring evening the two shadowy figures of the young women converged upon the assistantstewards newlyturfed mound and at that solemn place and hour the one of birth and beauty unfolded her tale how she had loved him and married him secretly how he had died in her chamber and how to keep her secret she had dragged him to his own door  married him my lady said the rustic maiden starting back  i have said so replied lady caroline  but it was a mad thing and a mistaken course  he ought to have married you  you milly were peculiarly his  but you lost him  yes said the poor girl and for that they laughed at me  haha you mid love him milly they said but he will not love you  victory over such unkind jeerers would be sweet said lady caroline you lost him in life but you may have him in death as if you had had him in life and so turn the tables upon them  how said the breathless girl  the young lady then unfolded her plan which was that milly should go forward and declare that the young man had contracted a secret marriage as he truly had done that it was with her milly his sweetheart that he had been visiting her in her cottage on the evening of his death when on finding he was a corpse she had carried him to his house to prevent discovery by her parents and that she had meant to keep the whole matter a secret till the rumours afloat had forced it from her  and how shall i prove this said the woodmans daughter amazed at the boldness of the proposal  quite sufficiently  you can say if necessary that you were married to him at the church of st michael in bath city in my name as the first that occurred to you to escape detection  that was where he married me i will support you in this  ohi dont quite like  if you will do so said the lady peremptorily i will always be your fathers friend and yours if not it will be otherwise  and i will give you my weddingring which you shall wear as yours  have you worn it my lady  only at night  there was not much choice in the matter and milly consented  then this noble lady took from her bosom the ring she had never been able openly to exhibit and grasping the young girls hand slipped it upon her finger as she stood upon her lovers grave  milly shivered and bowed her head saying i feel as if i had become a corpses bride  but from that moment the maiden was heart and soul in the substitution  a blissful repose came over her spirit  it seemed to her that she had secured in death him whom in life she had vainly idolized and she was almost content  after that the lady handed over to the young mans new wife all the little mementoes and trinkets he had given herself even to a locket containing his hair  the next day the girl made her socalled confession which the simple mourning she had already worn without stating for whom seemed to bear out and soon the story of the little romance spread through the village and countryside almost as far as melchester  it was a curious psychological fact that having once made the avowal milly seemed possessed with a spirit of ecstasy at her position  with the liberal sum of money supplied to her by lady caroline she now purchased the garb of a widow and duly appeared at church in her weeds her simple face looking so sweet against its margin of crape that she was almost envied her state by the other villagegirls of her age  and when a womans sorrow for her beloved can maim her young life so obviously as it had done millys there was in truth little subterfuge in the case  her explanation tallied so well with the details of her lovers latter movementsthose strange absences and sudden returnings which had occasionally puzzled his friendsthat nobody supposed for a moment that the second actor in these secret nuptials was other than she  the actual and whole truth would indeed have seemed a preposterous assertion beside this plausible one by reason of the lofty demeanour of the lady caroline and the unassuming habits of the late villager  there being no inheritance in question not a soul took the trouble to go to the city church forty miles off and search the registers for marriage signatures bearing out so humble a romance  in a short time milly caused a decent tombstone to be erected over her nominal husbands grave whereon appeared the statement that it was placed there by his heartbroken widow which considering that the payment for it came from lady caroline and the grief from milly was as truthful as such inscriptions usually are and only required pluralizing to render it yet more nearly so  the impressionable and complaisant milly in her character of widow took delight in going to his grave every day and indulging in sorrow which was a positive luxury to her  she placed fresh flowers on his grave and so keen was her emotional imaginativeness that she almost believed herself to have been his wife indeed as she walked to and fro in her garb of woe  one afternoon milly being busily engaged in this labour of love at the grave lady caroline passed outside the churchyard wall with some of her visiting friends who seeing milly there watched her actions with interest remarked upon the pathos of the scene and upon the intense affection the young man must have felt for such a tender creature as milly  a strange light as of pain shot from the lady carolines eye as if for the first time she begrudged to the young girl the position she had been at such pains to transfer to her it showed that a slumbering affection for her husband still had life in lady caroline obscured and stifled as it was by social considerations  an end was put to this smooth arrangement by the sudden appearance in the churchyard one day of the lady caroline when milly had come there on her usual errand of laying flowers  lady caroline had been anxiously awaiting her behind the chancel and her countenance was pale and agitated  milly she said come here  i dont know how to say to you what i am going to say  i am half dead  i am sorry for your ladyship says milly wondering  give me that ring says the lady snatching at the girls left hand  milly drew it quickly away  i tell you give it to me repeated caroline almost fiercely  ohbut you dont know why  i am in a grief and a trouble i did not expect  and lady caroline whispered a few words to the girl  o my lady said the thunderstruck milly  what will you do  you must say that your statement was a wicked lie an invention a scandal a deadly sinthat i told you to make it to screen me  that it was i whom he married at bath  in short we must tell the truth or i am ruinedbody mind and reputationfor ever  but there is a limit to the flexibility of gentlesouled women  milly by this time had so grown to the idea of being one flesh with this young man of having the right to bear his name as she bore it had so thoroughly come to regard him as her husband to dream of him as her husband to speak of him as her husband that she could not relinquish him at a moments peremptory notice  no no she said desperately i cannot i will not give him up  your ladyship took him away from me alive and gave him back to me only when he was dead  now i will keep him  i am truly his widow  more truly than you my lady for i love him and mourn for him and call myself by his dear name and your ladyship does neither  i do love him cries lady caroline with flashing eyes and i cling to him and wont let him go to such as you  how can i when he is the father of this poor babe thats coming to me  i must have him back again  milly milly cant you pity and understand me perverse girl that you are and the miserable plight that i am in  oh this precipitancyit is the ruin of women  why did i not consider and wait come give me back all that i have given you and assure me you will support me in confessing the truth  never never persisted milly with woebegone passionateness  look at this headstone  look at my gown and bonnet of crapethis ring listen to the name they call me by  my character is worth as much to me as yours is to you  after declaring my love mine myself his taking his name making his death my own particular sorrow how can i say it was not so  no such dishonour for me  i will outswear you my lady and i shall be believed  my story is so much the more likely that yours will be thought false  but o please my lady do not drive me to this  in pity let me keep him  the poor nominal widow exhibited such anguish at a proposal which would have been truly a bitter humiliation to her that lady caroline was warmed to pity in spite of her own condition  yes i see your position she answered  but think of mine  what can i do  without your support it would seem an invention to save me from disgrace even if i produced the register the love of scandal in the world is such that the multitude would slur over the fact say it was a fabrication and believe your story  i do not know who were the witnesses or anything  in a few minutes these two poor young women felt as so many in a strait have felt before that union was their greatest strength even now and they consulted calmly together  the result of their deliberations was that milly went home as usual and lady caroline also the latter confessing that very night to the countess her mother of the marriage and to nobody else in the world  and some time after lady caroline and her mother went away to london where a little while later still they were joined by milly who was supposed to have left the village to proceed to a wateringplace in the north for the benefit of her health at the expense of the ladies of the manor who had been much interested in her state of lonely and defenceless widowhood  early the next year the widow milly came home with an infant in her arms the family at the manor house having meanwhile gone abroad  they did not return from their tour till the autumn ensuing by which time milly and the child had again departed from the cottage of her father the woodman milly having attained to the dignity of dwelling in a cottage of her own many miles to the eastward of her native village a comfortable little allowance had moreover been settled on her and the child for life through the instrumentality of lady caroline and her mother  two or three years passed away and the lady caroline married a noblemanthe marquis of stonehengeconsiderably her senior who had wooed her long and phlegmatically  he was not rich but she led a placid life with him for many years though there was no child of the marriage meanwhile millys boy as the youngster was called and as milly herself considered him grew up and throve wonderfully and loved her as she deserved to be loved for her devotion to him in whom she every day traced more distinctly the lineaments of the man who had won her girlish heart and kept it even in the tomb  she educated him as well as she could with the limited means at her disposal for the allowance had never been increased lady caroline or the marchioness of stonehenge as she now was seeming by degrees to care little what had become of them  milly became extremely ambitious on the boys account she pinched herself almost of necessaries to send him to the grammar school in the town to which they retired and at twenty he enlisted in a cavalry regiment joining it with a deliberate intent of making the army his profession and not in a freak of idleness  his exceptional attainments his manly bearing his steady conduct speedily won him promotion which was furthered by the serious war in which this country was at that time engaged  on his return to england after the peace he had risen to the rank of ridingmaster and was soon after advanced another stage and made quartermaster though still a young man  his motherhis corporeal mother that is the marchioness of stonehengeheard tidings of this unaided progress it reawakened her maternal instincts and filled her with pride  she became keenly interested in her successful soldierson and as she grew older much wished to see him again particularly when the marquis dying she was left a solitary and childless widow  whether or not she would have gone to him of her own impulse i cannot say but one day when she was driving in an open carriage in the outskirts of a neighbouring town the troops lying at the barracks hard by passed her in marching order  she eyed them narrowly and in the finest of the horsemen recognized her son from his likeness to her first husband  this sight of him doubly intensified the motherly emotions which had lain dormant in her for so many years and she wildly asked herself how she could so have neglected him  had she possessed the true courage of affection she would have owned to her first marriage and have reared him as her son  what would it have mattered if she had never obtained this precious coronet of pearls and gold leaves by comparison with the gain of having the love and protection of such a noble and worthy son  these and other sad reflections cut the gloomy and solitary lady to the heart and she repented of her pride in disclaiming her first husband more bitterly than she had ever repented of her infatuation in marrying him  her yearning was so strong that at length it seemed to her that she could not live without announcing herself to him as his mother  come what might she would do it late as it was she would have him away from that woman whom she began to hate with the fierceness of a deserted heart for having taken her place as the mother of her only child  she felt confidently enough that her son would only too gladly exchange a cottagemother for one who was a peeress of the realm  being now in her widowhood free to come and go as she chose without question from anybody lady stonehenge started next day for the little town where milly yet lived still in her robes of sable for the lost lover of her youth  he is my son said the marchioness as soon as she was alone in the cottage with milly  you must give him back to me now that i am in a position in which i can defy the worlds opinion  i suppose he comes to see you continually  every month since he returned from the war my lady  and sometimes he stays two or three days and takes me about seeing sights everywhere she spoke with quiet triumph  well you will have to give him up said the marchioness calmly  it shall not be the worse for youyou may see him when you choose  i am going to avow my first marriage and have him with me  you forget that there are two to be reckoned with my lady  not only me but himself  that can be arranged  you dont suppose that he wouldnt  but not wishing to insult milly by comparing their positions she said he is my own flesh and blood not yours  flesh and bloods nothing said milly flashing with as much scorn as a cottager could show to a peeress which in this case was not so little as may be supposed  but i will agree to put it to him and let him settle it for himself  thats all i require said lady stonehenge  you must ask him to come and i will meet him here  the soldier was written to and the meeting took place  he was not so much astonished at the disclosure of his parentage as lady stonehenge had been led to expect having known for years that there was a little mystery about his birth  his manner towards the marchioness though respectful was less warm than she could have hoped  the alternatives as to his choice of a mother were put before him  his answer amazed and stupefied her  no my lady he said  thank you much but i prefer to let things be as they have been  my fathers name is mine in any case  you see my lady you cared little for me when i was weak and helpless why should i come to you now i am strong  she dear devoted soul pointing to milly tended me from my birth watched over me nursed me when i was ill and deprived herself of many a little comfort to push me on  i cannot love another mother as i love her  she is my mother and i will always be her son  as he spoke he put his manly arm round millys neck and kissed her with the tenderest affection  the agony of the poor marchioness was pitiable  you kill me she said between her shaking sobs  cannot youlovemetoo  no my lady  if i must say it you were ashamed of my poor father who was a sincere and honest man therefore i am ashamed of you  nothing would move him and the suffering woman at last gasped cannotoh cannot you give one kiss to meas you did to her  it is not muchit is all i askall  certainly he replied  he kissed her coldly and the painful scene came to an end  that day was the beginning of death to the unfortunate marchioness of stonehenge  it was in the perverseness of her human heart that his denial of her should add fuel to the fire of her craving for his love  how long afterwards she lived i do not know with any exactness but it was no great length of time  that anguish that is sharper than a serpents tooth wore her out soon  utterly reckless of the world its ways and its opinions she allowed her story to become known and when the welcome end supervened which i grieve to say she refused to lighten by the consolations of religion a broken heart was the truest phrase in which to sum up its cause        the rural dean having concluded some observations upon his tale were made in due course  the sentimental member said that lady carolines history afforded a sad instance of how an honest human affection will become shamefaced and mean under the frost of classdivision and social prejudices  she probably deserved some pity though her offspring before he grew up to mans estate had deserved more  there was no pathos like the pathos of childhood when a child found itself in a world where it was not wanted and could not understand the reason why  a tale by the speaker further illustrating the same subject though with different results from the last naturally followed     dame the fourthlady mottisfont by the sentimental member   of all the romantic towns in wessex wintoncester is probably the most convenient for meditative people to live in since there you have a cathedral with a nave so long that it affords space in which to walk and summon your remoter moods without continually turning on your heel or seeming to do more than take an afternoon stroll under cover from the rain or sun  in an uninterrupted course of nearly three hundred steps eastward and again nearly three hundred steps westward amid those magnificent tombs you can for instance compare in the most leisurely way the dry dustiness which ultimately pervades the persons of kings and bishops with the damper dustiness that is usually the final shape of commoners curates and others who take their last rest out of doors then if you are in love you can by sauntering in the chapels and behind the episcopal chantries with the brighteyed one so steep and mellow your ecstasy in the solemnities around that it will assume a rarer and finer tincture even more grateful to the understanding if not to the senses than that form of the emotion which arises from such companionship in spots where all is life and growth and fecundity  it was in this solemn place whither they had withdrawn from the sight of relatives on one cold day in march that sir ashley mottisfont asked in marriage as his second wife philippa the gentle daughter of plain squire okehall  her life had been an obscure one thus far while sir ashley though not a rich man had a certain distinction about him so that everybody thought what a convenient elevating and in a word blessed match it would be for such a supernumerary as she  nobody thought so more than the amiable girl herself  she had been smitten with such affection for him that when she walked the cathedral aisles at his side on the beforementioned day she did not know that her feet touched hard pavement it seemed to her rather that she was floating in space philippa was an ecstatic heartthumping maiden and could not understand how she had deserved to have sent to her such an illustrious lover such a travelled personage such a handsome man  when he put the question it was in no clumsy language such as the ordinary bucolic county landlords were wont to use on like quivering occasions but as elegantly as if he had been taught it in enfields speaker  yet he hesitated a littlefor he had something to add  my pretty philippa he said she was not very pretty by the way i have you must know a little girl dependent upon me a little waif i found one day in a patch of wild oats such was this worthy baronets humour when i was riding home a little nameless creature whom i wish to take care of till she is old enough to take care of herself and to educate in a plain way  she is only fifteen months old and is at present in the hands of a kind villagers wife in my parish  will you object to give some attention to the little thing in her helplessness  it need hardly be said that our innocent young lady loving him so deeply and joyfully as she did replied that she would do all she could for the nameless child and shortly afterwards the pair were married in the same cathedral that had echoed the whispers of his declaration the officiating minister being the bishop himself a venerable and experienced man so well accomplished in uniting people who had a mind for that sort of experiment that the couple with some sense of surprise found themselves one while they were still vaguely gazing at each other as two independent beings  after this operation they went home to deansleigh park and made a beginning of living happily ever after  lady mottisfont true to her promise was always running down to the village during the following weeks to see the baby whom her husband had so mysteriously lighted on during his ride homeconcerning which interesting discovery she had her own opinion but being so extremely amiable and affectionate that she could have loved stocks and stones if there had been no living creatures to love she uttered none of her thoughts  the little thing who had been christened dorothy took to lady mottisfont as if the baronets young wife had been her mother and at length philippa grew so fond of the child that she ventured to ask her husband if she might have dorothy in her own home and bring her up carefully just as if she were her own to this he answered that though remarks might be made thereon he had no objection a fact which was obvious sir ashley seeming rather pleased than otherwise with the proposal  after this they lived quietly and uneventfully for two or three years at sir ashley mottisfonts residence in that part of england with as near an approach to bliss as the climate of this country allows  the child had been a godsend to philippa for there seemed no great probability of her having one of her own and she wisely regarded the possession of dorothy as a special kindness of providence and did not worry her mind at all as to dorothys possible origin  being a tender and impulsive creature she loved her husband without criticism exhaustively and religiously and the child not much otherwise  she watched the little foundling as if she had been her own by nature and dorothy became a great solace to her when her husband was absent on pleasure or business and when he came home he looked pleased to see how the two had won each others hearts  sir ashley would kiss his wife and his wife would kiss little dorothy and little dorothy would kiss sir ashley and after this triangular burst of affection lady mottisfont would say dear mei forget she is not mine  what does it matter her husband would reply  providence is foreknowing  he has sent us this one because he is not intending to send us one by any other channel  their life was of the simplest  since his travels the baronet had taken to sporting and farming while philippa was a pattern of domesticity their pleasures were all local  they retired early to rest and rose with the carthorses and whistling waggoners  they knew the names of every bird and tree not exceptionally uncommon and could foretell the weather almost as well as anxious farmers and old people with corns  one day sir ashley mottisfont received a letter which he read and musingly laid down on the table without remark  what is it dearest asked his wife glancing at the sheet  oh it is from an old lawyer at bath whom i used to know  he reminds me of something i said to him four or five years agosome little time before we were marriedabout dorothy  what about her  it was a casual remark i made to him when i thought you might not take kindly to her that if he knew a lady who was anxious to adopt a child and could insure a good home to dorothy he was to let me know  but that was when you had nobody to take care of her she said quickly how absurd of him to write now  does he know you are married  he must surely  oh yes  he handed her the letter  the solicitor stated that a widowlady of position who did not at present wish her name to be disclosed had lately become a client of his while taking the waters and had mentioned to him that she would like a little girl to bring up as her own if she could be certain of finding one of good and pleasing disposition and the better to insure this she would not wish the child to be too young for judging her qualities  he had remembered sir ashleys observation to him a long while ago and therefore brought the matter before him  it would be an excellent home for the little girlof that he was positiveif she had not already found such a home  but it is absurd of the man to write so long after said lady mottisfont with a lumpiness about the back of her throat as she thought how much dorothy had become to her  i suppose it was when you firstfound herthat you told him this  exactlyit was then  he fell into thought and neither sir ashley nor lady mottisfont took the trouble to answer the lawyers letter and so the matter ended for the time  one day at dinner on their return from a short absence in town whither they had gone to see what the world was doing hear what it was saying and to make themselves generally fashionable after rusticating for so longon this occasion i say they learnt from some friend who had joined them at dinner that fernell hallthe manorial house of the estate next their own which had been offered on lease by reason of the impecuniosity of its ownerhad been taken for a term by a widow lady an italian contessa whose name i will not mention for certain reasons which may by and by appear  lady mottisfont expressed her surprise and interest at the probability of having such a neighbour  though if i had been born in italy i think i should have liked to remain there she said  she is not italian though her husband was said sir ashley  oh you have heard about her before now  yes they were talking of her at greys the other evening  she is english  and then as her husband said no more about the lady the friend who was dining with them told lady mottisfont that the countesss father had speculated largely in eastindia stock in which immense fortunes were being made at that time through this his daughter had found herself enormously wealthy at his death which had occurred only a few weeks after the death of her husband  it was supposed that the marriage of an enterprising english speculators daughter to a poor foreign nobleman had been matter of arrangement merely  as soon as the countesss widowhood was a little further advanced she would no doubt be the mark of all the schemers who came near her for she was still quite young  but at present she seemed to desire quiet and avoided society and town  some weeks after this time sir ashley mottisfont sat looking fixedly at his lady for many moments  he said  it might have been better for dorothy if the countess had taken her  she is so wealthy in comparison with ourselves and could have ushered the girl into the great world more effectually than we ever shall be able to do  the contessa take dorothy said lady mottisfont with a start  whatwas she the lady who wished to adopt her  yes she was staying at bath when lawyer gayton wrote to me  but how do you know all this ashley  he showed a little hesitation  oh ive seen her he says  you know she drives to the meet sometimes though she does not ride and she has informed me that she was the lady who inquired of gayton  you have talked to her as well as seen her then  oh yes several times everybody has  why didnt you tell me says his lady  i had quite forgotten to call upon her  ill go tomorrow or soon    but i cant think ashley how you can say that it might have been better for dorothy to have gone to her she is so much our own now that i cannot admit any such conjectures as those even in jest  her eyes reproached him so eloquently that sir ashley mottisfont did not answer  lady mottisfont did not hunt any more than the angloitalian countess did indeed she had become so absorbed in household matters and in dorothys wellbeing that she had no mind to waste a minute on mere enjoyments  as she had said to talk coolly of what might have been the best destination in days past for a child to whom they had become so attached seemed quite barbarous and she could not understand how her husband should consider the point so abstractedly for as will probably have been guessed lady mottisfont long before this time if she had not done so at the very beginning divined sir ashleys true relation to dorothy  but the baronets wife was so discreetly meek and mild that she never told him of her surmise and took what heaven had sent her without cavil her generosity in this respect having been bountifully rewarded by the new life she found in her love for the little girl  her husband recurred to the same uncomfortable subject when a few days later they were speaking of travelling abroad  he said that it was almost a pity if they thought of going that they had not fallen in with the countesss wish  that lady had told him that she had met dorothy walking with her nurse and that she had never seen a child she liked so well  whatshe covets her still  how impertinent of the woman said lady mottisfont  she seems to do so    you see dearest philippa the advantage to dorothy would have been that the countess would have adopted her legally and have made her as her own daughter while we have not done thatwe are only bringing up and educating a poor child in charity  but ill adopt her fullymake her mine legally cried his wife in an anxious voice  how is it to be done  hm  he did not inform her but fell into thought and for reasons of her own his lady was restless and uneasy  the very next day lady mottisfont drove to fernell hall to pay the neglected call upon her neighbour  the countess was at home and received her graciously  but poor lady mottisfonts heart died within her as soon as she set eyes on her new acquaintance  such wonderful beauty of the fullydeveloped kind had never confronted her before inside the lines of a human face  she seemed to shine with every light and grace that woman can possess  her finished continental manners her expanded mind her ready wit composed a study that made the other poor lady sick for she and latterly sir ashley himself were rather rural in manners and she felt abashed by new sounds and ideas from without  she hardly knew three words in any language but her own while this divine creature though truly english had apparently whatever she wanted in the italian and french tongues to suit every impression which was considered a great improvement to speech in those days and indeed is by many considered as such in these  how very strange it was about the little girl the contessa said to lady mottisfont in her gay tones  i mean that the child the lawyer recommended should just before then have been adopted by you who are now my neighbour  how is she getting on  i must come and see her  do you still want her asks lady mottisfont suspiciously  oh i should like to have her  but you cant  shes mine said the other greedily  a drooping manner appeared in the countess from that moment  lady mottisfont too was in a wretched mood all the way home that day the countess was so charming in every way that she had charmed her gentle ladyship how should it be possible that she had failed to charm sir ashley  moreover she had awakened a strange thought in philippas mind as soon as she reached home she rushed to the nursery and there seizing dorothy frantically kissed her then holding her at arms length she gazed with a piercing inquisitiveness into the girls lineaments  she sighed deeply abandoned the wondering dorothy and hastened away  she had seen there not only her husbands traits which she had often beheld before but others of the shade shape and expression which characterized those of her new neighbour  then this poor lady perceived the whole perturbing sequence of things and asked herself how she could have been such a walking piece of simplicity as not to have thought of this before  but she did not stay long upbraiding herself for her shortsightedness so overwhelmed was she with misery at the spectacle of herself as an intruder between these  to be sure she could not have foreseen such a conjuncture but that did not lessen her grief  the woman who had been both her husbands bliss and his backsliding had reappeared free when he was no longer so and she evidently was dying to claim her own in the person of dorothy who had meanwhile grown to be to lady mottisfont almost the only source of each days happiness supplying her with something to watch over inspiring her with the sense of maternity and so largely reflecting her husbands nature as almost to deceive her into the pleasant belief that she reflected her own also  if there was a single direction in which this devoted and virtuous lady erred it was in the direction of oversubmissiveness  when all is said and done and the truth told men seldom show much selfsacrifice in their conduct as lords and masters to helpless women bound to them for life and perhaps though i say it with all uncertainty if she had blazed up in his face like a furzefaggot directly he came home she might have helped herself a little  but god knows whether this is a true supposition at any rate she did no such thing and waited and prayed that she might never do despite to him who she was bound to admit had always been tender and courteous towards her and hoped that little dorothy might never be taken away  by degrees the two households became friendly and very seldom did a week pass without their seeing something of each other  try as she might and dangerous as she assumed the acquaintanceship to be lady mottisfont could detect no fault or flaw in her new friend  it was obvious that dorothy had been the magnet which had drawn the contessa hither and not sir ashley  such beauty united with such understanding and brightness philippa had never before known in one of her own sex and she tried to think whether she succeeded i do not know that she did not mind the propinquity since a woman so rich so fair and with such a command of suitors could not desire to wreck the happiness of so inoffensive a person as herself  the season drew on when it was the custom for families of distinction to go off to the bath and sir ashley mottisfont persuaded his wife to accompany him thither with dorothy  everybody of any note was there this year  from their own part of england came many that they knew among the rest lord and lady purbeck the earl and countess of wessex sir john grebe the drenkhards lady stourvale the old duke of hamptonshire the bishop of melchester the dean of exonbury and other lesser lights of court pulpit and field  thither also came the fair contessa whom as soon as philippa saw how much she was sought after by younger men she could not conscientiously suspect of renewed designs upon sir ashley  but the countess had finer opportunities than ever with dorothy for lady mottisfont was often indisposed and even at other times could not honestly hinder an intercourse which gave bright ideas to the child dorothy welcomed her new acquaintance with a strange and instinctive readiness that intimated the wonderful subtlety of the threads which bind flesh and flesh together  at last the crisis came it was precipitated by an accident  dorothy and her nurse had gone out one day for an airing leaving lady mottisfont alone indoors  while she sat gloomily thinking that in all likelihood the countess would contrive to meet the child somewhere and exchange a few tender words with her sir ashley mottisfont rushed in and informed her that dorothy had just had the narrowest possible escape from death some workmen were undermining a house to pull it down for rebuilding when without warning the front wall inclined slowly outwards for its fall the nurse and child passing beneath it at the same moment  the fall was temporarily arrested by the scaffolding while in the meantime the countess had witnessed their imminent danger from the other side of the street  springing across she snatched dorothy from under the wall and pulled the nurse after her the middle of the way being barely reached before they were enveloped in the dense dust of the descending mass though not a stone touched them  where is dorothy says the excited lady mottisfont  she has hershe wont let her go for a time  has her  but shes mineshes mine cries lady mottisfont  then her quick and tender eyes perceived that her husband had almost forgotten her intrusive existence in contemplating the oneness of dorothys the countesss and his own he was in a dream of exaltation which recognized nothing necessary to his wellbeing outside that welded circle of three lives  dorothy was at length brought home she was much fascinated by the countess and saw nothing tragic but rather all that was truly delightful in what had happened  in the evening when the excitement was over and dorothy was put to bed sir ashley said she has saved dorothy and i have been asking myself what i can do for her as a slight acknowledgment of her heroism  surely we ought to let her have dorothy to bring up since she still desires to do it  it would be so much to dorothys advantage  we ought to look at it in that light and not selfishly  philippa seized his hand  ashley ashley  you dont mean itthat i must lose my pretty darlingthe only one i have  she met his gaze with her piteous mouth and wet eyes so painfully strained that he turned away his face  the next morning before dorothy was awake lady mottisfont stole to the girls bedside and sat regarding her  when dorothy opened her eyes she fixed them for a long time upon philippas features  mammayou are not so pretty as the contessa are you she said at length  i am not dorothy  why are you not mamma  dorothywhere would you rather live always with me or with her  the little girl looked troubled  i am sorry mamma i dont mean to be unkind but i would rather live with her i mean if i might without trouble and you did not mind and it could be just the same to us all you know  has she ever asked you the same question  never mamma  there lay the sting of it the countess seemed the soul of honour and fairness in this matter test her as she might  that afternoon lady mottisfont went to her husband with singular firmness upon her gentle face  ashley we have been married nearly five years and i have never challenged you with what i know perfectly wellthe parentage of dorothy  never have you philippa dear  though i have seen that you knew from the first  from the first as to her father not as to her mother  her i did not know for some time but i know now  ah you have discovered that too says he without much surprise  could i help it  very well that being so i have thought it over and i have spoken to dorothy  i agree to her going  i can do no less than grant to the countess her wish after her kindness to myyourherchild  then this selfsacrificing woman went hastily away that he might not see that her heart was bursting and thereupon before they left the city dorothy changed her mother and her home  after this the countess went away to london for a while taking dorothy with her and the baronet and his wife returned to their lonely place at deansleigh park without her  to renounce dorothy in the bustle of bath was a different thing from living without her in this quiet home  one evening sir ashley missed his wife from the suppertable her manner had been so pensive and woeful of late that he immediately became alarmed  he said nothing but looked about outside the house narrowly and discerned her form in the park where recently she had been accustomed to walk alone  in its lower levels there was a pool fed by a trickling brook and he reached this spot in time to hear a splash  running forward he dimly perceived her light gown floating in the water  to pull her out was the work of a few instants and bearing her indoors to her room he undressed her nobody in the house knowing of the incident but himself  she had not been immersed long enough to lose her senses and soon recovered  she owned that she had done it because the contessa had taken away her child as she persisted in calling dorothy  her husband spoke sternly to her and impressed upon her the weakness of giving way thus when all that had happened was for the best  she took his reproof meekly and admitted her fault  after that she became more resigned but he often caught her in tears over some doll shoe or ribbon of dorothys and decided to take her to the north of england for change of air and scene  this was not without its beneficial effect corporeally no less than mentally as later events showed but she still evinced a preternatural sharpness of ear at the most casual mention of the child  when they reached home the countess and dorothy were still absent from the neighbouring fernell hall but in a month or two they returned and a little later sir ashley mottisfont came into his wifes room full of news  wellwould you think it philippa  after being so desperate too about getting dorothy to be with her  ahwhat  our neighbour the countess is going to be married again  it is to somebody she has met in london  lady mottisfont was much surprised she had never dreamt of such an event  the conflict for the possession of dorothys person had obscured the possibility of it yet what more likely the countess being still under thirty and so goodlooking  what is of still more interest to us or to you continued her husband is a kind offer she has made  she is willing that you should have dorothy back again  seeing what a grief the loss of her has been to you she will try to do without her  it is not for that it is not to oblige me said lady mottisfont quickly  one can see well enough what it is for  well never mind beggars mustnt be choosers  the reason or motive is nothing to us so that you obtain your desire  i am not a beggar any longer said lady mottisfont with proud mystery  what do you mean by that  lady mottisfont hesitated  however it was only too plain that she did not now jump at a restitution of one for whom some months before she had been breaking her heart  the explanation of this change of mood became apparent some little time farther on  lady mottisfont after five years of wedded life was expecting to become a mother and the aspect of many things was greatly altered in her view  among the more important changes was that of no longer feeling dorothy to be absolutely indispensable to her existence  meanwhile in view of her coming marriage the countess decided to abandon the remainder of her term at fernell hall and return to her pretty little house in town  but she could not do this quite so quickly as she had expected and half a year or more elapsed before she finally quitted the neighbourhood the interval being passed in alternations between the country and london  prior to her last departure she had an interview with sir ashley mottisfont and it occurred three days after his wife had presented him with a son and heir  i wanted to speak to you said the countess looking him luminously in the face about the dear foundling i have adopted temporarily and thought to have adopted permanently  but my marriage makes it too risky  i thought it might be that he answered regarding her steadfastly back again and observing two tears come slowly into her eyes as she heard her own voice describe dorothy in those words  dont criticize me she said hastily and recovering herself went on if lady mottisfont could take her back again as i suggested it would be better for me and certainly no worse for dorothy  to every one but ourselves she is but a child i have taken a fancy to and lady mottisfont coveted her so much and was very reluctant to let her go    i am sure she will adopt her again she added anxiously  i will sound her afresh said the baronet  you leave dorothy behind for the present  yes although i go away i do not give up the house for another month  he did not speak to his wife about the proposal till some few days after when lady mottisfont had nearly recovered and news of the countesss marriage in london had just reached them  he had no sooner mentioned dorothys name than lady mottisfont showed symptoms of disquietude  i have not acquired any dislike of dorothy she said but i feel that there is one nearer to me now  dorothy chose the alternative of going to the countess you must remember when i put it to her as between the countess and myself  but my dear philippa how can you argue thus about a child and that child our dorothy  not ours said his wife pointing to the cot  ours is here  what then philippa he said surprised you wont have her back after nearly dying of grief at the loss of her  i cannot argue dear ashley  i should prefer not to have the responsibility of dorothy again  her place is filled now  her husband sighed and went out of the chamber  there had been a previous arrangement that dorothy should be brought to the house on a visit that day but instead of taking her up to his wife he did not inform lady mottisfont of the childs presence  he entertained her himself as well as he could and accompanied her into the park where they had a ramble together  presently he sat down on the root of an elm and took her upon his knee  between this husband and this baby little dorothy you who had two homes are left out in the cold he said  cant i go to london with my pretty mamma said dorothy perceiving from his manner that there was a hitch somewhere  i am afraid not my child  she only took you to live with her because she was lonely you know  then cant i stay at deansleigh park with my other mamma and you  i am afraid that cannot be done either said he sadly  we have a baby in the house now  he closed the reply by stooping down and kissing her there being a tear in his eye  then nobody wants me said dorothy pathetically  oh yes somebody wants you he assured her  where would you like to live besides  dorothys experiences being rather limited she mentioned the only other place in the world that she was acquainted with the cottage of the villager who had taken care of her before lady mottisfont had removed her to the manor house  yes thats where youll be best off and most independent he answered and ill come to see you my dear girl and bring you pretty things and perhaps youll be just as happy there  nevertheless when the change came and dorothy was handed over to the kind cottagewoman the poor child missed the luxurious roominess of fernell hall and deansleigh and for a long time her little feet which had been accustomed to carpets and oak floors suffered from the cold of the stone flags on which it was now her lot to live and to play while chilblains came upon her fingers with washing at the pump  but thicker shoes with nails in them somewhat remedied the cold feet and her complaints and tears on this and other scores diminished to silence as she became inured anew to the hardships of the farmcottage and she grew up robust if not handsome  she was never altogether lost sight of by sir ashley though she was deprived of the systematic education which had been devised and begun for her by lady mottisfont as well as by her other mamma the enthusiastic countess  the latter soon had other dorothys to think of who occupied her time and affection as fully as lady mottisfonts were occupied by her precious boy  in the course of time the doublydesired and doublyrejected dorothy married i believe a respectable roadcontractorthe same if i mistake not who repaired and improved the old highway running from wintoncester southwesterly through the new forestand in the heart of this worthy man of business the poor girl found the nest which had been denied her by her own flesh and blood of higher degree        several of the listeners wished to hear another story from the sentimental member after this but he said that he could recall nothing else at the moment and that it seemed to him as if his friend on the other side of the fireplace had something to say from the look of his face  the member alluded to was a respectable churchwarden with a sly chink to one eyelidpossibly the result of an accidentand a regular attendant at the club meetings  he replied that his looks had been mainly caused by his interest in the two ladies of the last story apparently women of strong motherly instincts even though they were not genuinely staunch in their tenderness  the tale had brought to his mind an instance of a firmer affection of that sort on the paternal side in a nature otherwise culpable  as for telling the story his manner was much against him he feared but he would do his best if they wished  here the president interposed with a suggestion that as it was getting late in the afternoon it would be as well to adjourn to their respective inns and lodgings for dinner after which those who cared to do so could return and resume these curious domestic traditions for the remainder of the evening which might otherwise prove irksome enough  the curator had told him that the room was at their service  the churchwarden who was beginning to feel hungry himself readily acquiesced and the club separated for an hour and a half  then the faithful ones began to drop in againamong whom were not the president neither came the rural dean nor the two curates though the colonel and the man of family cigars in mouth were good enough to return having found their hotel dreary  the museum had no regular means of illumination and a solitary candle less powerful than the rays of the fire was placed on the table also bottles and glasses provided by some thoughtful member  the chinkeyed churchwarden now thoroughly primed proceeded to relate in his own terms what was in substance as follows while many of his listeners smoked     dame the fifththe lady icenway by the churchwarden   in the reign of his most excellent majesty king george the third defender of the faith and of the american colonies there lived in a faire manerplace so leland called it in his day as i have been told in one o the greenest bits of woodland between bristol and the city of exonbury a young lady who resembled some aforesaid ones in having many talents and exceeding great beauty  with these gifts she combined a somewhat imperious temper and arbitrary mind though her experience of the world was not actually so large as her conclusive manner would have led the stranger to suppose  being an orphan she resided with her uncle who though he was fairly considerate as to her welfare left her pretty much to herself  now it chanced that when this lovely young lady was about nineteen she being a fearless horsewoman was riding with only a young lad as an attendant in one o the woods near her uncles house and in trotting along her horse stumbled over the root of a felled tree  she slipped to the ground not seriously hurt and was assisted home by a gentleman who came in view at the moment of her mishap  it turned out that this gentleman a total stranger to her was on a visit at the house of a neighbouring landowner  he was of dutch extraction and occasionally came to england on business or pleasure from his plantations in guiana on the north coast of south america where he usually resided  on this account he was naturally but little known in wessex and was but a slight acquaintance of the gentleman at whose mansion he was a guest however the friendship between him and the heymeresas the uncle and niece were namedwarmed and warmed by degrees there being but few folk o note in the vicinity at that time which made a newcomer if he were at all sociable and of good credit always sure of a welcome  a tender feeling as it is called by the romantic sprang up between the two young people which ripened into intimacy  anderling the foreign gentleman was of an amorous temperament and though he endeavoured to conceal his feeling it could be seen that miss maria heymere had impressed him rather more deeply than would be represented by a scratch upon a stone he seemed absolutely unable to free himself from her fascination and his inability to do so much as he triedevidently thinking he had not the ghost of a chance with hergave her the pleasure of power though she more than sympathized when she overheard him heaving his deep drawn sighsprivately to himself as he supposed  after prolonging his visit by every conceivable excuse in his power he summoned courage and offered her his hand and his heart  being in no way disinclined to him though not so fervid as he and her uncle making no objection to the match she consented to share his fate for better or otherwise in the distant colony where as he assured her his rice and coffee and maize and timber produced him ample meansa statement which was borne out by his friend her uncles neighbour  in short a day for their marriage was fixed earlier in the engagement than is usual or desirable between comparative strangers by reason of the necessity he was under of returning to look after his properties  the wedding took place and maria left her uncles mansion with her husband going in the first place to london and about a fortnight after sailing with him across the great ocean for their distant homewhich however he assured her should not be her home for long it being his intention to dispose of his interests in this part of the world as soon as the war was over and he could do so advantageously when they could come to europe and reside in some favourite capital  as they advanced on the voyage she observed that he grew more and more constrained and by the time they had crossed the line he was quite depressed just as he had been before proposing to her  a day or two before landing at paramaribo he embraced her in a very tearful and passionate manner and said he wished to make a confession  it had been his misfortune he said to marry at quebec in early life a woman whose reputation proved to be in every way bad and scandalous  the discovery had nearly killed him but he had ultimately separated from her and had never seen her since  he had hoped and prayed she might be dead but recently in london when they were starting on this journey he had discovered that she was still alive  at first he had decided to keep this dark intelligence from her beloved ears but he had felt that he could not do it  all he hoped was that such a condition of things would make no difference in her feelings for him as it need make no difference in the course of their lives  thereupon the spirit of this proud and masterful lady showed itself in violent turmoil like the raging of a norwest thunderstormas well it might god knows  but she was of too stout a nature to be broken down by his revelation as many ladies of my acquaintance would have beenso far from home and right under the line in the blaze o the sun  of the two indeed he was the more wretched and shattered in spirit for he loved her deeply and there being a foreign twist in his make had been tempted to this crime by her exceeding beauty against which he had struggled day and night till he had no further resistance left in him it was she who came first to a decision as to what should be donewhether a wise one i do not attempt to judge  i put it to you says she when many useless selfreproaches and protestations on his part had been utteredi put it to you whether if any manliness is left in you you ought not to do exactly what i consider the best thing for me in this strait to which you have reduced me  he promised to do anything in the whole world  she then requested him to allow her to return and announce him as having died of malignant ague immediately on their arrival at paramaribo that she should consequently appear in weeds as his widow in her native place and that he would never molest her or come again to that part of the world during the whole course of his lifea good reason for which would be that the legal consequences might be serious  he readily acquiesced in this as he would have acquiesced in anything for the restitution of one he adored so deeplyeven to the yielding of life itself  to put her in an immediate state of independence he gave her in bonds and jewels a considerable sum for his worldly means had been in no way exaggerated and by the next ship she sailed again for england having travelled no farther than to paramaribo  at parting he declared it to be his intention to turn all his landed possessions into personal property and to be a wanderer on the face of the earth in remorse for his conduct towards her  maria duly arrived in england and immediately on landing apprised her uncle of her return duly appearing at his house in the garb of a widow she was commiserated by all the neighbours as soon as her story was told but only to her uncle did she reveal the real state of affairs and her reason for concealing it  for though she had been innocent of wrong marias pride was of that grain which could not brook the least appearance of having been fooled or deluded or nonplussed in her worldly aims  for some time she led a quiet life with her relative and in due course a son was born to her  she was much respected for her dignity and reserve and the portable wealth which her temporary husband had made over to her enabled her to live in comfort in a wing of the mansion without assistance from her uncle at all  but knowing that she was not what she seemed to be her life was an uneasy one and she often said to herself suppose his continued existence should become known here and people should discern the pride of my motive in hiding my humiliation  it would be worse than if i had been frank at first which i should have been but for the credit of this child  such grave reflections as these occupied her with increasing force and during their continuance she encountered a worthy man of noble birth and titlelord icenway his namewhose seat was beyond wintoncester quite at tother end of wessex  he being anxious to pay his addresses to her maria willingly accepted them though he was a plain man older than herself for she discerned in a remarriage a method of fortifying her position against mortifying discoveries  in a few months their union took place and maria lifted her head as lady icenway and left with her husband and child for his home as aforesaid where she was quite unknown  a justification or a condemnation of her step according as you view it was seen when not long after she received a note from her former husband anderling  it was a hasty and tender epistle and perhaps it was fortunate that it arrived during the temporary absence of lord icenway his worthless wife said anderling had just died in quebec he had gone there to ascertain particulars and had seen the unfortunate woman buried  he now was hastening to england to repair the wrong he had done his maria  he asked her to meet him at southampton his port of arrival which she need be in no fear of doing as he had changed his name and was almost absolutely unknown in europe  he would remarry her immediately and live with her in any part of the continent as they had originally intended where for the great love he still bore her he would devote himself to her service for the rest of his days  lady icenway selfpossessed as it was her nature to be was yet much disturbed at this news and set off to meet him unattended as soon as she heard that the ship was in sight  as soon as they stood face to face she found that she still possessed all her old influence over him though his power to fascinate her had quite departed  in his sorrow for his offence against her he had become a man of strict religious habits self denying as a lenten saint though formerly he had been a free and joyous liver  having first got him to swear to make her any amends she should choose which he was imagining must be by a true marriage she informed him that she had already wedded another husband an excellent man of ancient family and possessions who had given her a title in which she much rejoiced  at this the countenance of the poor foreign gentleman became cold as clay and his heart withered within him for as it had been her beauty and bearing which had led him to sin to obtain her so now that her beauty was in fuller bloom and her manner more haughty by her success did he feel her fascination to be almost more than he could bear nevertheless having sworn his word he undertook to obey her commands which were simply a renewal of her old requestthat he would depart for some foreign country and never reveal his existence to her friends or husband or any person in england never trouble her more seeing how great a harm it would do her in the high position which she at present occupied  he bowed his head  and the childour child he said  he is well says she  quite well  with this the unhappy gentleman departed much sadder in his heart than on his voyage to england for it had never occurred to him that a woman who rated her honour so highly as maria had done and who was the mother of a child of his would have adopted such means as this for the restoration of that honour and at so surprisingly early a date  he had fully calculated on making her his wife in law and truth and of living in cheerful unity with her and his offspring for whom he felt a deep and growing tenderness though he had never once seen the child  the lady returned to her mansion beyond wintoncester and told nothing of the interview to her noble husband who had fortunately gone that day to do a little cocking and ratting out by weydon priors and knew nothing of her movements  she had dismissed her poor anderling peremptorily enough yet she would often after this look in the face of the child of her so called widowhood to discover what and how many traits of his father were to be seen in his lineaments  for this she had ample opportunity during the following autumn and winter months her husband being a matterof fact nobleman who spent the greater part of his time in fieldsports and agriculture  one winter day when he had started for a meet of the hounds a long way from the houseit being his custom to hunt three or four times a week at this season of the yearshe had walked into the sunshine upon the terrace before the windows where there fell at her feet some little white object that had come over a boundary wall hard by  it proved to be a tiny note wrapped round a stone  lady icenway opened it and read it and immediately no doubt with a stern fixture of her queenly countenance walked hastily along the terrace and through the door into the shrubbery whence the note had come  the man who had first married her stood under the bushes before her  it was plain from his appearance that something had gone wrong with him  you notice a change in me my bestbeloved he said  yes mariai have lost all the wealth i once possessedmainly by reckless gambling in the continental hells to which you banished me  but one thing in the world remains to methe childand it is for him that i have intruded here  dont fear me darling  i shall not inconvenience you long i love you too well  but i think of the boy day and nighti cannot help iti cannot keep my feeling for him down and i long to see him and speak a word to him once in my lifetime  but your oath says she  you promised never to reveal by word or sign  i will reveal nothing  only let me see the child  i know what i have sworn to you cruel mistress and i respect my oath  otherwise i might have seen him by some subterfuge  but i preferred the frank course of asking your permission  she demurred with the haughty severity which had grown part of her character and which her elevation to the rank of a peeress had rather intensified than diminished  she said that she would consider and would give him an answer the day after the next at the same hour and place when her husband would again be absent with his pack of hounds  the gentleman waited patiently  lady icenway who had now no conscious love left for him well considered the matter and felt that it would be advisable not to push to extremes a man of so passionate a heart  on the day and hour she met him as she had promised to do  you shall see him she said of course on the strict condition that you do not reveal yourself and hence though you see him he must not see you or your manner might betray you and me  i will lull him into a nap in the afternoon and then i will come to you here and fetch you indoors by a private way  the unfortunate father whose misdemeanour had recoiled upon his own head in a way he could not have foreseen promised to adhere to her instructions and waited in the shrubberies till the moment when she should call him  this she duly did about three oclock that day leading him in by a garden door and upstairs to the nursery where the child lay he was in his little cot breathing calmly his arm thrown over his head and his silken curls crushed into the pillow  his father now almost to be pitied bent over him and a tear from his eye wetted the coverlet  she held up a warning finger as he lowered his mouth to the lips of the boy  but oh why not implored he  very well then said she relenting  but as gently as possible  he kissed the child without waking him turned gave him a last look and followed her out of the chamber when she conducted him off the premises by the way he had come  but this remedy for his sadness of heart at being a stranger to his own son had the effect of intensifying the malady for while originally not knowing or having ever seen the boy he had loved him vaguely and imaginatively only he now became attached to him in flesh and bone as any parent might and the feeling that he could at best only see his child at the rarest and most cursory moments if at all drove him into a state of distraction which threatened to overthrow his promise to the boys mother to keep out of his sight  but such was his chivalrous respect for lady icenway and his regret at having ever deceived her that he schooled his poor heart into submission  owing to his loneliness all the fervour of which he was capableand that was muchflowed now in the channel of parental and marital lovefor a child who did not know him and a woman who had ceased to love him  at length this singular punishment became such a torture to the poor foreigner that he resolved to lessen it at all hazards compatible with punctilious care for the name of the lady his former wife to whom his attachment seemed to increase in proportion to her punitive treatment of him  at one time of his life he had taken great interest in tulipculture as well as gardening in general and since the ruin of his fortunes and his arrival in england he had made of his knowledge a precarious income in the hothouses of nurserymen and others  with the new idea in his head he applied himself zealously to the business till he acquired in a few months great skill in horticulture  waiting till the noble lord his ladys husband had room for an undergardener of a general sort he offered himself for the place and was engaged immediately by reason of his civility and intelligence before lady icenway knew anything of the matter  much therefore did he surprise her when she found him in the conservatories of her mansion a week or two after his arrival  the punishment of instant dismissal with which at first she haughtily threatened him my lady thought fit on reflection not to enforce  while he served her thus she knew he would not harm her by a word while if he were expelled chagrin might induce him to reveal in a moment of exasperation what kind treatment would assist him to conceal  so he was allowed to remain on the premises and had for his residence a little cottage by the gardenwall which had been the domicile of some of his predecessors in the same occupation  here he lived absolutely alone and spent much of his leisure in reading but the greater part in watching the windows and lawns of his ladys house for glimpses of the form of the child  it was for that childs sake that he abandoned the tenets of the roman catholic church in which he had been reared and became the most regular attendant at the services in the parish place of worship hard by where sitting behind the pew of my lady my lord and his stepson the gardener could pensively study the traits and movements of the youngster at only a few feet distance without suspicion or hindrance  he filled his post for more than two years with a pleasure to himself which though mournful was soothing his lady never forgiving him or allowing him to be anything more than the gardener to her child though once or twice the boy said that gardeners eyes are so sad  why does he look so sadly at me  he sunned himself in her scornfulness as if it were love and his ears drank in her curt monosyllables as though they were rhapsodies of endearment  strangely enough the coldness with which she treated her foreigner began to be the conduct of lord icenway towards herself  it was a matter of great anxiety to him that there should be a lineal successor to the title yet no sign of that successor appeared one day he complained to her quite roughly of his fate  all will go to that dolt of a cousin he cried  id sooner see my name and place at the bottom of the sea  the lady soothed him and fell into thought and did not recriminate  but one day soon after she went down to the cottage of the gardener to inquire how he was getting on for he had been ailing of late though as was supposed not seriously  though she often visited the poor she had never entered her undergardeners home before and was much surprisedeven grieved and dismayedto find that he was too ill to rise from his bed  she went back to her mansion and returned with some delicate soup that she might have a reason for seeing him  his condition was so feeble and alarming and his face so thin that it quite shocked her softening heart and gazing upon him she said you must get wellyou must  i have been hard with youi know it  i will not be so again  the sick and dying manfor he was dying indeedtook her hand and pressed it to his lips  too late my darling too late he murmured  but you must not die  oh you must not she said  and on an impulse she bent down and whispered some words to him blushing as she had blushed in her maiden days  he replied by a faint wan smile  time was    but thats past he said i must die  and die he did a few days later as the sun was going down behind the gardenwall  her harshness seemed to come trebly home to her then and she remorsefully exclaimed against herself in secret and alone  her one desire now was to erect some tribute to his memory without its being recognized as her handiwork  in the completion of this scheme there arrived a few months later a handsome stainedglass window for the church and when it was unpacked and in course of erection lord icenway strolled into the building with his wife  erected to his memory by his grieving widow he said reading the legend on the glass  i didnt know that he had a wife ive never seen her  oh yes you must have icenway only you forget replied his lady blandly  but she didnt live with him and was seldom seen visiting him because there were differences between them which as is usually the case makes her all the more sorry now  and go ruining herself by this expensive rubyandazure glassdesign  she is not poor they say  as lord icenway grew older he became crustier and crustier and whenever he set eyes on his wifes boy by her other husband he would burst out morosely saying  tis a very odd thing my lady that you could oblige your first husband and couldnt oblige me  ah if i had only thought of it sooner she murmured  what said he  nothing dearest replied lady icenway        the colonel was the first to comment upon the churchwardens tale by saying that the fate of the poor fellow was rather a hard one  the gentlemantradesman could not see that his fate was at all too hard for him  he was legally nothing to her and he had served her shamefully  if he had been really her husband it would have stood differently  the bookworm remarked that lord icenway seemed to have been a very unsuspicious man with which view a fat member with a crimson face agreed  it was true his wife was a very closemouthed personage which made a difference  if she had spoken out recklessly her lord might have been suspicious enough as in the case of that lady who lived at stapleford park in their greatgrandfathers time  though there to be sure considerations arose which made her husband view matters with much philosophy  a few of the members doubted the possibility of this  the crimson man who was a retired maltster of comfortable means ventru and short in stature cleared his throat blew off his superfluous breath and proceeded to give the instance before alluded to of such possibility first apologizing for his heroines lack of a title it never having been his good fortune to know many of the nobility  to his style of narrative the following is only an approximation     dame the sixthsquire petricks lady by the crimson maltster   folk who are at all acquainted with the traditions of stapleford park will not need to be told that in the middle of the last century it was owned by that trump of mortgagees timothy petrick whose skill in gaining possession of fair estates by granting sums of money on their titledeeds has seldom if ever been equalled in our part of england timothy was a lawyer by profession and agent to several noblemen by which means his special line of business became opened to him by a sort of revelation  it is said that a relative of his a very deep thinker who afterwards had the misfortune to be transported for life for mistaken notions on the signing of a will taught him considerable legal lore which he creditably resolved never to throw away for the benefit of other people but to reserve it entirely for his own  however i have nothing in particular to say about his early and active days but rather of the time when an old man he had become the owner of vast estates by the means i have signifiedamong them the great manor of stapleford on which he lived in the splendid old mansion now pulled down likewise estates at marlott estates near sherton abbas nearly all the borough of millpool and many properties near ivell  indeed i cant call to mind half his landed possessions and i dont know that it matters much at this time of day seeing that hes been dead and gone many years  it is said that when he bought an estate he would not decide to pay the price till he had walked over every single acre with his own two feet and prodded the soil at every point with his own spud to test its quality which if we regard the extent of his properties must have been a stiff business for him  at the time i am speaking of he was a man over eighty and his son was dead but he had two grandsons the eldest of whom his namesake was married and was shortly expecting issue  just then the grandfather was taken ill for death as it seemed considering his age  by his will the old man had created an entail as i believe the lawyers call it devising the whole of the estates to his elder grandson and his issue male failing which to his younger grandson and his issue male failing which to remoter relatives who need not be mentioned now  while old timothy petrick was lying ill his elder grandsons wife annetta gave birth to her expected child who as fortune would have it was a son  timothy her husband through sprung of a scheming family was no great schemer himself he was the single one of the petricks then living whose heart had ever been greatly moved by sentiments which did not run in the groove of ambition and on this account he had not married well as the saying is his wife having been the daughter of a family of no better beginnings than his own that is to say her father was a country townsman of the professional class  but she was a very pretty woman by all accounts and her husband had seen courted and married her in a high tide of infatuation after a very short acquaintance and with very little knowledge of her hearts history  he had never found reason to regret his choice as yet and his anxiety for her recovery was great  she was supposed to be out of danger and herself and the child progressing well when there was a change for the worse and she sank so rapidly that she was soon given over  when she felt that she was about to leave him annetta sent for her husband and on his speedy entry and assurance that they were alone she made him solemnly vow to give the child every care in any circumstances that might arise if it should please heaven to take her  this of course he readily promised  then after some hesitation she told him that she could not die with a falsehood upon her soul and dire deceit in her life she must make a terrible confession to him before her lips were sealed for ever  she thereupon related an incident concerning the babys parentage which was not as he supposed  timothy petrick though a quickfeeling man was not of a sort to show nerves outwardly and he bore himself as heroically as he possibly could do in this trying moment of his life  that same night his wife died and while she lay dead and before her funeral he hastened to the bedside of his sick grandfather and revealed to him all that had happened the babys birth his wifes confession and her death beseeching the aged man as he loved him to bestir himself now at the eleventh hour and alter his will so as to dish the intruder  old timothy seeing matters in the same light as his grandson required no urging against allowing anything to stand in the way of legitimate inheritance he executed another will limiting the entail to timothy his grandson for life and his male heirs thereafter to be born after them to his other grandson edward and edwards heirs  thus the newlyborn infant who had been the centre of so many hopes was cut off and scorned as none of the elect  the old mortgagee lived but a short time after this the excitement of the discovery having told upon him considerably and he was gathered to his fathers like the most charitable man in his neighbourhood  both wife and grandparent being buried timothy settled down to his usual life as well as he was able mentally satisfied that he had by prompt action defeated the consequences of such dire domestic treachery as had been shown towards him and resolving to marry a second time as soon as he could satisfy himself in the choice of a wife  but men do not always know themselves  the embittered state of timothy petricks mind bred in him by degrees such a hatred and mistrust of womankind that though several specimens of high attractiveness came under his eyes he could not bring himself to the point of proposing marriage  he dreaded to take up the position of husband a second time discerning a trap in every petticoat and a slough of despond in possible heirs  what has happened once when all seemed so fair may happen again he said to himself  ill risk my name no more  so he abstained from marriage and overcame his wish for a lineal descendant to follow him in the ownership of stapleford  timothy had scarcely noticed the unfortunate child that his wife had borne after arranging for a meagre fulfilment of his promise to her to take care of the boy by having him brought up in his house occasionally remembering this promise he went and glanced at the child saw that he was doing well gave a few special directions and again went his solitary way  thus he and the child lived on in the stapleford mansionhouse till two or three years had passed by  one day he was walking in the garden and by some accident left his snuffbox on a bench  when he came back to find it he saw the little boy standing there he had escaped his nurse and was making a plaything of the box in spite of the convulsive sneezings which the game brought in its train then the man with the encrusted heart became interested in the little fellows persistence in his play under such discomforts he looked in the childs face saw there his wifes countenance though he did not see his own and fell into thought on the piteousness of childhoodparticularly of despised and rejected childhood like this before him  from that hour try as he would to counteract the feeling the human necessity to love something or other got the better of what he had called his wisdom and shaped itself in a tender anxiety for the youngster rupert  this name had been given him by his dying mother when at her request the child was baptized in her chamber lest he should not survive for public baptism and her husband had never thought of it as a name of any significance till about this time he learnt by accident that it was the name of the young marquis of christminster son of the duke of southwesterland for whom annetta had cherished warm feelings before her marriage  recollecting some wandering phrases in his wifes last words which he had not understood at the time he perceived at last that this was the person to whom she had alluded when affording him a clue to little ruperts history  he would sit in silence for hours with the child being no great speaker at the best of times but the boy on his part was too ready with his tongue for any break in discourse to arise because timothy petrick had nothing to say  after idling away his mornings in this manner petrick would go to his own room and swear in long loud whispers and walk up and down calling himself the most ridiculous dolt that ever lived and declaring that he would never go near the little fellow again to which resolve he would adhere for the space perhaps of a day  such cases are happily not new to human nature but there never was a case in which a man more completely befocled his former self than in this  as the child grew up timothys attachment to him grew deeper till rupert became almost the sole object for which he lived  there had been enough of the family ambition latent in him for timothy petrick to feel a little envy when some time before this date his brother edward had been accepted by the honourable harriet mountclere daughter of the second viscount of that name and title but having discovered as i have before stated the paternity of his boy rupert to lurk in even a higher stratum of society those envious feelings speedily dispersed  indeed the more he reflected thereon after his brothers aristocratic marriage the more content did he become  his late wife took softer outline in his memory as he thought of the lofty taste she had displayed though only a plain burghers daughter and the justification for his weakness in loving the childthe justification that he had longed forwas afforded now in the knowledge that the boy was by nature if not by name a representative of one of the noblest houses in england  she was a woman of grand instincts after all he said to himself proudly  to fix her choice upon the immediate successor in that ducal lineit was finely conceived  had he been of low blood like myself or my relations she would scarce have deserved the harsh measure that i have dealt out to her and her offspring  how much less then when such grovelling tastes were farthest from her soul  the man annetta loved was noble and my boy is noble in spite of me  the afterclap was inevitable and it soon came  so far he reasoned from cutting off this child from inheritance of my estates as i have done i should have rejoiced in the possession of him  he is of pure stock on one side at least whilst in the ordinary run of affairs he would have been a commoner to the bone  being a man whatever his faults of good old beliefs in the divinity of kings and those about em the more he overhauled the case in this light the more strongly did his poor wifes conduct in improving the blood and breed of the petrick family win his heart  he considered what ugly idle harddrinking scamps many of his own relations had been the miserable scriveners usurers and pawnbrokers that he had numbered among his forefathers and the probability that some of their bad qualities would have come out in a merely corporeal child to give him sorrow in his old age turn his black hairs gray his gray hairs white cut down every stick of timber and heaven knows what all had he not like a skilful gardener minded his grafting and changed the sort till at length this rightminded man fell down on his knees every night and morning and thanked god that he was not as other meanly descended fathers in such matters  it was in the peculiar disposition of the petrick family that the satisfaction which ultimately settled in timothys breast found nourishment  the petricks had adored the nobility and plucked them at the same time  that excellent man izaak waltons feelings about fish were much akin to those of old timothy petrick and of his descendants in a lesser degree concerning the landed aristocracy  to torture and to love simultaneously is a proceeding strange to reason but possible to practice as these instances show  hence when timothys brother edward said slightingly one day that timothys son was well enough but that he had nothing but shops and offices in his backward perspective while his own children should he have any would be far different in possessing such a mother as the honourable harriet timothy felt a bound of triumph within him at the power he possessed of contradicting that statement if he chose  so much was he interested in his boy in this new aspect that he now began to read up chronicles of the illustrious house ennobled as the dukes of southwesterland from their very beginning in the glories of the restoration of the blessed charles till the year of his own time  he mentally noted their gifts from royalty grants of lands purchases intermarriages plantings and buildings more particularly their political and military achievements which had been great and their performances in art and letters which had been by no means contemptible he studied prints of the portraits of that family and then like a chemist watching a crystallization began to examine young ruperts face for the unfolding of those historic curves and shades that the painters vandyke and lely had perpetuated on canvas  when the boy reached the most fascinating age of childhood and his shouts of laughter ran through stapleford house from end to end the remorse that oppressed timothy petrick knew no bounds  of all people in the world this rupert was the one on whom he could have wished the estates to devolve yet rupert by timothys own desperate strategy at the time of his birth had been ousted from all inheritance of them and since he did not mean to remarry the manors would pass to his brother and his brothers children who would be nothing to him whose boasted pedigree on one side would be nothing to his ruperts  had he only left the first will of his grandfather alone  his mind ran on the wills continually both of which were in existence and the first the cancelled one in his own possession  night after night when the servants were all abed and the click of safety locks sounded as loud as a crash he looked at that first will and wished it had been the second and not the first  the crisis came at last  one night after having enjoyed the boys company for hours he could no longer bear that his beloved rupert should be dispossessed and he committed the felonious deed of altering the date of the earlier will to a fortnight later which made its execution appear subsequent to the date of the second will already proved  he then boldly propounded the first will as the second  his brother edward submitted to what appeared to be not only incontestible fact but a far more likely disposition of old timothys property for like many others he had been much surprised at the limitations defined in the other will having no clue to their cause  he joined his brother timothy in setting aside the hitherto accepted document and matters went on in their usual course there being no dispositions in the substituted will differing from those in the other except such as related to a future which had not yet arrived  the years moved on  rupert had not yet revealed the anxiously expected historic lineaments which should foreshadow the political abilities of the ducal family aforesaid when it happened on a certain day that timothy petrick made the acquaintance of a wellknown physician of budmouth who had been the medical adviser and friend of the late mrs petricks family for many years though after annettas marriage and consequent removal to stapleford he had seen no more of her the neighbouring practitioner who attended the petricks having then become her doctor as a matter of course  timothy was impressed by the insight and knowledge disclosed in the conversation of the budmouth physician and the acquaintance ripening to intimacy the physician alluded to a form of hallucination to which annettas mother and grandmother had been subjectthat of believing in certain dreams as realities  he delicately inquired if timothy had ever noticed anything of the sort in his wife during her lifetime he the physician had fancied that he discerned germs of the same peculiarity in annetta when he attended her in her girlhood  one explanation begat another till the dumbfoundered timothy petrick was persuaded in his own mind that annettas confession to him had been based on a delusion  you look down in the mouth said the doctor pausing  a bit unmanned  tis unexpectedlike sighed timothy  but he could hardly believe it possible and thinking it best to be frank with the doctor told him the whole story which till now he had never related to living man save his dying grandfather  to his surprise the physician informed him that such a form of delusion was precisely what he would have expected from annettas antecedents at such a physical crisis in her life  petrick prosecuted his inquiries elsewhere and the upshot of his labours was briefly that a comparison of dates and places showed irrefutably that his poor wifes assertion could not possibly have foundation in fact  the young marquis of her tender passiona highly moral and bright minded noblemanhad gone abroad the year before annettas marriage and had not returned till after her death  the young girls love for him had been a delicate ideal dreamno more  timothy went home and the boy ran out to meet him whereupon a strangely dismal feeling of discontent took possession of his soul  after all then there was nothing but plebeian blood in the veins of the heir to his name and estates he was not to be succeeded by a noblenatured line to be sure rupert was his son but that glory and halo he believed him to have inherited from the ages outshining that of his brothers children had departed from ruperts brow for ever he could no longer read history in the boys face and centuries of domination in his eyes  his manner towards his son grew colder and colder from that day forward and it was with bitterness of heart that he discerned the characteristic features of the petricks unfolding themselves by degrees  instead of the elegant knifeedged nose so typical of the dukes of southwesterland there began to appear on his face the broad nostril and hollow bridge of his grandfather timothy  no illustrious line of politicians was promised a continuator in that graying blue eye for it was acquiring the expression of the orb of a particularly objectionable cousin of his own and instead of the mouthcurves which had thrilled parliamentary audiences in speeches now bound in calf in every wellordered library there was the bulllip of that very uncle of his who had had the misfortune with the signature of a gentlemans will and had been transported for life in consequence  to think how he himself too had sinned in this same matter of a will for this mere fleshly reproduction of a wretched old uncle whose very name he wished to forget  the boys christian name even was an imposture and an irony for it implied hereditary force and brilliancy to which he plainly would never attain  the consolation of real sonship was always left him certainly but he could not help groaning to himself why cannot a son be ones own and somebody elses likewise  the marquis was shortly afterwards in the neighbourhood of stapleford and timothy petrick met him and eyed his noble countenance admiringly the next day when petrick was in his study somebody knocked at the door  whos there  rupert  ill rupert thee you young impostor  say only a poor commonplace petrick his father grunted  why didnt you have a voice like the marquiss i saw yesterday he continued as the lad came in  why havent you his looks and a way of commanding as if youd done it for centurieshey  why  how can you expect it father when im not related to him  ugh  then you ought to be growled his father        as the narrator paused the surgeon the colonel the historian the spark and others exclaimed that such subtle and instructive psychological studies as this now that psychology was so much in demand were precisely the tales they desired as members of a scientific club and begged the mastermaltster to tell another curious mental delusion  the maltster shook his head and feared he was not genteel enough to tell another story with a sufficiently moral tone in it to suit the club he would prefer to leave the next to a better man  the colonel had fallen into reflection  true it was he observed that the more dreamy and impulsive nature of woman engendered within her erratic fancies which often started her on strange tracks only to abandon them in sharp revulsion at the dictates of her common sensesometimes with ludicrous effect  events which had caused a ladys action to set in a particular direction might continue to enforce the same line of conduct while she like a mangle would start on a sudden in a contrary course and end where she began  the vicepresident laughed and applauded the colonel adding that there surely lurked a story somewhere behind that sentiment if he were not much mistaken  the colonel fixed his face to a good narrative pose and went on without further preamble     dame the seventhanna lady baxby by the colonel   it was in the time of the great civil warif i should not rather as a loyal subject call it with clarendon the great rebellion  it was i say at that unhappy period of our history that towards the autumn of a particular year the parliament forces sat down before sherton castle with over seven thousand foot and four pieces of cannon  the castle as we all know was in that century owned and occupied by one of the earls of severn and garrisoned for his assistance by a certain noble marquis who commanded the kings troops in these parts  the said earl as well as the young lord baxby his eldest son were away from home just now raising forces for the king elsewhere  but there were present in the castle when the besiegers arrived before it the sons fair wife lady baxby and her servants together with some friends and near relatives of her husband and the defence was so good and wellconsidered that they anticipated no great danger  the parliamentary forces were also commanded by a noble lordfor the nobility were by no means at this stage of the war all on the kings sideand it had been observed during his approach in the nighttime and in the morning when the reconnoitring took place that he appeared sad and much depressed  the truth was that by a strange freak of destiny it had come to pass that the stronghold he was set to reduce was the home of his own sister whom he had tenderly loved during her maidenhood and whom he loved now in spite of the estrangement which had resulted from hostilities with her husbands family  he believed too that notwithstanding this cruel division she still was sincerely attached to him  his hesitation to point his ordnance at the walls was inexplicable to those who were strangers to his family history  he remained in the field on the north side of the castle called by his name to this day because of his encampment there till it occurred to him to send a messenger to his sister anna with a letter in which he earnestly requested her as she valued her life to steal out of the place by the little gate to the south and make away in that direction to the residence of some friends  shortly after he saw to his great surprise coming from the front of the castle walls a lady on horseback with a single attendant  she rode straight forward into the field and up the slope to where his army and tents were spread  it was not till she got quite near that he discerned her to be his sister anna and much was he alarmed that she should have run such risk as to sally out in the face of his forces without knowledge of their proceedings when at any moment their first discharge might have burst forth to her own destruction in such exposure  she dismounted before she was quite close to him and he saw that her familiar face though pale was not at all tearful as it would have been in their younger days  indeed if the particulars as handed down are to be believed he was in a more tearful state than she in his anxiety about her  he called her into his tent out of the gaze of those around for though many of the soldiers were honest and seriousminded men he could not bear that she who had been his dear companion in childhood should be exposed to curious observation in this her great grief  when they were alone in the tent he clasped her in his arms for he had not seen her since those happier days when at the commencement of the war her husband and himself had been of the same mind about the arbitrary conduct of the king and had little dreamt that they would not go to extremes together  she was the calmest of the two it is said and was the first to speak connectedly  william i have come to you said she but not to save myself as you suppose  why oh why do you persist in supporting this disloyal cause and grieving us so  say not that he replied hastily  if truth hides at the bottom of a well why should you suppose justice to be in high places  i am for the right at any price  anna leave the castle you are my sister come away my dear and save thy life  never says she  do you plan to carry out this attack and level the castle indeed  most certainly i do says he  what meaneth this army around us if not so  then you will find the bones of your sister buried in the ruins you cause said she  and without another word she turned and left him  annaabide with me he entreated  blood is thicker than water and what is there in common between you and your husband now  but she shook her head and would not hear him and hastening out mounted her horse and returned towards the castle as she had come  ay manys the time when i have been riding to hounds across that field that i have thought of that scene  when she had quite gone down the field and over the intervening ground and round the bastion so that he could no longer even see the tip of her mares white tail he was much more deeply moved by emotions concerning her and her welfare than he had been while she was before him  he wildly reproached himself that he had not detained her by force for her own good so that come what might she would be under his protection and not under that of her husband whose impulsive nature rendered him too open to instantaneous impressions and sudden changes of plan he was now acting in this cause and now in that and lacked the cool judgment necessary for the protection of a woman in these troubled times  her brother thought of her words again and again and sighed and even considered if a sister were not of more value than a principle and if he would not have acted more naturally in throwing in his lot with hers  the delay of the besiegers in attacking the castle was said to be entirely owing to this distraction on the part of their leader who remained on the spot attempting some indecisive operations and parleying with the marquis then in command with far inferior forces within the castle  it never occurred to him that in the meantime the young lady baxby his sister was in much the same mood as himself  her brothers familiar voice and eyes much worn and fatigued by keeping the field and by family distractions on account of this unhappy feud rose upon her vision all the afternoon and as day waned she grew more and more parliamentarian in her principles though the only arguments which had addressed themselves to her were those of family ties  her husband general lord baxby had been expected to return all the day from his excursion into the east of the county a message having been sent to him informing him of what had happened at home and in the evening he arrived with reinforcements in unexpected numbers  her brother retreated before these to a hill near ivell four or five miles off to afford the men and himself some repose  lord baxby duly placed his forces and there was no longer any immediate danger  by this time lady baxbys feelings were more parliamentarian than ever and in her fancy the fagged countenance of her brother beaten back by her husband seemed to reproach her for heartlessness  when her husband entered her apartment ruddy and boisterous and full of hope she received him but sadly and upon his casually uttering some slighting words about her brothers withdrawal which seemed to convey an imputation upon his courage she resented them and retorted that he lord baxby himself had been against the courtparty at first where it would be much more to his credit if he were at present and showing her brothers consistency of opinion instead of supporting the lying policy of the king as she called it for the sake of a barren principle of loyalty which was but an empty expression when a king was not at one with his people  the dissension grew bitter between them reaching to little less than a hot quarrel both being quicktempered souls  lord baxby was weary with his long days march and other excitements and soon retired to bed  his lady followed some time after  her husband slept profoundly but not so she she sat brooding by the windowslit and lifting the curtain looked forth upon the hills without  in the silence between the footfalls of the sentinels she could hear faint sounds of her brothers camp on the distant hills where the soldiery had hardly settled as yet into their bivouac since their evenings retreat  the first frosts of autumn had touched the grass and shrivelled the more delicate leaves of the creepers and she thought of william sleeping on the chilly ground under the strain of these hardships  tears flooded her eyes as she returned to her husbands imputations upon his courage as if there could be any doubt of lord williams courage after what he had done in the past days  lord baxbys long and reposeful breathings in his comfortable bed vexed her now and she came to a determination on an impulse  hastily lighting a taper she wrote on a scrap of paper  blood is thicker than water dear williami will come and with this in her hand she went to the door of the room and out upon the stairs on second thoughts turning back for a moment to put on her husbands hat and cloaknot the one he was daily wearingthat if seen in the twilight she might at a casual glance appear as some lad or hanger on of one of the household women thus accoutred she descended a flight of circular stairs at the bottom of which was a door opening upon the terrace towards the west in the direction of her brothers position  her object was to slip out without the sentry seeing her get to the stables arouse one of the varlets and send him ahead of her along the highway with the note to warn her brother of her approach to throw in her lot with his  she was still in the shadow of the wall on the west terrace waiting for the sentinel to be quite out of the way when her ears were greeted by a voice saying from the adjoining shade  here i be  the tones were the tones of a woman  lady baxby made no reply and stood close to the wall  my lord baxby the voice continued and she could recognize in it the local accent of some girl from the little town of sherton close at hand i be tired of waiting my dear lord baxby  i was afeard you would never come  lady baxby flushed hot to her toes  how the wench loves him she said to herself reasoning from the tones of the voice which were plaintive and sweet and tender as a birds  she changed from the homehating truant to the strategic wife in one moment  hist she said  my lord you told me ten oclock and tis near twelve now continues the other  how could ye keep me waiting so if you love me as you said i should have stuck to my lover in the parliament troops if it had not been for thee my dear lord  there was not the least doubt that lady baxby had been mistaken for her husband by this intriguing damsel  here was a pretty underhand business here were sly manoeuvrings  here was faithlessness  here was a precious assignation surprised in the midst  her wicked husband whom till this very moment she had ever deemed the soul of good faithhow could he  lady baxby precipitately retreated to the door in the turret closed it locked it and ascended one round of the staircase where there was a loophole  i am not coming  i lord baxby despise ye and all your wanton tribe she hissed through the opening and then crept upstairs as firmly rooted in royalist principles as any man in the castle  her husband still slept the sleep of the weary wellfed and welldrunken if not of the just and lady baxby quickly disrobed herself without assistancebeing indeed supposed by her woman to have retired to rest long ago  before lying down she noiselessly locked the door and placed the key under her pillow  more than that she got a staylace and creeping up to her lord in great stealth tied the lace in a tight knot to one of his long locks of hair attaching the other end of the lace to the bedpost for being tired herself now she feared she might sleep heavily and if her husband should wake this would be a delicate hint that she had discovered all  it is added that to make assurance trebly sure her gentle ladyship when she had lain down to rest held her lords hand in her own during the whole of the night  but this is oldwives gossip and not corroborated  what lord baxby thought and said when he awoke the next morning and found himself so strangely tethered is likewise only matter of conjecture though there is no reason to suppose that his rage was great  the extent of his culpability as regards the intrigue was this much that while halting at a crossroad near sherton that day he had flirted with a pretty young woman who seemed nothing loth and had invited her to the castle terrace after darkan invitation which he quite forgot on his arrival home  the subsequent relations of lord and lady baxby were not again greatly embittered by quarrels so far as is known though the husbands conduct in later life was occasionally eccentric and the vicissitudes of his public career culminated in long exile  the siege of the castle was not regularly undertaken till two or three years later than the time i have been describing when lady baxby and all the women therein except the wife of the then governor had been removed to safe distance  that memorable siege of fifteen days by fairfax and the surrender of the old place on an august evening is matter of history and need not be told by me        the man of family spoke approvingly across to the colonel when the club had done smiling declaring that the story was an absolutely faithful page of history as he had good reason to know his own people having been engaged in that wellknown scrimmage  he asked if the colonel had ever heard the equally wellauthenticated though less martial tale of a certain lady penelope who lived in the same century and not a score of miles from the same place  the colonel had not heard it nor had anybody except the local historian and the inquirer was induced to proceed forthwith     dame the eighththe lady penelope by the man of family   in going out of casterbridge by the lowlying road which eventually conducts to the town of ivell you see on the right hand an ivied manor house flanked by battlemented towers and more than usually distinguished by the size of its many mullioned windows  though still of good capacity the building is much reduced from its original grand proportions it has moreover been shorn of the fair estate which once appertained to its lord with the exception of a few acres of parkland immediately around the mansion  this was formerly the seat of the ancient and knightly family of the drenghards or drenkhards now extinct in the male line whose name according to the local chronicles was interpreted to mean strenuus miles vel potator though certain members of the family were averse to the latter signification and a duel was fought by one of them on that account as is well known  with this however we are not now concerned  in the early part of the reign of the first king james there was visiting near this place of the drenghards a lady of noble family and extraordinary beauty  she was of the purest descent ah theres seldom such blood nowadays as hers  she possessed no great wealth it was said but was sufficiently endowed  her beauty was so perfect and her manner so entrancing that suitors seemed to spring out of the ground wherever she went a sufficient cause of anxiety to the countess her mother her only living parent  of these there were three in particular whom neither her mothers complaints of prematurity nor the ready raillery of the maiden herself could effectually put off  the said gallants were a certain sir john gale a sir william hervy and the wellknown sir george drenghard one of the drenghard family beforementioned  they had curiously enough all been equally honoured with the distinction of knighthood and their schemes for seeing her were manifold each fearing that one of the others would steal a march over himself  not content with calling on every imaginable excuse at the house of the relative with whom she sojourned they intercepted her in rides and in walks and if any one of them chanced to surprise another in the act of paying her marked attentions the encounter often ended in an altercation of great violence  so heated and impassioned indeed would they become that the lady hardly felt herself safe in their company at such times notwithstanding that she was a brave and buxom damsel not easily put out and with a daring spirit of humour in her composition if not of coquetry  at one of these altercations which had place in her relatives grounds and was unusually bitter threatening to result in a duel she found it necessary to assert herself  turning haughtily upon the pair of disputants she declared that whichever should be the first to break the peace between them no matter what the provocation that man should never be admitted to her presence again and thus would she effectually stultify the aggressor by making the promotion of a quarrel a distinct bar to its object  while the two knights were wearing rather a crestfallen appearance at her reprimand the third never far off came upon the scene and she repeated her caveat to him also  seeing then how great was the concern of all at her peremptory mood the ladys manner softened and she said with a roguish smile  have patience have patience you foolish men  only bide your time quietly and in faith i will marry you all in turn  they laughed heartily at this sally all three together as though they were the best of friends at which she blushed and showed some embarrassment not having realized that her arch jest would have sounded so strange when uttered  the meeting which resulted thus however had its good effect in checking the bitterness of their rivalry and they repeated her speech to their relatives and acquaintance with a hilarious frequency and publicity that the lady little divined or she might have blushed and felt more embarrassment still  in the course of time the position resolved itself and the beauteous lady penelope as she was called made up her mind her choice being the eldest of the three knights sir george drenghard owner of the mansion aforesaid which thereupon became her home and her husband being a pleasant man and his family though not so noble of as good repute as her own all things seemed to show that she had reckoned wisely in honouring him with her preference  but what may lie behind the still and silent veil of the future none can foretell  in the course of a few months the husband of her choice died of his convivialities as if indeed to bear out his name and the lady penelope was left alone as mistress of his house  by this time she had apparently quite forgotten her careless declaration to her lovers collectively but the lovers themselves had not forgotten it and as she would now be free to take a second one of them sir john gale appeared at her door as early in her widowhood as it was proper and seemly to do so  she gave him little encouragement for of the two remaining her best beloved was sir william of whom if the truth must be told she had often thought during her short married life  but he had not yet reappeared  her heart began to be so much with him now that she contrived to convey to him by indirect hints through his friends that she would not be displeased by a renewal of his former attentions  sir william however misapprehended her gentle signalling and from excellent though mistaken motives of delicacy delayed to intrude himself upon her for a long time  meanwhile sir john now created a baronet was unremitting and she began to grow somewhat piqued at the backwardness of him she secretly desired to be forward  never mind her friends said jestingly to her knowing of her humorous remark as everybody did that she would marry them all three if they would have patiencenever mind why hesitate upon the order of them take em as they come  this vexed her still more and regretting deeply as she had often done that such a careless speech should ever have passed her lips she fairly broke down under sir johns importunity and accepted his hand  they were married on a fine spring morning about the very time at which the unfortunate sir william discovered her preference for him and was beginning to hasten home from a foreign court to declare his unaltered devotion to her  on his arrival in england he learnt the sad truth  if sir william suffered at her precipitancy under what she had deemed his neglect the lady penelope herself suffered more  she had not long been the wife of sir john gale before he showed a disposition to retaliate upon her for the trouble and delay she had put him to in winning her with increasing frequency he would tell her that as far as he could perceive she was an article not worth such labour as he had bestowed in obtaining it and such snubbings as he had taken from his rivals on the same account  these and other cruel things he repeated till he made the lady weep sorely and wellnigh broke her spirit though she had formerly been such a mettlesome dame  by degrees it became perceptible to all her friends that her life was a very unhappy one and the fate of the fair woman seemed yet the harder in that it was her own stately mansion left to her sole use by her first husband which her second had entered into and was enjoying his being but a mean and meagre erection  but such is the flippancy of friends that when she met them and secretly confided her grief to their ears they would say cheerily lord never mind my dear theres a third to come yetat which maladroit remark she would show much indignation and tell them they should know better than to trifle on so solemn a theme  yet that the poor lady would have been only too happy to be the wife of the third instead of sir john whom she had taken was painfully obvious and much she was blamed for her foolish choice by some people  sir william however had returned to foreign cities on learning the news of her marriage and had never been heard of since  two or three years of suffering were passed by lady penelope as the despised and chidden wife of this man sir john amid regrets that she had so greatly mistaken him and sighs for one whom she thought never to see again till it chanced that her husband fell sick of some slight ailment one day after this when she was sitting in his room looking from the window upon the expanse in front she beheld approaching the house on foot a form she seemed to know well  lady penelope withdrew silently from the sickroom and descended to the hall whence through the doorway she saw entering between the two round towers which at that time flanked the gateway sir william hervy as she had surmised but looking thin and travelworn  she advanced into the courtyard to meet him  i was passing through casterbridge he said with faltering deference and i walked out to ask after your ladyships health  i felt that i could do no less and of course to pay my respects to your good husband my heretofore acquaintance    but oh penelope thst look sick and sorry  i am heartsick thats all said she  they could see in each other an emotion which neither wished to express and they stood thus a long time with tears in their eyes  he does not treat ee well i hear said sir william in a low voice may god in heaven forgive him but it is asking a great deal  hush hush said she hastily  nay but i will speak what i may honestly say he answered  i am not under your roof and my tongue is free  why didst not wait for me penelope or send to me a more overt letter  i would have travelled night and day to come  too late william you must not ask it said she endeavouring to quiet him as in old times  my husband just now is unwell  he will grow better in a day or two maybe  you must call again and see him before you leave casterbridge  as she said this their eyes met  each was thinking of her lightsome words about taking the three men in turn each thought that twothirds of that promise had been fulfilled  but as if it were unpleasant to her that this recollection should have arisen she spoke again quickly come again in a day or two when my husband will be well enough to see you  sir william departed without entering the house and she returned to sir johns chamber  he rising from his pillow said to whom hast been talking wife in the courtyard  i heard voices there  she hesitated and he repeated the question more impatiently  i do not wish to tell you now said she  but i wooll know said he  then she answered sir william hervy  by g i thought as much cried sir john drops of perspiration standing on his white face  a skulking villain  a sick mans ears are keen my lady  i heard that they were loverlike tones and he called ee by your christian name  these be your intrigues my lady when i am off my legs awhile  on my honour cried she you do me a wrong  i swear i did not know of his coming  swear as you will said sir john i dont believe ee  and with this he taunted her and worked himself into a greater passion which much increased his illness  his lady sat still brooding  there was that upon her face which had seldom been there since her marriage and she seemed to think anew of what she had so lightly said in the days of her freedom when her three lovers were one and all coveting her hand  i began at the wrong end of them she murmured  my godthat did i  what said he  a trifle said she  i spoke to myself only  it was somewhat strange that after this day while she went about the house with even a sadder face than usual her churlish husband grew worse and what was more to the surprise of all though to the regret of few he died a fortnight later  sir william had not called upon him as he had promised having received a private communication from lady penelope frankly informing him that to do so would be inadvisable by reason of her husbands temper  now when sir john was gone and his remains carried to his family burying place in another part of england the lady began in due time to wonder whither sir william had betaken himself  but she had been cured of precipitancy if ever woman were and was prepared to wait her whole lifetime a widow if the said sir william should not reappear  her life was now passed mostly within the walls or in promenading between the pleasaunce and the bowlinggreen and she very seldom went even so far as the high road which then skirted the grounds on the north though it has now and for many years been diverted to the south side  her patience was rewarded if love be in any case a reward for one day many months after her second husbands death a messenger arrived at her gate with the intelligence that sir william hervy was again in casterbridge and would be glad to know if it were her pleasure that he should wait upon her  it need hardly be said that permission was joyfully granted and within two hours her lover stood before her a more thoughtful man than formerly but in all essential respects the same man generous modest to diffidence and sincere  the reserve which womanly decorum threw over her manner was but too obviously artificial and when he said the ways of providence are strange and added after a moment and merciful likewise she could not conceal her agitation and burst into tears upon his neck  but this is too soon she said starting back  but no said he  you are eleven months gone in widowhood and it is not as if sir john had been a good husband to you  his visits grew pretty frequent now as may well be guessed and in a month or two he began to urge her to an early union  but she counselled a little longer delay  why said he  surely i have waited long  life is short we are getting older every day and i am the last of the three  yes said the lady frankly  and that is why i would not have you hasten  our marriage may seem so strange to everybody after my unlucky remark on that occasion we know so well and which so many others know likewise thanks to talebearers  on this representation he conceded a little space for the sake of her good name  but the destined day of their marriage at last arrived and it was a gay time for the villagers and all concerned and the bells in the parish church rang from noon till night  thus at last she was united to the man who had loved her the most tenderly of them all who but for his reticence might perhaps have been the first to win her  often did he say to himself how wondrous that her words should have been fulfilled many a truth hath been spoken in jest but never a more remarkable one the noble lady herself preferred not to dwell on the coincidence a certain shyness if not shame crossing her fair face at any allusion thereto  but people will have their say sensitive souls or none and their sayings on this third occasion took a singular shape  surely they whispered there is something more than chance in this    the death of the first was possibly natural but what of the death of the second who illused her and whom loving the third so desperately she must have wished out of the way  then they pieced together sundry trivial incidents of sir johns illness and dwelt upon the indubitable truth that he had grown worse after her lovers unexpected visit till a very sinister theory was built up as to the hand she may have had in sir johns premature demise  but nothing of this suspicion was said openly for she was a lady of noble birthnobler indeed than either of her husbandsand what people suspected they feared to express in formal accusation  the mansion that she occupied had been left to her for so long a time as she should choose to reside in it and having a regard for the spot she had coaxed sir william to remain there  but in the end it was unfortunate for one day when in the full tide of his happiness he was walking among the willows near the gardens where he overheard a conversation between some basketmakers who were cutting the osiers for their use  in this fatal dialogue the suspicions of the neighbouring townsfolk were revealed to him for the first time  a cupboard close to his bed and the key in her pocket  ah said one  and a blue phial thereinhm said another  and spurgelaurel leaves among the hearthashes  ohoh said a third  on his return home sir william seemed to have aged years  but he said nothing indeed it was a thing impossible  and from that hour a ghastly estrangement began  she could not understand it and simply waited  one day he said however i must go abroad  why said she  william have i offended you  no said he but i must go  she could coax little more out of him and in itself there was nothing unnatural in his departure for he had been a wanderer from his youth  in a few days he started off apparently quite another man than he who had rushed to her side so devotedly a few months before  it is not known when or how the rumours which were so thick in the atmosphere around her actually reached the lady penelopes ears but that they did reach her there is no doubt  it was impossible that they should not the district teemed with them they rustled in the air like nightbirds of evil omen  then a reason for her husbands departure occurred to her appalled mind and a loss of health became quickly apparent  she dwindled thin in the face and the veins in her temples could all be distinctly traced  an inner fire seemed to be withering her away  her rings fell off her fingers and her arms hung like the flails of the threshers though they had till lately been so round and so elastic  she wrote to her husband repeatedly begging him to return to her but he being in extreme and wretched doubt moreover knowing nothing of her illhealth and never suspecting that the rumours had reached her also deemed absence best and postponed his return awhile giving various good reasons for his delay  at length however when the lady penelope had given birth to a still born child her mother the countess addressed a letter to sir william requesting him to come back to her if he wished to see her alive since she was wasting away of some mysterious disease which seemed to be rather mental than physical  it was evident that his motherinlaw knew nothing of the secret for she lived at a distance but sir william promptly hastened home and stood beside the bed of his now dying wife  believe me william she said when they were alone i am innocentinnocent  of what said he  heaven forbid that i should accuse you of anything  but you do accuse mesilently she gasped  i could not write thereonand ask you to hear me  it was too much too degrading  but would that i had been less proud  they suspect me of poisoning him william  but oh my dear husband i am innocent of that wicked crime  he died naturally  i loved youtoo soon but that was all  nothing availed to save her  the worm had gnawed too far into her heart before sir williams return for anything to be remedial now and in a few weeks she breathed her last  after her death the people spoke louder and her conduct became a subject of public discussion  a little later on the physician who had attended the late sir john heard the rumour and came down from the place near london to which he latterly had retired with the express purpose of calling upon sir william hervy now staying in casterbridge  he stated that at the request of a relative of sir johns who wished to be assured on the matter by reason of its suddenness he had with the assistance of a surgeon made a private examination of sir johns body immediately after his decease and found that it had resulted from purely natural causes  nobody at this time had breathed a suspicion of foul play and therefore nothing was said which might afterwards have established her innocence  it being thus placed beyond doubt that this beautiful and noble lady had been done to death by a vile scandal that was wholly unfounded her husband was stung with a dreadful remorse at the share he had taken in her misfortunes and left the country anew this time never to return alive  he survived her but a few years and his body was brought home and buried beside his wifes under the tomb which is still visible in the parish church  until lately there was a good portrait of her in weeds for her first husband with a cross in her hand at the ancestral seat of her family where she was much pitied as she deserved to be  yet there were some severe enough to sayand these not unjust persons in other respectsthat though unquestionably innocent of the crime imputed to her she had shown an unseemly wantonness in contracting three marriages in such rapid succession that the untrue suspicion might have been ordered by providence who often works indirectly as a punishment for her selfindulgence  upon that point i have no opinion to offer        the reverend the vicepresident however the tale being ended offered as his opinion that her fate ought to be quite clearly recognized as a punishment  so thought the churchwarden and also the quiet gentleman sitting near  the latter knew many other instances in point one of which could be narrated in a few words     dame the ninththe duchess of hamptonshire by the quiet gentleman   some fifty years ago the then duke of hamptonshire fifth of that title was incontestibly the head man in his county and particularly in the neighbourhood of batton  he came of the ancient and loyal family of saxelbye which before its ennoblement had numbered many knightly and ecclesiastical celebrities in its male line  it would have occupied a painstaking county historian a whole afternoon to take rubbings of the numerous effigies and heraldic devices graven to their memory on the brasses tablets and altartombs in the aisle of the parishchurch  the duke himself however was a man little attracted by ancient chronicles in stone and metal even when they concerned his own beginnings  he allowed his mind to linger by preference on the many graceless and unedifying pleasures which his position placed at his command  he could on occasion close the mouths of his dependents by a good bomblike oath and he argued doggedly with the parson on the virtues of cockfighting and baiting the bull  this noblemans personal appearance was somewhat impressive  his complexion was that of the copperbeech tree  his frame was stalwart though slightly stooping  his mouth was large and he carried an unpolished sapling as his walkingstick except when he carried a spud for cutting up any thistle he encountered on his walks  his castle stood in the midst of a park surrounded by dusky elms except to the southward and when the moon shone out the gleaming stone facade backed by heavy boughs was visible from the distant high road as a white spot on the surface of darkness  though called a castle the building was little fortified and had been erected with greater eye to internal convenience than those crannied places of defence to which the name strictly appertains  it was a castellated mansion as regular as a chessboard on its groundplan ornamented with makebelieve bastions and machicolations behind which were stacks of battlemented chimneys  on still mornings at the firelighting hour when ghostly housemaids stalk the corridors and thin streaks of light through the shutterchinks lend startling winks and smiles to ancestors on canvas twelve or fifteen thin stems of blue smoke sprouted upwards from these chimneytops and spread into a flat canopy on high  around the site stretched ten thousand acres of good fat unimpeachable soil plentiful in glades and lawns wherever visible from the castlewindows and merging in homely arable where screened from the too curious eye by ingeniouslycontrived plantations  some way behind the owner of all this came the second man in the parish the rector the honourable and reverend mr oldbourne a widower over stiff and stern for a clergyman whose severe white neckcloth wellkept gray hair and rightlined face betokened none of those sympathetic traits whereon depends so much of a parsons power to do good among his fellowcreatures  the last farremoved man of the seriesaltogether the neptune of these local primarieswas the curate mr alwyn hill  he was a handsome young deacon with curly hair dreamy eyesso dreamy that to look long into them was like ascending and floating among summer cloudsa complexion as fresh as a flower and a chin absolutely beardless  though his age was about twentyfive he looked not much over nineteen  the rector had a daughter called emmeline of so sweet and simple a nature that her beauty was discovered measured and inventoried by almost everybody in that part of the country before it was suspected by herself to exist  she had been bred in comparative solitude a rencounter with men troubled and confused her  whenever a strange visitor came to her fathers house she slipped into the orchard and remained till he was gone ridiculing her weakness in apostrophes but unable to overcome it  her virtues lay in no resistant force of character but in a natural inappetency for evil things which to her were as unmeaning as joints of flesh to a herbivorous creature  her charms of person manner and mind had been clear for some time to the antinous in orders and no less so to the duke who though scandalously ignorant of dainty phrases ever showing a clumsy manner towards the gentler sex and in short not at all a ladys man took fire to a degree that was wellnigh terrible at sudden sight of emmeline a short time after she was turned seventeen  it occurred one afternoon at the corner of a shrubbery between the castle and the rectory where the duke was standing to watch the heaving of a mole when the fair girl brushed past at a distance of a few yards in the full light of the sun and without hat or bonnet  the duke went home like a man who had seen a spirit  he ascended to the picturegallery of his castle and there passed some time in staring at the bygone beauties of his line as if he had never before considered what an important part those specimens of womankind had played in the evolution of the saxelbye race  he dined alone drank rather freely and declared to himself that emmeline oldbourne must be his  meanwhile there had unfortunately arisen between the curate and this girl some sweet and secret understanding  particulars of the attachment remained unknown then and always but it was plainly not approved of by her father  his procedure was cold hard and inexorable  soon the curate disappeared from the parish almost suddenly after bitter and hard words had been heard to pass between him and the rector one evening in the garden intermingled with which like the cries of the dying in the din of battle were the beseeching sobs of a woman  not long after this it was announced that a marriage between the duke and miss oldbourne was to be solemnized at a surprisingly early date  the weddingday came and passed and she was a duchess  nobody seemed to think of the ousted man during the day or else those who thought of him concealed their meditations  some of the less subservient ones were disposed to speak in a jocular manner of the august husband and wife others to make correct and pretty speeches about them according as their sex and nature dictated  but in the evening the ringers in the belfry with whom alwyn had been a favourite eased their minds a little concerning the gentle young man and the possible regrets of the woman he had loved  dont you see something wrong in it all said the third bell as he wiped his face  i know well enough where she would have liked to stable her horses tonight when they have done their journey  that is you would know if you could tell where young mr hill is living which is known to none in the parish  except to the lady that this ring o grandsire triples is in honour of  yet these friendly cottagers were at this time far from suspecting the real dimensions of emmelines misery nor was it clear even to those who came into much closer communion with her than they so well had she concealed her heartsickness  but bride and bridegroom had not long been home at the castle when the young wifes unhappiness became plainly enough perceptible  her maids and men said that she was in the habit of turning to the wainscot and shedding stupid scalding tears at a time when a rightminded lady would have been overhauling her wardrobe  she prayed earnestly in the great churchpew where she sat lonely and insignificant as a mouse in a cell instead of counting her rings falling asleep or amusing herself in silent laughter at the queer old people in the congregation as previous beauties of the family had done in their time she seemed to care no more for eating and drinking out of crystal and silver than from a service of earthen vessels  her head was in truth full of something else and that such was the case was only too obvious to the duke her husband  at first he would only taunt her for her folly in thinking of that milkandwater parson but as time went on his charges took a more positive shape  he would not believe her assurance that she had in no way communicated with her former lover nor he with her since their parting in the presence of her father  this led to some strange scenes between them which need not be detailed their result was soon to take a catastrophic shape  one dark quiet evening about two months after the marriage a man entered the gate admitting from the highway to the park and avenue which ran up to the house  he arrived within two hundred yards of the walls when he left the gravelled drive and drew near to the castle by a roundabout path leading into a shrubbery  here he stood still  in a few minutes the strokes of the castleclock resounded and then a female figure entered the same secluded nook from an opposite direction  there the two indistinct persons leapt together like a pair of dewdrops on a leaf and then they stood apart facing each other the woman looking down  emmeline you begged me to come and here i am heaven forgive me said the man hoarsely  you are going to emigrate alwyn she said in broken accents  i have heard of it you sail from plymouth in three days in the western glory  yes  i can live in england no longer  life is as death to me here says he  my life is even worseworse than death  death would not have driven me to this extremity  listen alwyni have sent for you to beg to go with you or at least to be near youto do anything so that it be not to stay here  to go away with me he said in a startled tone  yes yesor under your direction or by your help in some way  dont be horrified at meyou must bear with me whilst i implore it  nothing short of cruelty would have driven me to this  i could have borne my doom in silence had i been left unmolested but he tortures me and i shall soon be in the grave if i cannot escape  to his shocked inquiry how her husband tortured her the duchess said that it was by jealousy  he tries to wring admissions from me concerning you she said and will not believe that i have not communicated with you since my engagement to him was settled by my father and i was forced to agree to it  the poor curate said that this was the heaviest news of all  he has not personally illused you he asked  yes she whispered  what has he done  she looked fearfully around and said sobbing in trying to make me confess to what i have never done he adopts plans i dare not describe for terrifying me into a weak state so that i may own to anything  i resolved to write to you as i had no other friend  she added with dreary irony i thought i would give him some ground for his suspicion so as not to disgrace his judgment  do you really mean emmeline he tremblingly inquired that youthat you want to fly with me  can you think that i would act otherwise than in earnest at such a time as this  he was silent for a minute or more  you must not go with me he said  why  it would be sin  it cannot be sin for i have never wanted to commit sin in my life and it isnt likely i would begin now when i pray every day to die and be sent to heaven out of my misery  but it is wrong emmeline all the same  is it wrong to run away from the fire that scorches you  it would look wrong at any rate in this case  alwyn alwyn take me i beseech you she burst out  it is not right in general i know but it is such an exceptional instance this  why has such a severe strain been put upon me  i was doing no harm injuring no one helping many people and expecting happiness yet trouble came can it be that god holds me in derision  i had no supporteri gave way and now my life is a burden and a shame to me    oh if you only knew how much to me this request to you ishow my life is wrapped up in it you could not deny me  this is almost beyond enduranceheaven support us he groaned  emmy you are the duchess of hamptonshire the duke of hamptonshires wife you must not go with me  and am i then refusedoh am i refused she cried frantically alwyn alwyn do you say it indeed to me  yes i do dear tender heart  i do most sadly say it  you must not go  forgive me for there is no alternative but refusal  though i die though you die we must not fly together  it is forbidden in gods law goodbye for always and ever  he tore himself away hastened from the shrubbery and vanished among the trees  three days after this meeting and farewell alwyn his soft handsome features stamped with a haggard hardness that ten years of ordinary wear and tear in the world could scarcely have produced sailed from plymouth on a drizzling morning in the passengership western glory  when the land had faded behind him he mechanically endeavoured to school himself into a stoical frame of mind  his attempt backed up by the strong moral staying power that had enabled him to resist the passionate temptation to which emmeline in her reckless trustfulness had exposed him was rewarded by a certain kind of success though the murmuring stretch of waters whereon he gazed day after day too often seemed to be articulating to him in tones of her wellremembered voice  he framed on his journey rules of conduct for reducing to mild proportions the feverish regrets which would occasionally arise and agitate him when he indulged in visions of what might have been had he not hearkened to the whispers of conscience  he fixed his thoughts for so many hours a day on philosophical passages in the volumes he had brought with him allowing himself now and then a few minutes thought of emmeline with the strict yet reluctant niggardliness of an ailing epicure proportioning the rank drinks that cause his malady  the voyage was marked by the usual incidents of a sailingpassage in those daysa storm a calm a man overboard a birth and a funeralthe latter sad event being one in which he as the only clergyman on board officiated reading the service ordained for the purpose  the ship duly arrived at boston early in the month following and thence he proceeded to providence to seek out a distant relative  after a short stay at providence he returned again to boston and by applying himself to a serious occupation made good progress in shaking off the dreary melancholy which enveloped him even now  distracted and weakened in his beliefs by his recent experiences he decided that he could not for a time worthily fill the office of a minister of religion and applied for the mastership of a school  some introductions given him before starting were useful now and he soon became known as a respectable scholar and gentleman to the trustees of one of the colleges this ultimately led to his retirement from the school and installation in the college as professor of rhetoric and oratory  here and thus he lived on exerting himself solely because of a conscientious determination to do his duty  he passed his winter evenings in turning sonnets and elegies often giving his thoughts voice in lines to an unfortunate lady while his summer leisure at the same hour would be spent in watching the lengthening shadows from his window and fancifully comparing them with the shades of his own life  if he walked he mentally inquired which was the eastern quarter of the landscape and thought of two thousand miles of water that way and of what was beyond it  in a word he was at all spare times dreaming of her who was only a memory to him and would probably never be more  nine years passed by and under their wear and tear alwyn hills face lost a great many of the attractive characteristics which had formerly distinguished it  he was kind to his pupils and affable to all who came in contact with him but the kernel of his life his secret was kept as snugly shut up as though he had been dumb  in talking to his acquaintances of england and his life there he omitted the episode of batton castle and emmeline as if it had no existence in his calendar at all  though of towering importance to himself it had filled but a short and small fragment of time an ephemeral season which would have been wellnigh imperceptible even to him at this distance but for the incident it enshrined  one day at this date when cursorily glancing over an old english newspaper he observed a paragraph which short as it was contained for him whole tomes of thrilling informationrung with more passionstirring rhythm than the collected cantos of all the poets  it was an announcement of the death of the duke of hamptonshire leaving behind him a widow but no children  the current of alwyns thoughts now completely changed  on looking again at the newspaper he found it to be one that was sent him long ago and had been carelessly thrown aside  but for an accidental overhauling of the waste journals in his study he might not have known of the event for years  at this moment of reading the duke had already been dead seven months  alwyn could now no longer bind himself down to machinemade synecdoche antithesis and climax being full of spontaneous specimens of all these rhetorical forms which he dared not utter  who shall wonder that his mind luxuriated in dreams of a sweet possibility now laid open for the first time these many years for emmeline was to him now as ever the one dear thing in all the world  the issue of his silent romancing was that he resolved to return to her at the very earliest moment  but he could not abandon his professional work on the instant  he did not get really quite free from engagements till four months later but though suffering throes of impatience continually he said to himself every day if she has continued to love me nine years she will love me ten she will think the more tenderly of me when her present hours of solitude shall have done their proper work old times will revive with the cessation of her recent experience and every day will favour my return  the enforced interval soon passed and he duly arrived in england reaching the village of batton on a certain winter day between twelve and thirteen months subsequent to the time of the dukes death  it was evening yet such was alwyns impatience that he could not forbear taking this very night one look at the castle which emmeline had entered as unhappy mistress ten years before  he threaded the park trees gazed in passing at wellknown outlines which rose against the dim sky and was soon interested in observing that lively countrypeople in parties of two and three were walking before and behind him up the interlaced avenue to the castle gateway  knowing himself to be safe from recognition alwyn inquired of one of these pedestrians what was going on  her grace gives her tenantry a ball tonight to keep up the old custom of the duke and his father before him which she does not wish to change  indeed  has she lived here entirely alone since the dukes death  quite alone  but though she doesnt receive company herself she likes the village people to enjoy themselves and often has em here  kindhearted as always thought alwyn  on reaching the castle he found that the great gates at the tradesmens entrance were thrown back against the wall as if they were never to be closed again that the passages and rooms in that wing were brilliantly lighted up some of the numerous candles guttering down over the green leaves which decorated them and upon the silk dresses of the happy farmers wives as they passed beneath each on her husbands arm  alwyn found no difficulty in marching in along with the rest the castle being liberty hall tonight  he stood unobserved in a corner of the large apartment where dancing was about to begin  her grace though hardly out of mourning will be sure to come down and lead off the dance with neighbour bates said one  who is neighbour bates asked alwyn  an old man she respects muchthe oldest of her tenantfarmers  he was seventyeight his last birthday  ah to be sure said alwyn at his ease  i remember  the dancers formed in line and waited  a door opened at the farther end of the hall and a lady in black silk came forth  she bowed smiled and proceeded to the top of the dance  who is that lady said alwyn in a puzzled tone  i thought you told me that the duchess of hamptonshire  that is the duchess said his informant  but there is another  no there is no other  but she is not the duchess of hamptonshirewho used to alwyns tongue stuck to his mouth he could get no farther  whats the matter said his acquaintance  alwyn had retired and was supporting himself against the wall  the wretched alwyn murmured something about a stitch in his side from walking  then the music struck up the dance went on and his neighbour became so interested in watching the movements of this strange duchess through its mazes as to forget alwyn for a while  it gave him an opportunity to brace himself up  he was a man who had suffered and he could suffer again  how came that person to be your duchess he asked in a firm distinct voice when he had attained complete selfcommand  where is her other grace of hamptonshire  there certainly was another  i know it  oh the previous one  yes yes  she ran away years and years ago with the young curate  mr hill was the young mans name if i recollect  no  she never did  what do you mean by that he said  yes she certainly ran away  she met the curate in the shrubbery about a couple of months after her marriage with the duke  there were folks who saw the meeting and heard some words of their talk  they arranged to go and she sailed from plymouth with him a day or two afterward  thats not true  then tis the queerest lie ever told by man  her father believed and knew to his dying day that she went with him and so did the duke and everybody about here  ay there was a fine upset about it at the time the duke traced her to plymouth  traced her to plymouth  he traced her to plymouth and set on his spies and they found that she went to the shippingoffice and inquired if mr alwyn hill had entered his name as passenger by the western glory and when she found that he had she booked herself for the same ship but not in her real name  when the vessel had sailed a letter reached the duke from her telling him what she had done  she never came back here again  his grace lived by himself a number of years and married this lady only twelve months before he died  alwyn was in a state of indescribable bewilderment  but unmanned as he was he called the next day on the to him spurious duchess of hamptonshire  at first she was alarmed at his statement then cold then she was won over by his condition to give confidence for confidence  she showed him a letter which had been found among the papers of the late duke corroborating what alwyns informant had detailed  it was from emmeline bearing the postmarked date at which the western glory sailed and briefly stated that she had emigrated by that ship to america  alwyn applied himself body and mind to unravel the remainder of the mystery  the story repeated to him was always the same she ran away with the curate  a strangely circumstantial piece of intelligence was added to this when he had pushed his inquiries a little further  there was given him the name of a waterman at plymouth who had come forward at the time that she was missed and sought for by her husband and had stated that he put her on board the western glory at dusk one evening before that vessel sailed  after several days of search about the alleys and quays of plymouth barbican during which these impossible words she ran off with the curate became branded on his brain alwyn found this important waterman  he was positive as to the truth of his story still remembering the incident well and he described in detail the ladys dress as he had long ago described it to her husband which description corresponded in every particular with the dress worn by emmeline on the evening of their parting  before proceeding to the other side of the atlantic to continue his inquiries there the puzzled and distracted alwyn set himself to ascertain the address of captain wheeler who had commanded the western glory in the year of alwyns voyage out and immediately wrote a letter to him on the subject  the only circumstances which the sailor could recollect or discover from his papers in connection with such a story were that a woman bearing the name which alwyn had mentioned as fictitious certainly did come aboard for a voyage he made about that time that she took a common berth among the poorest emigrants that she died on the voyage out at about five days sail from plymouth that she seemed a lady in manners and education  why she had not applied for a firstclass passage why she had no trunks they could not guess for though she had little money in her pocket she had that about her which would have fetched it  we buried her at sea continued the captain  a young parson one of the cabinpassengers read the burialservice over her i remember well  the whole scene and proceedings darted upon alwyns recollection in a moment  it was a fine breezy morning on that longpast voyage out and he had been told that they were running at the rate of a hundred and odd miles a day  the news went round that one of the poor young women in the other part of the vessel was ill of fever and delirious  the tidings caused no little alarm among all the passengers for the sanitary conditions of the ship were anything but satisfactory  shortly after this the doctor announced that she had died  then alwyn had learnt that she was laid out for burial in great haste because of the danger that would have been incurred by delay  and next the funeral scene rose before him and the prominent part that he had taken in that solemn ceremony  the captain had come to him requesting him to officiate as there was no chaplain on board  this he had agreed to do and as the sun went down with a blaze in his face he read amidst them all assembled we therefore commit her body to the deep to be turned into corruption looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead  the captain also forwarded the addresses of the ships matron and of other persons who had been engaged on board at the date  to these alwyn went in the course of time  a categorical description of the clothes of the dead truant the colour of her hair and other things extinguished for ever all hope of a mistake in identity  at last then the course of events had become clear  on that unhappy evening when he left emmeline in the shrubbery forbidding her to follow him because it would be a sin she must have disobeyed  she must have followed at his heels silently through the darkness like a poor pet animal that will not be driven back  she could have accumulated nothing for the journey more than she might have carried in her hand and thus poorly provided she must have embarked  her intention had doubtless been to make her presence on board known to him as soon as she could muster courage to do so  thus the ten years chapter of alwyn hills romance wound itself up under his eyes  that the poor young woman in the steerage had been the young duchess of hamptonshire was never publicly disclosed  hill had no longer any reason for remaining in england and soon after left its shores with no intention to return  previous to his departure he confided his story to an old friend from his native towngrandfather of the person who now relates it to you        a few members including the bookworm seemed to be impressed by the quiet gentlemans tale but the member we have called the sparkwho by the way was getting somewhat tinged with the light of other days and owned to eightandthirtywalked daintily about the room instead of sitting down by the fire with the majority and said that for his part he preferred something more lively than the last storysomething in which such longseparated lovers were ultimately united  he also liked stories that were more modern in their date of action than those he had heard to day  members immediately requested him to give them a specimen to which the spark replied that he didnt mind as far as that went  and though the vicepresident the man of family the colonel and others looked at their watches and said they must soon retire to their respective quarters in the hotel adjoining they all decided to sit out the sparks story     dame the tenththe honourable laura by the spark   it was a cold and gloomy christmas eve  the mass of cloud overhead was almost impervious to such daylight as still lingered on the snow lay several inches deep upon the ground and the slanting downfall which still went on threatened to considerably increase its thickness before the morning  the prospect hotel a building standing near the wild north coast of lower wessex looked so lonely and so useless at such a time as this that a passing wayfarer would have been led to forget summer possibilities and to wonder at the commercial courage which could invest capital on the basis of the popular taste for the picturesque in a country subject to such dreary phases  that the district was alive with visitors in august seemed but a dim tradition in weather so totally opposed to all that tempts mankind from home  however there the hotel stood immovable and the cliffs creeks and headlands which were the primary attractions of the spot rising in full view on the opposite side of the valley were now but stern angular outlines while the townlet in front was tinged over with a grimy dirtiness rather than the pearly gray that in summer lent such beauty to its appearance  within the hotel commanding this outlook the landlord walked idly about with his hands in his pockets not in the least expectant of a visitor and yet unable to settle down to any occupation which should compensate in some degree for the losses that winter idleness entailed on his regular profession  so little indeed was anybody expected that the coffeeroom waitera genteel boy whose plated buttons in summer were as close together upon the front of his short jacket as peas in a podnow appeared in the back yard metamorphosed into the unrecognizable shape of a rough country lad in corduroys and hobnailed boots sweeping the snow away and talking the local dialect in all its purity quite oblivious of the new polite accent he had learned in the hot weather from the well behaved visitors  the front door was closed and as if to express still more fully the sealed and chrysalis state of the establishment a sand bag was placed at the bottom to keep out the insidious snowdrift the wind setting in directly from that quarter  the landlord entering his own parlour walked to the large fire which it was absolutely necessary to keep up for his comfort no such blaze burning in the coffeeroom or elsewhere and after giving it a stir returned to a table in the lobby whereon lay the visitors booknow closed and pushed back against the wall  he carelessly opened it not a name had been entered there since the 19th of the previous november and that was only the name of a man who had arrived on a tricycle who indeed had not been asked to enter at all  while he was engaged thus the evening grew darker but before it was as yet too dark to distinguish objects upon the road winding round the back of the cliffs the landlord perceived a black spot on the distant white which speedily enlarged itself and drew near  the probabilities were that this vehiclefor a vehicle of some sort it seemed to bewould pass by and pursue its way to the nearest railwaytown as others had done but contrary to the landlords expectation as he stood conning it through the yet unshuttered windows the solitary object on reaching the corner turned into the hotelfront and drove up to the door  it was a conveyance particularly unsuited to such a season and weather being nothing more substantial than an open basketcarriage drawn by a single horse  within sat two persons of different sexes as could soon be discerned in spite of their muffled attire  the man held the reins and the lady had got some shelter from the storm by clinging close to his side  the landlord rang the hostlers bell to attract the attention of the stableman for the approach of the visitors had been deadened to noiselessness by the snow and when the hostler had come to the horses head the gentleman and lady alighted the landlord meeting them in the hall  the male stranger was a foreignlooking individual of about eightand twenty  he was closeshaven excepting a moustache his features being good and even handsome  the lady who stood timidly behind him seemed to be much youngerpossibly not more than eighteen though it was difficult to judge either of her age or appearance in her present wrappings  the gentleman expressed his wish to stay till the morning explaining somewhat unnecessarily considering that the house was an inn that they had been unexpectedly benighted on their drive  such a welcome being given them as landlords can give in dull times the latter ordered fires in the drawing and coffeerooms and went to the boy in the yard who soon scrubbed himself up dragged his disused jacket from its box polished the buttons with his sleeve and appeared civilized in the hall the lady was shown into a room where she could take off her snowdamped garments which she sent down to be dried her companion meanwhile putting a couple of sovereigns on the table as if anxious to make everything smooth and comfortable at starting and requesting that a private sittingroom might be got ready  the landlord assured him that the best upstairs parlourusually publicshould be kept private this evening and sent the maid to light the candles  dinner was prepared for them and at the gentlemans desire served in the same apartment where the young lady having joined him they were left to the rest and refreshment they seemed to need  that something was peculiar in the relations of the pair had more than once struck the landlord though wherein that peculiarity lay it was hard to decide  but that his guest was one who paid his way readily had been proved by his conduct and dismissing conjectures he turned to practical affairs  about nine oclock he reentered the hall and everything being done for the day again walked up and down occasionally gazing through the glass door at the prospect without to ascertain how the weather was progressing  contrary to prognostication snow had ceased falling and with the rising of the moon the sky had partially cleared light fleeces of cloud drifting across the silvery disk  there was every sign that a frost was going to set in later on  for these reasons the distant rising road was even more distinct now between its high banks than it had been in the declining daylight  not a track or rut broke the virgin surface of the white mantle that lay along it all marks left by the lately arrived travellers having been speedily obliterated by the flakes falling at the time  and now the landlord beheld by the light of the moon a sight very similar to that he had seen by the light of day  again a black spot was advancing down the road that margined the coast  he was in a moment or two enabled to perceive that the present vehicle moved onward at a more headlong pace than the little carriage which had preceded it next that it was a brougham drawn by two powerful horses next that this carriage like the former one was bound for the hoteldoor  this desirable feature of resemblance caused the landlord to once more withdraw the sand bag and advance into the porch  an old gentleman was the first to alight  he was followed by a young one and both unhesitatingly came forward  has a young lady less than nineteen years of age recently arrived here in the company of a man some years her senior asked the old gentleman in haste  a man cleanly shaven for the most part having the appearance of an operasinger and calling himself signor smithozzi  we have had arrivals lately said the landlord in the tone of having had twenty at leastnot caring to acknowledge the attenuated state of business that afflicted prospect hotel in winter  and among them can your memory recall two persons such as those i describethe man a sort of baritone  there certainly is or was a young couple staying in the hotel but i could not pronounce on the compass of the gentlemans voice  no no of course not  i am quite bewildered  they arrived in a basket carriage altogether badly provided  they came in a carriage i believe as most of our visitors do  yes yes  i must see them at once  pardon my want of ceremony and show us in to where they are  but sir you forget  suppose the lady and gentleman i mean are not the lady and gentleman you mean  it would be awkward to allow you to rush in upon them just now while they are at dinner and might cause me to lose their future patronage  true true  they may not be the same persons  my anxiety i perceive makes me rash in my assumptions  upon the whole i think they must be the same uncle quantock said the young man who had not till now spoken  and turning to the landlord you possibly have not such a large assemblage of visitors here on this somewhat forbidding evening that you quite forget how this couple arrived and what the lady wore  his tone of addressing the landlord had in it a quiet frigidity that was not without irony  ah what she wore thats it james  what did she wear  i dont usually take stock of my guests clothing replied the landlord drily for the ready money of the first arrival had decidedly biassed him in favour of that gentlemans cause  you can certainly see some of it if you want to he added carelessly for it is drying by the kitchen fire  before the words were half out of his mouth the old gentleman had exclaimed ah and precipitated himself along what seemed to be the passage to the kitchen but as this turned out to be only the entrance to a dark chinacloset he hastily emerged again after a collision with the inncrockery had told him of his mistake  i beg your pardon im sure but if you only knew my feelings which i cannot at present explain you would make allowances  anything i have broken i will willingly pay for  dont mention it sir said the landlord  and showing the way they adjourned to the kitchen without further parley  the eldest of the party instantly seized the ladys cloak that hung upon a clotheshorse exclaiming ah yes james it is hers  i knew we were on their track  yes it is hers answered the nephew quietly for he was much less excited than his companion  show us their room at once said the old man  william have the lady and gentleman in the front sittingroom finished dining  yes sir long ago said the hundred plated buttons  then show up these gentlemen to them at once  you stay here tonight gentlemen i presume  shall the horses be taken out  feed the horses and wash their mouths  whether we stay or not depends upon circumstances said the placid younger man as he followed his uncle and the waiter to the staircase  i think nephew james said the former as he paused with his foot on the first stepi think we had better not be announced but take them by surprise  she may go throwing herself out of the window or do some equally desperate thing  yes certainly well enter unannounced  and he called back the lad who preceded them  i cannot sufficiently thank you james for so effectually aiding me in this pursuit exclaimed the old gentleman taking the other by the hand my increasing infirmities would have hindered my overtaking her tonight had it not been for your timely aid  i am only too happy uncle to have been of service to you in this or any other matter  i only wish i could have accompanied you on a pleasanter journey  however it is advisable to go up to them at once or they may hear us  and they softly ascended the stairs        on the door being opened a room too large to be comfortable lit by the best branchcandlesticks of the hotel was disclosed before the fire of which apartment the truant couple were sitting very innocently looking over the hotel scrapbook and the album containing views of the neighbourhood  no sooner had the old man entered than the young ladywho now showed herself to be quite as young as described and remarkably prepossessing as to featuresperceptibly turned pale  when the nephew entered she turned still paler as if she were going to faint  the young man described as an operasinger rose with grim civility and placed chairs for his visitors  caught you thank god said the old gentleman breathlessly  yes worse luck my lord murmured signor smithozzi in native london english that distinguished alien having in fact first seen the light in the vicinity of the city road  she would have been mine tomorrow and i think that under the peculiar circumstances it would be wiserconsidering how soon the breath of scandal will tarnish a ladys fameto let her be mine tomorrow just the same  never said the old man  here is a lady under age without experiencechildlike in her maiden innocence and virtuewhom you have plied by your vile arts till this morning at dawn  lord quantock were i not bound to respect your gray hairs  till this morning at dawn you tempted her away from her fathers roof what blame can attach to her conduct that will not on a full explanation of the matter be readily passed over in her and thrown entirely on you laura you return at once with me  i should not have arrived after all early enough to deliver you if it had not been for the disinterestedness of your cousin captain northbrook who on my discovering your flight this morning offered with a promptitude for which i can never sufficiently thank him to accompany me on my journey as the only male relative i have near me  come do you hear  put on your things we are off at once  i dont want to go pouted the young lady  i daresay you dont replied her father drily  but children never know whats best for them  so come along and trust to my opinion  laura was silent and did not move the opera gentleman looking helplessly into the fire and the ladys cousin sitting meditatively calm as the single one of the four whose position enabled him to survey the whole escapade with the cool criticism of a comparative outsider  i say to you laura as the father of a daughter under age that you instantly come with me  what  would you compel me to use physical force to reclaim you  i dont want to return again declared laura  it is your duty to return nevertheless and at once i inform you  i dont want to  now dear laura this is what i say return with me and your cousin james quietly like a good and repentant girl and nothing will be said nobody knows what has happened as yet and if we start at once we shall be home before it is light tomorrow morning  come  i am not obliged to come at your bidding father and i would rather not  now james the cousin during this dialogue might have been observed to grow somewhat restless and even impatient  more than once he had parted his lips to speak but second thoughts each time held him back  the moment had come however when he could keep silence no longer  come madam he spoke out this farce with your father has in my opinion gone on long enough  just make no more ado and step downstairs with us  she gave herself an intractable little twist and did not reply  by the lord harry laura i wont stand this he said angrily  come get on your things before i come and compel you  there is a kind of compulsion to which this talk is childs play  come madaminstantly i say  the old nobleman turned to his nephew and said mildly leave me to insist james  it doesnt become you  i can speak to her sharply enough if i choose  james however did not heed his uncle and went on to the troublesome young woman you say you dont want to come indeed  a pretty story to tell me that  come march out of the room at once and leave that hulking fellow for me to deal with afterward  get on quicklycome and he advanced toward her as if to pull her by the hand  nay nay expostulated lauras father much surprised at his nephews sudden demeanour  you take too much upon yourself  leave her to me  i wont leave her to you any longer  you have no right james to address either me or her in this way so just hold your tongue  come my dear  i have every right insisted james  how do you make that out  i have the right of a husband  whose husband  hers  what  shes my wife  james  well to cut a long story short i may say that she secretly married me in spite of your lordships prohibition about three months ago  and i must add that though she cooled down rather quickly everything went on smoothly enough between us for some time in spite of the awkwardness of meeting only by stealth  we were only waiting for a convenient moment to break the news to you when this idle adonis turned up and after poisoning her mind against me brought her into this disgrace  here the operatic luminary who had sat in rather an abstracted and nerveless attitude till the cousin made his declaration fired up and cried i declare before heaven that till this moment i never knew she was a wife  i found her in her fathers house an unhappy girlunhappy as i believe because of the loneliness and dreariness of that establishment and the want of society and for nothing else whatever what this statement about her being your wife means i am quite at a loss to understand  are you indeed married to him laura  laura nodded from within her tearful handkerchief  it was because of my anomalous position in being privately married to him she sobbed that i was unhappy at homeandand i didnt like him so well as i did at firstand i wished i could get out of the mess i was in  and then i saw you a few times and when you said well run off i thought i saw a way out of it all and then i agreed to come with youoooo  well well well  and is this true murmured the bewildered old nobleman staring from james to laura and from laura to james as if he fancied they might be figments of the imagination  is this then james the secret of your kindness to your old uncle in helping him to find his daughter  good heavens  what further depths of duplicity are there left for a man to learn  i have married her uncle quantock as i said answered james coolly the deed is done and cant be undone by talking here  where were you married  at st marys toneborough  when  on the 29th of september during the time she was visiting there  who married you  i dont know  one of the curateswe were quite strangers to the place so instead of my assisting you to recover her you may as well assist me  never never said lord quantock  madam and sir i beg to tell you that i wash my hands of the whole affair  if you are man and wife as it seems you are get reconciled as best you may  i have no more to say or do with either of you  i leave you laura in the hands of your husband and much joy may you bring him though the situation i own is not encouraging  saying this the indignant speaker pushed back his chair against the table with such force that the candlesticks rocked on their bases and left the room  lauras wet eyes roved from one of the young men to the other who now stood glaring face to face and being much frightened at their aspect slipped out of the room after her father  him however she could hear going out of the front door and not knowing where to take shelter she crept into the darkness of an adjoining bedroom and there awaited events with a palpitating heart  meanwhile the two men remaining in the sittingroom drew nearer to each other and the operasinger broke the silence by saying how could you insult me in the way you did calling me a fellow and accusing me of poisoning her mind toward you when you knew very well i was as ignorant of your relation to her as an unborn babe  oh yes you were quite ignorant i can believe that readily sneered lauras husband  i here call heaven to witness that i never knew  recitativothe rhythm excellent and the tone well sustained  is it likely that any man could win the confidence of a young fool her age and not get that out of her  preposterous  tell it to the most improved new pitstalls  captain northbrook your insinuations are as despicable as your wretched person cried the baritone losing all patience  and springing forward he slapped the captain in the face with the palm of his hand  northbrook flinched but slightly and calmly using his handkerchief to learn if his nose was bleeding said i quite expected this insult so i came prepared  and he drew forth from a black valise which he carried in his hand a small case of pistols  the baritone started at the unexpected sight but recovering from his surprise said very well as you will though perhaps his tone showed a slight want of confidence  now continued the husband quite confidingly we want no parade no nonsense you know  therefore well dispense with seconds  the signor slightly nodded  do you know this part of the country well cousin james went on in the same cool and still manner  if you dont i do  quite at the bottom of the rocks out there just beyond the stream which falls over them to the shore is a smooth sandy space not so much shut in as to be out of the moonlight and the way down to it from this side is over steps cut in the cliff and we can find our way down without trouble  wewe twowill find our way down but only one of us will find his way up you understand  quite  then suppose we start the sooner it is over the better  we can order supper before we go outsupper for two for though we are three at present  three  yes you and i and she  oh yes  we shall be only two by and by so that as i say we will order supper for two for the lady and a gentleman  whichever comes back alive will tap at her door and call her in to share the repast with himshes not off the premises  but we must not alarm her now and above all things we must not let the innpeople see us go out it would look so odd for two to go out and only one come in  ha ha  ha ha exactly  are you ready  ohquite  then ill lead the way  he went softly to the door and downstairs ordering supper to be ready in an hour as he had said then making a feint of returning to the room again he beckoned to the singer and together they slipped out of the house by a side door        the sky was now quite clear and the wheelmarks of the brougham which had borne away lauras father lord quantock remained distinctly visible soon the verge of the down was reached the captain leading the way and the baritone following silently casting furtive glances at his companion and beyond him at the scene ahead  in due course they arrived at the chasm in the cliff which formed the waterfall  the outlook here was wild and picturesque in the extreme and fully justified the many praises paintings and photographic views to which the spot had given birth  what in summer was charmingly green and gray was now rendered weird and fantastic by the snow  from their feet the cascade plunged downward almost vertically to a depth of eighty or a hundred feet before finally losing itself in the sand and though the stream was but small its impact upon jutting rocks in its descent divided it into a hundred spirts and splashes that sent up a mist into the upper air  a few marginal drippings had been frozen into icicles but the centre flowed on unimpeded  the operatic artist looked down as he halted but his thoughts were plainly not of the beauty of the scene  his companion with the pistols was immediately in front of him and there was no handrail on the side of the path toward the chasm  obeying a quick impulse he stretched out his arm and with a superhuman thrust sent lauras husband reeling over  a whirling human shape diminishing downward in the moons rays farther and farther toward invisibility a smacksmack upon the projecting ledges of rockat first louder and heavier than that of the brook and then scarcely to be distinguished from itthen a cessation then the splashing of the stream as before and the accompanying murmur of the sea were all the incidents that disturbed the customary flow of the little waterfall  the singer waited in a fixed attitude for a few minutes then turning he rapidly retraced his steps over the intervening upland toward the road and in less than a quarter of an hour was at the door of the hotel slipping quietly in as the clock struck ten he said to the landlord over the bar hatchway  the bill as soon as you can let me have it including charges for the supper that was ordered though we cannot stay to eat it i am sorry to say  he added with forced gaiety the ladys father and cousin have thought better of intercepting the marriage and after quarrelling with each other have gone home independently  well done sir said the landlord who still sided with this customer in preference to those who had given trouble and barely paid for baiting the horses  love will find out the way as the saying is  wish you joy sir  signor smithozzi went upstairs and on entering the sittingroom found that laura had crept out from the dark adjoining chamber in his absence she looked up at him with eyes red from weeping and with symptoms of alarm  what is itwhere is he she said apprehensively  captain northbrook has gone back  he says he will have no more to do with you  and i am quite abandoned by themand theyll forget me and nobody care about me any more  she began to cry afresh  but it is the luckiest thing that could have happened  all is just as it was before they came disturbing us  but laura you ought to have told me about that private marriage though it is all the same now it will be dissolved of course  you are a widvirtually a widow  it is no use to reproach me for what is past  what am i to do now  we go at once to cliffmartin  the horse has rested thoroughly these last three hours and he will have no difficulty in doing an additional halfdozen miles  we shall be there before twelve and there are late taverns in the place no doubt  there well sell both horse and carriage tomorrow morning and go by the coach to downstaple  once in the train we are safe  i agree to anything she said listlessly  in about ten minutes the horse was put in the bill paid the ladys dried wraps put round her and the journey resumed  when about a mile on their way they saw a glimmering light in advance of them  i wonder what that is said the baritone whose manner had latterly become nervous every sound and sight causing him to turn his head  it is only a turnpike said she  that light is the lamp kept burning over the door  of course of course dearest  how stupid i am  on reaching the gate they perceived that a man on foot had approached it apparently by some more direct path than the roadway they pursued and was at the moment they drew up standing in conversation with the gatekeeper  it is quite impossible that he could fall over the cliff by accident or the will of god on such a light night as this the pedestrian was saying  these two children i tell you of saw two men go along the path toward the waterfall and ten minutes later only one of em came back walking fast like a man who wanted to get out of the way because he had done something queer  there is no manner of doubt that he pushed the other man over and mark me it will soon cause a hue and cry for that man  the candle shone in the face of the signor and showed that there had arisen upon it a film of ghastliness  laura glancing toward him for a few moments observed it till the gatekeeper having mechanically swung open the gate her companion drove through and they were soon again enveloped in the white silence  her conductor had said to laura just before that he meant to inquire the way at this turnpike but he had certainly not done so  as soon as they had gone a little farther the omission intentional or not began to cause them some trouble  beyond the secluded district which they now traversed ran the more frequented road where progress would be easy the snow being probably already beaten there to some extent by traffic but they had not yet reached it and having no one to guide them their journey began to appear less feasible than it had done before starting  when the little lane which they had entered ascended another hill and seemed to wind round in a direction contrary to the expected route to cliffmartin the question grew serious  ever since overhearing the conversation at the turnpike laura had maintained a perfect silence and had even shrunk somewhat away from the side of her lover  why dont you talk laura he said with forced buoyancy and suggest the way we should go  oh yes i will she responded a curious fearfulness being audible in her voice  after this she uttered a few occasional sentences which seemed to persuade him that she suspected nothing  at last he drew rein and the weary horse stood still  we are in a fix he said  she answered eagerly ill hold the reins while you run forward to the top of the ridge and see if the road takes a favourable turn beyond  it would give the horse a few minutes rest and if you find out no change in the direction we will retrace this lane and take the other turning  the expedient seemed a good one in the circumstances especially when recommended by the singular eagerness of her voice and placing the reins in her handsa quite unnecessary precaution considering the state of their hackhe stepped out and went forward through the snow till she could see no more of him  no sooner was he gone than laura with a rapidity which contrasted strangely with her previous stillness made fast the reins to the corner of the phaeton and slipping out on the opposite side ran back with all her might down the hill till coming to an opening in the fence she scrambled through it and plunged into the copse which bordered this portion of the lane  here she stood in hiding under one of the large bushes clinging so closely to its umbrage as to seem but a portion of its mass and listening intently for the faintest sound of pursuit  but nothing disturbed the stillness save the occasional slipping of gathered snow from the boughs or the rustle of some wild animal over the crisp flakebespattered herbage  at length apparently convinced that her former companion was either unable to find her or not anxious to do so in the present strange state of affairs she crept out from the bushes and in less than an hour found herself again approaching the door of the prospect hotel  as she drew near laura could see that far from being wrapped in darkness as she might have expected there were ample signs that all the tenants were on the alert lights moving about the open space in front satisfaction was expressed in her face when she discerned that no reappearance of her baritone and his ponycarriage was causing this sensation but it speedily gave way to grief and dismay when she saw by the lights the form of a man borne on a stretcher by two others into the porch of the hotel  i have caused all this she murmured between her quivering lips  he has murdered him  running forward to the door she hastily asked of the first person she met if the man on the stretcher was dead  no miss said the labourer addressed eyeing her up and down as an unexpected apparition  he is still alive they say but not sensible he either fell or was pushed over the waterfall tis thoughted he was pushed  he is the gentleman who came here just now with the old lord and went out afterward as is thoughted with a stranger who had come a little earlier  anyhow thats as i had it  laura entered the house and acknowledging without the least reserve that she was the injured mans wife had soon installed herself as head nurse by the bed on which he lay  when the two surgeons who had been sent for arrived she learned from them that his wounds were so severe as to leave but a slender hope of recovery it being little short of miraculous that he was not killed on the spot which his enemy had evidently reckoned to be the case  she knew who that enemy was and shuddered  laura watched all night but her husband knew nothing of her presence during the next day he slightly recognized her and in the evening was able to speak  he informed the surgeons that as was surmised he had been pushed over the cascade by signor smithozzi but he communicated nothing to her who nursed him not even replying to her remarks he nodded courteously at any act of attention she rendered and that was all  in a day or two it was declared that everything favoured his recovery notwithstanding the severity of his injuries  full search was made for smithozzi but as yet there was no intelligence of his whereabouts though the repentant laura communicated all she knew  as far as could be judged he had come back to the carriage after searching out the way and finding the young lady missing had looked about for her till he was tired then had driven on to cliffmartin sold the horse and carriage next morning and disappeared probably by one of the departing coaches which ran thence to the nearest station the only difference from his original programme being that he had gone alone        during the days and weeks of that long and tedious recovery laura watched by her husbands bedside with a zeal and assiduity which would have considerably extenuated any fault save one of such magnitude as hers  that her husband did not forgive her was soon obvious  nothing that she could do in the way of smoothing pillows easing his position shifting bandages or administering draughts could win from him more than a few measured words of thankfulness such as he would probably have uttered to any other woman on earth who had performed these particular services for him  dear dear james she said one day bending her face upon the bed in an excess of emotion  how you have suffered  it has been too cruel  i am more glad you are getting better than i can say  i have prayed for itand i am sorry for what i have done i am innocent of the worst andi hope you will not think me so very bad james  oh no  on the contrary i shall think you very goodas a nurse he answered the caustic severity of his tone being apparent through its weakness  laura let fall two or three silent tears and said no more that day  somehow or other signor smithozzi seemed to be making good his escape  it transpired that he had not taken a passage in either of the suspected coaches though he had certainly got out of the county altogether the chance of finding him was problematical  not only did captain northbrook survive his injuries but it soon appeared that in the course of a few weeks he would find himself little if any the worse for the catastrophe  it could also be seen that laura while secretly hoping for her husbands forgiveness for a piece of folly of which she saw the enormity more clearly every day was in great doubt as to what her future relations with him would be  moreover to add to the complication whilst she as a runaway wife was unforgiven by her husband she and her husband as a runaway couple were unforgiven by her father who had never once communicated with either of them since his departure from the inn  but her immediate anxiety was to win the pardon of her husband who possibly might be bearing in mind as he lay upon his couch the familiar words of brabantio she has deceived her father and may thee  matters went on thus till captain northbrook was able to walk about  he then removed with his wife to quiet apartments on the south coast and here his recovery was rapid  walking up the cliffs one day supporting him by her arm as usual she said to him simply james if i go on as i am going now and always attend to your smallest want and never think of anything but devotion to you will youtry to like me a little  it is a thing i must carefully consider he said with the same gloomy dryness which characterized all his words to her now  when i have considered i will tell you  he did not tell her that evening though she lingered long at her routine work of making his bedroom comfortable putting the light so that it would not shine into his eyes seeing him fall asleep and then retiring noiselessly to her own chamber  when they met in the morning at breakfast and she had asked him as usual how he had passed the night she added timidly in the silence which followed his reply have you considered  no i have not considered sufficiently to give you an answer  laura sighed but to no purpose and the day wore on with intense heaviness to her and the customary modicum of strength gained to him  the next morning she put the same question and looked up despairingly in his face as though her whole life hung upon his reply  yes i have considered he said  ah  we must part  o james  i cannot forgive you no man would  enough is settled upon you to keep you in comfort whatever your father may do  i shall sell out and disappear from this hemisphere  you have absolutely decided she asked miserably  i have nobody now to cccare for  i have absolutely decided he shortly returned  we had better part here  you will go back to your father  there is no reason why i should accompany you since my presence would only stand in the way of the forgiveness he will probably grant you if you appear before him alone  we will say farewell to each other in three days from this time  i have calculated on being ready to go on that day  bowed down with trouble she withdrew to her room and the three days were passed by her husband in writing letters and attending to other businessmatters saying hardly a word to her the while  the morning of departure came but before the horses had been put in to take the severed twain in different directions out of sight of each other possibly for ever the postman arrived with the morning letters  there was one for the captain none for herthere were never any for her  however on this occasion something was enclosed for her in his which he handed her  she read it and looked up helpless  my dear fatheris dead she said  in a few moments she added in a whisper i must go to the manor to bury him    will you go with me james  he musingly looked out of the window  i suppose it is an awkward and melancholy undertaking for a woman alone he said coldly  well wellmy poor uncleyes ill go with you and see you through the business  so they went off together instead of asunder as planned  it is unnecessary to record the details of the journey or of the sad week which followed it at her fathers house  lord quantocks seat was a fine old mansion standing in its own park and there were plenty of opportunities for husband and wife either to avoid each other or to get reconciled if they were so minded which one of them was at least captain northbrook was not present at the reading of the will  she came to him afterward and found him packing up his papers intending to start next morning now that he had seen her through the turmoil occasioned by her fathers death  he has left me everything that he could she said to her husband james will you forgive me now and stay  i cannot stay  why not  i cannot stay he repeated  but why  i dont like you  he acted up to his word  when she came downstairs the next morning she was told that he had gone        laura bore her double bereavement as best she could  the vast mansion in which she had hitherto lived with all its historic contents had gone to her fathers successor in the title but her own was no unhandsome one around lay the undulating park studded with trees a dozen times her own age beyond it the wood beyond the wood the farms  all this fair and quiet scene was hers  she nevertheless remained a lonely repentant depressed being who would have given the greater part of everything she possessed to ensure the presence and affection of that husband whose very austerity and phlegmqualities that had formerly led to the alienation between themseemed now to be adorable features in his character  she hoped and hoped again but all to no purpose  captain northbrook did not alter his mind and return  he was quite a different sort of man from one who altered his mind that she was at last despairingly forced to admit  and then she left off hoping and settled down to a mechanical routine of existence which in some measure dulled her grief but at the expense of all her natural animation and the sprightly wilfulness which had once charmed those who knew her though it was perhaps all the while a factor in the production of her unhappiness  to say that her beauty quite departed as the years rolled on would be to overstate the truth  time is not a merciful master as we all know and he was not likely to act exceptionally in the case of a woman who had mental troubles to bear in addition to the ordinary weight of years  be this as it may eleven other winters came and went and laura northbrook remained the lonely mistress of house and lands without once hearing of her husband  every probability seemed to favour the assumption that he had died in some foreign land and offers for her hand were not few as the probability verged on certainty with the long lapse of time  but the idea of remarriage seemed never to have entered her head for a moment whether she continued to hope even now for his return could not be distinctly ascertained at all events she lived a life unmodified in the slightest degree from that of the first six months of his absence  this twelfth year of lauras loneliness and the thirtieth of her life drew on apace and the season approached that had seen the unhappy adventure for which she so long had suffered  christmas promised to be rather wet than cold and the trees on the outskirts of lauras estate dripped monotonously from day to day upon the turnpikeroad which bordered them  on an afternoon in this week between three and four oclock a hired fly might have been seen driving along the highway at this point and on reaching the top of the hill it stopped  a gentleman of middle age alighted from the vehicle  you need drive no farther he said to the coachman  the rain seems to have nearly ceased  ill stroll a little way and return on foot to the inn by dinnertime  the flyman touched his hat turned the horse and drove back as directed when he was out of sight the gentleman walked on but he had not gone far before the rain again came down pitilessly though of this the pedestrian took little heed going leisurely onward till he reached lauras park gate which he passed through  the clouds were thick and the days were short so that by the time he stood in front of the mansion it was dark  in addition to this his appearance which on alighting from the carriage had been untarnished partook now of the character of a drenched wayfarer not too well blessed with this worlds goods  he halted for no more than a moment at the front entrance and going round to the servants quarter as if he had a preconceived purpose in so doing there rang the bell  when a page came to him he inquired if they would kindly allow him to dry himself by the kitchen fire  the page retired and after a murmured colloquy returned with the cook who informed the wet and muddy man that though it was not her custom to admit strangers she should have no particular objection to his drying himself the night being so damp and gloomy  therefore the wayfarer entered and sat down by the fire  the owner of this house is a very rich gentleman no doubt he asked as he watched the meat turning on the spit  tis not a gentleman but a lady said the cook  a widow i presume  a sort of widow  poor soul her husband is gone abroad and has never been heard of for many years  she sees plenty of company no doubt to make up for his absence  no indeedhardly a soul  service here is as bad as being in a nunnery  in short the wayfarer who had at first been so coldly received contrived by his frank and engaging manner to draw the ladies of the kitchen into a most confidential conversation in which lauras history was minutely detailed from the day of her husbands departure to the present  the salient feature in all their discourse was her unflagging devotion to his memory  having apparently learned all that he wanted to knowamong other things that she was at this moment as always alonethe traveller said he was quite dry and thanking the servants for their kindness departed as he had come  on emerging into the darkness he did not however go down the avenue by which he had arrived  he simply walked round to the front door  there he rang and the door was opened to him by a manservant whom he had not seen during his sojourn at the other end of the house  in answer to the servants inquiry for his name he said ceremoniously will you tell the honourable mrs northbrook that the man she nursed many years ago after a frightful accident has called to thank her  the footman retreated and it was rather a long time before any further signs of attention were apparent  then he was shown into the drawing room and the door closed behind him  on the couch was laura trembling and pale  she parted her lips and held out her hands to him but could not speak  but he did not require speech and in a moment they were in each others arms  strange news circulated through that mansion and the neighbouring town on the next and following days  but the world has a way of getting used to things and the intelligence of the return of the honourable mrs northbrooks longabsent husband was soon received with comparative calm  a few days more brought christmas and the forlorn home of laura northbrook blazed from basement to attic with light and cheerfulness  not that the house was overcrowded with visitors but many were present and the apathy of a dozen years came at length to an end  the animation which set in thus at the close of the old year did not diminish on the arrival of the new and by the time its twelve months had likewise run the course of its predecessors a son had been added to the dwindled line of the northbrook family        at the conclusion of this narrative the spark was thanked with a manner of some surprise for nobody had credited him with a taste for taletelling  though it had been resolved that this story should be the last a few of the weatherbound listeners were for sitting on into the small hours over their pipes and glasses and raking up yet more episodes of family history  but the majority murmured reasons for soon getting to their lodgings  it was quite dark without except in the immediate neighbourhood of the feeble streetlamps and before a few shopwindows which had been hardily kept open in spite of the obvious unlikelihood of any chance customer traversing the muddy thoroughfares at that hour  by one by two and by three the benighted members of the fieldclub rose from their seats shook hands made appointments and dropped away to their respective quarters free or hired hoping for a fair morrow  it would probably be not until the next summer meeting months away in the future that the easy intercourse which now existed between them all would repeat itself  the crimson maltster for instance knew that on the following marketday his friends the president the rural dean and the bookworm would pass him in the street if they met him with the barest nod of civility the president and the colonel for social reasons the bookworm for intellectual reasons and the rural dean for moral ones the latter being a staunch teetotaller dead against john barleycorn  the sentimental member knew that when on his rambles he met his friend the bookworm with a pocketcopy of something or other under his nose the latter would not love his companionship as he had done today and the president the aristocrat and the farmer knew that affairs political sporting domestic or agricultural would exclude for a long time all rumination on the characters of dames gone to dust for scores of years however beautiful and noble they may have been in their day  the last member at length departed the attendant at the museum lowered the fire the curator locked up the rooms and soon there was only a single pirouetting flame on the top of a single coal to make the bones of the ichthyosaurus seem to leap the stuffed birds to wink and to draw a smile from the varnished skulls of vespasians soldiery
