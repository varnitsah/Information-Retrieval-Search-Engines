more orderly colony than britannula was ever settled by british colonists but it had its period of separation from the mother country though never of rebellionlike its elder sister new zealand indeed in that respect it simply followed the lead given her by the australias which when they set up for themselves did so with the full cooperation of england there was no doubt a special cause with us which did not exist in australia and which was only in part understood by the british government when we britannulists were allowed to stand by ourselves the great doctrine of a fixed period was received by them at first with ridicule and then with dismay but it was undoubtedly the strong faith which we of britannula had in that doctrine which induced our separation nothing could have been more successful than our efforts to live alone during the thirty years that we remained our own masters we repudiated no debtas have done some of our neighbours and no attempts have been made towards communismas has been the case with others we have been laborious contented and prosperous and if we have been reabsorbed by the mother country in accordance with what i cannot but call the pusillanimous conduct of certain of our elder britannulists it has not been from any failure on the part of the island but from the opposition with which the fixed period has been regarded  i think i must begin my story by explaining in moderate language a few of the manifest advantages which would attend the adoption of the fixed period in all countries as far as the law went it was adopted in britannula its adoption was the first thing discussed by our young assembly when we found ourselves alone and though there were disputes on the subject in none of them was opposition made to the system i myself at the age of thirty had been elected speaker of that parliament but i was nevertheless able to discuss the merits of the bills in committee and i did so with some enthusiasm thirty years have passed since and my period is drawing nigh but i am still as energetic as ever and as assured that the doctrine will ultimately prevail over the face of the civilised world though i will acknowledge that men are not as yet ripe for it  the fixed period has been so far discussed as to make it almost unnecessary for me to explain its tenets though its advantages may require a few words of argument in a world that is at present dead to its charms it consists altogether of the abolition of the miseries weakness and fainéant imbecility of old age by the prearranged ceasing to live of those who would otherwise become old need i explain to the inhabitants of england for whom i chiefly write how extreme are those sufferings and how great the costliness of that old age which is unable in any degree to supply its own wants such old age should not we britannulists maintain be allowed to be this should be prevented in the interests both of the young and of those who do become old when obliged to linger on after their period of work is over two mistakes have been made by mankind in reference to their own racefirst in allowing the world to be burdened with the continued maintenance of those whose cares should have been made to cease and whose troubles should be at an end does not the psalmist say the sameif by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow and the second in requiring those who remain to live a useless and painful life both these errors have come from an illjudged and a thoughtless tendernessa tenderness to the young in not calling upon them to provide for the decent and comfortable departure of their progenitors and a tenderness to the old lest the man when uninstructed and unconscious of good and evil should be unwilling to leave the world for which he is not fitted but such tenderness is no better than unpardonable weakness statistics have told us that the sufficient sustenance of an old man is more costly than the feeding of a young oneas is also the care nourishment and education of the as yet unprofitable child statistics also have told us that the unprofitable young and the no less unprofitable old form a third of the population let the reader think of the burden with which the labour of the world is thus saddled to these are to be added all who because of illness cannot work and because of idleness will not how are a people to thrive when so weighted and for what good as for the children they are clearly necessary they have to be nourished in order that they may do good work as their time shall come but for whose good are the old and effete to be maintained amid all these troubles and miseries had there been any one in our parliament capable of showing that they could reasonably desire it the bill would not have been passed though to me the politicoeconomical view of the subject was always very strong the relief to be brought to the aged was the one argument to which no reply could be given  it was put forward by some who opposed the movement that the old themselves would not like it i never felt sure of that nor do i now when the colony had become used to the fixed period system the old would become accustomed as well as the young it is to be understood that a euthanasia was to be prepared for themand how many as men now are does a euthanasia await and they would depart with the full respect of all their fellowcitizens to how many does that lot now fall during the last years of their lives they were to be saved from any of the horrors of poverty how many now lack the comforts they cannot earn for themselves and to them there would be no degraded feeling that they were the recipients of charity they would be prepared for their departure for the benefit of their country surrounded by all the comforts to which at their time of life they would be susceptible in a college maintained at the public expense and each as he drew nearer to the happy day would be treated with still increasing honour i myself had gone most closely into the question of expense and had found that by the use of machinery the college could almost be made selfsupporting but we should save on an average £50 for each man and woman who had departed when our population should have become a million presuming that one only in fifty would have reached the desired age the sum actually saved to the colony would amount to £1000000 ayear it would keep us out of debt make for us our railways render all our rivers navigable construct our bridges and leave us shortly the richest people on gods earth and this would be effected by a measure doing more good to the aged than to any other class of the community  many arguments were used against us but were vain and futile in their conception in it religion was brought to bear and in talking of this the terrible word murder was brought into common use i remember startling the house by forbidding any member to use a phrase so revolting to the majesty of the people murder did any one who attempted to deter us by the use of foul language bethink himself that murder to be murder must be opposed to the law this thing was to be done by the law there can be no other murder if a murderer be hangedin england i mean for in britannula we have no capital punishmentis that murder it is not so only because the law enacts it i and a few others did succeed at last in stopping the use of that word then they talked to us of methuselah and endeavoured to draw an argument from the age of the patriarchs i asked them in committee whether they were prepared to prove that the 969 years as spoken of in genesis were the same measure of time as 969 years now and told them that if the sanitary arrangements of the world would again permit men to live as long as the patriarchs we would gladly change the fixed period  in fact there was not a word to be said against us except that which referred to the feelings of the young and old feelings are changeable i told them at that great and glorious meeting which we had at gladstonopolis and though naturally governed only by instinct would be taught at last to comply with reason i had lately read how feelings had been allowed in england to stand in the way of the great work of cremation a son will not like you say to lead his father into the college but ought he not to like to do so and if so will not reason teach him to like to do what he ought i can conceive with rapture the pride the honour the affection with which when the fixed period had come i could have led my father into the college there to enjoy for twelve months that preparation for euthanasia which no cares for this world would be allowed to disturb all the existing ideas of the grave would be absent there would be no further struggles to prolong the time of misery which nature had herself produced that temptation to the young to begrudge to the old the costly comforts which they could not earn would be no longer fostered it would be a pride for the young man to feel that his parents name had been enrolled to all coming time in the bright books of the college which was to be established for the fixed period i have a son of my own and i have carefully educated him to look forward to the day in which he shall deposit me there as the proudest of his life circumstances as i shall relate in this story have somewhat interfered with him but he will i trust yet come back to the right way of thinking that i shall never spend that last happy year within the walls of the college is to me from a selfish point of view the saddest part of englands reassuming our island as a colony  my readers will perceive that i am an enthusiast but there are reforms so great that a man cannot but be enthusiastic when he has received into his very soul the truth of any human improvement alas me i shall never live to see carried out the glory of this measure to which i have devoted the best years of my existence the college which has been built under my auspices as a preparation for the happy departure is to be made a chamber of commerce those aged men who were awaiting as i verily believe in impatience the coming day of their perfected dignity have been turned loose in the world and allowed to grovel again with mundane thoughts amidst the idleness of years that are useless our bridges our railways our government are not provided for our young men are again becoming torpid beneath the weight imposed upon them i was in truth wrong to think that so great a reform could be brought to perfection within the days of the first reformers a divine idea has to be made common to mens minds by frequent ventilation before it will be seen to be fit for humanity did not the first christians all suffer affliction poverty and martyrdom how many centuries has it taken in the history of the world to induce it to denounce the not yet abolished theory of slavery a throne a lord and a bishop still remain to encumber the earth what right had i then as the first of the fixedperiodists to hope that i might live to see my scheme carried out or that i might be allowed to depart as among the first glorious recipients of its advantages  it would appear absurd to say that had there been such a law in force in england england would not have prevented its adoption in britannula that is a matter of course but it has been because the old men are still alive in england that the young in britannula are to be afflictedthe young and the old as well the prime minister in downing street was seventytwo when we were debarred from carrying out our project and the secretary for the colonies was sixtynine had they been among us and had we been allowed to use our wisdom without interference from effete old age where would they have been i wish to speak with all respect of sir william gladstone when we named our metropolis after him we were aware of his good qualities he has not the eloquence of his greatgrandfather but he is they tell us a safe man as to the minister for the crown coloniesof which alas britannula has again become onei do not i own look upon him as a great statesman the present duke of hatfield has none of the dash if he has more than the prudence of his grandfather he was elected to the present upper chamber as a strong antichurch liberal but he never has had the spirit to be a true reformer it is now due to the feelings which fill no doubt the bosoms of these two antifixedperiod seniors that the doctrine of the fixed period has for a time been quenched in britannula it is sad to think that the strength and intellect and spirit of manhood should thus be conquered by that very imbecility which it is their desire to banish from the world  two years since i had become the president of that which we gloried to call the rising empire of the south pacific and in spite of all internal opposition the college of the fixed period was already completed i then received violent notice from the british government that britannula had ceased to be independent and had again been absorbed by the mother country among the crown colonies how that information was received and with what weakness on the part of the britannulists i now proceed to tell  i confess that i for one was not at first prepared to obey we were small but we were independent and owed no more of submission to great britain than we do to the salomon islands or to otaheite it was for us to make our own laws and we had hitherto made them in conformity with the institutions and i must say with the prejudices of socalled civilisation we had now made a first attempt at progress beyond these limits and we were immediately stopped by the fatuous darkness of the old men whom had great britain known her own interest she would already have silenced by a fixed period law on her own account no greater instance of uncalledfor tyranny is told of in the history of the world as already written but my brother britannulists did not agree with me that in the interest of the coming races it was our duty rather to die at our posts than yield to the menaces of the duke of hatfield one british gunboat they declared in the harbour of gladstonopolis would reduce usto order what order a 250ton steamswiveller could no doubt crush us and bring our fixed period college in premature ruin about our ears but as was said the captain of the gunboat would never dare to touch the wire that should commit so wide a destruction an englishman would hesitate to fire a shot that would send perhaps five thousand of his fellowcreatures to destruction before their fixed period but even in britannula fear still remains it was decided i will confess by the common voice of the island that we should admit this governor and swear fealty again to the british crown sir ferdinando brown was allowed to land and by the rejoicing made at the first government house ball as i have already learned since i left the island it appeared that the britannulists rejoiced rather than otherwise at their thraldom  two months have passed since that time and i being a wornout old man and fitted only for the glory of the college have nothing left me but to write this story so that coming ages may see how noble were our efforts but in truth the difficulties which lay in our way were very stern the philosophical truth on which the system is founded was too strong too mighty too divine to be adopted by man in the immediate age of its first appearance but it has appeared and i perhaps should be contented and gratified during the years which i am doomed to linger through impotent imbecility to think that i have been the first reformer of my time though i shall be doomed to perish without having enjoyed its fruits  i must now explain before i begin my story certain details of our plan which created much schism among ourselves in the first place what should be the fixed period when a party of us three or four hundred in number first emigrated from new zealand to britannula we were almost all of us young people we would not consent to measures in regard to their public debt which the houses in new zealand threatened to take and as this island had been discovered and a part of it cultivated thither we determined to go our resolution was very popular not only with certain parties in new zealand but also in the mother country others followed us and we settled ourselves with great prosperity but we were essentially a young community there were not above ten among us who had then reached any fixed period and not above twenty others who could be said to be approaching it there never could arrive a time or a people when or among whom the system could be tried with so good a hope of success it was so long before we had been allowed to stand on our bottom that the fixed period became a matter of common conversation in britannula there were many who looked forward to it as the creator of a new idea of wealth and comfort and it was in those days that the calculation was made as to the rivers and railways i think that in england they thought that a few and but a few among us were dreamers of a dream had they believed that the fixed period would ever have become law they would not have permitted us to be lawmakers i acknowledge that but when we were once independent then again to reduce us to submission by a 250ton steamswiveller was an act of gross tyranny  what should be the fixed period that was the first question which demanded an immediate answer years were named absurd in their intended leniencyeighty and even eightyfive let us say a hundred said i aloud turning upon them all the battery of my ridicule i suggested sixty but the term was received with silence i pointed out that the few old men now on the island might be exempted and that even those above fiftyfive might be allowed to drag out their existences if they were weak enough to select for themselves so degrading a position this latter proposition was accepted at once and the exempt showed no repugnance even when it was proved to them that they would be left alone in the community and entitled to no honour and never allowed even to enter the pleasant gardens of the college i think now that sixty was too early an age and that sixtyfive to which i gracefully yielded is the proper fixed period for the human race let any man look among his friends and see whether men of sixtyfive are not in the way of those who are still aspiring to rise in the world a judge shall be deaf on the bench when younger men below him can hear with accuracy his voice shall have descended to a poor treble or his eyesight shall be dim and failing at any rate his limbs will have lost all that robust agility which is needed for the adequate performance of the work of the world it is selfevident that at sixtyfive a man has done all that he is fit to do he should be troubled no longer with labour and therefore should be troubled no longer with life it is all vanity and vexation of spirit such a one would say if still brave and still desirous of honour lead me into the college and there let me prepare myself for that brighter life which will require no mortal strength my words did avail with many and then they demanded that seventy should be the fixed period  how long we fought over this point need not now be told but we decided at last to divide the interval sixtyseven and a half was named by a majority of the assembly as the fixed period surely the colony was determined to grow in truth old before it could go into the college but then there came a further dispute on which side of the fixed period should the year of grace be taken our debates even on this subject were long and animated it was said that the seclusion within the college would be tantamount to penal departure and that the old men should thus have the last lingering drops of breath allowed them without in the world at large it was at last decided that men and women should be brought into the college at sixtyseven and that before their sixtyeighth birthday they should have departed then the bells were rung and the whole community rejoiced and banquets were eaten and the young men and women called each other brother and sister and it was felt that a great reform had been inaugurated among us for the benefit of mankind at large  little was thought about it at home in england when the bill was passed there was i suppose in the estimation of englishmen time enough to think about it the idea was so strange to them that it was considered impossible that we should carry it out they heard of the bill no doubt but i maintain that as we had been allowed to separate ourselves and stand alone it was no more their concern than if it had been done in arizona or idaho or any of those western states of america which have lately formed themselves into a new union it was from them no doubt that we chiefly expected that sympathy which however we did not receive the world was clearly not yet alive to the grand things in store for it we received indeed a violent remonstrance from the oldfashioned government at washington but in answer to that we stated that we were prepared to stand and fall by the new systemthat we expected glory rather than ignominy and to be followed by mankind rather than repudiated we had a lengthened correspondence also with new zealand and with australia but england at first did not believe us and when she was given to understand that we were in earnest she brought to bear upon us the one argument that could have force and sent to our harbour her 250ton steamswiveller the 250ton swiveller no doubt was unanswerableunless we were prepared to die for our system i was prepared but i could not carry the people of my country with me  i have now given the necessary prelude to the story which i have to tell i cannot but think that in spite of the isolated manners of great britain readers in that country generally must have become acquainted with the views of the fixedperiodists it cannot but be that a scheme with such power to changeand i may say to improvethe manners and habits of mankind should be known in a country in which a portion of the inhabitants do at any rate read and write they boast indeed that not a man or a woman in the british islands is now ignorant of his letters but i am informed that the knowledge seldom approaches to any literary taste it may be that a portion of the masses should have been ignorant of what was being done within the empire of the south pacific i have therefore written this preliminary chapter to explain to them what was the condition of britannula in regard to the fixed period just twelve months before england had taken possession of us and once more made us her own sir ferdinando brown now rules us i must say not with a rod of iron but very much after his own good will he makes us flowery speeches and thinks that they will stand in lieu of independence he collects his revenue and informs us that to be taxed is the highest privilege of an ornate civilisation he pointed to the gunboat in the bay when it came and called it the divine depository of beneficent power for a time no doubt british tenderness will prevail but i shall have wasted my thoughts and in vain poured out my eloquence as to the fixed period if in the course of years it does not again spring to the front and prove itself to be necessary before man can accomplish all that he is destined to achieve     chapter ii  gabriel crasweller   i will now begin my tale it is above thirty years since i commenced my agitation in britannula we were a small people and had not then been blessed by separation but we were i think peculiarly intelligent we were the very cream as it were that had been skimmed from the milkpail of the people of a wider colony themselves gifted with more than ordinary intelligence we were the élite of the selected population of new zealand i think i may say that no race so well informed ever before set itself down to form a new nation i am now nearly sixty years oldvery nearly fit for the college which alas will never be open for meand i was nearly thirty when i began to be in earnest as to the fixed period at that time my dearest friend and most trusted coadjutor was gabriel crasweller he was ten years my senior then and is now therefore fit for deposition in the college were the college there to receive him he was one of those who brought with them merino sheep into the colony at great labour and expense he exported from new zealand a small flock of choice animals with which he was successful from the first he took possession of the lands of little christchurch five or six miles from gladstonopolis and showed great judgment in the selection a prettier spot as it turned out for the fattening of both beef and mutton and for the growth of wool it would have been impossible to have found everything that human nature wants was there at little christchurch the streams which watered the land were bright and rapid and always running the grasses were peculiarly rich and the old english fruittrees which we had brought with us from new zealand throve there with an exuberant fertility of which the mother country i am told knows nothing he had imported pheasants eggs and salmonspawn and young deer and blackcock and grouse and those beautiful little alderney cows no bigger than goodsized dogs which when milked give nothing but cream all these things throve with him uncommonly so that it may be declared of him that his lines had fallen in pleasant places but he had no son and therefore in discussing with him as i did daily the question of the fixed period i promised him that it should be my lot to deposit him in the sacred college when the day of his withdrawal should have come he had been married before we left new zealand and was childless when he made for himself and his wife his homestead at little christchurch but there after a few years a daughter was born to him and i ought to have remembered when i promised to him that last act of friendship that it might become the duty of that childs husband to do for him with filial reverence the loving work which i had undertaken to perform  many and most interesting were the conversations held between crasweller and myself on the great subject which filled our hearts he undoubtedly was sympathetic and took delight in expatiating on all those benefits that would come to the world from the race of mankind which knew nothing of the debility of old age he saw the beauty of the theory as well as did i myself and would speak often of the weakness of that pretended tenderness which would fear to commence a new operation in regard to the feelings of the men and women of the old world can any man love another better than i do you i would say to him with energy and yet would i scruple for a moment to deposit you in the college when the day had come i should lead you in with that perfect reverence which it is impossible that the young should feel for the old when they become feeble and incapable i doubt now whether he relished these allusions to his own seclusion he would run away from his own individual case and generalise widely about some future time and when the time for voting came he certainly did vote for seventyfive but i took no offence at his vote gabriel crasweller was almost my dearest friend and as his girl grew up it was a matter of regret to me that my only son was not quite old enough to be her husband  eva crasweller was i think the most perfect piece i ever beheld of youthful feminine beauty i have not yet seen those english beauties of which so much is said in their own romances but whom the young men from new york and san francisco who make their way to gladstonopolis do not seem to admire very much eva was perfect in symmetry in features in complexion and in simplicity of manners all languages are the same to her but that accomplishment has become so common in britannula that but little is thought of it i do not know whether she ravished our ears most with the oldfashioned piano and the nearly obsolete violin or with the modern mousometor or the more perfect melpomeneon it was wonderful to hear the way with which she expressed herself at the meeting held about the rising buildings of the college when she was only sixteen but i think she touched me most with just a rolypoly pudding which she made with her own fair hands for our dinner one sunday at little christchurch and once when i saw her by chance take a kiss from her lover behind the door i felt that it was a pity indeed that a man should ever become old perhaps however in the eyes of some her brightest charm lay in the wealth which her father possessed his sheep had greatly increased in number the valleys were filled with his cattle and he could always sell his salmon for halfacrown a pound and his pheasants for sevenandsixpence a brace everything had thriven with crasweller and everything must belong to eva as soon as he should have been led into the college evas mother was now dead and no other child had been born crasweller had also embarked his money largely in the wool trade and had become a sleepingpartner in the house of grundle  grabbe he was an older man by ten years than either of his partners but yet grundles eldest son abraham was older than eva when crasweller lent his money to the firm it was soon known who was to be the happiest man in the empire it was young abraham by whom eva was kissed behind the door that sunday when we ate the rolypoly pudding then she came into the room and with her eyes raised to heaven and with a halo of glory almost round her head as she poured forth her voice she touched the mousometor and gave us the old hundredth psalm  she was a fine girl at all points and had been quite alive to the dawn of the fixed period system but at this time on the memorable occasion of the eating of that dinner it first began to strike me that my friend crasweller was getting very near his fixed period and it occurred to me to ask myself questions as to what might be the daughters wishes it was the state of her feelings rather that would push itself into my mind quite lately he had said nothing about itnor had she on that sunday morning when he and his girl were at churchfor crasweller had stuck to the old habit of saying his prayers in a special place on a special dayi had discussed the matter with young grundle nobody had been into the college as yet three or four had died naturally but crasweller was about to be the first we were arranging that he should be attended by pleasant visitors till within the last week or two and i was making special allusion to the law which required that he should abandon all control of his property immediately on his entering the college i suppose he would do that said grundle expressing considerable interest by the tone of his voice  oh certainly said i he must do that in accordance with the law but he can make his will up to the very moment in which he is deposited he had then about twelve months to run i suppose there was not a man or woman in the community who was not accurately aware of the very day of craswellers birth we had already introduced the habit of tattooing on the backs of the babies the day on which they were born and we had succeeded in operating also on many of the children who had come into the world before the great law some there were who would not submit on behalf of themselves or their children and we did look forward to some little confusion in this matter a register had of course been commenced and there were already those who refused to state their exact ages but i had been long on the lookout for this and had a little book of my own in which were inscribed the periods of all those who had come to britannula with us and since i had first thought of the fixed period i had been very careful to note faithfully the births as they occurred the reader will see how important as time went on it would become to have an accurate record and i already then feared that there might be some want of fidelity after i myself had been deposited but my friend crasweller was the first on the list and there was no doubt in the empire as to the exact day on which he was born all britannula knew that he would be the first and that he was to be deposited on the 13th of june 1980 in conversation with my friend i had frequently alluded to the very dayto the happy day as i used to call it before i became acquainted with his actual feelingsand he never ventured to deny that on that day he would become sixtyseven  i have attempted to describe his daughter eva and i must say a word as to the personal qualities of her father he too was a remarkably handsome man and though his hair was beautifully white had fewer of the symptoms of age than any old man i had before known he was tall robust and broad and there was no beginning even of a stoop about him he spoke always clearly and audibly and he was known for the firm voice with which he would perform occasionally at some of our decimal readings we had fixed our price at a decimal in order that the sum so raised might be used for the ornamentation of the college our population at gladstonopolis was so thriving that we found it as easy to collect ten pennies as one at these readings gabriel crasweller was the favourite performer and it had begun to be whispered by some caitiffs who would willingly disarrange the whole starry system for their own immediate gratification that crasweller should not be deposited because of the beauty of his voice and then the difficulty was somewhat increased by the care and precision with which he attended to his own business he was as careful as ever about his flocks and at shearingtime would stand all day in the woolshed to see to the packing of his wool and the marking of his bales  it would be a pity said to me a britannulist one daya man younger than myselfto lock up old crasweller and let the business go into the hands of young grundle young grundle will never know half as much about sheep in spite of his conceit and crasweller is a deal fitter for his work than for living idle in the college till you shall put an end to him  there was much in these words which made me very angry according to this mans feelings the whole system was to be made to suit itself to the peculiarities of one individual constitution a man who so spoke could have known nothing of the general beauty of the fixed period and he had alluded to the manner of depositing in most disrespectful terms i had felt it to be essentially necessary so to maintain the dignity of the ceremony as to make it appear as unlike an execution as possible and this depositing of crasweller was to be the first and shouldaccording to my own intentionsbe attended with a peculiar grace and reverence i dont know what you call locking up said i angrily had mr crasweller been about to be dragged to a felons prison you could not have used more opprobrious language and as to putting an end to him you must i think be ignorant of the method proposed for adding honour and glory to the last moments in this world of those dear friends whose happy lot it will be to be withdrawn from the worlds troubles amidst the love and veneration of their fellowsubjects as to the actual mode of transition there had been many discussions held by the executive in president square and it had at last been decided that certain veins should be opened while the departing one should under the influence of morphine be gently entranced within a warm bath i as president of the empire had agreed to use the lancet in the first two or three cases thereby intending to increase the honours conferred under these circumstances i did feel the sting bitterly when he spoke of my putting an end to him but you have not i said at all realised the feeling of the ceremony a few illspoken words such as these you have just uttered will do us more harm in the minds of many than all your voting will have done good in answer to this he merely repeated his observation that crasweller was a very bad specimen to begin with he has got ten years of work in him said my friend and yet you intend to make away with him without the slightest compunction  make away with him what an expression to useand this from the mouth of one who had been a determined fixedperiodist it angered me to think that men should be so little reasonable as to draw deductions as to an entire system from a single instance crasweller might in truth be strong and hearty at the fixed period but that period had been chosen with reference to the community at large and what though he might have to depart a year or two before he was worn out still he would do so with everything around him to make him happy and would depart before he had ever known the agony of a headache looking at the entire question with the eyes of reason i could not but tell myself that a better example of a triumphant beginning to our system could not have been found but yet there was in it something unfortunate had our first hero been compelled to abandon his business by old agehad he become doting over its detailsparsimonious or extravagant or even shortsighted in his speculationspublic feeling than which nothing is more ignorant would have risen in favour of the fixed period how true is the presidents reasoning the people would have said look at crasweller he would have ruined little christchurch had he stayed there much longer but everything he did seemed to prosper and it occurred to me at last that he forced himself into abnormal sprightliness with a view of bringing disgrace upon the law of the fixed period if there were any such feeling i regard it as certainly mean  on the day after the dinner at which evas pudding was eaten abraham grundle came to me at the executive hall and said that he had a few things to discuss with me of importance abraham was a goodlooking young man with black hair and bright eyes and a remarkably handsome moustache and he was one well inclined to business in whose hands the firm of grundle grabbe  crasweller was likely to thrive but i myself had never liked him much i had thought him to be a little wanting in that reverence which he owed to his elders and to be moreover somewhat overfond of money it had leaked out that though he was no doubt attached to eva crasweller he had thought quite as much of little christchurch and though he could kiss eva behind the door after the ways of young men still he was more intent on the fleeces than on her lips i want to say a word to you mr president he began upon a subject that disturbs my conscience very much  your conscience said i  yes mr president i believe youre aware that i am engaged to marry miss crasweller  it may be as well to explain here that my own eldest son as fine a boy as ever delighted a mothers eye was only two years younger than eva and that my wife mrs neverbend had of late got it into her head that he was quite old enough to marry the girl it was in vain that i told her that all that had been settled while jack was still at the didascalion he had been colonel of the curriculum as they now call the head boy but eva had not then cared for colonels of curriculums but had thought more of young grundles moustache my wife declared that all that was alteredthat jack was in fact a much more manly fellow than abraham with his shiny bit of beard and that if one could get at a maidens heart we should find that eva thought so in answer to this i bade her hold her tongue and remember that in britannula a promise was always held to be as good as a bond i suppose a young woman may change her mind in britannula as well as elsewhere said my wife i turned all this over in my mind because the slopes of little christchurch are very alluring and they would all belong to eva so soon and then it would be well as i was about to perform for crasweller so important a portion of his final ceremony our close intimacy should be drawn still nearer by a family connection i did think of it but then it occurred to me that the girls engagement to young grundle was an established fact and it did not behove me to sanction the breach of a contract oh yes said i to the young man i am aware that there is an understanding to that effect between you and evas father  and between me and eva i can assure you  having observed the kiss behind the door on the previous day i could not deny the truth of this assertion  it is quite understood continued abraham and i had always thought that it was to take place at once so that eva might get used to her new life before her papa was deposited  to this i merely bowed my head as though to signify that it was a matter with which i was not personally concerned i had taken it for granted that my old friend would like to see his daughter settled and little christchurch put into his daughters hands before he should bid adieu to his own sublunary affairs i remarked when i found that he paused  we all thought so up at the warehouse said hei and father and grabbe and postlecott our chief clerk postlecott is the next but three on the books and is getting very melancholy but he is especially anxious just at present to see how crasweller bears it  what has all that to do with evas marriage  i suppose i might marry her but he hasnt made any will  what does that matter there is nobody to interfere with eva  but he might go off mr neverbend whispered grundle and where should i be then if he was to get across to auckland or to sydney and to leave some one to manage the property for him what could you do thats what i want to know the law says that he shall be deposited on a certain day  he will become as nobody in the eye of the law said i with all the authority of a president  but if he and his daughter have understood each other and if some deed be forthcoming by which little christchurch shall have been left to trustees and if he goes on living at sydney let us say on the fat of the landdrawing all the income and leaving the trustees as legal ownerswhere should i be then  in that case said i having taken two or three minutes for considerationin that case i presume the property would be confiscated by law and would go to his natural heir now if his natural heir be then your wife it will be just the same as though the property were yours young grundle shook his head i dont know what more you would want at any rate there is no more for you to get i confess that at that moment the idea of my boys chance of succeeding with the heiress did present itself to my mind according to what my wife had said jack would have jumped at the girl with just what she stood up in and had sworn to his mother when he had been told that morning about the kiss behind the door that he would knock that brutes head off his shoulders before many days were gone by looking at the matter merely on behalf of jack it appeared to me that little christchurch would in that case be quite safe let crasweller be depositedor run away to sydney  you do not know for certain about the confiscation of the property said abraham  ive told you as much mr grundle as it is fit that you should know i replied with severity for the absolute condition of the law you must look in the statutebook and not come to the president of the empire  abraham grundle then departed i had assumed an angry air as though i were offended with him for troubling me on a matter by referring simply to an individual but he had in truth given rise to very serious and solemn thoughts could it be that crasweller my own confidential friendthe man to whom i had trusted the very secrets of my soul on this important mattercould it be that he should be unwilling to be deposited when the day had come could it be that he should be anxious to fly from his country and her laws just as the time had arrived when those laws might operate upon him for the benefit of that country i could not think that he was so vain so greedy so selfish and so unpatriotic but this was not all should he attempt to fly could we prevent his flying and if he did fly what step should we take next the government of new south wales was hostile to us on the very matter of the fixed period and certainly would not surrender him in obedience to any law of extradition and he might leave his property to trustees who would manage it on his behalf although as far as britannula was concerned he would be beyond the reach of law and regarded even as being without the pale of life and if he the first of the fixedperiodists were to run away the fashion of so running would become common we should thus be rid of our old men and our object would be so far attained but looking forward i could see at a glance that if one or two wealthy members of our community were thus to escape it would be almost impossible to carry out the law with reference to those who should have no such means but that which vexed me most was that gabriel crasweller should desire to escapethat he should be anxious to throw over the whole system to preserve the poor remnant of his life if he would do so who could be expected to abstain if he should prove false when the moment came who would prove true and he the first the very first on our list young grundle had now left me and as i sat thinking of it i was for a moment tempted to abandon the fixed period altogether but as i remained there in silent meditation better thoughts came to me had i dared to regard myself as the foremost spirit of my age and should i thus be turned back by the human weakness of one poor creature who had not sufficiently collected the strength of his heart to be able to look death in the face and to laugh him down it was a difficultya difficulty the more it might be the crushing difficulty which would put an end to the system as far as my existence was concerned but i bethought me how many early reformers had perished in their efforts and how seldom it had been given to the first man to scale the walls of prejudice and force himself into the citadel of reason but they had not yielded when things had gone against them and though they had not brought their visions down to the palpable touch of humanity still they had persevered and their efforts had not been altogether lost to the world  so it shall be with me said i though i may never live to deposit a human being within that sanctuary and though i may be doomed by the foolish prejudice of men to drag out a miserable existence amidst the sorrows and weakness of old age though it may never be given to me to feel the ineffable comforts of a triumphant depositionstill my name will be handed down to coming ages and i shall be spoken of as the first who endeavoured to save grey hairs from being brought with sorrow to the grave  i am now writing on board hm gunboat john brightfor the tyrannical slaves of a modern monarch have taken me in the flesh and are carrying me off to england so that as they say all that nonsense of a fixed period may die away in britannula they thinkpoor ignorant fighting menthat such a theory can be made to perish because one individual shall have been mastered but no the idea will still live and in ages to come men will prosper and be strong and thrive unpolluted by the greed and cowardice of second childhood because john neverbend was at one time president of britannula  it occurred to me then as i sat meditating over the tidings conveyed to me by abraham grundle that it would be well that i should see crasweller and talk to him freely on the subject it had sometimes been that by my strength i had reinvigorated his halting courage this suggestion that he might run away as the day of his deposition drew nighor rather that others might run awayhad been the subject of some conversation between him and me how will it be he had said if they mizzle he had intended to allude to the possible premature departure of those who were about to be deposited  men will never be so weak i said  i suppose youd take all their property  every stick of it  but property is a thing which can be conveyed away  we should keep a sharp lookout upon themselves there might be a writ you know ne exeant regno if we are driven to a pinch that will be the last thing to do but i should be sorry to be driven to express my fear of human weakness by any general measure of that kind it would be tantamount to an accusation of cowardice against the whole empire  crasweller had only shaken his head but i had understood him to shake it on the part of the human race generally and not on his own behalf     chapter iii  the first breakdown   it was now midwinter and it wanted just twelve months to that 30th of june on which in accordance with all our plans crasweller was to be deposited a full year would no doubt suffice for him to arrange his worldly affairs and to see his daughter married but it would not more than suffice he still went about his business with an alacrity marvellous in one who was so soon about to withdraw himself from the world the fleeces for bearing which he was preparing his flocks though they might be shorn by him would never return their prices to his account they would do so for his daughter and his soninlaw but in these circumstances it would have been well for him to have left the flocks to his soninlaw and to have turned his mind to the consideration of other matters there should be a year devoted to that final year to be passed within the college so that by degrees the mind may be weaned from the ignoble art of moneymaking i had once so spoken to him but there he was as intent as ever with his mind fixed on the records of the price of wool as they came back to him from the english and american markets it is all for his daughter i had said to myself had he been blessed with a son it would have been otherwise with him so i got on to my steamtricycle and in a few minutes i was at little christchurch he was coming in after a hard days work among the flocks and seemed to be triumphant and careful at the same time  i tell you what it is neverbend said he we shall have the fluke over here if we dont look after ourselves  have you found symptoms of it  well not exactly among my own sheep but i know the signs of it so well my grasses are peculiarly dry and my flocks are remarkably well looked after but i can see indications of it only fancy where we should all be if fluke showed itself in britannula if it once got ahead we should be no better off than the australians  this might be anxiety for his daughter but it looked strangely like that personal feeling which would have been expected in him twenty years ago crasweller said i do you mind coming into the house and having a little chat and so i got off my tricycle  i was going to be very busy he said showing an unwillingness i have fifty young foals in that meadow there and i like to see that they get their suppers served to them warm  bother the young foals said i as if you had not men enough about the place to see to feeding your stock without troubling yourself i have come out from gladstonopolis because i want to see you and now i am to be sent back in order that you might attend to the administration of hot mashes come into the house then i entered in under the verandah and he followed you certainly have got the bestfurnished house in the empire said i as i threw myself on to a double armchair and lighted my cigar in the inner verandah  yes yes said he it is pretty comfortable  he was evidently melancholy and knew the purpose for which i had come i dont suppose any girl in the old country was ever better provided for than will be eva this i said wishing to comfort him and at the same time to prepare for what was to be said  eva is a good girla dear girl but i am not at all so sure about that young fellow abraham grundle its a pity president your son had not been born a few years sooner at this moment my boy was half a head taller than young grundle and a much better specimen of a britannulist but it is too late now i suppose to talk of that it seems to me that jack never even thinks of looking at eva  this was a view of the case which certainly was strange to me and seemed to indicate that crasweller was gradually becoming fit for the college if he could not see that jack was madly in love with eva he could see nothing at all but i had not come out to little christchurch at the present moment to talk to him about the love matters of the two children i was intent on something of infinitely greater importance crasweller said i you and i have always agreed to the letter on this great matter of the fixed period he looked into my face with supplicating weak eyes but he said nothing your period now will soon have been reached and i think it well that we as dear loving friends should learn to discuss the matter closely as it draws nearer i do not think that it becomes either of us to be afraid of it  thats all very well for you he replied i am your senior  ten years i believe  about nine i think  this might have come from a mistake of his as to my exact age and though i was surprised at the error i did not notice it on this occasion you have no objection to the law as it stands now i said  it might have been seventy  that has all been discussed fully and you have given your assent look round on the men whom you can remember and tell me on how many of them life has not sat as a burden at seventy years of age  men are so different said he as far as one can judge of his own capacities i was never better able to manage my business than i am at present it is more than i can say for that young fellow grundle who is so anxious to step into my shoes  my dear crasweller i rejoined it was out of the question so to arrange the law as to vary the term to suit the peculiarities of one man or another  but in a change of such terrible severity you should have suited the eldest  this was dreadful to methat he the first to receive at the hands of his country the great honour intended for himthat he should have already allowed his mind to have rebelled against it if he who had once been so keen a supporter of the fixed period now turned round and opposed it how could others who should follow be expected to yield themselves up in a fitting frame of mind and then i spoke my thoughts freely to him are you afraid of departure i saidafraid of that which must come afraid to meet as a friend that which you must meet so soon as friend or enemy i paused but he sat looking at me without reply to fear departuremust it not be the greatest evil of all our life if it be necessary can god have brought us into the world intending us so to leave it that the very act of doing so shall be regarded by us as a curse so terrible as to neutralise all the blessings of our existence can it be that he who created us should have intended that we should so regard our dismissal from the world the teachers of religion have endeavoured to reconcile us to it and have in their vain zeal endeavoured to effect it by picturing to our imaginations a hellfire into which ninetynine must fall while one shall be allowed to escape to a heaven which is hardly made more alluring to us is that the way to make a man comfortable at the prospect of leaving this world but it is necessary to our dignity as men that we shall find the mode of doing so to lie quivering and quaking on my bed at the expectation of the black angel of death does not suit my manhoodwhich would fear nothingwhich does not and shall not stand in awe of aught but my own sins how best shall we prepare ourselves for the day which we know cannot be avoided that is the question which i have ever been asking myselfwhich you and i have asked ourselves and which i thought we had answered let us turn the inevitable into that which shall in itself be esteemed a glory to us let us teach the world so to look forward with longing eyes and not with a faint heart i had thought to have touched some few not by the eloquence of my words but by the energy of my thoughts and you oh my friend have ever been he whom it has been my greatest joy to have had with me as the sharer of my aspirations  but i am nine years older than you are  i again passed by the one year added to my age there was nothing now in so trifling an error but you still agree with me as to the fundamental truth of our doctrine  i suppose so said crasweller  i suppose so repeated i is that all that can be said for the philosophy to which we have devoted ourselves and in which nothing false can be found  it wont teach any one to think it better to live than to die while he is fit to perform all the functions of life it might be very well if you could arrange that a man should be deposited as soon as he becomes absolutely infirm  some men are infirm at forty  then deposit them said crasweller  yes but they will not own that they are infirm if a man be weak at that age he thinks that with advancing years he will resume the strength of his youth there must in fact be a fixed period we have discussed that fifty times and have always arrived at the same conclusion  he sat still silent unhappy and confused i saw that there was something on his mind to which he hardly dared to give words wishing to encourage him i went on after all you have a full twelve months yet before the day shall have come  two years he said doggedly  exactly two years before your departure but twelve months before deposition  two years before deposition said crasweller  at this i own i was astonished nothing was better known in the empire than the ages of the two or three first inhabitants to be deposited i would have undertaken to declare that not a man or a woman in britannula was in doubt as to mr craswellers exact age it had been written in the records and upon the stones belonging to the college there was no doubt that within twelve months of the present date he was due to be detained there as the first inhabitant and now i was astounded to hear him claim another year which could not be allowed him  that impudent fellow grundle has been with me he continued and wishes to make me believe that he can get rid of me in one year i have at any rate two years left of my outofdoor existence and i do not mean to give up a day of it for grundle or any one else  it was something to see that he still recognised the law though he was so meanly anxious to evade it there had been some whisperings in the empire among the elderly men and women of a desire to obtain the assistance of great britain in setting it aside peter grundle for instance craswellers senior partner had been heard to say that england would not allow a deposited man to be slaughtered there was much in that which had angered me the word slaughter was in itself peculiarly objectionable to my earsto me who had undertaken to perform the first ceremony as an act of grace and what had england to do with our laws it was as though russia were to turn upon the united states and declare that their congress should be put down what would avail the loudest voice of great britain against the smallest spark of a law passed by our assemblyunless indeed great britain should condescend to avail herself of her great power and thus to crush the free voice of those whom she had already recognised as independent as i now write this is what she has already done and history will have to tell the story but it was especially sad to have to think that there should be a britannulist so base such a coward such a traitor as himself to propose this expedient for adding a few years to his own wretched life  but crasweller did not as it seemed intend to avail himself of these whispers his mind was intent on devising some falsehood by which he should obtain for himself just one other year of life and his expectant soninlaw purposed to prevent him i hardly knew as i turned it all in my mind which of the two was the more sordid but i think that my sympathies were rather in accord with the cowardice of the old man than with the greed of the young after all i had known from the beginning that the fear of death was a human weakness to obliterate that fear from the human heart and to build up a perfect manhood that should be liberated from so vile a thraldom had been one of the chief objects of my scheme i had no right to be angry with crasweller because crasweller when tried proved himself to be no stronger than the world at large it was a matter to me of infinite regret that it should be so he was the very man the very friend on whom i had relied with confidence but his weakness was only a proof that i myself had been mistaken in all that assembly by which the law had been passed consisting chiefly of young men was there one on whom i could rest with confidence to carry out the purpose of the law when his own time should come ought i not so to have arranged matters that i myself should have been the firstto have postponed the use of the college till such time as i might myself have been deposited this had occurred to me often throughout the whole agitation but then it had occurred also that none might perhaps follow me when under such circumstances i should have departed  but in my heart i could forgive crasweller for grundle i felt nothing but personal dislike he was anxious to hurry on the deposition of his fatherinlaw in order that the entire possession of little christchurch might come into his own hands just one year the earlier no doubt he knew the exact age of the man as well as i did but it was not for him to have hastened his deposition and then i could not but think even in this moment of public misery how willing jack would have been to have assisted old crasweller in his little fraud so that eva might have been the reward my belief is that he would have sworn against his own father perjured himself in the very teeth of truth to have obtained from eva that little privilege which i had once seen grundle enjoying  i was sitting there silent in craswellers verandah as all this passed through my mind but before i spoke again i was enabled to see clearly what duty required of me eva and little christchurch with jacks feelings and interests and all my wifes longings must be laid on one side and my whole energy must be devoted to the literal carrying out of the law it was a great worlds movement that had been projected and if it were to fail now just at its commencement when everything had been arranged for the work when again would there be hope it was a matter which required legislative sanction in whatever country might adopt it no despot could attempt it let his power be ever so confirmed the whole country would rise against him when informed in its ignorance of the contemplated intention nor could it be effected by any congress of which the large majority were not at any rate under forty years of age i had seen enough of human nature to understand its weakness in this respect all circumstances had combined to make it practicable in britannula but all these circumstances might never be combined again and it seemed to me to depend now entirely on the power which i might exert in creating courage in the heart of the poor timid creature who sat before me i did know that were britannula to appeal aloud to england england with that desire for interference which has always characterised her would interfere but if the empire allowed the working of the law to be commenced in silence then the fixed period might perhaps be regarded as a thing settled how much then depended on the words which i might use  crasweller i said my friend my brother  i dont know much about that a man ought not to be so anxious to kill his brother  if i could take your place as god will be my judge i would do so with as ready a step as a young man to the arms of his beloved and if for myself why not for my brother  you do not know he said you have not in truth been tried  would that you could try me  and we are not all made of such stuff as you you have talked about this till you have come to be in love with deposition and departure but such is not the natural condition of a man look back upon all the centuries and you will perceive that life has ever been dear to the best of men and you will perceive also that they who have brought themselves to suicide have encountered the contempt of their fellowcreatures  i would not tell him of cato and brutus feeling that i could not stir him to grandeur of heart by roman instances he would have told me that in those days as far as the romans knew         the everlasting had not fixed    his canon gainst selfslaughter   i must reach him by other methods than these if at all who can be more alive than you i said to the fact that man by the fear of death is degraded below the level of the brutes  if so he is degraded said crasweller it is his condition  but need he remain so is it not for you and me to raise him to a higher level  not for menot for me certainly i own that i am no more than man little christchurch is so pleasant to me and evas smiles and happiness and the lowing of my flocks and the bleating of my sheep are so gracious in my ears and it is so sweet to my eyes to see how fairly i have turned this wilderness into a paradise that i own that i would fain stay here a little longer  but the law my friend the lawthe law which you yourself have been so active in creating  the law allows me two years yet said he that look of stubbornness which i had before observed again spreading itself over his face  now this was a lie an absolute undoubted demonstrable lie and yet it was a lie which by its mere telling might be made available for its intended purpose if it were known through the capital that crasweller was anxious to obtain a years grace by means of so foul a lie the years grace would be accorded to him and then the fixed period would be at an end  i will tell you what it is said he anxious to represent his wishes to me in another light grundle wants to get rid of me  grundle i fear has truth on his side said i determined to show him that i at any rate would not consent to lend myself to the furtherance of a falsehood  grundle wants to get rid of me he repeated in the same tone but he shant find that i am so easy to deal with eva already does not above half like him eva thinks that this depositing plan is abominable she says that no good christians ever thought of it  a childa sweet childbut still only a child and brought up by her mother with all the old prejudices  i dont know much about that i never knew a decent woman who wasnt an episcopalian eva is at any rate a good girl to endeavour to save her father and ill tell you whatit is not too late yet as far as my opinion goes jack neverbend is ten to one a better sort of fellow than abraham grundle of course a promise has been made but promises are like piecrusts dont you think that jack neverbend is quite old enough to marry a wife and that he only needs be told to make up his mind to do it little christchurch would do just as well for him as for grundle if he dont think much of the girl he must think something of the sheep  not think much of the girl just at this time jack was talking to his mother morning noon and night about eva and threatening young grundle with all kinds of schoolboy punishments if he should persevere in his suit only yesterday he had insulted abraham grossly and as i had reason to suspect had been more than once out to christchurch on some clandestine object as to which it was necessary he thought to keep old crasweller in the dark and then to be told in this manner that jack didnt think much of eva and should be encouraged in preference to look after the sheep he would have sacrificed every sheep on the place for the sake of half an hour with eva alone in the woods but he was afraid of crasweller whom he knew to have sanctioned an engagement with abraham grundle  i dont think that we need bring jack and his love into this dispute said i  only that it isnt too late you know do you think that jack could be brought to lend an ear to it  perish jack perish eva perish jacks mother before i would allow myself to be bribed in this manner to abandon the great object of all my life this was evidently craswellers purpose he was endeavouring to tempt me with his flocks and herds the temptation had he known it would have been with evawith eva and the genuine downright honest love of my gallant boy i knew too that at home i should not dare to tell my wife that the offer had been made to me and had been refused my wife could not understandcrasweller could not understandhow strong may be the passion founded on the conviction of a life and honesty simple honesty would forbid it for me to strike a bargain with one already destined for depositionthat he should be withdrawn from his glorious his almost immortal state on the payment of a bribe to me and my family i had called this man my friend and brother but how little had the man known me could i have saved all gladstonopolis from imminent flames by yielding an inch in my convictions i would not have done so in my then frame of mind and yet this manmy friend and brotherhad supposed that i could be bought to change my purpose by the pretty slopes and fat flocks of little christchurch  crasweller said i let us keep these two things separate or rather in discussing the momentous question of the fixed period let us forget the loves of a boy and a girl  but the sheep and the oxen and the pastures i can still make my will  the sheep and the oxen and the pastures must also be forgotten they can have nothing to do with the settlement of this matter my boy is dear to me and eva is dear also but not to save even their young lives could i consent to a falsehood in this matter  falsehood there is no falsehood intended  then there need be no bargain as to eva and no need for discussing the flocks and herds on this occasion crasweller you are sixtysix now and will be sixtyseven this time next year then the period of your deposition will have arrived and in the year followingtwo years hence mindthe fixed period of your departure will have come  no  is not such the truth  no you put it all on a year too far i was never more than nine years older than you i remember it all as well as though it were yesterday when we first agreed to come away from new zealand when will you have to be deposited  in 1989 i said carefully my fixed period is 1990  exactly and mine is nine years earlier it always was nine years earlier  it was all manifestly untrue he knew it to be untrue for the sake of one poor year he was imploring my assent to a base falsehood and was endeavouring to add strength to his prayer by a bribe how could i talk to a man who would so far descend from the dignity of manhood the law was there to support me and the definition of the law was in this instance supported by ample evidence i need only go before the executive of which i myself was the chief desire that the established documents should be searched and demand the body of gabriel crasweller to be deposited in accordance with the law as enacted but there was no one else to whom i could leave the performance of this invidious task as a matter of course there were aldermen in gladstonopolis and magistrates in the country whose duty it would no doubt be to see that the law was carried out arrangements to this effect had been studiously made by myself such arrangements would no doubt be carried out when the working of the fixed period had become a thing established but i had long foreseen that the first deposition should be effected with some éclat of voluntary glory it would be very detrimental to the cause to see my special friend crasweller hauled away to the college by constables through the streets of gladstonopolis protesting that he was forced to his doom twelve months before the appointed time crasweller was a popular man in britannula and the people around would not be so conversant with the fact as was i nor would they have the same reasons to be anxious that the law should be accurately followed and yet how much depended upon the accuracy of following the law a willing obedience was especially desired in the first instance and a willing obedience i had expected from my friend crasweller  crasweller i said addressing him with great solemnity it is not so  it isit is i say it is  it is not so the books that have been printed and sworn to which have had your own assent with that of others are all against you  it was a mistake i have got a letter from my old aunt in hampshire written to my mother when i was born which proves the mistake  i remember the letter well i saidfor we had all gone through such documents in performing the important task of settling the period you were born in new south wales and the old lady in england did not write till the following year  who says so how can you prove it she wasnt at all the woman to let a year go by before she congratulated her sister  we have your own signature affirming the date  how was i to know when i was born all that goes for nothing  and unfortunately said i as though clenching the matter the bible exists in which your father entered the date with his usual exemplary accuracy then he was silent for a moment as though having no further evidence to offer crasweller said i are you not man enough to do this thing in a straightforward manly manner  one year he exclaimed i only ask for one year i do think that as the first victim i have a right to expect that one year should be granted me then jack neverbend shall have little christchurch and the sheep and the cattle and eva also as his own for ever and everor at any rate till he too shall be led away to execution  a victim and execution what language in which to speak of the great system for myself i was determined that though i would be gentle with him i would not yield an inch the law at any rate was with me and i did not think as yet that crasweller would lend himself to those who spoke of inviting the interference of england the law was on my side and so must still be all those who in the assembly had voted for the fixed period there had been enthusiasm then and the different clauses had been carried by large majorities a dozen different clauses had been carried each referring to various branches of the question not only had the period been fixed but money had been voted for the college and the mode of life at the college had been settled the very amusements of the old men had been sanctioned and last but not least the very manner of departure had been fixed there was the college now a graceful building surrounded by growing shrubs and broad pleasant walks for the old men endowed with a kitchen in which their taste should be consulted and with a chapel for such of those who would require to pray in public and all this would be made a laughingstock to britannula if this old man crasweller declined to enter the gates it must be done i said in a tone of firm decision  no he exclaimed  crasweller it must be done the law demands it  no no not by me you and young grundle together are in a conspiracy to get rid of me i am not going to be shut up a whole year before my time  with that he stalked into the inner house leaving me alone on the verandah i had nothing for it but to turn on the electric lamp of my tricycle and steam back to government house at gladstonopolis with a sad heart     chapter iv  jack neverbend   six months passed away which i must own to me was a period of great doubt and unhappiness though it was relieved by certain moments of triumph of course as the time drew nearer the question of craswellers deposition became generally discussed by the public of gladstonopolis and so also did the loves of abraham grundle and eva crasweller there were evaites and abrahamites in the community for though the match had not yet been altogether broken it was known that the two young people differed altogether on the question of the old mans deposition it was said by the defendents of grundle who were to be found for the most part among the young men and young women that abraham was simply anxious to carry out the laws of his country it happened that during this period he was elected to a vacant seat in the assembly so that when the matter came on for discussion there he was able to explain publicly his motives and it must be owned that he did so with good words and with a certain amount of youthful eloquence as for eva she was simply intent on preserving the lees of her fathers life and had been heard to express an opinion that the college was all humbug and that people ought to be allowed to live as long as it pleased god to let them of course she had with her the elderly ladies of the community and among them my own wife as the foremost mrs neverbend had never made herself prominent before in any public question but on this she seemed to entertain a very warm opinion whether this arose entirely from her desire to promote jacks welfare or from a reflection that her own period of deposition was gradually becoming nearer i never could quite make up my mind she had at any rate ten years to run and i never heard from her any expressed fear ofdeparture she wasand isa brave good woman attached to her household duties anxious for her husbands comfort but beyond measure solicitous for all good things to befall that scapegrace jack neverbend for whom she thinks that nothing is sufficiently rich or sufficiently grand jack is a handsome boy i grant but that is about all that can be said of him and in this matter he has been diametrically opposed to his father from first to last  it will be seen that in such circumstances none of these moments of triumph to which i have alluded can have come to me within my own home there mrs neverbend and jack and after a while eva sat together in perpetual council against me when these meetings first began eva still acknowledged herself to be the promised bride of abraham grundle there were her own vows and her parents assent and something perhaps of remaining love but presently she whispered to my wife that she could not but feel horror for the man who was anxious to murder her father and byandby she began to own that she thought jack a fine fellow we had a wonderful cricket club in gladstonopolis and britannula had challenged the english cricketers to come and play on the little christchurch ground which they declared to be the only cricket ground as yet prepared on the face of the earth which had all the accomplishments possible for the due prosecution of the game now jack though very young was captain of the club and devoted much more of his time to that occupation than to his more legitimate business as a merchant eva who had not hitherto paid much attention to cricket became on a sudden passionately devoted to it whereas abraham grundle with a steadiness beyond his years gave himself up more than ever to the business of the assembly and expressed some contempt for the game though he was no mean player  it had become necessary during this period to bring forward in the assembly the whole question of the fixed period as it was felt that in the present state of public opinion it would not be expedient to carry out the established law without the increased sanction which would be given to it by a further vote in the house public opinion would have forbidden us to deposit crasweller without some such further authority therefore it was deemed necessary that a question should be asked in which craswellers name was not mentioned but which might lead to some general debate young grundle demanded one morning whether it was the intention of the government to see that the different clauses as to the new law respecting depositions were at once carried out the house is aware i believe he said that the first operation will soon be needed i may as well state here that this was repeated to eva and that she pretended to take huff at such a question from her lover it was most indecent she said and she after such words must drop him for ever it was not for some months after that that she allowed jacks name to be mentioned with her own but i was aware that it was partly settled between her and jack and mrs neverbend grundle declared his intention of proceeding against old crasweller in reference to the breach of contract according to the laws of britannula but that jacks party disregarded altogether in telling this however i am advancing a little beyond the point in my story to which i have as yet carried my reader  then there arose a debate upon the whole principle of the measure which was carried on with great warmth i as president of course took no part in it but in accordance with our constitution i heard it all from the chair which i usually occupied at the speakers right hand the arguments on which the greatest stress was laid tended to show that the fixed period had been carried chiefly with a view to relieving the miseries of the old and it was conclusively shown that in a very great majority of cases life beyond sixtyeight was all vanity and vexation of spirit that other argument as to the costliness of old men to the state was for the present dropped had you listened to young grundle insisting with all the vehemence of youth on the absolute wretchedness to which the aged had been condemned by the absence of any such lawhad you heard the miseries of rheumatism gout stone and general debility pictured in the eloquent words of fiveandtwentyyou would have felt that all who could lend themselves to perpetuate such a state of things must be guilty of fiendish cruelty he really rose to a great height of parliamentary excellence and altogether carried with him the younger and luckily the greater part of the house there was really nothing to be said on the other side except a repetition of the prejudices of the old world but alas so strong are the weaknesses of the world that prejudice can always vanquish truth by the mere strength of its battalions not till it had been proved and reproved ten times over was it understood that the sun could not have stood still upon gideon crasweller who was a member and who took his seat during these debates without venturing to speak merely whispered to his neighbour that the heartless greedy fellow was unwilling to wait for the wools of little christchurch  three divisions were made on the debate and thrice did the fixedperiodists beat the old party by a majority of fifteen in a house consisting of eightyfive members so strong was the feeling in the empire that only two members were absent and the number remained the same during the whole week of the debate this i did think was a triumph and i felt that the old country which had really nothing on earth to do with the matter could not interfere with an opinion expressed so strongly my heart throbbed with pleasureable emotion as i heard that old age which i was myself approaching depicted in terms which made its impotence truly conspicuoustill i felt that had it been proposed to deposit all of us who had reached the age of fiftyeight i really think that i should joyfully have given my assent to such a measure and have walked off at once and deposited myself in the college  but it was only at such moments that i was allowed to experience this feeling of triumph i was encountered not only in my own house but in society generally and on the very streets of gladstonopolis by the expression of an opinion that crasweller would not be made to retire to the college at his fixed period what on earth is there to hinder it i said once to my old friend ruggles ruggles was now somewhat over sixty and was an agent in the town for country woolgrowers he took no part in politics and though he had never agreed to the principle of the fixed period had not interested himself in opposition to it he was a man whom i regarded as indifferent to length of life but one who would upon the whole rather face such lot as nature might intend for him than seek to improve it by any new reform  eva crasweller will hinder it said ruggles  eva is a mere child do you suppose that her opinion will be allowed to interrupt the laws of the whole community and oppose the progress of civilisation  her feelings will said ruggles whos to stand a daughter interceding for the life of her father  one man cannot but eightyfive can do so  the eightyfive will be to the community just what the one would be to the eightyfive i am not saying anything about your law i am not expressing an opinion whether it would be good or bad i should like to live out my own time though i acknowledge that you assembly men have on your shoulders the responsibility of deciding whether i shall do so or not you could lead me away and deposit me without any trouble because i am not popular but the people are beginning to talk about eva crasweller and abraham grundle and i tell you that all the volunteers you have in britannula will not suffice to take the old man to the college and to keep him there till you have polished him off he would be deposited again at little christchurch in triumph and the college would be left a wreck behind him  this view of the case was peculiarly distressing to me as the chief magistrate of the community nothing is so abhorrent to me as rebellion of a populace that are not lawabiding nothing but evil can be predicted whereas a people who will obey the laws cannot but be prosperous it grieved me greatly to be told that the inhabitants of gladstonopolis would rise in tumult and destroy the college merely to favour the views of a pretty girl was there any honour or worse again could there be any utility in being the president of a republic in which such things could happen i left my friend ruggles in the street and passed on to the executive hall in a very painful frame of mind  when there tidings reached me of a much sadder nature at the very moment at which i had been talking with ruggles in the street on the subject a meeting had been held in the marketplace with the express purpose of putting down the fixed period and who had been the chief orator on the occasion but jack neverbend my own son had taken upon himself this new work of public speechifying in direct opposition to his own father and i had reason to believe that he was instigated to do so by my own wife your son sir has been addressing the multitude about the fixed period and they say that it has been quite beautiful to hear him it was thus that the matter was told me by one of the clerks in my office and i own that i did receive some slight pleasure at finding that jack could do something beyond cricket but it became immediately necessary to take steps to stop the evil and i was the more bound to do so because the only delinquent named to me was my own son  if it be so i said aloud in the office jack neverbend shall sleep this night in prison but it did not occur to me at the moment that it would be necessary i should have formal evidence that jack was conspiring against the laws before i could send him to jail i had no more power over him in that respect than on any one else had i declared that he should be sent to bed without his supper i should have expressed myself better both as a father and a magistrate  i went home and on entering the house the first person that i saw was eva now as this matter went on i became full of wrath with my son and with my wife and with poor old crasweller but i never could bring myself to be angry with eva there was a coaxing sweet feminine way with her which overcame all opposition and i had already begun to regard her as my daughterinlaw and to love her dearly in that position although there were moments in which jacks impudence and new spirit of opposition almost tempted me to disinherit him  eva i said what is this that i hear of a public meeting in the streets  oh mr neverbend she said taking me by the arm there are only a few boys who are talking about papa through all the noises and tumults of these times there was an evident determination to speak of jack as a boy everything that he did and all that he said were merely the efflux of his high spirits as a schoolboy eva always spoke of him as a kind of younger brother and yet i soon found that the one opponent whom i had most to fear in britannula was my own son  but why i asked should these foolish boys discuss the serious question respecting your dear father in the public street  they dont want to have himdeposited she said almost sobbing as she spoke  but my dear i began determined to teach her the whole theory of the fixed period with all its advantages from first to last  but she interrupted me at once oh mr neverbend i know what a good thing it isto talk about i have no doubt the world will be a great deal the better for it and if all the papas had been deposited for the last five hundred years i dont suppose that i should care so much about it but to be the first that ever it happened to in all the world why should papa be the first you ought to begin with some weak crotchety poor old cripple who would be a great deal better out of the way but papa is in excellent health and has all his wits about him a great deal better than mr grundle he manages everything at little christchurch and manages it very well  but my dear i was going to explain to her that in a question of such enormous public interest as this of the fixed period it was impossible to consider the merits of individual cases but she interrupted me again before i could get out a word  oh mr neverbend theyll never be able to do it and im afraid that then youll be vexed  my dear if the law be  oh yes the law is a very beautiful thing but whats the good of laws if they cannot be carried out theres jack thereof course he is only a boy but he swears that all the executive and all the assembly and all the volunteers in britannula shant lead my papa into that beastly college  beastly my dear you cannot have seen the college it is perfectly beautiful  thats only what jack says its jack that calls it beastly of course hes not much of a man as yet but he is your own son and i do think that for an earnest spirit about a thing jack is a very fine fellow  abraham grundle you know is just as warm on the other side  i hate abraham grundle i dont want ever to hear his name again i understand very well what it is that abraham grundle is after he never cared a straw for me nor i much for him if you come to that  but you are contracted  if you think that i am going to marry a man because our names have been written down in a book together you are very much mistaken he is a nasty mean fellow and i will never speak to him again as long as i live he would deposit papa this very moment if he had the power whereas jack is determined to stand up for him as long as he has got a tongue to shout or hands to fight these were terrible words but i had heard the same sentiment myself from jacks own lips of course jack is nothing to me she continued with that half sob which had become habitual to her whenever she was forced to speak of her fathers deposition he is only a boy but we all know that he could thrash abraham grundle at once and to my thinking he is much more fit to be a member of the assembly  as she would not hear a word that i said to her and was only intent on expressing the warmth of her own feelings i allowed her to go her way and retired to the privacy of my own library there i endeavoured to console myself as best i might by thinking of the brilliant nature of jacks prospects he himself was over head and ears in love with eva and it was clear to me that eva was nearly as fond of him and then the sly rogue had found the certain way to obtain old craswellers consent grundle had thought that if he could once see his fatherinlaw deposited he would have nothing to do but to walk into little christchurch as master that was the accusation generally made against him in gladstonopolis but jack who did not as far as i could see care a straw for humanity in the matter had vehemently taken the side of the antifixedperiodists as the safest way to get the fathers consent there was a contract of marriage no doubt and grundle would be entitled to take a quarter of the fathers possessions if he could prove that the contract had been broken such was the law of britannula on the subject but not a shilling had as yet been claimed by any man under that law and crasweller no doubt concluded that grundle would be unwilling to bear the odium of being the first and there were clauses in the law which would make it very difficult for him to prove the validity of the contract it had been already asserted by many that a girl could not be expected to marry the man who had endeavoured to destroy her father and although in my mind there could be no doubt that abraham grundle had only done his duty as a senator there was no knowing what view of the case a jury might take in gladstonopolis and then if the worst came to the worst crasweller would resign a fourth of his property almost without a pang and jack would content himself in making the meanness of grundle conspicuous to his fellowcitizens  and now i must confess that as i sat alone in my library i did hesitate for an hour as to my future conduct might it not be better for me to abandon altogether the fixed period and all its glories even in britannula the world might be too strong for me should i not take the good things that were offered and allow jack to marry his wife and be happy in his own way in my very heart i loved him quite as well as did his mother and thought that he was the finest young fellow that britannula had produced and if this kind of thing went on it might be that i should be driven to quarrel with him altogether and to have him punished under the law like some old roman of old and i must confess that my relations with mrs neverbend made me very unfit to ape the roman paterfamilias she never interfered with public business but she had a way of talking about household matters in which she was always victorious looking back as i did at this moment on the past it seemed to me that she and jack who were the two persons i loved best in the world had been the enemies who had always successfully conspired against me do have done with your fixed period and nonsense she had said to me only yesterday its all very well for the assembly but when you come to killing poor mr crasweller in real life it is quite out of the question and then when i began to explain to her at length the immense importance of the subject she only remarked that that would do very well for the assembly should i abandon it all take the good things with which god had provided me and retire into private life i had two sides to my character and could see myself sitting in luxurious comfort amidst the furniture of craswellers verandah while eva and her children were around and jack was standing with a cigar in his mouth outside laying down the law for the cricketers at gladstonopolis were not better done as others use i said to myself over and over again as i sat there wearied with this contest and thinking of the much more frightful agony i should be called upon to endure when the time had actually come for the departure of old crasweller  and then again if i should fail for half an hour or so i did fear that i should fail i had been always a most popular magistrate but now it seemed had come the time in which all my popularity must be abandoned jack who was quick enough at understanding the aspect of things had already begun to ask the people whether they would see their old friend crasweller murdered in cold blood it was a dreadful word but i was assured that he had used it how would it be when the time even for depositing had come and an attempt was made to lead the old man up through the streets of gladstonopolis should i have strength of character to perform the task in opposition to the loudly expressed wishes of the inhabitants and to march him along protected by a strong body of volunteers and how would it be if the volunteers themselves refused to act on the side of law and order should i not absolutely fail and would it not afterwards be told of me that as president i had broken down in an attempt to carry out the project with which my name had been so long associated  as i sat there alone i had almost determined to yield but suddenly there came upon me a memory of socrates of galileo of hampden and of washington what great things had these men done by constancy in opposition to the wills and prejudices of the outside world how triumphant they now appeared to have been in fighting against the enormous odds which power had brought against them and how pleasant now were the very sounds of their names to all who loved their fellowcreatures in some moments of private thought anxious as were now my own they too must have doubted they must have asked themselves the question whether they were strong enough to carry their great reforms against the world but in these very moments the necessary strength had been given to them it must have been that when almost despairing they had been comforted by an inner truth and had been all but inspired to trust with confidence in their cause they too had been weak and had trembled and had almost feared but they had found in their own hearts that on which they could rely had they been less sorely pressed than was i now at this present moment had not they believed and trusted and been confident as i thought of it i became aware that it was not only necessary for a man to imagine new truths but to be able to endure and to suffer and to bring them to maturity and how often before a truth was brought to maturity must it be necessary that he who had imagined it and seen it and planned it must give his very life for it and all in vain but not perhaps all in vain as far as the world was concerned but only in vain in regard to the feelings and knowledge of the man himself in struggling for the welfare of his fellowcreatures a man must dare to endure to be obliteratedmust be content to go down unheard ofor worse still ridiculed and perhaps abused by allin order that something afterwards may remain of those changes which he has been enabled to see but not to carry out how many things are requisite to true greatness but first of all is required that selfnegation which is able to plan new blessings although certain that those blessings will be accounted as curses by the world at large  then i got up and as i walked about the room i declared to myself aloud my purpose though i might perish in the attempt i would certainly endeavour to carry out the doctrine of the fixed period though the people might be against me and regard me as their enemythat people for whose welfare i had done it allstill i would persevere even though i might be destined to fall in the attempt though the wife of my bosom and the son of my loins should turn against me and embitter my last moments by their enmity still would i persevere when they came to speak of the vices and the virtues of president neverbendto tell of his weakness and his strengthit should never be said of him that he had been deterred by fear of the people from carrying out the great measure which he had projected solely for their benefit  comforted by this resolve i went into mrs neverbends parlour where i found her son jack sitting with her they had evidently been talking about jacks speech in the marketplace and i could see that the young orators brow was still flushed with the triumph of the moment father said he immediately you will never be able to deposit old crasweller people wont let you do it  the people of britannula i said will never interfere to prevent their magistrate from acting in accordance with the law  bother said mrs neverbend when my wife said bother it was i was aware of no use to argue with her indeed mrs neverbend is a lady upon whom argument is for the most part thrown away she forms her opinion from the things around her and is in regard to domestic life and to her neighbours and to the conduct of people with whom she lives almost invariably right she has a quick insight and an affectionate heart which together keep her from going astray she knows how to do good and when to do it but to abstract argument and to political truth she is wilfully blind i felt it to be necessary that i should select this opportunity for making jack understand that i would not fear his opposition but i own that i could have wished that mrs neverbend had not been present on the occasion  wont they said jack thats just what i fancy they will do  do you mean to say that it is what you wish them to dothat you think it right that they should do it  i dont think crasweller ought to be deposited if you mean that father  not though the law requires it this i said in a tone of authority have you formed any idea in your own mind of the subjection to the law which is demanded from all good citizens have you ever bethought yourself that the law should be in all things  oh mr president pray do not make a speech here said my wife i shall never understand it and i do not think that jack is much wiser than i am  i do not know what you mean by a speech sarah my wifes name is sarah but it is necessary that jack should be instructed that he at any rate must obey the law he is my son and as such it is essentially necessary that he should be amenable to it the law demands  you cant do it and theres an end of it said mrs neverbend you and all your laws will never be able to put an end to poor mr craswellerand it would be a great shame if you did you dont see it but the feeling here in the city is becoming very strong the people wont have it and i must say that it is only rational that jack should be on the same side he is a man now and has a right to his own opinion as well as another  jack said i with much solemnity do you value your fathers blessing  well sir yes said he a blessing i suppose means something of an allowance paid quarterly  i turned away my face that he might not see the smile which i felt was involuntarily creeping across it sir said i a fathers blessing has much more than a pecuniary value it includes that kind of relation between a parent and his son without which life would be a burden to me and i should think very grievous to you also  of course i hope that you and i may always be on good terms  i was obliged to take this admission for what it was worth if you wish to remain on good terms with me said i you must not oppose me in public when i am acting as a public magistrate  is he to see mr crasweller murdered before his very eyes and to say nothing about it said mrs neverbend  of all terms in the language there was none so offensive to me as that odious word when used in reference to the ceremony which i had intended to be so gracious and alluring sarah said i turning upon her in my anger that is a very improper word and one which you should not tempt the boy to use especially in my presence  english is english mr president she said she always called me mr president when she intended to oppose me  you might as well say that a man was murdered when he isiskilled in battle i had been about to say executed but i stopped myself men are not executed in britannula  no he is fighting his countrys battle and dies gloriously  he has his leg shot off or his arm and is too frequently left to perish miserably on the ground here every comfort will be provided for him so that he may depart from this world without a pang when in the course of years he shall have lived beyond the period at which he can work and be useful  but look at mr crasweller father who is more useful than he is  nothing had been more unlucky to me as the promoter of the fixed period than the peculiar healthiness and general sanity of him who was by chance to be our first martyr it might have been possible to make jack understand that a rule which had been found to be applicable to the world at large was not fitted for some peculiar individual but it was quite impossible to bring this home to the mind of mrs neverbend i must i felt choose some other opportunity for expounding that side of the argument i would at the present moment take a leaf out of my wifes book and go straight to my purpose i tell you what it is young man said i i do not intend to be thwarted by you in carrying on the great reform to which i have devoted my life if you cannot hold your tongue at the present moment and abstain from making public addresses in the marketplace you shall go out of britannula it is well that you should travel and see something of the world before you commence the trade of public orator now i think of it the alpine club from sydney are to be in new zealand this summer and it will suit you very well to go and climb up mount earnshawe and see all the beauties of nature instead of talking nonsense here in gladstonopolis  oh father i should like nothing better cried jack enthusiastically  nonsense said mrs neverbend are you going to send the poor boy to break his neck among the glaciers dont you remember that dick ardwinkle was lost there a year or two ago and came to his death in a most frightful manner  that was before i was born said jack or at any rate very shortly afterwards and they hadnt then invented the new patent steel climbing arms since they came up no one has ever been lost among the glaciers  you had better prepare then to go said i thinking that the idea of getting rid of jack in this manner was very happy  but father said he of course i cant stir a step till after the great cricketmatch  you must give up cricket for this time so good an opportunity for visiting the new zealand mountains may never come again  give up the match he exclaimed why the english sixteen are coming here on purpose to play us and swear that theyll beat us by means of the new catapult but i know that our steambowler will beat their catapult hollow at any rate i cannot stir from here till after the match is over ive got to arrange everything myself besides they do count something on my springbatting i should be regarded as absolutely a traitor to my country if i were to leave britannula while this is going on the young marquis of marylebone their leader is to stay at our house and the vessel bringing them will be due here about eleven oclock next wednesday  eleven oclock next wednesday said i in surprise i had not as yet heard of this match nor of the coming of our aristocratic visitor  they wont be above thirty minutes late at the outside they left the lands end three weeks ago last tuesday at two and london at halfpast ten we have had three or four water telegrams from them since they started and they hadnt then lost ten minutes on the journey of course i must be at home to receive the marquis of marylebone  all this set me thinking about many things it was true that at such a moment i could not use my parental authority to send jack out of the island to such an extent had the childish amusements of youth been carried as to give to them all the importance of politics and social science what i had heard about this cricketmatch had gone in at one ear and come out at the other but now that it was brought home to me i was aware that all my authority would not serve to banish jack till it was over not only would he not obey me but he would be supported in his disobedience by even the elders of the community but perhaps the worst feature of it all was the arrival just now at gladstonopolis of a crowd of educated englishmen when i say educated i mean prejudiced they would be englishmen with no ideas beyond those current in the last century and would be altogether deaf to the wisdom of the fixed period i saw at a glance that i must wait till they should have taken their departure and postpone all further discussion on the subject as far as might be possible till gladstonopolis should have been left to her natural quiescence after the disturbance of the cricket very well said i leaving the room then it may come to pass that you will never be able to visit the wonderful glories of mount earnshawe  plenty of time for that said jack as i shut the door     chapter v  the cricketmatch   i had been of late so absorbed in the affairs of the fixed period that i had altogether forgotten the cricketmatch and the noble strangers who were about to come to our shores of course i had heard of it before and had been informed that lord marylebone was to be our guest i had probably also been told that sir lords longstop and sir kennington oval were to be entertained at little christchurch but when i was reminded of this by jack a few days later it had quite gone out of my head but i now at once began to recognise the importance of the occasion and to see that for the next two months crasweller the college and the fixed period must be banished if not from my thoughts at any rate from my tongue better could not be done in the matter than to have them banished from the tongue of all the world as i certainly should not be anxious to have the subject ventilated within hearing and speaking of the crowd of thoroughly oldfashioned prejudiced aristocratic young englishmen who were coming to us the cricketmatch sprang to the front so suddenly that jack seemed to have forgotten all his energy respecting the college and to have transferred his entire attention to the various weapons offensive and defensive wherewith the london club was if possible to be beaten we are never short of money in britannula but it seemed as i watched the various preparations made for carrying on two or three days play at little christchurch that england must be sending out another army to take another sebastopol more paraphernalia were required to enable these thirtytwo lads to play their game with propriety than would have been needed for the depositing of half gladstonopolis every man from england had his attendant to look after his bats and balls and shoes and greaves and it was necessary of course that our boys should be equally well served each of them had two bicycles for his own use and as they were all constructed with the new doubleacting levers they passed backwards and forwards along the bicycle track between the city and craswellers house with astonishing rapidity i used to hear that the six miles had been done in fifteen minutes then there came a struggle with the english and the britannulists as to which would get the nearest to fourteen minutes till it seemed that bicycleracing and not cricket had been the purpose for which the english had sent out the 4000ton steamyacht at the expense of all the cricketers of the nation it was on this occasion that the track was first divided for comers and goers and that volunteers were set to prevent stragglers from crossing except by the regular bridges i found that i the president of the republic was actually forbidden to go down in my tricycle to my old friends house unless i would do so before noon youd be run over and made mincemeat of said jack speaking of such a catastrophe with less horror than i thought it ought to have engendered in his youthful mind poor sir lords was run down by our jackcollided as jack called it he hadnt quite impetus enough on to make the turning sharp as he ought said jack without the slightest apparent regret at what had occurred another inch and a half would have saved him if he can touch a ball from our steambowler when i send it i shall think more of his arms than i do of his legs and more of his eyes than i do of his lungs what a fellow to send out why hes thirty and has been eating soup they tell me all through the journey these young men had brought a doctor with them dr macnuffery to prescribe to them what to eat and drink at each meal and the unfortunate baronet whom jack had nearly slaughtered had encountered the illwill of the entire club because he had called for muttonbroth when he was seasick  they were to be a month in britannula before they would begin the match so necessary was it that each man should be in the best possible physical condition they had brought their dr macnuffery and our lads immediately found the need of having a doctor of their own there was i think a little pretence in this as though dr bobbs had been a longestablished officer of the southern cross cricket club they had not in truth thought of it and bobbs was only appointed the night after macnufferys position and duties had been made known bobbs was a young man just getting into practice in gladstonopolis and understood measles i fancy better than the training of athletes macnuffery was the most disagreeable man of the english party and soon began to turn up his nose at bobbs but bobbs i think got the better of him do you allow coffee to your clubcoffee asked macnuffery in a voice mingling ridicule and reproof with a touch of satire as he had begun to guess that bobbs had not been long attending to his present work youll find said bobbs that young men in our air do not need the restraints which are necessary to you english their fathers and mothers were not soft and flabby before them as was the case with yours i think lord marylebone looked across the table i am told at sir kennington oval and nothing afterwards was said about diet  but a great trouble arose which however rather assisted jack in his own prospects in the longrunthough for a time it seemed to have another effect sir kennington oval was much struck by evas beauty and living as he did in craswellers house soon had an opportunity of so telling her abraham grundle was one of the cricketers and as such was frequently on the ground at little christchurch but he did not at present go into craswellers house and the whole fashionable community of gladstonopolis was beginning to entertain the opinion that that match was off grundle had been heard to declare most authoritatively that when the day came crasweller should be deposited and had given it as his opinion that the power did not exist which could withstand the law of britannula whether in this he preferred the law to eva or acted in anger against crasweller for interfering with his prospects or had an idea that it would not be worth his while to marry the girl while the girls father should be left alive or had gradually fallen into this bitterness of spirit from the opposition shown to him i could not quite tell and he was quite as hostile to jack as to crasweller but he seemed to entertain no aversion at all to sir kennington oval nor i was informed did eva i had known that for the last month jacks mother had been instant with him to induce him to speak out to eva but he who hardly allowed me his father to open my mouth without contradicting me and who in our house ordered everything about just as though he were the master was so bashful in the girls presence that he had never as yet asked her to be his wife now sir kennington had come in his way and he by no means carried his modesty so far as to abstain from quarrelling with him sir kennington was a goodlooking young aristocrat with plenty of words but nothing special to say for himself he was conspicuous for his cricketing finery and when got up to take his place at the wicket looked like a diver with his divingarmour all on but jack said that he was very little good at the game indeed for mere cricket jack swore that the english would be nowhere but for eight professional players whom they had brought out with them it must be explained that our club had no professionals we had not come to that yetthat a man should earn his bread by playing cricket lord marylebone and his friend had brought with them eight professional slaves as our young men came to call themmost ungraciously but each slave required as much looking after as did the masters and they thought a great deal more of themselves than did the nonprofessionals  jack had in truth been attempting to pass sir kennington on the bicycle track when he had upset poor sir lords longstop and according to his own showing he had more than once allowed sir kennington to start in advance and had run into little christchurch bicycle quay before him this had not given rise to the best feeling and i feared lest there might be an absolute quarrel before the match should have been played ill punch that fellows head some of these days jack said one evening when he came back from little christchurch  whats the matter now i asked  impudent puppy he thinks because he has got an unmeaning handle to his name that everybody is to come to his whistle they tell me that his father was made what they call a baronet because he set a broken arm for one of those twenty royal dukes that england has to pay for  who has had to come to his whistle now asked his mother  he went over with his steam curricle and sent to ask eva whether she would not take a drive with him on the cliffs  she neednt have gone unless she wished it i said  but she did go and there she was with him for a couple of hours hes the most unmeaning upstart of a puppy i ever met he has not three ideas in the world i shall tell eva what i think about him  the quarrel went on during the whole period of preparation till it seemed as though gladstonopolis had nothing else to talk about evas name was in every ones mouth till my wife was nearly beside herself with anger a girl said she shouldnt get herself talked about in that way by every one all round i dont suppose the man intends to marry her  i cant see why he shouldnt i replied  shes nothing more to him than a pretty provincial lass what would she be in london  why should not mr craswellers daughter be as much admired in london as here i answered beauty is the same all the world over and her money will be thought of quite as much there as here  but she will have such a spot upon her  spot what spot  as the daughter of the first deposited of the fixed period peopleif ever that comes off or if it dont shell be talked about as her who was to be i dont suppose any englishman will think of marrying her  this made me very angry what i said do you a britannulist and my wife intend to turn the special glory of britannula to the disgrace of her people that which we should be ready to claim as the highest honouras being an advance in progress and general civilisation never hitherto even thought of among other peopleto have conceived that and to have prepared it in every detail for perfect consummationthat is to be accounted as an opprobrium to our children by you the lady president of the republic have you no love of country no patriotism no feeling at any rate of what has been done for the worlds welfare by your own family i own i did feel vexed when she spoke of eva as having been as it were contaminated by being a britannulist because of the law enacting the fixed period  shed better face it out at home than go across the world to hear what other people say of us it may be all very well as far as state wisdom goes but the world isnt ripe for it and we shall only be laughed at  there was truth in this and a certain amount of concession had also been made i can fancy that an easygoing butterfly should laugh at the painful industry of the ant and i should think much of the butterfly who should own that he was only a butterfly because it was the age of butterflies the few wise said i have ever been the laughingstock of silly crowds  but eva isnt one of the wise she replied and would be laughed at without having any of your philosophy to support her however i dont suppose the man is thinking of it  but the young man was thinking of it and had so far made up his mind before he went as to ask eva to marry him out of hand and return with him to england we heard of it when the time came and heard also that eva had declared that she could not make up her mind so quickly that was what was said when the time drew near for the departure of the yacht but we did not hear it direct from eva nor yet from crasweller all these tidings came to us from jack and jack was in this instance somewhat led astray  time passed on and the practice on the little christchurch ground was continued several accidents happened but the cricketers took very little account of these jack had his cheek cut open by a ball running off his bat on to his face and eva who saw the accident was carried fainting into the house sir kennington behaved admirably and himself brought him home in his curricle we were told afterwards that this was done at evas directions because old crasweller would have been uncomfortable with the boy in his house seeing that he could not in his present circumstances receive me or my wife mrs neverbend swore a solemn oath that jack should be made to abandon his cricket but jack was playing again the next day with his face strapped up athwart and across with republican blacksilk adhesive when i saw bobbs at work over him i thought that one side of his face was gone and that his eye would be dreadfully out of place all his chance of marrying eva is gone said i to my wife the nasty little selfish slut said mrs neverbend but at two the next day jack had been patched up and nothing could keep him from little christchurch bobbs was with him the whole morning and assured his mother that if he could go out and take exercise his eye would be all right his mother offered to take a walk with him in the city park but bobbs declared that violent exercise would be necessary to keep the eye in its right place and jack was at little christchurch manipulating his steambowler in the afternoon afterwards littlebat one of the english professionals had his leg broken and was necessarily laid on one side and young grundle was hurt on the lower part of the back and never showed himself again on the scene of danger my life is too precious in the assembly just at present he said to me excusing himself he alluded to the fixed period debate which he knew would be renewed as soon as the cricketers were gone i no doubt depended very much on abraham grundle and assented the match was afterwards carried on with fifteen on each side for though each party had spare players they could not agree as to the use of them our next man was better than theirs they said and they were anxious that we should take our second best to which our men would not agree therefore the game was ultimately played with thirty combatants  so one of our lot is to come back for a wife almost immediately said lord marylebone at our table the day before the match was to be played  oh indeed my lord said mrs neverbend i am glad to find that a britannulan young lady has been so effective who is the gentleman it was easy to see by my wifes face and to know by her tone of voice that she was much disturbed by the news  sir kennington said lord marylebone i supposed you had all heard of it of course we had all heard of it but lord marylebone did not know what had been mrs neverbends wishes for her own son  we did know that sir kennington had been very attentive but there is no knowing what that means from you foreign gentlemen its a pity that poor eva who is a good girl in her way should have her head turned this came from my wife  its ovals head that is turned continued his lordship i never saw a man so bowled over in my life hes awfully in love with her  what will his friends say at home asked mrs neverbend  we understand that miss crasweller is to have a large fortune eight or ten thousand ayear at the least i should imagine that she will be received with open arms by all the ovals and as for a foreignerwe dont call you foreigners  why not said i rather anxious to prove that we were foreigners what makes a foreigner but a different allegiance do we not call the americans foreigners great britain and france had been for years engaged in the great maritime contest with the united fleets of russia and america and had only just made that glorious peace by which as politicians said all the world was to be governed for the future and after that it need not be doubted but that the americans were foreign to the englishand if the americans why not the britannulists we had separated ourselves from great britain without coming to blows indeed but still our own flag the southern cross flew as proudly to our gentle breezes as ever had done the unionjack amidst the inclemency of a british winter it was the flag of britannula with which great britain had no concern at the present moment i was specially anxious to hear a distinguished englishman like lord marylebone acknowledge that we were foreigners if we be not foreigners what are we my lord  englishmen of course said he what else dont you talk english  so do the americans my lord said i with a smile that was intended to be gracious our language is spreading itself over the world and is no sign of nationality  what laws do you obey  englishtill we choose to repeal them you are aware that we have already freed ourselves from the stain of capital punishment  those coins pass in your marketplaces then he brought out a gold piece from his waistcoatpocket and slapped it down on the table it was one of those pounds which the people will continue to call sovereigns although the name has been made actually illegal for the rendering of all accounts whose is this image and superscription he asked and yet this was paid to me today at one of your banks and the lady cashier asked me whether i would take sovereigns how will you get over that mr president  a small peoplenumerically smallcannot of course do everything at once we have been a little slack perhaps in instituting a national mint in fact there was a difficulty about the utensil by which we would have clapped a southern cross over the british arms and put the portrait of the britannulan president of the daymine for instancein the place where the face of the british monarch has hitherto held its own i have never pushed the question much lest i should seem as have done some presidents over anxious to exhibit myself i have ever thought more of the glory of our race than of putting forward my own individual selfas may be seen by the whole history of the college i will not attempt to get over it i said but according to my ideas a nation does not depend on the small external accidents of its coin or its language  but on the flag which it flies after all a bit of bunting is easy  nor on its flag lord marylebone but on the hearts of its people we separated from the old mother country with no quarrel with no illwill but with the mutual friendly wishes of both if there be a trace of the feeling of antagonism in the word foreigners i will not use it but british subjects we are not and never can be again this i said because i felt that there was creeping up as it were in the very atmosphere a feeling that england should be again asked to annex us so as to save our old people from the wise decision to which our own assembly had come oh for an adamantine law to protect the human race from the imbecility the weakness the discontent and the extravagance of old age lord marylebone who saw that i was in earnest and who was the most courteous of gentlemen changed the conversation i had already observed that he never spoke about the fixed period in our house though in the condition in which the community then was he must have heard it discussed elsewhere  the day for the match had come jacks face was so nearly healed that mrs neverbend had been brought to believe entirely in the efficacy of violent exercise for cuts and bruises grundles back was still bad and the poor fellow with the broken leg could only be wheeled out in front of the verandah to look at the proceedings through one of those wonderful little glasses which enable the critic to see every motion of the players at halfamiles distance he assured me that the precision with which jack set his steambowler was equal to that of one of those shoeburyness gunners who can hit a sparrow as far as they can see him on condition only that they know the precise age of the bird i gave jack great credit in my own mind because i felt that at the moment he was much down at heart on the preceding day sir kennington had been driving eva about in his curricle and jack had returned home tearing his hair they do it on purpose to put him off his play said his mother but if so they hadnt known jack nor indeed had i quite known him up to this time  i was bound myself to see the game because a special tent and a special glass had been prepared for the president crasweller walked by as i took my place but he only shook his head sadly and was silent it now wanted but four months to his deposition though there was a strong party in his favour i do not know that he meddled much with it i did hear from different sources that he still continued to assert that he was only nine years my senior by which he intended to gain the favour of a postponement of his term by twelve poor months but i do not think that he ever lent himself to the other party under my auspices he had always voted for the fixed period and he could hardly oppose it now in theory they tossed for the first innings and the english club won it it was all england against britannula think of the population of the two countries we had however been taught to believe that no community ever played cricket as did the britannulans the english went in first with the two baronets at the wickets they looked like two stout minervas with huge wicker helmets i know a picture of the goddess all helmet spear and petticoats carrying her spear over her shoulder as she flies through the air over the cities of the earth sir kennington did not fly but in other respects he was very like the goddess so completely enveloped was he in his indiarubber guards and so wonderful was the machine upon his head by which his brain and features were to be protected  as he took his place upon the ground there was great cheering then the steambowler was ridden into its place by the attendant engineer and jack began his work i could see the colour come and go in his face as he carefully placed the ball and peeped down to get its bearing it seemed to me as though he were taking infinite care to level it straight and even at sir kenningtons head i was told afterwards that he never looked at sir kennington but that having calculated his distance by means of a quicksilver levellingglass his object was to throw the ball on a certain inch of turf from which it might shoot into the wicket at such a degree as to make it very difficult for sir kennington to know what to do with it it seemed to me to take a long time during which the fourteen men around all looked as though each man were intending to hop off to some other spot than that on which he was standing there used i am told to be only eleven of these men but now in a great match the longoffs and the longons and the rest of them are all doubled the double longoff was at such a distance that he being a small man i could only just see him through the fieldglass which i kept in my waistcoatpocket when i had been looking hard at them for what seemed to be a quarter of an hour and the men were apparently becoming tired of their continual hop and when jack had stooped and kneeled and sprawled with one eye shut in every conceivable attitude on a sudden there came a sharp snap a little smoke and lo sir kennington oval wasout  there was no doubt about it i myself saw the two bails fly away into infinite space and at once there was a sound of kettledrums trumpets fifes and clarionets it seemed as though all the loud music of the town band had struck up at the moment with their shrillest notes and a huge gun was let off      and let the kettle to the trumpet speak     the trumpet to the cannoneer without     the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth     now drinks the king to hamlet   i could not but fancy at these great signs of success that i was hamlets father  sir kennington oval was outout at the very first ball there could be no doubt about it and jacks triumph was complete it was melancholy to see the english minerva as he again shouldered his spear and walked back to his tent in spite of jacks good play and the success on the part of my own countrymen i could not but be sorry to think that the young baronet had come half round the world to be put out at the first ball there was a cruelty in itan inhospitalitywhich in spite of the exigencies of the game went against the grain then when the shouting and the holloaing and the flinging up of the ball were still going on i remembered that after it he would have his consolation with eva and poor jack when his short triumph was over would have to reflect that though fortunate in his cricket he was unhappy in his love as this occurred to me i looked back towards the house and there from a little lattice window at the end of the verandah i saw a ladys handkerchief waving could it be that eva was waving it so as to comfort her vanquished british lover in the meantime minerva went to his tent and hid himself among sympathetic friends and i was told afterwards that he was allowed half a pint of bitter beer by dr macnuffery  after twenty minutes spent in what seemed to me the very ostentation of success another man was got to the wickets this was stumps one of the professionals who was not quite so much like a minerva though he too was prodigiously greaved jack again set his ball snap went the machine and stumps wriggled his bat he touched the ball and away it flew behind the wicket five republican minervas ran after it as fast as their legs could carry them and i was told by a gentleman who sat next to me scoring that a dozen runs had been made he spent a great deal of time in explaining how in the old times more than six at a time were never scored now all this was altered a slight tip counted ever so much more than a good forward blow because the ball went behind the wicket up flew on all sides of the ground figures to show that stumps had made a dozen and two british clarionets were blown with a great deal of vigour stumps was a thickset solid solemnlooking man who had been ridiculed by our side as being much too old for the game but he seemed to think very little of jacks precise machine he kept chopping at the ball which always went behind till he had made a great score it was two hours before jack had sorely lamed him in the hip and the umpire had given it legbeforewicket indeed it was legbeforewicket as the poor man felt when he was assisted back to his tent however he had scored 150 sir lords longstop too had run up a good score before he was caught out by the middle longoffa marvellous catch they all said it wasand our trumpets were blown for fully five minutes but the big gun was only fired when a ball was hurled from the machine directly into the wicket  at the end of three days the britishers were all out and the runs were numbered in four figures i had my doubts as i looked at the contest whether any of them would be left to play out the match i was informed that i was expected to take the presidents seat every day but when i heard that there were to be two innings for each set i positively declined but crasweller took my place and i was told that a gleam of joy shot across his worn sorrowful face when sir kennington began the second innings with ten runs could he really wish in his condition to send his daughter away to england simply that she might be a baronets wife  when the britannulists went in for the second time they had 1500 runs to get and it was said afterwards that grundle had bet four to one against his own side this was thought to be very shabby on his part though if such was the betting i dont see why he should lose his money by backing his friends jack declared in my hearing that he would not put a shilling on he did not wish either to lose his money or to bet against himself but he was considerably disheartened when he told me that he was not going in on the first day of their second innings he had not done much when the britannulists were in beforehad only made some thirty or forty runs and worse than that sir kennington oval had scored up to 300 they told me that his pallas helmet was shaken with tremendous energy as he made his running and again that man stumps had seemed to be invincible though still lame and had carried out his bat with a tremendous score he trudged away without any sign of triumph but jack said that the professional was the best man they had  on the second day of our partys second inningsthe last day but one of the matchjack went in they had only made 150 runs on the previous day and three wickets were down our kettledrums had had but little opportunity for making themselves heard jack was very despondent and had had some tiff with eva he had asked eva whether she were not going to england and eva had said that perhaps she might do so if some britannulists did not do their duty jack had chosen to take this as a bit of genuine impertinence and had been very sore about it stumps was bowling from the british catapult and very nearly gave jack his quietus during the first over he hit wildly and four balls passed him without touching his wicket then came his turn again and he caught the first ball with his neverbend springbatfor he had invented it himselfsuch a swipe as he called it that nobody has ever yet been able to find the ball the story goes that it went right up to the verandah and that eva picked it up and has treasured it ever since  be that as it may during the whole of that day and the next nobody was able to get him out there was a continual banging of the kettledrum which seemed to give him renewed spirits every ball as it came to him was sent away into infinite space all the englishmen were made to retire to further distances from the wickets and to stand about almost at the extremity of the ground the management of the catapults was intrusted to one man after anotherbut in vain then they sent the catapults away and tried the oldfashioned slow bowling it was all the same to jack he would not be tempted out of his ground but stood there awaiting the ball let it come ever so slowly through the first of the two days he stood before his wicket hitting to the right and the left till hope seemed to spring up again in the bosom of the britannulists and i could see that the englishmen were becoming nervous and uneasy although the odds were still much in their favour  at the end of the first day jack had scored above 500but eleven wickets had gone down and only three of the most inferior players were left to stand up with him it was considered that jack must still make another 500 before the game would be won this would allow only twenty each to the other three players but said eva to me that evening theyll never get the twenty each  and on which side are you eva i inquired with a smile for in truth i did believe at that moment that she was engaged to the baronet  how dare you ask mr neverbend she demanded with indignation am not i a britannulist as well as you and as she walked away i could see that there was a tear in her eye  on the last day feelings were carried to a pitch which was more befitting the last battle of a great warsome waterloo of other agesthan the finishing of a prolonged game of cricket men looked and moved and talked as though their all were at stake i cannot say that the englishmen seemed to hate us or we them but that the affair was too serious to admit of playful words between the parties and those unfortunates who had to stand up with jack were so afraid of themselves that they were like young country orators about to make their first speeches jack was silent determined and yet inwardly proud of himself feeling that the whole future success of the republic was on his shoulders he ordered himself to be called at a certain hour and the assistants in our household listened to his words as though feeling that everything depended on their obedience he would not go out on his bicycle as fearing that some accident might occur although ought i not to wish that i might be struck dead he said as then all the world would know that though beaten it had been by the hand of god and not by our default it astonished me to find that the boy was quite as eager about his cricket as i was about my fixed period  at eleven oclock i was in my seat and on looking round i could see that all the rank and fashion of britannula were at the ground but all the rank and fashion were there for nothing unless they had come armed with glasses the spaces required by the cricketers were so enormous that otherwise they could not see anything of the play under my canopy there was room for five of which i was supposed to be able to fill the middle thrones on the two others sat those who officially scored the game one seat had been demanded for mrs neverbend i will see his fatewhether it be his glory or his fallsaid his mother with true roman feeling for the other eva had asked and of course it had been awarded to her when the play began sir kennington was at the catapult and jack at the opposite wicket and i could hardly say for which she felt the extreme interest which she certainly did exhibit i as the day went on found myself worked up to such excitement that i could hardly keep my hat on my head or behave myself with becoming presidential dignity at one period as i shall have to tell i altogether disgraced myself  there seemed to be an opinion that jack would either show himself at once unequal to the occasion and immediately be put outwhich opinion i think that all gladstonopolis was inclined to holdor else that he would get his eye in as he called it and go on as long as the three others could keep their bats i know that his own opinion was the same as that general in the city and i feared that his very caution at the outset would be detrimental to him the great object on our side was that jack should as nearly as possible be always opposite to the bowler he was to take the four first balls making but one run off the last and then beginning another over at the opposite end do the same thing again it was impossible to manage this exactly but something might be done towards effecting it there were the three men with whom to work during the day the first unfortunately was soon made to retire but jack who had walked up to my chair during the time allowed for fetching down the next man told me that he had got his eye and i could see a settled look of fixed purpose in his face he bowed most gracefully to eva who was so stirred by emotion that she could not allow herself to speak a word oh jack i pray for you i pray for you said his mother jack i fancy thought more of evas silence than of his mothers prayer  jack went back to his place and hit the first ball with such energy that he drove it into the other stumps and smashed them to pieces everybody declared that such a thing had never been before achieved at cricketand the ball passed on and eight or ten runs were scored after that jack seemed to be mad with cricketing power he took off his greaves declaring that they impeded his running and threw away altogether his helmet oh eva is he not handsome said his mother in ecstasy hanging across my chair eva sat quiet without a sign it did not become me to say a word but i did think that he was very handsomeand i thought also how uncommonly hard it would be to hold him if he should chance to win the game let him make what orations he might against the fixed period all gladstonopolis would follow him if he won this game of cricket for them  i cannot pretend to describe all the scenes of that day nor the growing anxiety of the englishmen as jack went on with one hundred after another he had already scored nearly 1000 when young grabbe was caught out young grabbe was very popular because he was so altogether unlike his partner grundle he was a fine frank fellow and was jacks great friend i dont mean to say that he can really play cricket jack had said that morning speaking with great authority but he is the best fellow in the world and will do exactly what you ask him but he was out now and jack with over 200 still to make declared that he gave up the battle almost as lost  dont say that mr neverbend whispered eva  ah yes were gone coons even your sympathy cannot bring us round now if anything could do it that would  in my opinion continued eva britannula will never be beaten as long as mr neverbend is at the wicket  sir kennington has been too much for us i fear said jack with a forced smile as he retired  there was now but the one hope left mr brittlereed remained but he was all mr brittlereed was a gentleman who had advanced nearer to his fixed period than any other of the cricketers he was nearly thirtyfive years of age and was regarded by them all as quite an old man he was supposed to know all the rules of the game and to be rather quick in keeping the wicket but jack had declared that morning that he could not hit a ball in a week of sundays he oughtnt to be here jack had whispered but you know how those things are managed i did not know how those things were managed but i was sorry that he should be there as jack did not seem to want him  mr brittlereed now went to his wicket and was bound to receive the first ball this he did made one run whereas he might have made two and then had to begin the war over it certainly seemed as though he had done it on purpose jack in his passion broke the handle of his springbat and then had halfadozen brought to him in order that he might choose another it was his favourite bat said his mother and buried her face in her handkerchief  i never understood how it was that mr brittlereed lived through that over but he did live although he never once touched the ball then it came to be jacks turn and he at once scored thirtynine during the over leaving himself at the proper wicket for recommencing the operation i think that this gave him new life it added at any rate new fire to every britannulist on the ground and i must say that after that mr brittlereed managed the matter altogether to jacks satisfaction over after over jack went on and received every ball that was bowled they tried their catapult with single double and even treble action sir kennington did his best flinging the ball with his most tremendous impetus and then just rolling it up with what seemed to me the most provoking languor it was all the same to jack he had in truth got his eye in and as surely as the ball came to him it was sent away to some most distant part of the ground the britishers were mad with dismay as jack worked his way on through the last hundred it was piteous to see the exertions which poor mr brittlereed made in running backwards and forwards across the ground they tried i think to bustle him by the rapid succession of their bowling but the only result was that the ball was sent still further off when it reached jacks wicket at last just as every clock upon the ground struck six with that wonderful unanimity which our clocks have attained since they were all regulated by wires from greenwich jack sent a ball flying up into the air perfectly regardless whether it might be caught or not knowing well that the one now needed would be scored before it could come down from the heavens into the hands of any englishman it did come down and was caught by stumps but by that time britannula had won her victory jacks total score during that innings was 1275 i doubt whether in the annals of cricket any record is made of a better innings than that then it was that with an absence of that presence of mind which the president of a republic should always remember i took off my hat and flung it into the air  jacks triumph would have been complete only that it was ludicrous to those who could not but think as i did of the very little matter as to which the contest had been raisedjust a game of cricket which two sets of boys had been playing and which should have been regarded as no more than an amusementas a pastime by which to refresh themselves between their work but they regarded it as though a great national combat had been fought and the britannulists looked upon themselves as though they had been victorious against england it was absurd to see jack as he was carried back to gladstonopolis as the hero of the occasion and to hear him as he made his speeches at the dinner which was given on the day and at which he was called upon to take the chair i was glad to see however that he was not quite so glib with his tongue as he had been when addressing the people he hesitated a good deal nay almost broke down when he gave the health of sir kennington oval and the british sixteen and i was quite pleased to hear lord marylebone declare to his mother that he was a wonderfully nice boy i think the english did try to turn it off a little as though they had only come out there just for the amusement of the voyage but grundle who had now become quite proud of his country and who lamented loudly that he should have received so severe an injury in preparing for the game would not let this pass my lord he said what is your population lord marylebone named sixty million we are but two hundred and fifty thousand said grundle and see what we have done we are cocks fighting on our own dunghill said jack and that does make a deal of difference  but i was told that jack had spoken a word to eva in quite a different spirit before he had left little christchurch after all eva sir kennington has not quite trampled us under his feet he said  who thought that he would said eva my heart has never fainted whatever some others may have done     chapter vi  the college   i was surprised to see that jack who was so bold in playing his match and who had been so well able to hold his own against the englishmenwho had been made a hero and had carried off his heroism so wellshould have been so shamefaced and bashful in regard to eva he was like a silly boy hardly daring to look her in the face instead of the gallant captain of the band who had triumphed over all obstacles but i perceived though it seemed that he did not that she was quite prepared to give herself to him and that there was no real obstacle between him and all the flocks and herds of little christchurch not much had been seen or heard of grundle during the match and as far as eva was concerned he had succumbed as soon as sir kennington oval had appeared upon the scene he had thought so much of the english baronet as to have been cowed and quenched by his grandeur and sir kennington himself had i think been in earnest before the days of the cricketmatch but i could see now that eva had merely played him off against jack thinking thereby to induce the younger swain to speak his mind this had made jack more than ever intent on beating sir kennington but had not as yet had the effect which eva had intended it will all come right i said to myself as soon as these englishmen have left the island but then my mind reverted to the fixed period and to the fastapproaching time for craswellers deposition we were now nearly through march and the thirtieth of june was the day on which he ought to be led to the college it was my first anxiety to get rid of these englishmen before the subject should be again ventilated i own i was anxious that they should not return to their country with their prejudices strengthened by what they might hear at gladstonopolis if i could only get them to go before the matter was again debated it might be that no strong public feeling would be excited in england till it was too late that was my first desire but then i was also anxious to get rid of jack for a short time the more i thought of eva and the flocks the more determined was i not to allow the personal interests of my boyand therefore my ownto clash in any way with the performance of my public duties  i heard that the englishmen were not to go till another week had elapsed a week was necessary to recruit their strength and to enable them to pack up their bats and bicycles neither however were packed up till the day before they started for the track down to little christchurch was crowded with them and they were still practising as though another match were contemplated i was very glad to have lord marylebone as an inmate in our house but i acknowledge that i was anxious for him to say something as to his departure we have been very proud to have you here my lord i remarked  i cannot say that we are very proud he replied because we have been so awfully licked barring that i never spent a pleasanter two months in my life and should not be at all unwilling to stay for another your mode of life here seems to me to be quite delightful and we have been thinking so much of our cricket that i have hardly as yet had a moment to look at your institutions what is all this about the fixed period jack who was present put on a serious face and assumed that air of determination which i was beginning to fear mrs neverbend pursed up her lips and said nothing but i knew what was passing through her mind i managed to turn the conversation but i was aware that i did it very lamely  jack i said to my son i got a postcard from new zealand yesterday the boats had just begun to run between the two islands six days aweek and as their regular contract pace was twentyfive miles an hour it was just an easy days journey  what said the postcard  theres plenty of time for mount earnshawe yet they all say the autumn is the best the snow is now disappearing in great quantities  but an old bird is not to be caught with chaff jack was determined not to go to the eastern alps this year and indeed as i found not to go till this question of the fixed period should be settled i told him that he was a fool although he would have been wrong to assist in depositing his fatherinlaw for the sake of getting the herd and flocks himself as grundle would have done nevertheless he was hardly bound by any feelings of honour or conscience to keep old crasweller at little christchurch in direct opposition to the laws of the land but all this i could not explain to him and was obliged simply to take it as a fact that he would not join an alpine party for mount earnshawe this year as i thought of all this i almost feared jacks presence in gladstonopolis more than that of the young englishmen  it was clear however that nothing could be done till the englishmen were gone and as i had a day at my disposal i determined to walk up to the college and meditate there on the conduct which it would be my duty to follow during the next two months the college was about five miles from the town at the side opposite to you as you enter the town from little christchurch and i had some time since made up my mind how in the bright genial days of our pleasant winter i would myself accompany mr crasweller through the city in an open barouche as i took him to be deposited through admiring crowds of his fellowcitizens i had not then thought that he would be a recreant or that he would be deterred by the fear of departure from enjoying the honours which would be paid to him but how different now was his frame of mind from that glorious condition to which i had looked forward in my sanguine hopes had it been i i myself how proud should i have been of my country and its wisdom had i been led along as a first hero to anticipate the euthanasia prepared for me as it was i hired an inside cab and hiding myself in the corner was carried away to the college unseen by any  the place was called necropolis the name had always been distasteful to me as i had never wished to join with it the feeling of death various names had been proposed for the site young grundle had suggested cremation hall because such was the ultimate end to which the mere husks and hulls of the citizens were destined but there was something undignified in the soundas though we were talking of a dancing saloon or a music halland i would have none of it my idea was to give to the mind some notion of an approach to good things to come and i proposed to call the place aditus but men said that it was unmeaning and declared that britannulists should never be ashamed to own the truth necropolis sounded well they said and argued that though no actual remains of the body might be left there still the tablets would remain therefore necropolis it was called i had hoped that a smiling hamlet might grow up at the gate inhabited by those who would administer to the wants of the deposited but i had forgot that the deposited must come first the hamlet had not yet built itself and round the handsome gates there was nothing at present but a desert while land in britannula was plenty no one had cared to select ground so near to those awful furnaces by which the mortal clay should be transported into the air from the gates up to the temple which stood in the middle of the groundsthat temple in which the last scene of life was to be encounteredthere ran a broad gravel path which was intended to become a beautiful avenue it was at present planted alternately with eucalypti and ilexesthe gumtrees for the present generation and the greenoaks for those to come but even the gumtrees had not as yet done much to give a furnished appearance to the place some had demanded that cedars and yewtrees should be placed there and i had been at great pains to explain to them that our object should be to make the spot cheerful rather than sad round the temple at the back of it were the sets of chambers in which were to live the deposited during their year of probation some of these were very handsome and were made so no doubt with a view of alluring the first comers in preparing wisdom for babes it is necessary to wrap up its precepts in candied sweets but though handsome they were at present anything but pleasant abodes not one of them had as yet been inhabited as i looked at them knowing crasweller as well as i did i almost ceased to wonder at his timidity a hero was wanted but crasweller was no hero then further off but still in the circle round the temple there were smaller abodes less luxurious but still comfortable all of which would in a few short years be inhabitedif the fixed period could be carried out in accordance with my project and foundations had been made for others still smallerfor a whole township of old men and women as in the course of the next thirty years they might come hurrying on to find their last abode in the college i had already selected one not by any means the finest or the largest for myself and my wife in which we might prepare ourselves for the grand departure but as for mrs neverbend nothing would bring her to set foot within the precincts of the college ground before those next ten years are gone she would say commonsense will have interfered to let folks live out their lives properly it had been quite useless for me to attempt to make her understand how unfitting was such a speech for the wife of the president of the republic my wifes opposition had been an annoyance to me from the first but i had consoled myself by thinking how impossible it always is to imbue a womans mind with a logical idea and though in all respects of domestic life mrs neverbend is the best of women even among women she is the most illogical  i now inspected the buildings in a sad frame of mind asking myself whether it would ever come to pass that they should be inhabited for their intended purpose when the assembly in compliance with my advice had first enacted the law of the fixed period a large sum had been voted for these buildings as the enthusiasm had worn off men had asked themselves whether the money had not been wasted and had said that for so small a community the college had been planned on an absurdly grand scale still i had gone on and had watched them as they grew from day to day and had allowed no shilling to be spared in perfecting them in my earlier years i had been very successful in the wool trade and had amassed what men called a large fortune during the last two or three years i had devoted a great portion of this to the external adornment of the college not without many words on the matter from mrs neverbend jack is to be ruined she had said in order that all the old men and women may be killed artistically this and other remarks of the kind i was doomed to bear it was a part of the difficulty which as a great reformer i must endure but now as i walked mournfully among the disconsolate and halffinished buildings i could not but ask myself as to the purpose to which my money had been devoted and i could not but tell myself that if in coming years these tenements should be left tenantless my country would look back upon me as one who had wasted the produce of her young energies but again i bethought me of columbus and galileo and swore that i would go on or perish in the attempt  as these painful thoughts were agitating my mind a slow decrepit old gentleman came up to me and greeted me as mr president he linked his arm familiarly through mine and remarked that the time seemed to be very long before the college received any of its inhabitants this was mr graybody the curator who had been specially appointed to occupy a certain residence to look after the grounds and to keep the books of the establishment graybody and i had come as young men to britannula together and whereas i had succeeded in all my own individual attempts he had unfortunately failed he was exactly of my age as was also his wife but under the stress of misfortune they had both become unnaturally old and had at last been left ruined and hopeless without a shilling on which to depend i had always been a sincere friend to graybody though he was indeed a man very difficult to befriend on most subjects he thought as i did if he can be said to have thought at all at any rate he had agreed with me as to the fixed period saying how good it would be if he could be deposited at fiftyeight and had always declared how blessed must be the time when it should have come for himself and his old wife i do not think that he ever looked much to the principle which i had in view he had no great ideas as to the imbecility and weakness of human life when protracted beyond its fitting limits he only felt that it would be good to give up and that if he did so others might be made to do so too as soon as a residence at the college was completed i asked him to fill it and now he had been living there he and his wife together with an attendant and drawing his salary as curator for the last three years i thought that it would be the very place for him he was usually melancholy disheartened and impoverished but he was always glad to see me and i was accustomed to go frequently to the college in order to find a sympathetic soul with whom to converse about the future of the establishment well graybody i said i suppose we are nearly ready for the first comer  oh yes were always ready but then the first comer is not i had not said much to him during the latter months as to crasweller in particular his name used formerly to be very ready in all my conversations with graybody but of late i had talked to him in a more general tone you cant tell me yet when its to be mr president we do find it a little dull here  now he knew as well as i did the day and the year of craswellers birth i had intended to speak to him about crasweller but i wished our friends name to come first from him i suppose it will be some time about midwinter i said  oh i didnt know whether it might not have been postponed  how can it be postponed as years creep on you cannot postpone their step if there might be postponement such as that i doubt whether we should ever find the time for our inhabitants to come no graybody there can be no postponement for the fixed period  it might have been made sixtynine or seventy said he  originally no doubt but the wisdom of the assembly has settled all that the assembly has declared that they in britannula who are left alive at sixtyseven shall on that day be brought into the college you yourself have i think ten years to run and you will not be much longer left to pass them in solitude  it is weary being here all alone i must confess mrs g says that she could not bear it for another twelve months the girl we have has given us notice and she is the ninth within a year no followers will come after them here because they say theyll smell the dead bodies  rubbish i exclaimed angrily positive rubbish the actual clay will evaporate into the air without leaving a trace either for the eye to see or the nose to smell  they all say that when you tried the furnaces there was a savour of burnt pork now great trouble was taken in that matter of cremation and having obtained from europe and the states all the best machinery for the purpose i had supplied four immense hogs in order that the system might be fairly tested and i had fattened them for the purpose as old men are not unusually very stout these we consumed in the furnaces all at the same time and the four bodies had been dissolved into their original atoms without leaving a trace behind them by which their former condition of life might be recognised but a trapdoor in certain of the chimneys had been left open by accidenteither that or by an enemy on purposeand undoubtedly some slight flavour of the pig had been allowed to escape i had been there on the spot knowing that i could trust only my own senses and was able to declare that the scent which had escaped was very slight and by no means disagreeable and i was able to show that the trapdoor had been left open either by chance or by designthe very trapdoor which was intended to prevent any such escape during the moments of full cremationso that there need be no fear of a repetition of the accident i ought indeed to have supplied four other hogs and to have tried the experiment again but the theme was disagreeable and i thought that the trial had been so far successful as to make it unnecessary that the expense should be again incurred they say that men and women would not have quite the same smell said he  how do they know that i exclaimed in my anger how do they know what men and women will smell like they havent tried there wont be any smell at allnot the least and the smoke will all consume itself so that even you living just where you are will not know when cremation is going on we might consume all gladstonopolis as i hope we shall some day and not a living soul would know anything about it but the prejudices of the citizens are ever the stumblingblocks of civilisation  at any rate mrs g tells me that jemima is going because none of the young men will come up and see her  this was another difficulty but a small one and i made up my mind that it should be overcome the shrubs seem to grow very well i said resolved to appear as cheerful as possible  theyre pretty nearly all alive said graybody and they do give the place just an appearance like the cemetery at old christchurch he meant the capital in the province of canterbury  in the course of a few years you will be quitecheerful here  i dont know much about that mr president im not sure that for myself i want to be cheerful anywhere if ive only got somebody just to speak to sometimes that will be quite enough for me i suppose old crasweller will be the first  i suppose so  it will be a gruesome time when i have to go to bed early so as not to see the smoke come out of his chimney  i tell you there will be nothing of the kind i dont suppose you will even know when theyre going to cremate him  he will be the first mr president and no doubt he will be looked closely after old barnes will be here by that time wont he sir  barnes is the second and he will come just three months before craswellers departure but tallowax the grocer in high street will be up here by that time and then they will come so quickly that we must soon see to get other lodgings finished exors the lawyer will be the fourth but he will not come in till a day or two after craswellers departure  they all will come wont they sir asked graybody  will come why they must it is the law  tallowax swears hell have himself strapped to his own kitchen table and defend himself to the last gasp with a carvingknife exors says that the law is bad and you cant touch him as for barnes he has gone out of what little wits he ever had with the fright of it and people seem to think that you couldnt touch a lunatic  barnes is no more a lunatic than i am  i only tell you what folk tell me i suppose youll try it on by force if necessary you never expected that people would come and deposit themselves of their own accord  the national assembly expects that the citizens of britannula will obey the law  but there was one question i was going to ask mr president of course i am altogether on your side and do not wish to raise difficulties but what shall i do suppose they take to running away after they have been deposited if old crasweller goes off in his steamcarriage how am i to go after him and whom am i to ask to help to bring him back again  i was puzzled but i did not care to show it no doubt a hundred little arrangements would be necessary before the affairs of the institution could be got into a groove so as to run steadily but our first object must be to deposit crasweller and barnes and tallowax so that the citizens should be accustomed to the fashion of depositing the aged there were as i knew two or three old women living in various parts of the island who would in due course come in towards the end of craswellers year but it had been rumoured that they had already begun to invent falsehoods as to their age and i was aware that we might be led astray by them this i had been prepared to accept as being unavoidable but now as the time grew nearer i could not but see how difficult it would be to enforce the law against wellknown men and how easy to allow the women to escape by the help of falsehood exors the lawyer would say at once that we did not even attempt to carry out the law and barnes lunatic as he pretended to be would be very hard to manage my mind misgave me as i thought of all these obstructions and i felt that i could so willingly deposit myself at once and then depart without waiting for my year of probation but it was necessary that i should show a determined front to old graybody and make him feel that i at any rate was determined to remain firm to my purpose mr crasweller will give you no such trouble as you suggest said i  perhaps he has come round  he is a gentleman whom we have both known intimately for many years and he has always been a friend to the fixed period i believe that he is so still although there is some little hitch as to the exact time at which he should be deposited  just twelve months he says  of course i replied the difference would be sure to be that of one year he seems to think that there are only nine years between him and me  ten mr president ten i know the time well  i had always thought so but i should be willing to abandon a year if i could make things run smooth by doing so but all that is a detail with which up here we need not perhaps concern ourselves  only the time is getting very short mr president and my old woman will break down altogether if shes told that shes to live another year all alone crasweller wont be a bit readier next year than he is this and of course if he is let off you must let off barnes and tallowax and there are a lot of old women about who are beginning to tell terrible lies about their ages do think of it all mr president  i never thought of anything else so full was my mind of the subject when i woke in the morning before i could face the light of day it was necessary that i should fortify myself with columbus and galileo i began to fancy as the danger became nearer and still nearer that neither of those great men had been surrounded by obstructions such as encompassed me to plough on across the waves and either to be drowned or succeed to tell a new truth about the heavens and either to perish or become great for evereither was within the compass of a man who had only his own life to risk my lifehow willingly could i run any risk did but the question arise of risking it how often i felt in these days that there is a fortitude needed by man much greater than that of jeopardising his life life what is it here was that poor crasweller belying himself and all his convictions just to gain one year more of it and then when the year was gone he would still have his deposition before him is it not so with us all for me i feelhave felt for yearstempted to rush on and pass through the gates of death that man should shudder at the thought of it does not appear amiss to me the unknown future is always awful and the unknown future of another world to be approached by so great a change of circumstancesby the loss of our very flesh and blood and body itselfhas in it something so fearful to the imagination that the man who thinks of it cannot but be struck with horror as he acknowledges that by himself too it has to be encountered but it has to be encountered and though the change be awful it should not therefore by the sane judgment be taken as a change necessarily for the worst knowing the great goodness of the almighty should we not be prepared to accept it as a change probably for the better as an alteration of our circumstances by which our condition may be immeasurably improved then one is driven back to consider the circumstances by which such change may be effected to me it seems rational to suppose that as we leave this body so shall we enter that new phase of life in which we are destined to livebut with all our higher resolves somewhat sharpened and with our lower passions alas made stronger also that theory by which a human being shall jump at once to a perfection of bliss or fall to an eternity of evil and misery has never found credence with me for myself i have to say that while acknowledging my many drawbacks i have so lived as to endeavour to do good to others rather than evil and that therefore i look to my departure from this world with awe indeed but still with satisfaction but i cannot look with satisfaction to a condition of life in which from my own imbecility i must necessarily retrograde into selfishness it may be that he who judges of us with a wisdom which i cannot approach shall take all this into account and that he shall so mould my future being as to fit it to the best at which i had arrived in this world still i cannot but fear that a taint of that selfishness which i have hitherto avoided but which will come if i allow myself to become old may remain and that it will be better for me that i should go hence while as yet my own poor wants are not altogether uppermost in my mind but then in arranging this matter i am arranging it for my fellowcitizens and not for myself i have to endeavour to think how craswellers mind may be affected rather than my own he dreads his departure with a trembling currish fear and i should hardly be doing good to him were i to force him to depart in a frame of mind so poor and piteous but then again neither is it altogether of crasweller that i must thinknot of crasweller or of myself how will the coming ages of men be affected by such a change as i propose should such a change become the normal condition of death can it not be brought about that men should arrange for their own departure so as to fall into no senile weakness no slippered selfishness no ugly whinings of undefined want before they shall go hence and be no more thought of these are the ideas that have actuated me and to them i have been brought by seeing the conduct of those around me not for crasweller or barnes or tallowax will this thing be goodnor for those old women who are already lying about their ages in their cottagesnor for myself who am i know too apt to boast of myself that even though old age should come upon me i may be able to avoid the worst of its effects but for those untold generations to come whose lives may be modelled for them under the knowledge that at a certain fixed period they shall depart hence with all circumstances of honour and glory  i was however quite aware that it would be useless to spend my energy in dilating on this to mr graybody he simply was willing to shuffle off his mortal coil because he found it uncomfortable in the wearing in all likelihood had his time come as nigh as that of crasweller he too like crasweller would impotently implore the grace of another year he would ape madness like barnes or arm himself with a carvingknife like tallowax or swear that there was a flaw in the law as exors was disposed to do he too would clamorously swear that he was much younger as did the old women was not the world peopled by craswellers tallowaxes exorses and old women had i a right to hope to alter the feelings which nature herself had implanted in the minds of men but still it might be done by practiceby practice if only we could arrive at the time in which practice should have become practice then as i was about to depart from the door of graybodys house i whispered to myself again the names of galileo and columbus  you think that he will come on the thirtieth said graybody as he took my hand at parting  i think replied i that you and i as loyal citizens of the republic are bound to suppose that he will do his duty as a citizen then i went leaving him standing in doubt at his door   end of the first volume                                      volume ii  chapter vii  columbus and galileo   i had left graybody with a lie on my tongue i said that i was bound to suppose that crasweller would do his duty as a citizenby which i had meant graybody to understand that i expected my old friend to submit to deposition now i expected nothing of the kind and it grieved me to think that i should be driven to such false excuses i began to doubt whether my mind would hold its proper bent under the strain thus laid upon it and to ask myself whether i was in all respects sane in entertaining the ideas which filled my mind galileo and columbusgalileo and columbus i endeavoured to comfort myself with these namesbut in a vain delusive manner and though i used them constantly i was beginning absolutely to hate them why could i not return to my woolshed and be contented among my bales and my ships and my credits as i was of yore before this theory took total possession of me i was doing good then i robbed no one i assisted very many in their walks of life i was happy in the praises of all my fellowcitizens my health was good and i had ample scope for my energies then even as now but there came on me a day of successa day shall i say of glory or of wretchedness or shall i not most truly say of bothand i persuaded my fellowcitizens to undertake this sad work of the fixed period from that moment all quiet had left me and all happiness still it is not necessary that a man should be happy i doubt whether cæsar was happy with all those enemies around himgauls and britons and romans if a man be doing his duty let him not think too much of that condition of mind which he calls happiness let him despise happiness and do his duty and he will in one sense be happy but if there creep upon him a doubt as to his duty if he once begin to feel that he may perhaps be wrong then farewell all peace of mindthen will come that condition in which a man is tempted to ask himself whether he be in truth of sane mind  what should i do next the cricketing englishmen i knew were going two or three days more would see their gallant ship steam out of the harbour as i returned in my cab to the city i could see the english colours fluttering from her topmast and the flag of the english cricketclub waving from her stern but i knew well that they had discussed the question of the fixed period among them and that there was still time for them to go home and send back some english mandate which ought to be inoperative but which we should be unable to disobey and letters might have been written before thistreacherous letters calling for the assistance of another country in opposition to the councils of their own  but what should i do next i could not enforce the law vi et armis against crasweller i had sadly but surely acknowledged so much as that to myself but i thought that i had seen signs of relenting about the mansome symptoms of sadness which seemed to bespeak a yielding spirit he only asked for a year he was still in theory a supporter of the fixed periodpleading his own little cause however by a direct falsehood could i not talk him into a generous assent there would still be a year for him and in old days there had been a spice of manliness in his bosom to which it might be possible that i should bring him back though the hope was poor it seemed at present to be my only hope  as i returned i came round by the quays dropping my cab at the corner of the street there was the crowd of englishmen all going off to the vessel to see their bats and bicycles disposed of and among them was jack the hero they were standing at the watersedge while three longboats were being prepared to take them off heres the president said sir kennington oval he has not seen our yacht yet let him come on board with us they were very gracious so i got into one boat and jack into another and old crasweller who had come with his guests from little christchurch into the third and we were pulled off to the yacht jack i perceived was quite at home there he had dined there frequently and had slept on board but to me and crasweller it was altogether new yes said lord marylebone if a fellow is to make his home for a month upon the seas it is as well to make it as comfortable as possible each of us has his own crib with a bath to himself and all the etceteras this is where we feed it is not altogether a bad shop for grubbing as i looked round i thought that i had never seen anything more palatial and beautiful this is where we pretend to sit continued the lord where we are supposed to write our letters and read our books and this he said opening another door is where we really sit and smoke our pipes and drink our brandyandwater we came out under the rule of that tyrant king macnuffery we mean to go back as a republic and i as being the only lord mean to elect myself president you couldnt give me any wrinkles as to a pleasant mode of governing everybody is to be allowed to do exactly what he pleases and nobody is to be interfered with unless he interferes with somebody else we mean to take a wrinkle from you fellows in britannula where everybody seems under your presidency to be as happy as the day is long  we have no upper house with us my lord said i  you have got rid at any rate of one terrible bother i daresay we shall drop it before long in england i dont see why we should continue to sit merely to register the edicts of the house of commons and be told that were a pack of fools when we hesitate i told him that it was the unfortunate destiny of a house of lords to be made to see her own unfitness for legislative work  but if we were abolished continued he then i might get into the other place and do something you have to be elected a peer of parliament or you can sit nowhere a ship can only be a ship after all but if we must live in a ship we are not so bad here come and take some tiffin an englishman when he comes to our side of the globe always calls his lunch tiffin  i went back to the other room with lord marylebone and as i took my place at the table i heard that the assembled cricketers were all discussing the fixed period  id be shot said mr puddlebrane if they should deposit me and bleed me to death and cremate me like a big pig then he perceived that i had entered the saloon and there came a sudden silence across the table  what sort of wind will be blowing next friday at two oclock asked sir lords longstop  it was evident that sir lords had only endeavoured to change the conversation because of my presence and it did not suit me to allow them to think that i was afraid to talk of the fixed period why should you object to be cremated mr puddlebrane said i whether like a big pig or otherwise it has not been suggested that any one shall cremate you while alive  because my father and mother were buried and all the puddlebranes were always buried there are they all to be seen in puddlebrane church and i should like to appear among them  i suppose its only their names that appear and not their bodies mr puddlebrane and a cremated man may have as big a tombstone as though he had been allowed to become rotten in the orthodox fashion  what puddlebrane means is said another that hed like to have the same chance of living as his ancestors  if he will look back to his family records he will find that they very generally died before sixtyeight but we have no idea of invading your parliament and forcing our laws upon you  take a glass of wine mr president said lord marylebone and leave puddlebrane to his ancestors hes a very good slip though he didnt catch jack when he got a chance allow me to recommend you a bit of icepudding the mangoes came from jamaica and are as fresh as the day they were picked i ate my mangopudding but i did not enjoy it for i was sure that the whole crew were returning to england laden with prejudices against the fixed period as soon as i could escape i got back to the shore leaving jack among my enemies it was impossible not to feel that they were my enemies as i was sure that they were about to oppose the cherished conviction of my very heart and soul crasweller had sat there perfectly silent while mr puddlebrane had spoken of his own possible cremation and yet crasweller was a declared fixedperiodist  on the friday at two oclock the vessel sailed amidst all the plaudits which could be given by mingled kettledrums and trumpets and by a salvo of artillery they were as good a set of fellows as ever wore pinkflannel clothing and as generous as any that there are born to live upon pâté and champagne i doubt whether there was one among them who could have earned his bread in a countinghouse unless it was stumps the professional when we had paid all honour to the departing vessel i went at once to little christchurch and there i found my friend in the verandah with eva during the last month or two he seemed to be much older than i had ever before known him and was now seated with his daughters hand within his own i had not seen him since the day on board the yacht and he now seemed to be greyer and more haggard than he was then crasweller said i taking him by the hand it is a sad thing that you and i should quarrel after so many years of perfect friendship  so it is so it is i dont want to quarrel mr president  there shall be no quarrel well eva how do you bear the loss of all your english friends  the loss of my english friends wont hurt me if i can only keep those which i used to have in britannula i doubted whether she alluded to me or to jack it might be only to me but i thought she looked as if she were thinking of jack  eva my dear said mr crasweller you had better leave us the president i think wishes to speak to me on business then she came up and looked me in the face and pressed my hand and i knew that she was asking for mercy for her father the feeling was not pleasant seeing that i was bound by the strongest oath which the mind can conceive not to show him mercy  i sat for a few minutes in silence thinking that as mr crasweller had banished eva he would begin but he said nothing and would have remained silent had i allowed him to do so crasweller i said it is certainly not well that you and i should quarrel on this matter in your company i first learned to entertain this project and for years we have agreed that in it is to be found the best means for remedying the condition of mankind  i had not felt then what it is to be treated as one who was already dead  does eva treat you so  yes with all her tenderness and all her sweet love eva feels that my days are numbered unless i will boldly declare myself opposed to your theory she already regards me as though i were a visitant from the other world her very gentleness is intolerable  but crasweller the convictions of your mind cannot be changed  i do not know i will not say that any change has taken place but it is certain that convictions become vague when they operate against ones self the desire to live is human and therefore godlike when the hand of god is felt to have struck one with coming death the sufferer knowing the blow to be inevitable can reconcile himself but it is very hard to walk away to ones long rest while health and work and means of happiness yet remain  there was something in this which seemed to me to imply that he had abandoned the weak assertion as to his age and no longer intended to ask for a year of grace by the use of that falsehood but it was necessary that i should be sure of this as to your exact age ive been looking at the records i began  the records are right enough he said you need trouble yourself no longer about the records eva and i have discussed all that from this i became aware that eva had convinced him of the baseness of the falsehood  then there is the law said i with as i felt unflinching hardness  yes there is the lawif it be a law mr exors is prepared to dispute it and says that he will ask permission to argue the case out with the executive  he would argue about anything you know what exors is  and there is that poor man barnes has gone altogether out of his mind and has become a drivelling idiot  they told me yesterday that he was a raging lunatic but i learn from really good authority that whether he takes one part or the other he is only acting  and tallowax is prepared to run amuck against those who come to fetch him he swears that no one shall lead him up to the college  and you then there was a pause and crasweller sat silent with his face buried in his hands he was at any rate in a far better condition of mind for persuasion than that in which i had last found him he had given up the fictitious year and had acknowledged that he had assented to the doctrine with which he was now asked to comply but it was a hard task that of having to press him under such circumstances i thought of eva and her despair and of himself with all that natural desire for life eager at his heart i looked round and saw the beauty of the scenery and thought how much worse to such a man would be the melancholy shades of the college than even departure itself and i am not by nature hardhearted i have none of that steel and fibre which will enable a really strong man to stand firm by convictions even when opposed by his affections to have liberated crasweller at this moment i would have walked off myself oh so willingly to the college i was tearing my own heart to piecesbut i remembered columbus and galileo neither of them was surely ever tried as i was at this moment but it had to be done or i must yield and for ever if i could not be strong to prevail with my own friend and fellowlabourerwith crasweller who was the first to come and who should have entered the college with an heroic grandeurhow could i even desire any other to immure himself how persuade such men as barnes or tallowax or that pettifogger exors to be led quietly up through the streets of the city and you i asked again  it is for you to decide  the agony of that moment but i think that i did right though my very heart was bleeding i know that i did right for the sake of the benefits which are to accrue to unknown thousands of your fellowcreatures it is your duty to obey the law this i said in a low voice still holding him by the hand i felt at the moment a great love for himand in a certain sense admiration because he had so far conquered his fear of an unknown future as to promise to do this thing simply because he had said that he would do it there was no high feeling as to future generations of his fellowcreatures no grand idea that he was about to perform a great duty for the benefit of mankind in general but simply the notion that as he had always advocated my theory as my friend he would not now depart from it let the cost to himself be what it might he answered me only by drawing away his hand but i felt that in his heart he accused me of cruelty and of mad adherence to a theory should it not be so crasweller  as you please president  but should it not be so then at great length i went over once again all my favourite arguments and endeavoured with the whole strength of my eloquence to reach his mind but i knew as i was doing so that that was all in vain i had succeededor perhaps eva had done soin inducing him to repudiate the falsehood by which he had endeavoured to escape but i had not in the least succeeded in making him see the good which would come from his deposition he was ready to become a martyr because in years back he had said that he would do so he had now left it for me to decide whether he should be called upon to perform his promise and i with an unfeeling pertinacity had given the case against him that was the light in which mr crasweller looked at it you do not think that i am cruel i asked  i do said crasweller you ask the question and i answer you i do think that you are cruel it concerns life and deaththat is a matter of courseand it is the life and death of your most intimate friend of evas father of him who years since came hither with you from another country and has lived with you through all the struggles and all the successes of a long career but you have my word and i will not depart from it even to save my life in a moment of weakness i was tempted to a weak lie i will not lie i will not demean myself to claim a poor year of life by such means though i do not lack evidence to support the statement i am ready to go with you and he rose up from his seat as though intending to walk away and be deposited at once  not now crasweller  i shall be ready when you may come for me i shall not again leave my home till i have to leave it for the last time days and weeks mean nothing with me now the bitterness of death has fallen upon me  crasweller i will come and live with you and be a brother to you during the entire twelve months  no it will not be needed eva will be with me and perhaps jack may come and see methough i must not allow jack to express the warmth of his indignation in evas hearing jack had perhaps better leave britannula for a time and not come back till all shall be over then he may enjoy the lawns of little christchurch in peaceunless perchance an idea should disturb him that he has been put into their immediate possession by his fathers act then he got up from his chair and went from the verandah back into the house  as i rose and returned to the city i almost repented myself of what i had done i had it in my heart to go back and yield and to tell him that i would assent to the abandonment of my whole project it was not for me to say that i would spare my own friend and execute the law against barnes and tallowax nor was it for me to declare that the victims of the first year should be forgiven i could easily let the law die away but it was not in my power to decide that it should fall into partial abeyance this i almost did but when i had turned on my road to little christchurch and was prepared to throw myself into craswellers arms the idea of galileo and columbus and their ultimate success again filled my bosom the moment had now come in which i might succeed the first man was ready to go to the stake and i had felt all along that the great difficulty would be in obtaining the willing assent of the first martyr it might well be that these accusations of cruelty were a part of the suffering without which my great reform could not be carried to success though i should live to be accounted as cruel as cæsar what would that be if i too could reduce my gaul to civilisation dear crasweller i murmured to myself as i turned again towards gladstonopolis and hurrying back buried myself in the obscurity of the executive chambers  the following day occurred a most disagreeable scene in my own house at dinner jack came in and took his chair at the table in grim silence it might be that he was lamenting for his english friends who were gone and therefore would not speak mrs neverbend too ate her dinner without a word i began to fear that presently there would be something to be saidsome cause for a quarrel and as is customary on such occasions i endeavoured to become specially gracious and communicative i talked about the ship that had started on its homeward journey and praised lord marylebone and laughed at mr puddlebrane but it was to no effect neither would jack nor mrs neverbend say anything and they ate their dinner gloomily till the attendant left the room then jack began i think it right to tell you sir that theres going to be a public meeting on the town flags the day after tomorrow the town flags was an open unenclosed place over which supported by arches was erected the town hall it was here that the people were accustomed to hold those outside assemblies which too often guided the responsible assembly in the senatehouse  and what are you all going to talk about there  there is only one subject said jack which at present occupies the mind of gladstonopolis the people dont intend to allow you to deposit mr crasweller  considering your age and experience jack dont you think that youre taking too much upon yourself to say whether people will allow or will not allow the executive of the country to perform their duty  if jack isnt old said mrs neverbend i at any rate am older and i say the same thing  of course i only said what i thought continued jack what i want to explain is that i shall be there myself and shall do all that i can to support the meeting  in opposition to your father said i  wellyes i am afraid so you see its a public subject on a public matter and i dont see that father and son have anything to do with it if i were in the assembly i dont suppose i should be bound to support my father  but youre not in the assembly  i have my own convictions all the same and i find myself called upon to take a part  good graciousyes and to save poor old mr craswellers life from this most inhuman law hes just as fit to live as are you and i  the only question is whether he be fit to dieor rather to be deposited i mean but im not going to argue the subject here it has been decided by the law and that should be enough for you two as it is enough for me as for jack i will not have him attend any such meeting were he to do so he would incur my grave displeasureand consequent punishment  what do you mean to do to the boy asked mrs neverbend  if he ceases to behave to me like a son i shall cease to treat him like a father if he attends this meeting he must leave my house and i shall see him no more  leave the house shrieked mrs neverbend  jack said i with the kindest voice which i was able to assume you will pack up your portmanteau and go to new zealand the day after tomorrow i have business for you to transact with macmurdo and brown of some importance i will give you the particulars when i see you in the office  of course he wont go mr neverbend cried my wife but though the words were determined there was a certain vacillation in the tone of her voice which did not escape me  we shall see if jack intends to remain as my son he must obey his father i have been kind and perhaps too indulgent to him i now require that he shall proceed to new zealand the day after tomorrow the boat sails at eight i shall be happy to go down with him and see him on board  jack only shook his headby which i understood that he meant rebellion i had been a most generous father to him and loved him as the very apple of my eye but i was determined that i would be stern you have heard my order i said and you can have tomorrow to think about it i advise you not to throw over and for ever the affection the fostering care and all the comforts pecuniary as well as others which you have hitherto had from an indulgent father  you do not mean to say that you will disinherit the boy said mrs neverbend  i knew that it was utterly out of my power to do so i could not disinherit him i could not even rob him of a single luxury without an amount of suffering much greater than he would feel was i not thinking of him day and night as i arranged my worldly affairs that moment when he knocked down sir kennington ovals wicket had i not been as proud as he was when the trumpet sounded did not i feel the honour more than he when he made his last triumphant run and i threw my hat in the air was it not to me sweeter than if i had done it myself did i not even love him the better for swearing that he would make this fight for crasweller but yet it was necessary that i should command obedience and if possible frighten him into subservience we talk of a fathers power and know that the old romans could punish filial disobedience by death but a britannulan father has a heart in his bosom which is more powerful than law or even custom and i believe that the roman was much the same my dear i will not discuss my future intentions before the boy it would be unseemly i command him to start for new zealand the day after tomorrow and i shall see whether he will obey me i strongly advise him to be governed in this matter by his father jack only shook his head and left the room i became aware afterwards that he slept that night at little christchurch  that night i received such a lecture from mrs neverbend in our bedroom as might have shamed that mrs caudle of whom we read in english history i hate these lectures not as thinking them unbecoming but as being peculiarly disagreeable i always find myself absolutely impotent during their progress i am aware that it is quite useless to speak a word and that i can only allow the clock to run itself down what mrs neverbend says at such moments has always in it a great deal of good sense but it is altogether wasted because i knew it all beforehand and with pen and ink could have written down the lecture which she delivered at that peculiar moment and i fear no evil results from her anger for the future because her conduct to me will i know by experience be as careful and as kind as ever were another to use harsh language to me she would rise in wrath to defend me and she does not in truth mean a tenth of what she says but i am for the time as though i were within the clapper of a mill and her passion goes on increasing because she can never get a word from me mr neverbend i tell you thisyou are going to make a fool of yourself i think it my duty to tell you so as your wife everybody else will think it who are you to liken yourself to galileoan old fellow of that kind who lived a thousand years ago before christianity had ever been invented you have got nasty murderous thoughts in your mind and want to kill poor mr crasweller just out of pride because you have said you would now jack is determined that you shant and i say that he is right there is no reason why jack shouldnt obey me as well as you you will never be able to deposit mr craswellernot if you try it for a hundred years the city wont let you do it and if you have a grain of sense left in your head you wont attempt it jack is determined to meet the men on the town flags the day after tomorrow and i say that he is right as for your disinheriting him and spending all your money on machinery to roast pigsi say you cant do it there will be a commission to inquire into you if you do not mind yourself and then you will remember what i told you poor mr crasweller whom you have known for forty years i wonder how you can bring yourself to think of killing the poor man whose bread you have so often eaten and if you think you are going to frighten jack you are very much mistaken jack would do twice more for eva crasweller than for you or me and its natural he should you may be sure he will not give up and the end will be that he will get eva for his own i do believe he has gone to sleep then i gave myself infinite credit for the pertinacity of my silence and for the manner in which i had put on an appearance of somnolency without overacting the part mrs neverbend did in truth go to sleep but i lay awake during the whole night thinking of the troubles before me     chapter viii  the john bright   jack of course did not go to new zealand and i was bound to quarrel with himtemporarily they held the meeting on the town flags and many eloquent words were no doubt spoken i did not go of course nor did i think it well to read the reports mrs neverbend took it into her head at this time to speak to me only respecting the material wants of life will you have another lump of sugar in your tea mr president or if you want a second blanket on your bed mr neverbend and will say the word it shall be supplied i took her in the same mood and was dignified cautious and silent with jack i was supposed to have quarrelled altogether and very grievous it was to me not to be able to speak to the lad of a morning or an evening but he did not seem to be much the worse for it as for turning him out of the house or stopping his pocketmoney that would be carrying the joke further than i could do it indeed it seemed to me that he was peculiarly happy at this time for he did not go to his office he spent his mornings in making speeches and then went down in the afternoon on his bicycle to little christchurch  so the time passed on and the day absolutely came on which crasweller was to be deposited i had seen him constantly during the last few weeks but he had not spoken to me on the subject he had said that he would not leave little christchurch and he did not do so i do not think that he had been outside his own grounds once during these six weeks he was always courteous to me and would offer me tea and toast when i came with a stately civility as though there had been no subject of burning discord between us eva i rarely saw that she was there i was awarebut she never came into my presence till the evening before the appointed day as i shall presently have to tell once or twice i did endeavour to lead him on to the subject but he showed a disinclination to discuss it so invincible that i was silenced as i left him on the day before that on which he was to be deposited i assured him that i would call for him on the morrow  do not trouble yourself he said repeating the words twice over it will be just the same whether you are here or not then i shook my head by way of showing him that i would come and i took my leave  i must explain that during these last few weeks things had not gone quietly in gladstonopolis but there had been nothing like a serious riot i was glad to find that in spite of jacks speechifying the younger part of the population was still true to me and i did not doubt that i should still have got the majority of votes in the assembly a rumour was spread abroad that the twelve months of craswellers period of probation were to be devoted to discussing the question and i was told that my theory as to the fixed period would not in truth have been carried out merely because mr crasweller had changed his residence from little christchurch to the college i had ordered an open barouche to be prepared for the occasion and had got a pair of splendid horses fit for a triumphal march with these i intended to call at little christchurch at noon and to accompany mr crasweller up to the college sitting on his left hand on all other occasions the president of the republic sat in his carriage on the right side and i had ever stood up for the dignities of my position but this occasion was to be an exception to all rule  on the evening before as i was sitting in my library at home mournfully thinking of the occasion telling myself that after all i could not devote my friend to what some might think a premature death the door was opened and eva crasweller was announced she had on one of those round closefitting mens hats which ladies now wear but under it was a veil which quite hid her face i am taking a liberty mr neverbend she said in troubling you at the present moment  eva my dear how can anything you do be called a liberty  i do not know mr neverbend i have come to you because i am very unhappy  i thought you had shunned me of late  so i have how could i help it when you have been so anxious to deposit poor papa in that horrid place  he was equally anxious a few years since  never he agreed to it because you told him and because you were a man able to persuade it was not that he ever had his heart in it even when it was not near enough to alarm himself and he is not a man fearful of death in the ordinary way papa is a brave man  my darling child it is beautiful to hear you say so of him  he is going with you tomorrow simply because he has made you a promise and does not choose to have it said of him that he broke his word even to save his own life is not that courage it is not with him as it is with you who have your heart in the matter because you think of some great thing that you will do so that your name may be remembered to future generations  it is not for that eva i care not at all whether my name be remembered it is for the good of many that i act  he believes in no good but is willing to go because of his promise is it fair to keep him to such a promise under such circumstances  but the law  i will hear nothing of the law the law means you and your influences papa is to be sacrificed to the law to suit your pleasure papa is to be destroyed not because the law wishes it but to suit the taste of mr neverbend  oh eva  it is true  to suit my taste  wellwhat else you have got the idea into your head and you will not drop it and you have persuaded him because he is your friend oh a most fatal friendship he is to be sacrificed because when thinking of other things he did not care to differ with you then she paused as though to see whether i might not yield to her words and if the words of any one would have availed to make me yield i think it would have been hers as now spoken do you know what people will say of you mr neverbend she continued  what will they say  if i only knew how best i could tell you your son has asked meto be his wife  i have long known that he has loved you well  but it can never be she said if my father is to be carried away to this fearful place people would say that you had hurried him off in order that jack  would you believe it eva said i with indignation  it does not matter what i would believe mr grundle is saying it already and is accusing me too and mr exors the lawyer is spreading it about it has become quite the common report in gladstonopolis that jack is to become at once the owner of little christchurch  perish little christchurch i exclaimed my son would marry no mans daughter for his money  i do not believe it of jack she said for i know that he is generous and good there i do love him better than any one in the world but as things are i can never marry him if papa is to be shut up in that wretched city of the dead  not city of the dead my dear  oh i cannot bear to think of itall alone with no one but me with him to watch him as day after day passes away as the ghastly hour comes nearer and still nearer when he is to be burned in those fearful furnaces  the cremation my dear has nothing in truth to do with the fixed period  to wait till the fatal day shall have arrived and then to know that at a fixed hour he will be destroyed just because you have said so can you imagine what my feelings will be when that moment shall have come  i had not in truth thought of it but now when the idea was represented to my minds eye i acknowledged to myself that it would be impossible that she should be left there for the occasion how or when she should be taken away or whither i could not at the moment think these would form questions which it would be very hard to answer after some score of years say when the community would be used to the fixed period i could understand that a daughter or a wife might leave the college and go away into such solitudes as the occasion required a week perhaps before the hour arranged for departure had come custom would make it comparatively easy as custom has arranged such a period of mourning for a widow and such another for a widower a son or a daughter but here with eva there would be no custom she would have nothing to guide her and might remain there till the last fatal moment i had hoped that she might have married jack or perhaps grundle during the intervalnot having foreseen that the year which was intended to be one of honour and glory should become a time of mourning and tribulation yes my dear it is very sad  sad was there ever a position in life so melancholy so mournful so unutterably miserable i remained there opposite gazing into vacancy but i could say nothing what do you intend to do mr neverbend she asked it is altogether in your bosom my fathers life or death is in your hands what is your decision i could only remain steadfast but it seemed to be impossible to say so well mr neverbend will you speak  it is not for me to decide it is for the country  the country she exclaimed rising up it is your own prideyour vanity and cruelty combined you will not yield in this matter to me your friends daughter because your vanity tells you that when you have once said a thing that thing shall come to pass then she put the veil down over her face and went out of the room  i sat for some time motionless trying to turn over in my mind all that she had said to me but it seemed as though my faculties were utterly obliterated in despair eva had been to me almost as a daughter and yet i was compelled to refuse her request for her fathers life and when she had told me that it was my pride and vanity which had made me do so i could not explain to her that they were not the cause and indeed was i sure of myself that it was not so i had flattered myself that i did it for the public good but was i sure that obduracy did not come from my anxiety to be counted with columbus and galileo or if not that was there not something personal to myself in my desire that i should be known as one who had benefited my species in considering such matters it is so hard to separate the motivesto say how much springs from some glorious longing to assist others in their struggle upwards in humanity and how much again from mean personal ambition i had thought that i had done it all in order that the failing strength of old age might be relieved and that the race might from age to age be improved but i now doubted myself and feared lest that vanity of which eva had spoken to me had overcome me with my wife and son i could still be braveeven with crasweller i could be constant and hard but to be obdurate with eva was indeed a struggle and when she told me that i did so through pride i found it very hard to bear and yet it was not that i was angry with the child i became more and more attached to her the more loudly she spoke on behalf of her father her very indignation endeared me to her and made me feel how excellent she was how noble a wife she would be for my son but was i to give way after all having brought the matter to such a pitch was i to give up everything to the prayers of a girl i was well aware even then that my theory was true the old and effete should go in order that the strong and manlike might rise in their places and do the work of the world with the wealth of the world at their command take the average of mankind all round and there would be but the lessening of a year or two from the life of them all even taking those men who had arrived at twentyfive to how few are allotted more than forty years of life but yet how large a proportion of the wealth of the world remains in the hands of those who have passed that age and are unable from senile imbecility to employ that wealth as it should be used as i thought of this i said to myself that evas prayers might not avail and i did take some comfort to myself in thinking that all was done for the sake of posterity and then again when i thought of her prayers and of those stern words which had followed her prayersof that charge of pride and vanityi did tell myself that pride and vanity were not absent  she was gone now and i felt that she must say and think evil things of me through all my future life the time might perhaps come when i too should have been taken away and when her father should long since have been at rest that softer thoughts would come across her mind if it were only possible that i might go so that jack might be married to the girl he loved that might be well then i wiped my eyes and went forth to make arrangements for the morrow  the morning camethe 30th of junea bright clear winter morning cold but still genial and pleasant as i got into the barouche and had myself driven to little christchurch to say that my heart was sad within me would give no fair record of my condition i was so crushed by grief so obliterated by the agony of the hour that i hardly saw what passed before my eyes i only knew that the day had come the terrible day for which in my ignorance i had yearned and that i was totally unable to go through its ceremonies with dignity or even with composure but i observed as i was driven down the street lying out at sea many miles to the left a small spot of smoke on the horizon as though it might be of some passing vessel it did not in the least awaken my attention but there it was and i remembered to have thought as i passed on how blessed were they who steamed by unconscious of that terrible ordeal of the fixed period which i was bound to encounter  i went to little christchurch and there i found mr crasweller waiting for me in the hall i came in and took his limp hand in mine and congratulated him oh how vain how wretched sounded that congratulation in my own ears  and it was spoken i was aware in a piteous tone of voice and with meagre bated breath he merely shook his head and attempted to pass on will you not take your greatcoat said i seeing that he was going out into the open air without protection  no why should i it will not be wanted up there  you do not know the place i replied there are twenty acres of pleasureground for you to wander over then he turned upon me a lookoh such a lookand went on and took his place in the carriage but eva followed him and spread a rug across his knees and threw a cloak over his shoulders  will not eva come with us i said  no my daughter will hide her face on such a day as this it is for you and me to be carried through the cityyou because you are proud of the pageant and me because i do not fear it this too added something to my sorrow then i looked and saw that eva got into a small closed carriage in the rear and was driven off by a circuitous route to meet us no doubt at the college  as we were driven awaycrasweller and ii had not a word to say to him and he seemed to collect himself in his fierceness and to remain obdurately silent in his anger in this way we drove on till coming to a turn of the road the expanse of the sea appeared before us here again i observed a small cloud of smoke which had grown out of the spot i had before seen and i was aware that some large ship was making its way into the harbour of gladstonopolis i turned my face towards it and gazed and then a sudden thought struck me how would it be with me if this were some great english vessel coming into our harbour on the very day of craswellers deposition a year since i would have rejoiced on such an occasion and would have assured myself that i would show to the strangers the grandeur of this ceremony which must have been new to them but now a creeping terror took possession of me and i felt my heart give way within me i wanted no englishman nor american to come and see the first day of our fixed period  it was evident that crasweller did not see the smoke but to my eyes as we progressed it became nearer till at last the hull of the vast vessel became manifest then as the carriage passed on into the street of gladstonopolis at the spot where one side of the street forms the quay the vessel with extreme rapidity steamed in and i could see across the harbour that she was a ship of war a certain sense of relief came upon my mind just then because i felt sure that she had come to interfere with the work which i had in hand but how base must be my condition when i could take delight in thinking that it had been interrupted  by this time we had been joined by some eight or ten carriages which formed as it were a funeral cortège behind us but i could perceive that these carriages were filled for the most part by young men and that there was no contemporary of crasweller to be seen at all as we went up the town hill i could espy barnes gibbering on the doorstep of his house and tallowax brandishing a large knife in his hand and exors waving a paper over his head which i well knew to be a copy of the act of our assembly but i could only pretend not to see them as our carriage passed on  the chief street of gladstonopolis running through the centre of the city descends a hill to the level of the harbour as the vessel came in we began to ascend the hill but the horses progressed very slowly crasweller sat perfectly speechless by my side i went on with a forced smile upon my face speaking occasionally to this or the other neighbour as we met them i was forced to be in a certain degree cheerful but grave and solemn in my cheerfulness i was taking this man home for that last glorious year which he was about to pass in joyful anticipation of a happier life and therefore i must be cheerful but this was only the thing to be acted the play to be played by me the player i must be solemn toosilent as the churchyard mournful as the gravebecause of the truth why was i thus driven to act a part that was false on the brow of the hill we met a concourse of people both young and old and i was glad to see that the latter had come out to greet us but by degrees the crowd became so numerous that the carriage was stopped in its progress and rising up i motioned to those around us to let us pass we became however more firmly enveloped in the masses and at last i had to ask aloud that they would open and let us go on mr president said one old gentleman to me a tanner in the city theres an english ship of war come into the harbour i think theyve got something to say to you  something to say to me what can they have to say to me i replied with all the dignity i could command  well just stay and seewell just wait a few minutes said another elder he was a barkeeper with a red nose and as he spoke he took up a place in front of the horses it was in vain for me to press the coachman it would have been indecent to do so at such a moment and something at any rate was due to the position of crasweller he remained speechless in the carriage but i thought that i could see as i glanced at his face that he took a strong interest in the proceedings theyre going to begin to come up the hill mr bunnit said the barkeeper to the tanner as soon as ever theyre out of their boats  god bless the old flag for ever and ever said mr bunnit i knew they wouldnt let us deposit any one  thus their secret was declared these old menthe tanner and whiskydealer and the likehad sent home to england to get assistance against their own government there had always been a scum of the populationthe dirty frothy meaningless foam at the topmen like the drunken old barkeeper who had still clung submissive to the old countrymen who knew nothing of progress and civilisationwho were content with what they ate and drank and chiefly with the latter here they come god bless their gold bands said he of the red nose yesup the hill they came three gilded british naval officers surrounded by a crowd of britannulans  crasweller heard it all but did not move from his place but he leaned forward and he bit his lip and i saw that his right hand shook as it grasped the arm of the carriage there was nothing for me but to throw myself back and remain tranquil i was however well aware that an hour of despair and opposition and of defeat was coming upon me up they came and were received with three deafening cheers by the crowd immediately round the carriage i beg your pardon sir said one of the three whom i afterwards learned to be the second lieutenant are you the president of this republic  i am replied i and what may you be  i am the second lieutenant on board hms gunboat the john bright i had heard of this vessel which had been named from a gallant officer who in the beginning of the century had seated himself on a barrel of gunpowder and had singlehanded quelled a mutiny he had been made earl bright for what he had done on that occasion but the vessel was still called j b throughout the service  and what may be your business with me mr second lieutenant  our captain captain battleaxs compliments and he hopes you wont object to postpone this interesting ceremony for a day or two till he may come and see he is sure that mr crasweller wont mind then he took off his hat to my old friend the captain would have come up himself but he cant leave the ship before he sees his big gun laid on and made safe he is very sorry to be so unceremonious but the 250ton steamswiveller requires a great deal of care  laid on i suggested  wellyes it is always necessary when the ship lets go her anchor to point the gun in the most effective manner  she wont go off will she asked bunnit  not without provocation i think the captain has the exploding wire under double lock and key in his own stateroom if he only touched the spring we about the locality here would be knocked into little bits in less time than it will take you to think about it indeed the whole of this side of the hill would become an instantaneous ruin without the sign of a human being anywhere  there was a threat in this which i could not endure and indeed for myself i did not care how soon i might be annihilated england with unsurpassed tyranny had sent out one of her brutal modern inventions and threatened us all with blood and gore and murder if we did not give up our beneficent modern theory it was the malevolent influence of the intellect applied to brute force dominating its benevolent influence as applied to philanthropy what was the john bright to me that it should come there prepared to send me into eternity by its bloodthirsty mechanism it is an evil sign of the timesof the times that are in so many respects hopefulthat the greatest inventions of the day should always take the shape of engines of destruction but what could i do in the agony of the moment i could but show the coolness of my courage by desiring the coachman to drive on  for gods sake dont said crasweller jumping up  he shant stir a step said bunnit to the barkeeper  he cant move an inch replied the other we know what our precious lives are worth dont we mr bunnit  what could i do mr second lieutenant i must hold you responsible for this interruption said i  exactly so i am responsibleas far as stopping this carriage goes had all the town turned out in your favour and had this gentleman insisted on being carried away to be buried  nothing of that kind said crasweller  then i think i may assume that captain battleax will not fire his gun but if you will allow me i will ask him a question then he put a minute whistle up to his mouth and i could see for the first time that there hung from this the thinnest possible metal wirea thread of silk i would have said only that it was much less palpablewhich had been dropped from the whistle as the lieutenant had come along and which now communicated with the vessel i had of course heard of this hair telephone but i had never before seen it used in such perfection i was assured afterwards that one of the ships officers could go ten miles inland and still hold communication with his captain he put the instrument alternately to his mouth and to his ear and then informed me that captain battleax was desirous that we should all go home to our own houses  i decline to go to my own house i said the lieutenant shrugged his shoulders coachman as soon as the crowd has dispersed itself you will drive on the coachman who was an old assistant in my establishment turned round and looked at me aghast but he was soon put out of his trouble bunnit and the barkeeper took out the horses and proceeded to lead them down the hill crasweller as soon as he saw this said that he presumed he might go back as he could not possibly go on it is but three miles for us to walk i said  i am forbidden to permit this gentleman to proceed either on foot or with the carriage said the lieutenant i am to ask if he will do captain battleax the honour to come on board and take tiffin with him if i could only prevail on you mr president on this i shook my head in eager denial exactly so but he will hope to see you on another occasion soon i little thought then how many long days i should have to pass with captain battleax and his officers or how pleasant companions i should find them when the remembrance of the present indignity had been somewhat softened by time  crasweller turned upon his heel and walked down the hill with the officersall the crowd accompanying them while bunnit and the barkeeper had gone off with the horses i had not descended from the carriage but there i was planted alonethe president of the republic left on the top of the hill in his carriage without means of locomotion on looking round i saw jack and with jack i saw also a lady shrouded from head to foot in black garments with a veil over her face whom i knew from the little round hat upon her head to be eva jack came up to me but where eva went i could not see shall we walk down to the house he said i felt that his coming to me at such a moment was kind because i had been as it were deserted by all the world then he opened the door of the carriage and i came out it was very odd that those fellows should have turned up just at this moment said jack  when things happen very oddly as you call it they seem to have been premeditated  not their coming today that has not been premeditated at least not to my knowledge indeed i did not in the least know what the english were likely to do  do you think it right to send to the enemies of your country for aid against your country this i asked with much indignation and i had refused as yet to take his arm  oh but sir england isnt our enemy  not when she comes and interrupts the quiet execution of our laws by threats of blowing us and our city and our citizens to instant destruction  she would never have done it i dont suppose that big gun is even loaded  the more contemptible is her position she threatens us with a lie in her mouth  i know nothing about it sir the gun may be there all right and the gunpowder and the twenty tons of iron shot but im sure shell not fire it off in our harbour they say that each shot costs two thousand five hundred pounds and that the wear and tear to the vessel is two thousand more there are things so terrible that if you will only create a belief in them that will suffice without anything else i suppose we may walk down crasweller has gone and you can do nothing without him  this was true and i therefore prepared to descend the hill my position as president of the republic did demand a certain amount of personal dignity and how was i to uphold that in my present circumstances jack said i it is the sign of a noble mind to bear contumely without petulance since our horses have gone before us and crasweller and the crowd have gone we will follow them then i put my arm within his and as i walked down the hill i almost took joy in thinking that crasweller had been spared  sir said jack as we walked on i want to tell you something  what is it  something of most extreme importance to me i never thought that i should have been so fortunate as to announce to you what ive now got to say i hardly know whether i am standing on my head or my heels eva crasweller has promised to be my wife  indeed  if you will make us happy by giving us your permission  i should not have thought that she would have asked for that  she has to ask her father and hes all right he did say when i spoke to him this morning that his permission would go for nothing as he was about to be led away and deposited of course i told him that all that would amount to nothing  to nothing what right had you to say so  well siryou see that a party of us were quite determined eva had said that she would never let me even speak to her as long as her fathers life was in danger she altogether hated that wretch grundle for wanting to get rid of him i swore to her that i would do the best i could and she said that if i could succeed thenshe thought she could love me what was a fellow to do  what did you do  i had it all out with sir kennington oval who is the prince of good fellows and he telegraphed to his uncle who is secretary for benevolence or some such thing at home  england is not your home said i  its the way we all speak of it  and what did he say  well he went to work and the john bright was sent out here but it was only an accident that it should come on this very day  and this was the way in which things are to be managed in britannula because a young boy had fallen in love with a pretty girl the whole wealth of england was to be used for a most nefarious purpose and a great nation was to exercise its tyranny over a small one in which her own language was spoken and her own customs followed in every way england had had reason to be proud of her youngest child we britannulans had become noted for intellect morals health and prosperity we had advanced a step upwards and had adopted the fixed period then at the instance of this lad a leviathan of war was to be sent out to crush us unless we would consent to put down the cherished conviction of our hearts as i thought of all walking down the street hanging on jacks arm i had to ask myself whether the fixed period was the cherished conviction of our hearts it was so of some no doubt and i had been able by the intensity of my willand something too by the covetousness and hurry of the younger mento cause my wishes to prevail in the community i did not find that i had reconciled myself to the use of this covetousness with the object of achieving a purpose which i believed to be thoroughly good but the heartfelt conviction had not been strong with the people i was forced to confess as much had it indeed been really strong with any but myself was i not in the position of a shepherd driving sheep into a pasture which was distasteful to them eat o sheep and you will love the food in good timeyou or the lambs that are coming after you what sheep will go into unsavoury pastures with no hopes but such as these held out to them and yet i had been right the pasture had been the best which the ingenuity of man had found for the maintenance of sheep  jack said i what a poor stupid lovelorn boy you are  i daresay i am said jack meekly  you put the kisses of a pretty girl who may perhaps make you a good wifeand again may make you a bad oneagainst all the world in arms  i am quite sure about that said jack  sure about what  that there is not a fellow in all britannula will have such a wife as eva  that means that you are in love and because you are in love you are to throw overnot merely your father because in such an affair that goes for nothing  oh but it does i have thought so much about it  im much obliged to you but you are to put yourself in opposition to the greatest movement made on behalf of the human race for centuries you are to set yourself up against  galileo and columbus he suggested quoting my words with great cruelty  the modern galileo sir the columbus of this age and you are to conquer them i the father have to submit to you the son i the president of fiftyseven to you the schoolboy of twentyone i the thoughtful man to you the thoughtless boy i congratulate you but i do not congratulate the world on the extreme folly which still guides its actions then i left him and going into the executive chambers sat myself down and cried in the very agony of a broken heart     chapter ix  the new governor   so said i to myself because of jack and his love all the aspirations of my life are to be crushed the whole dream of my existence which has come so near to the fruition of a waking moment is to be violently dispelled because my own son and sir kennington oval have settled between them that a pretty girl is to have her own way as i thought of it there seemed to be a monstrous cruelty and potency in fortune which she never could have been allowed to exercise in a world which was not altogether given over to injustice it was for that that i wept i wept to think that a spirit of honesty should as yet have prevailed so little in the world here in our waters was lying a terrible engine of british power sent out by a british cabinet ministerthe socalled minister of benevolence by a bitter chanceat the instance of that ministers nephew to put down by brute force the most absolutely benevolent project for the governance of the world which the mind of man had ever projected it was in that that lay the agony of the blow  i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light had eva crasweller not been goodlooking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mr bunnit and the barkeeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hillshould i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend that was the question which i ought to ask myself and even had i succeeded in carrying my success so far as that should i not have appeared a murderer to my fellowcitizens had not his departure been followed in regular sequence by that of all others till it had come to my turn had crasweller departed and had the system then been stopped should i not have appeared a murderer even to myself and what hope had there been what reasonable expectation that the system should have been allowed fairplay  it must be understood that i i myself have never for a moment swerved but though i have been strong enough to originate the idea i have not been strong enough to bear the terrible harshness of the opinions of those around me when i should have exercised against those dear to me the mandates of the new law if i could in the spirit have leaped over a space of thirty years and been myself deposited in due order i could see that my memory would have been embalmed with those who had done great things for their fellowcitizens columbus and galileo and newton and harvey and wilberforce and cobden and that great banting who has preserved us all so completely from the horrors of obesity would not have been named with honour more resplendent than that paid to the name of neverbend such had been my ambition such had been my hope but it is necessary that a whole age should be carried up to some proximity to the reformer before there is a space sufficiently large for his operations had the telegraph been invented in the days of ancient rome would the romans have accepted it or have stoned wheatstone so thinking i resolved that i was before my age and that i must pay the allotted penalty  on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company we did not usually use the room but on entering the house i heard the clatter of conversation and went in there was captain battleax seated there beautiful with a cockedhat and an epaulet and gold braid he rose to meet me and i saw that he was a handsome tall man about forty with a determined face and a winning smile mr president said he i am in command of her majestys gunboat the john bright and i have come to pay my respects to the ladies  i am sure the ladies have great pleasure in seeing you i looked round the room and there with other of our fair citizens i saw eva as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self  i have come to your shores mr president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world  things were progressing captain battleax pretty well before this morning we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rosewater but on the whole we are a prosperous and wellsatisfied people  we are quite satisfied now captain battleax said my wife  quite satisfied said eva  i am sure we are all delighted to hear the ladies speak in so pleasant a manner said firstlieutenant crosstrees an officer with whom i have since become particularly intimate  then there was a little pause in the conversation and i felt myself bound to say something as to the violent interruption to which i had this morning been subjected and yet that something must be playful in its nature i must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind you will perceive captain battleax that there is a little difference of opinion between us all here as to the ceremony which was to have been accomplished this morning the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow  their masters said mrs neverbend no doubt we shall do so when it is only ourselves that we have to sacrifice but never when the question concerns our husbands our fathers and our sons  this was a pretty little speech enough and received the eager compliments of the officers of the john bright i did not mean said captain battleax to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this i am here only to pay my respects as a messenger from great britain to britannula to congratulate you all on your late victory at cricket and to say how loud are the praises bestowed on mr john neverbend junior for his skill and gallantry the power of his arm is already the subject discussed at all clubs and drawingrooms at home we had received details of the whole affair by watertelegram before the john bright started mrs neverbend you must indeed be proud of your son  jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises  sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife  and my lord marylebone behaves himself quite like a british peer said the wife of the mayor of gladstonopolisa lady whom he had married in england and who had not moved there in quite the highest circles  then we began to think of the hospitality of the island and the officers of the john bright were asked to dine with us on the following day i and my wife and son and the two craswellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next to me personally an extreme of courtesy was shown it seemed as though i were treated with almost royal honour this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner including the chaplain and the surgeon there were twelve of them and she asked twelve of the prettiest girls in gladstonopolis to meet them this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies we sat down thirtysix to dinner and i think that we showed a great divergence from those usual colonial banquets at which the elders are only invited to meet distinguished guests the officers were chiefly young men and a greater babel of voices was ill undertake to say never heard from a banquetinghall than came from our dinnertable eva crasweller was the queen of the evening and was as joyous as beautiful and as highspirited as a queen should ever be i did once or twice during the festivity glance round at old crasweller he was quiet and i might almost say silent during the whole evening but i could see from the testimony of his altered countenance how strong is the passion for life that dwells in the human breast  your promised bride seems to have it all her own way said captain battleax to jack when at last the ladies had withdrawn  oh yes said jack and im nowhere but i mean to have my innings before long  of what mrs neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success i was told too that after the invitations had been written no milliner in britannula was allowed to sleep a single moment till half an hour before the ladies were assembled in our drawingroom but their efforts too were conspicuously successful  on the next day some of us went on board the john bright for a return dinner and very pleasant the officers made it the living on board the john bright is exceedingly good as i have had occasion to learn from many dinners eaten there since that day i little thought when i sat down at the right hand of captain battleax as being the president of the republic with my wife on his left i should ever spend more than a month on board the ship or write on board it this account of all my thoughts and all my troubles in regard to the fixed period after dinner captain battleax simply proposed my health paying to me many unmeaning compliments in which however i observed that no reference was made to the special doings of my presidency and he ended by saying that though he had as a matter of courtesy and with the greatest possible alacrity proposed my health he would not call upon me for any reply and immediately on his sitting down there got up a gentleman to whom i had not been introduced before this day and gave the health of mrs neverbend and the ladies of britannula now in spite of what the captain said i undoubtedly had intended to make a speech when the president of the republic has his health drunk it is i conceive his duty to do so but here the gentleman rose with a rapidity which did at the moment seem to have been premeditated at any rate my eloquence was altogether stopped the gentleman was named sir ferdinando brown he was dressed in simple black and was clearly not one of the ships officers but i could not but suspect at the moment that he was in some special measure concerned in the mission on which the gunboat had been sent he sat on mrs neverbends left hand and did seem in some respect to be the chief man on that occasion however he proposed mrs neverbends health and the ladies and the captain instantly called upon the band to play some favourite tune after that there was no attempt at speaking we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore sir ferdinando and i said the captain as we shook hands with him will do ourselves the honour of calling on you at the executive chambers tomorrow morning  i went home to bed with a presentiment of evil running across my heart a presentiment indeed how much of evilof real accomplished evilhad there not occurred to me during the last few days every hope for which i had lived as i then told myself had been brought to sudden extinction by the coming of these men to whom i had been so pleasant and who in their turn had been so pleasant to me what could i do now but just lay myself down and die and the death of which i dreamt could not alas be that true benumbing death which we think may put an end or at any rate give a change to all our thoughts to die would be as nothing but to live as the late president of the republic who had fixed his aspirations so high would indeed be very melancholy as president i had still two years to run but it occurred to me now that i could not possibly endure those two years of prolonged nominal power i should be the laughingstock of the people and as such it would become me to hide my head when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days mrs neverbend should come with me or stay if it so pleased her in gladstonopolis jack would become evas happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world crasweller the triumphant would live and at last die amidst the flocks and herds of little christchurch i too would have a small herd a little flock of my own surrounded by no such glories as those of little christchurchowing nothing to wealth or scenery or neighbourhoodand there till god should take me i would spend the evening of my day thinking of all this i went to sleep  on the next morning sir ferdinando brown and captain battleax were announced at the executive chambers i had already been there at my work for a couple of hours but sir ferdinando apologised for the earliness of his visit it seemed to me as he entered the room and took the chair that was offered to him that he was the greater man of the two on the occasionor perhaps i should say of the three and yet he had not before come on shore to visit me nor had he made one at our little dinnerparty mr neverbend began the captainand i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as presidentit cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high but you must be aware that it has been our intention to interfere with that which you must regard as the performance of a duty  it is a duty said i but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it therefore we can be courteous while we submit not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you but how can a little state but a few years old situated on a small island far removed from all the centres of civilisation contend on any point with the owner of the great 250ton swivellergun  that is all quite true mr neverbend said sir ferdinando brown  i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter in which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction whether your gun be loaded or not matters little  it is certainly loaded said captain battleax  then you have wasted your powder and shot like a highwayman it would have sufficed for you merely to tell the weak and cowardly that your pistol would be made to go off when wanted to speak the truth captain battleax i do not think that you excel us more in courage than you do in thought and practical wisdom therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally  very well put said sir ferdinando i simply bowed to him and now he continued will you answer me one question  a dozen if it suits you to ask them  captain battleax cannot remain here long with that expensive toy which he keeps locked up somewhere among his cockedhats and white gloves i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board but 250ton swivellers do cost money and the john bright must steam away and play its part in other quarters of the globe what do you intend to do when he shall have taken his pocketpistol away  i thought for a little what answer it would best become me to give to this question but i paused only for a moment or two i shall proceed at once to carry out the fixed period i felt that my honour demanded that to such a question i should make no other reply  and that in opposition to the wishes as i understand of a large proportion of your fellowcitizens  the wishes of our fellowcitizens have been declared by repeated majorities in the assembly  you have only one house in your constitution said sir ferdinando  one house i hold to be quite sufficient  i was proceeding to explain the theory on which the britannulan constitution had been formed when sir ferdinando interrupted me at any rate you will admit that a second chamber is not there to guard against the sudden action of the first but we need not discuss all this now it is your purpose to carry out your fixed period as soon as the john bright shall have departed  certainly  and you are i am aware sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so  i think i am i said with a modest acquiescence in an assertion which i felt to be so much to my credit but i blushed for its untruth  then said sir ferdinando there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him  there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt me the president of a foreign nation the first officer of a people with whom great britain was at peacethe captain of one of her gunboats must carry me off hurry me away a prisoner whither i knew not and leave the country ungoverned with no president as yet elected to supply my place and i looking at the matter from my own point of view was a husband the head of a family a man largely concerned in businessi was to be carried away in bondagei who had done no wrong had disobeyed no law who had indeed been conspicuous for my adherence to my duties no opposition ever shown to columbus and galileo had come near to this in audacity and oppression i the president of a free republic the elected of all its people the chosen depository of its official lifei was to be kidnapped and carried off in a ship of war because forsooth i was deemed too popular to rule the country and this was told to me in my own room in the executive chambers in the very sanctum of public life by a stout florid gentleman in a black coat of whom i hitherto knew nothing except that his name was brown  sir i said after a pause and turning to captain battleax and addressing him i cannot believe that you as an officer in the british navy will commit any act of tyranny so oppressive and of injustice so gross as that which this gentleman has named  you hear what sir ferdinando brown has said replied captain battleax  i do not know the gentlemanexcept as having been introduced to him at your hospitable table sir ferdinando brown is to mesimply sir ferdinando brown  sir ferdinando has lately been our british governor in ashantee where he has as i may truly say bought golden opinions from all sorts of people he has now been sent here on this delicate mission and to no one could it be intrusted by whom it would be performed with more scrupulous honour this was simply the opinion of captain battleax and expressed in the presence of the gentleman himself whom he so lauded  but what is the delicate mission i asked  then sir ferdinando told his whole story which i think should have been declared before i had been asked to sit down to dinner with him in company with the captain on board the ship i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhereor drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which that was the first step to be taken towards carrying out the tyrannical illegal and altogether injurious intention of the british government then the republic of britannula was to be declared as nonexistent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers that governor was to be sir ferdinando brown  i was lost in a maze of wonderment as i attempted to look at the proceeding all round now at the close of the twentieth century could oppression be carried to such a height as this gentlemen i said you are powerful that little instrument which you have hidden in your cabin makes you the master of us all it has been prepared by the ingenuity of men able to dominate matter though altogether powerless over mind on myself i need hardly say that it would be inoperative though you should reduce me to atoms from them would spring those opinions which would serve altogether to silence your artillery but the dread of it is to the generality much more powerful than the fact of its possession  you may be quite sure its there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board  you propose to kidnap me i said what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you  lieutenant crosstrees has sealed orders and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore he would think nothing of blowing me up so long as he obeyed orders  i was going on to observe i continued that though this power is in your hands and in that of your country the exercise of it betrays not only tyranny of disposition but poorness and meanness of spirit i here bowed first to the one gentleman and then to the other it is simply a contest between brute strength and mental energy  if you will look at the contests throughout the world said sir ferdinando you will generally find that the highest respect is paid to the greatest battalions  what worldwide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando he was a man who looked as though everything were to yield to his meagre philosophy and it seemed to me as though he enjoyed the exercise of the tyranny which chance had put into his power  you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion in the meantime my friend captain battleax has below a guard of fifty marines who will pay you the respect of escorting you on board with two of the ships cutters everything that can be there done for your accommodation and comfortevery luxury which can be provided to solace the president of this late republicshall be afforded but mr neverbend it is necessary that you should go to england and allow me to assure you that your departure can neither be prevented nor delayed by uncivil words spoken to the future governor of this prosperous colony  my words are at any rate less uncivil than captain battleaxs marines and they have i submit been made necessary by the conduct of your country in this matter were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter i say that the english government is a tyrant and that you are the instruments of its tyranny now you can proceed to do your work  that having all been pleasantly settled said sir ferdinando with a smile i will ask you to read the document by which this duty has been placed in my hands he then took out of his pocket a letter addressed to him by the duke of hatfield as minister for the crown colonies and gave it to me to read the letter ran as follows      colonial office crown colonies    15th may 1980     siri have it in command to inform your excellency that    you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which    is called britannula the peculiar circumstances of the    colony are within your excellencys knowledge some years    since after the separation of new zealand the inhabitants    of britannula requested to be allowed to manage their own    affairs and hm minister of the day thought it expedient    to grant their request the country has since undoubtedly    prospered and in a material point of view has given    us no grounds for regret but in their selection of a    constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed    themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have    sprung their present difficulties it must be that in    such circumstances crude councils should be passed as laws    without the safeguard coming from further discussion and    thought at the present moment a law has been passed which    if carried into action would become abhorrent to mankind    at large it is contemplated to destroy all those who shall    have reached a certain fixed age the arguments put forward    to justify so strange a measure i need not here explain at    length it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those    who survive that period of life at which men cease to work    this terrible doctrine has been adopted at the advice of    an eloquent citizen of the republic who is at present    its president and whose general popularity seems to be    so great that in compliance with his views even this    measure will be carried out unless great britain shall    interfere     you are desired to proceed at once to britannula to    reannex the island and to assume the duties of the    governor of a crown colony it is understood that a year of    probation is to be allowed to those victims who have agreed    to their own immolation you will therefore arrive there    in ample time to prevent the first bloodshed but it is    surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your    entering at once upon your government so great is the    popularity of their president mr neverbend that if he be    left on the island your excellency will find a dangerous    rival it is therefore desired that you should endeavour    to obtain information as to his intentions and that if    the fixed period be not abandoned altogether with a clear    conviction as to its cruelty on the part of the inhabitants    generally you should cause him to be carried away and    brought to england     to enable you to effect this captain battleax of hm    gunboat the john bright has been instructed to carry    you out the john bright is armed with a weapon of great    power against which it is impossible that the people of    britannula should prevail you will carry out with you 100    men of the northnorthwest birmingham regiment which will    probably suffice for your own security as it is thought    that if mr neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert    easily to their old habits of obedience     in regard to mr neverbend himself it is the especial    wish of hm government that he shall be treated with all    respect and that those honours shall be paid to him which    are due to the president of a friendly republic it is to    be expected that he should not allow himself to make an    enforced visit to england without some opposition but    it is considered in the interests of humanity to be so    essential that this scheme of the fixed period shall not be    carried out that hm government consider that his absence    from britannula shall be for a time insured you will    therefore insure it but will take care that as far as    lies in your excellencys power he be treated with all    that respect and hospitality which would be due to him were    he still the president of an allied republic     captain battleax of the john bright will have received    a letter to the same effect from the first lord of the    admiralty and you will find him ready to cooperate with    your excellency in every respecti have the honour to be    sir your excellencys most obedient servant     hatfield   this i read with great attention while they sat silent i understand it and that is all i suppose that i need say upon the subject when do you intend that the john bright shall start  we have already lighted our fires and our sailors are weighing the anchors will twelve oclock suit you  today i shouted  i rather think we must move today said the captain  if so you must be content to take my dead body it is now nearly eleven  halfpast ten said the captain looking at his watch  and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government  i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando  no doubtknowing nothing of the forms of our government or  they of course must all be altered  or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible i too have the complicated affairs of my entire life to arrange and my wife and son to leave though i would not for a moment be supposed to put these private matters forward when the public service is concerned but the time you name is so unreasonable as to create a feeling of horror at your tyranny  a feeling of horror would be created on the other side of the water said sir ferdinando at the idea of what you may do if you escape us i should not consider my head to be safe on my own shoulders were it to come to pass that while i am on the island an old man were executed in compliance with your system  alas i could not but feel how little he knew of the sentiment which prevailed in britannula how false was his idea of my power and how potent was that love of life which had been evinced in the city when the hour for deposition had become nigh all this i could hardly explain to him as i should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy and yet it was necessary that i should say something to make him understand that this sudden deportation was not necessary and then during that moment there came to me suddenly an idea that it might be well that i should take this journey to england and there begin again my careeras columbus after various obstructions had recommenced hisand that i should endeavour to carry with me the people of great britain as i had already carried the more quickly intelligent inhabitants of britannula and in order that i may do so i have now prepared these pages writing them on board hm gunboat the john bright  your power is sufficient i said  we are not sure of that said sir ferdinando it is always well to be on the safe side  are you so afraid of what a single old man can doyou with your 250ton swivellers and your guard of marines and your northnorthwest birmingham soldiery  that depends on who and what the old man may be this was the first complimentary speech which sir ferdinando had made and i must confess that it was efficacious i did not after that feel so strong a dislike to the man as i had done before we do not wish to make ourselves disagreeable to you mr neverbend i shrugged my shoulders unnecessarily disagreeable i should have said you are a man of your word here i bowed to him if you will give us your promise to meet captain battleax here at this time tomorrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twentyfour hours to this again i objected violently and at last as an extreme favour two entire days were allowed for my departure  the craft of men versed in the affairs of the old eastern world is notorious i afterwards learned that the stokers on board the ship were only pretending to get up their fires and the sailors pretending to weigh their anchors in order that their operations might be visible and that i might suppose that i had received a great favour from my enemies hands and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace at any rate i did make the promise and gave these two gentlemen my word that i would be present there in my own room in the executive chambers at the same hour on the day but one following  and now said sir ferdinando that this matter is settled between us allow me most cordially to shake you by the hand and to express my great admiration for your character i cannot say that i agree with you in theory as to the fixed periodmy wife and children could not i am sure endure to see me led away when a certain day should comebut i can understand that much may be said on the point and i admire greatly the eloquence and energy which you have devoted to the matter i shall be happy to meet you here at any hour tomorrow and to receive the britannulan archives from your hands you mr neverbend will always be regarded as the father of your country      roma patrem patriæ ciceronem libera dixit   with this the two gentlemen left the room     chapter x  the townhall   when i went home and told them what was to be done they were of course surprised but apparently not very unhappy mrs neverbend suggested that she should accompany me so as to look after my linen and other personal comforts but i told her whether truly or not i hardly then knew that there would be no room for her on board a ship of war such as the john bright since i have lived on board her i have become aware that they would willingly have accommodated at my request a very much larger family than my own mrs neverbend at once went to work to provide for my enforced absence and in the course of the day eva crasweller came in to help her evas manner to myself had become perfectly altered since the previous morning nothing could be more affectionate more gracious or more winning than she was now and i envied jack the short moments of têteàtête retreat which seemed from time to time to be necessary for carrying out the arrangements of the day  i may as well state here that from this time abraham grundle showed himself to be a declared enemy and that the partnership was dissolved between crasweller and himself he at once brought an action against my old friend for the recovery of that proportion of his property to which he was held to be entitled under our marriage laws this mr crasweller immediately offered to pay him but some of our more respectable lawyers interfered and persuaded him not to make the sacrifice there then came on a long action with an appealall which was given against grundle and nearly ruined the grundles it seemed to me as far as i could go into the matter that grundle had all the law on his side but there arose certain quibbles and questions all of which jack had at his fingersends by the strength of which the unfortunate young man was trounced as i learned by the letters which eva wrote to me crasweller was all through most anxious to pay him but the lawyers would not have it so and therefore so much of the property of little christchurch was saved for the ultimate benefit of that happy fellow jack neverbend  on the afternoon of the one day which as a matter of grace had been allowed to me sir ferdinando declared his intention of making a speech to the people of gladstonopolis he was desirous he said of explaining to the community at large the objects of hm government in sending him to britannula and in requesting the inhabitants to revert to their old form of government request indeed i said to crasweller throwing all possible scorn into the tone of my voicerequest with the northnorthwest birmingham regiment and his 250ton steamswiveller in the harbour that ferdinando brown knows how to conceal his claws beneath a velvet glove we are to be slavesslaves because england so wills it we are robbed of our constitution our freedom of action is taken from us and we are reduced to the lamentable condition of a british crown colony and all this is to be done because we had striven to rise above the prejudices of the day crasweller smiled and said not a word to oppose me and accepted all my indignation with assent but he certainly did not show any enthusiasm a happier old gentleman or one more active for his years i had never known it was but yesterday that i had seen him so absolutely cowed as to be hardly able to speak a word and all this change had occurred simply because he was to be allowed to die out in the open world instead of enjoying the honour of having been the first to depart in conformity with the new theory he and i however spent thus one day longer in sweet friendship and i do not doubt but that when i return to britannula i shall find him living in great comfort at little christchurch  at three oclock we all went into our great townhall to hear what sir ferdinando had to say to us the chamber is a very spacious one fitted up with a large organ and all the arrangements necessary for a musichall but i had never seen a greater crowd than was collected there on this occasion there was not a vacant corner to be found and i heard that very many of the inhabitants went away greatly displeased in that they could not be accommodated sir ferdinando had been very particular in asking the attendance of captain battleax and as many of the ships officers as could be spared this i was told he did in order that something of the éclat of his oration might be taken back to england sir ferdinando was a man who thought much of his own eloquenceand much also of the advantage which he might reap from it in the opinion of his fellowcountrymen generally i found that a place of honour had been reserved for me too at his right hand and also one for my wife at his left i must confess that in these last moments of my sojourn among the people over whom i had ruled i was treated with the most distinguished courtesy but as i continued to say to myself i was to be banished in a few hours as one whose intended cruelties were too abominable to allow of my remaining in my own country on the first seat behind the chair sat captain battleax with four or five of his officers behind him so you have left lieutenant crosstrees in charge of your little toy i whispered to captain battleax  with a glass he replied by which he will be able to see whether you leave the building in that case he will blow us all into atoms  then sir ferdinando rose to his legs and began his speech i had never before heard a specimen of that special oratory to which the epithet flowery may be most appropriately applied it has all the finished polish of england joined to the fervid imagination of ireland it streams on without a pause and without any necessary end but that which the convenience of time may dictate it comes without the slightest effort and it goes without producing any great effect it is sweet at the moment it pleases many and can offend none but it is hardly afterwards much remembered and is efficacious only in smoothing somewhat the rough ways of this harsh world but i have observed that in what i have read of british debates those who have been eloquent after this fashion are generally firm to some purpose of selfinterest sir ferdinando had on this occasion dressed himself with minute care and though he had for the hour before been very sedulous in manipulating certain notes he now was careful to show not a scrap of paper and i must do him the justice to declare that he spun out the words from the reel of his memory as though they all came spontaneous and pat to his tongue  mr neverbend he said ladies and gentlemeni have today for the first time the great pleasure of addressing an intelligent concourse of citizens in britannula i trust that before my acquaintance with this prosperous community may be brought to an end i may have many another opportunity afforded me of addressing you it has been my lot in life to serve my sovereign in various parts of the world and humbly to represent the throne of england in every quarter of the globe but by the admitted testimony of all peoplemy fellowcountrymen at home in england and those who are equally my fellowcountrymen in the colonies to which i have been sentit is acknowledged that in prosperity intelligence and civilisation you are excelled by no englishspeaking section of the world and if by none who speak english who shall then aspire to excel you such as i have learned has been the common verdict given and as i look round this vast room on a spot which fifty years ago the marsupial races had under their own dominion and see the feminine beauty and manly grace which greet me on every side i can well believe that some peculiarly kind freak of nature has been at work and has tended to produce a people as strong as it is beautiful and as clever in its wit as it is graceful in its actions here the speaker paused and the audience all clapped their hands and stamped their feet which seemed to me to be a very improper mode of testifying their assent to their own praises but sir ferdinando took it all in good part and went on with his speech  i have been sent here ladies and gentlemen on a peculiar missionon a duty as to which though i am desirous of explaining it to all of you in every detail i feel a difficulty of saying a single word fixed period was shouted from one of the balconies in a voice which i recognised as that of mr tallowax my friend in the gallery continued sir ferdinando reminds me of the very word for which i should in vain have cudgelled my brain the fixed period is the subject on which i am called upon to say to you a few wordsthe fixed period and the man who has i believe been among you the chief author of that system of livingand if i may be permitted to say so of dying also here the orator allowed his voice to fade away in a melancholy cadence while he turned his face towards me and with a gentle motion laid his right hand upon my shoulder oh my friends it is to say the least of it a startling project uncommon if it was your turn next said tallowax in the gallery yes indeed continued sir ferdinando if it were my turn next i must own that though i should consider myself to be affronted if i were told that i were faintheartedthough i should know myself to be maligned if it were said of me that i have a cowards fear of deathstill i should feel far from comfortable if that age came upon me which this system has defined and were i to live in a country in which it has prevailed though i trust that i may be able to meet death like a brave man when it may come still i should wish that it might come by gods hand and not by the wisdom of a man  i have nothing to say against the wisdom of that man continued he turning to me again i know all the arguments with which he has fortified himself they have travelled even as far as my ears but i venture to use the experience which i have gathered in many countries and to tell him that in accordance with gods purposes the world is not as yet ripe for his wisdom i could not help thinking as he spoke thus that he was not perhaps acquainted with all the arguments on which my system of the fixed period was founded and that if he would do me the honour to listen to a few words which i proposed to speak to the people of britannula before i left them he would have clearer ideas about it than had ever yet entered into his mind oh my friends said he rising to the altitudes of his eloquence it is fitting for us that we should leave these things in the hands of the almighty it is fitting for us at any rate that we should do so till we have been brought by him to a state of godlike knowledge infinitely superior to that which we at present possess here i could perceive that sir ferdinando was revelling in the sounds of his own words and that he had prepared and learnt by heart the tones of his voice and even the motion of his hands we all know that it is not allowed to us to rush into his presence by any deed of our own you all remember what the poet says      or that the everlasting had not fixed     his canon gainst selfslaughter   is not this selfslaughter this theory in accordance with which a man shall devote himself to death at a certain period and if a man may not slay himself how shall he then in the exercise of his poor human wit devote a fellowcreature to certain death and he as well as ever he was in his life said tallowax in the gallery  my friend does well to remind me though mr neverbend has named a fixed period for human life and has perhaps chosen that at which its energies may usually be found to diminish who can say that he has even approached the certainty of that death which the lord sends upon us all at his own period the poor fellow to whom nature has been unkind departs from us decrepit and worn out at forty whereas another at seventy is still hale and strong in performing the daily work of his life  i am strong enough to do amost anything for myself and i was to be the next to gothe very next this in a treble voice came from that poor fellow barnes who had suffered nearly the pangs of death itself from the fixed period  yes indeed in answer to such an appeal as that who shall venture to say that the fixed period shall be carried out with all its startling audacity the tenacity of purpose which distinguishes our friend here is known to us all the fame of his character in that respect had reached my ears even among the thicklipped inhabitants of central africa i own i did wonder whether this could be true justum et tenacem propositi virum nothing can turn him from his purpose or induce him to change his inflexible will you know him and i know him and he is well known throughout england persuasion can never touch him fear has no power over him he as one unit is strong against a million he is invincible imperturbable and ever selfassured  i as i sat there listening to this character of myself heroic somewhat but utterly unlike the person for whom it was intended felt that england knew very little about me and cared less and i could not but be angry that my name should be used in this way to adorn the sentences of sir ferdinandos speech here in gladstonopolis i was well knownand well known to be neither imperturbable nor selfassured but all the people seemed to accept what he said and i could not very well interrupt him he had his opportunity now and i perhaps might have mine byandby  my friends continued sir ferdinando at home in england where though we are powerful by reason of our wealth and numbers just so said i where we are powerful i repeat by reason of our wealth and numbers though perhaps less advanced than you are in the philosophical arrangements of life it has seemed to us to be impossible that the theory should be allowed to be carried to its legitimate end the whole country would be horrified were one life sacrificed to this theory we knew thatwe knew that said the voice of tallowax and yet your assembly had gone so far as to give to the system all the stability of law had not the john bright steamed into your harbour yesterday one of your most valued citizens would have been alreadydeposited when he had so spoken he turned round to mr crasweller who was sitting on my right hand and bowed to him crasweller looked straight before him and took no notice of sir ferdinando he was at the present moment rather on my side of the question and having had his freedom secured to him did not care for sir ferdinando  but that has been prevented thanks to the extraordinary rapidity with which my excellent friend captain battleax has made his way across the ocean and i must say that every one of these excellent fellows his officers has done his best to place hm ship the john bright in her commanding position with the least possible delay here he turned round and bowed to the officers and by keen eyes might have been observed to bow through the windows also to the vessel which lay a mile off in the harbour there will not at any rate for the present be any fixed period for human life in britannula that dream has been dreamedat any rate for the present whether in future ages such a philosophy may prevail who shall say at present we must all await our death from the hands of the almighty sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  and now gentlemen i have to request your attention for a few moments to another matter and one which is very different from this which we have discussed i am to say a few words of the past and the presentof your past constitution and of that which it is my purpose to inaugurate here there arose a murmur through the room very audible and threatening by its sounds to disturb the orator i will ask your favour for a few minutes and when you shall have heard me today i will in my turn hear you tomorrow great britain at your request surrendered to you the power of selfgovernment to so small an englishspeaking community has this never before been granted and i am bound to say that you have in many respects shown yourselves fit for the responsibility imposed upon you you have been intelligent industrious and prudent ignorance has been expelled from your shores and poverty has been forced to hide her diminished head here the orator paused to receive that applause which he conceived to be richly his due but the occupants of the benches before him sat sternly silent there were many there who had been glad to see a ship of war come in to stop the fixed period but hardly one who was pleased to lose his own independence but though that is so said sir ferdinando a little nettled at the want of admiration with which his words had been received hm government is under the necessity of putting an end to the constitution under which the fixed period can be allowed to prevail while you have made laws for yourselves any laws so made must have all the force of law thats not so certain said a voice from a distance which i shrewdly suspect to have been that of my hopeful son jack neverbend as great britain cannot and will not permit the fixed period to be carried out among any englishspeaking race of people  how about the united states said a voice  the united states have made no such attempt but i will proceed it has therefore sent me out to assume the reins and to undertake the power and to bear the responsibility of being your governor during a short term of years who shall say what the future may disclose for the present i shall rule here but i shall rule by the aid of your laws  not the fixed period law said exors who was seated on the floor of the chamber immediately under the orator  no that law will be specially wiped out from your statutebook in other respects your laws and those of great britain are nearly the same there may be divergences as in reference to the noninfliction of capital punishment in such matters i shall endeavour to follow your wishes and so to govern you that you may still feel that you are living under the rule of a president of your own selection here i cannot but think that sir ferdinando was a little rash he did not quite know the extent of my popularity nor had he gauged the dislike which he himself would certainly encounter he had heard a few voices in the hall which under fear of death had expressed their dislike to the fixed period but he had no idea of the love which the people felt for their own independence ori believe i may sayfor their own president there arose in the hall a certain amount of clamour in the midst of which sir ferdinando sat down  then there was a shuffling of feet as of a crowd going away sir ferdinando having sat down got up again and shook me warmly by the hand i returned his greeting with my pleasantest smile and then while the people were moving i spoke to them two or three words i told them that i should start tomorrow at noon for england under a promise made by me to their new governor and that i purposed to explain to them before i went under what circumstances i had given that promise and what it was that i intended to do when i should reach england would they meet me there in that hall at eight oclock that evening and hear the last words which i should have to address to them then the hall was filled with a mighty shout and there arose a great fury of exclamation there was a waving of handkerchiefs and a holding up of hats and all those signs of enthusiasm which are wont to greet the popular man of the hour and in the midst of them sir ferdinando brown stood up upon his legs and continued to bow without cessation  at eight the hall was again full to overflowing i had been busy and came down a little late and found a difficulty in making my way to the chair which sir ferdinando had occupied in the morning i had had no time to prepare my words though the thoughts had rushed quicklytoo quicklyinto my mind it was as though they would tumble out from my own mouth in precipitate energy on my right hand sat the governor as i must now call him and in the chair on my left was placed my wife the officers of the gunboat were not present having occupied themselves no doubt in banking up their fires  my fellowcitizens i said a sudden end has been brought to that selfgovernment of which we have been proud and by which sir ferdinando has told you that ignorance has been expelled from your shores and poverty has been forced to hide her diminished head i trust that under his experience which he tells us as a governor has been very extensive those evils may not now fall upon you we are however painfully aware that they do prevail wherever the concrete power of great britain is found to be in full force a man ruling usus and many other millions of subjectsfrom the other side of the globe cannot see our wants and watch our progress as we can do ourselves and even sir ferdinando coming upon us with all his experience can hardly be able to ascertain how we may be made happy and prosperous he has with him however a company of a celebrated english regiment with its attendant officers who by their red coats and long swords will no doubt add to the cheerfulness of your social gatherings i hope that you may not find that they shall ever interfere with you after a rougher fashion  but upon me my fellowcitizens has fallen the great disgrace of having robbed you of your independence here a murmur ran through the hall declaring that this was not so so your new governor has told you but he has not told you the exact truth with whom the doctrine of the fixed period first originated i will not now inquire all the responsibility i will take upon myself though the honour and glory i must share with my fellowcountrymen  your governor has told you that he is aware of all the arguments by which the fixed period is maintained but i think that he must be mistaken here as he has not ventured to attack one of them he has told us that it is fitting that we should leave the question of life and death in the hands of the almighty if so why is all europe bristling at this moment with armsprepared as we must suppose for shortening lifeand why is there a hangman attached to the throne of great britain as one of its necessary executive officers why in the old testament was joshua commanded to slay mighty kings and why was pharaoh and his hosts drowned in the red sea because the almighty so willed it our governor will say taking it for granted that he willed everything of which a record is given in the old testament in those battles which have ravished the northwest of india during the last halfcentury did the almighty wish that men should perish miserably by ten thousands and twenty thousands till any of us can learn more than we know at present of the will of the almighty i would if he will allow me advise our governor to be silent on that head  ladies and gentlemen it would be a long task and one not to be accomplished before your bedtime were i to recount to you for his advantage a few of the arguments which have been used in favour of the fixed periodand it would be useless as you are all acquainted with them but sir ferdinando is evidently not aware that the general prolongation of life on an average is one of the effects to be gained and that though he himself might not therefore live the longer if doomed to remain here in britannula yet would his descendants do so and would live a life more healthy more useful and more sufficient for human purposes  as far as i can read the will of the almighty or rather the progress of the ways of human nature it is for man to endeavour to improve the conditions of mankind it would be as well to say that we would admit no fires into our establishments because a life had now and again been lost by fire as to use such an argument as that now put forward against the fixed period if you will think of the line of reasoning used by sir ferdinando you will remember that he has after all only thrown you back upon the old prejudices of mankind if he will tell me that he is not as yet prepared to discard them and that i am in error in thinking that the world is so prepared i may perhaps agree with him the john bright in our harbour is the strongest possible proof that such prejudices still exist sir ferdinando brown is now your governor a fact which in itself is strong evidence in opposition to these witnesses i have nothing to say the ignorance which we are told that we had expelled from our shores has come back to us and the poverty is about i fear to show its head sir ferdinando here arose and expostulated but the people hardly heard him and at my request he again sat down  i do think that i have endeavoured in this matter to advance too quickly and that sir ferdinando has been sent here as the necessary reprimand for that folly he has required that i shall be banished to england and as his order is backed by a double file of redcoatsan instrument which in britannula we do not possessi purpose to obey him i shall go to england and i shall there use what little strength remains to me in my endeavour to put forward those arguments for conquering the prejudices of the people which have prevailed here but which i am very sure would have no effect upon sir ferdinando brown  i cannot but think that sir ferdinando gave himself unnecessary trouble in endeavouring to prove to us that the fixed period is a wicked arrangement he was not likely to succeed in that attempt but he was sure to succeed in telling us that he would make it impossible by means of the double file of armed men by whom he is accompanied and the 250ton steamswiveller with which as he informed me he is able to blow us all into atoms unless i would be ready to start with captain battleax tomorrow it is not his religion but his strength that has prevailed that great britain is much stronger than britannula none of us can doubt till yesterday i did doubt whether she would use her strength to perpetuate her own prejudices and to put down the progress made by another people  but fellowcitizens we must look the truth in the face in this generation probably the fixed period must be allowed to be in abeyance when i had uttered these words there came much cheering and a loud sound of triumph which was indorsed probably by the postponement of the system which had its terrors but i was enabled to accept these friendly noises as having been awarded to the system itself well as you all love the fixed period it must be delayed till sir ferdinando and the english havebeen converted  never never shouted sir ferdinando so godless an idea shall never find a harbour in this bosom and he struck his chest violently  sir ferdinando is probably not aware to what ideas that bosom may some day give a shelter if he will look back thirty years he will find that he had hardly contemplated even the weatherwatch which he now wears constantly in his waistcoatpocket at the command of his sovereign he may still live to carry out the fixed period somewhere in the centre of africa  never  in what college among the negroes he may be deposited it may be too curious to inquire i my friends shall leave these shores tomorrow and you may be sure of this that while the power of labour remains to me i shall never desist to work for the purpose that i have at heart i trust that i may yet live to return among you and to render you an account of what i have done for you and for the cause in europe here i sat down and was greeted by the deafening applause of the audience and i did feel at the moment that i had somewhat got the better of sir ferdinando  i have been able to give the exact words of these two speeches as they were both taken down by the reporting telephoneapparatus which on the occasion was found to work with great accuracy the words as they fell from the mouth of the speakers were composed by machinery and my speech appeared in the london morning newspapers within an hour of the time of its utterance     chapter xi  farewell   i went home to my house in triumph but i had much to do before noon on the following day but very little time in which to do it i had spent the morning of that day in preparing for my departure and in so arranging matters with my clerks that the entrance of sir ferdinando on his new duties might be easy i had said nothing and had endeavoured to think as little as possible of the fixed period an old secretary of mineold in years of work though not as yet in agehad endeavoured to comfort me by saying that the college up the hill might still be used before long but i had told him frankly that we in britannula had all been too much in a hurry and had foolishly endeavoured to carry out a system in opposition to the worlds prejudices which system when successful must pervade the entire world and is nothing to be done with those beautiful buildings said the secretary putting in the word beautiful by way of flattery to myself the chimneys and the furnaces may perhaps be used i replied cremation is no part of the fixed period but as for the residences the less we think about them the better and so i determined to trouble my thoughts no further with the college and i felt that there might be some consolation to me in going away to england so that i might escape from the great vexation and eyesore which the empty college would have produced  but i had to bid farewell to my wife and my son and to eva and crasweller the first task would be the easier because there would be no necessity for any painful allusion to my own want of success in what little i might say to mrs neverbend on the subject i could continue that tone of sarcastic triumph in which i had replied to sir ferdinando what was pathetic in the matter i might altogether ignore and jack was himself so happy in his nature and so little likely to look at anything on its sorrowful side that all would surely go well with him but with eva and with evas father things would be different words must be spoken which would be painful in the speaking and regrets must be uttered by me which could not certainly be shared by him i am broken down and trampled upon and all the glory is departed from my name and i have become a byword and a reproach rather than a term of honour in which future ages may rejoice because i have been unable to carry out my longcherished purpose bydepositing you and insuring at least your departure and then crasweller would answer me with his general kindly feeling and i should feel at the moment of my leaving him the hollowness of his words i had loved him the better because i had endeavoured to commence my experiment on his body i had felt a vicarious regard for the honour which would have been done him almost regarding it as though i myself were to go in his place all this had received a check when he in his weakness had pleaded for another year but he had yielded and though he had yielded without fortitude he had done so to comply with my wishes and i could not but feel for the man an extraordinary affection i was going to england and might probably never see him again and i was going with aspirations in my heart so very different from those which he entertained  from the hours intended for slumber a few minutes could be taken for saying adieu to my wife my dear said i this is all very sudden but a man engaged in public life has to fit himself to the public demands had i not promised to go today i might have been taken away yesterday or the day before  oh john said she i think that everything has been put up to make you comfortable  thanks yes im sure of it when you hear my name mentioned after i am gone i hope that theyll say of me that i did my duty as president of the republic  of course they will every day you have been at these nasty executive chambers from nine till five unless when youve been sitting in that wretched assembly  i shall have a holiday now at any rate said i laughing gently under the bedclothes  yes and i am sure it will do you good if you only take your meals regular i sometimes think that you have been encouraged to dwell upon this horrid fixed period by the melancholy of an empty stomach  it was sad to hear such words from her lips after the two speeches to which she had listened and to feel that no trace had been left on her mind of the triumph which i had achieved over sir ferdinando but i put up with that and determined to answer her after her own heart you have always provided a sandwich for me to take to the chambers  sandwiches are nothing do remember that at your time of life you should always have something warma frizzle or a cutlet and you shouldnt eat it without thinking of it what has made me hate the fixed period worse than anything is that you have never thought of your victuals you gave more attention to the burning of these pigs than to the cooking of any food in your own kitchen  well my dear im going to england now said i beginning to feel weary of her reminiscences  yes my dear i know you are and do remember that as you get nearer and nearer to that chilly country the weather will always be colder and colder i have put you up four pairs of flannel drawers and a little bag which you must wear upon your chest i observed that sir ferdinando when he was preparing himself for his speech showed that he had just such a little bag on and all the time i endeavoured to spy how it was that he wore it when i came home i immediately went to work and i shall insist on your putting it on the first thing in the morning in order that i may see that it sits flat sir ferdinandos did not sit flat and it looked bulgy i thought to myself that lady brown did not do her duty properly by him if you would allow me to come with you i could see that you always put it on rightly as it is i know that people will say that it is all my fault when it hangs out and shows itself then i went to sleep and the parting words between me and my wife had been spoken  early on the following morning i had jack into my dressingroom and said goodbye to him jack said i in this little contest which there has been between us you have got the better in everything  nobody thought so when they heard your answer to sir ferdinando last night  well yes i think i managed to answer him but i havent got the better of you  i didnt mean anything said jack in a melancholy tone of voice it was all evas doing i never cared twopence whether the old fellows were deposited or not but i do think that if your own time had come near i shouldnt have liked it much  why not why not if you will only think of the matter all round you will find that it is all a false sentiment  i should not like it said jack with determination  yes you would after you had got used to it here he looked very incredulous what i mean is jack that when sons were accustomed to see their fathers deposited at a certain age and were aware that they were treated with every respect that kind of feeling which you describe would wear off you would have the idea that a kind of honour was done to your parents  when i knew that somebody was going to kill him on the next day how would it be then  you might retire for a few hours to your thoughtsgoing into mourning as it were jack shook his head but at any rate in this matter of mr crasweller you have got the better of me  that was for evas sake  i suppose so but i wish to make you understand now that i am going to england and may possibly never return to these shores again  dont say that father  well yes i shall have much to do there and of course it may be that i shall not come back and i wish you to understand that i do not part from you in the least in anger what you have done shows a high spirit and great devotion to the girl  it was not quite altogether for eva either  what then i demanded  well i dont know the two things went together as it were if there had been no question about the fixed period i do think i could have cut out abraham grundle and as for sir kennington oval i am beginning to believe that that was all evas pretence i like sir kennington but eva never cared a button for him she had taken to me because i had shown myself an antifixedperiod man i did it at first simply because i hated grundle grundle wanted to fixperiod old crasweller for the sake of the property and therefore i belonged naturally to the other side it wasnt that i liked opposing you if it had been tallowax that you were to begin with or exors you might have burnt em up without a word from me  i am gratified at hearing that  though the fixed period does seem to be horrible i would have swallowed all that at your bidding but you can see how i tumbled into it and how eva egged me on and how the nearer the thing came the more i was bound to fight will you believe iteva swore a most solemn oath that if her father was put into that college she would never marry a human being and up to that moment when the lieutenant met us at the top of the hill she was always as cold as snow  and now the snow is melted  yesthat is to say it is beginning to thaw as he said this i remembered the kiss behind the parlourdoor which had been given to her by another suitor before these troubles began and my impression that jack had seen it also but on that subject i said nothing of course it has all been very happy for me jack continued but i wish to say to you before you go how unhappy it makes me to think that i have opposed you  all right jack all right i will not say that i should not have done the same at your age if eva had asked me i wish you always to remember that we parted as friends it will not be long before you are married now  three months said jack in a melancholy tone  in an affair of importance of this kind that is the same as tomorrow i shall not be here to wish you joy at your wedding  why are you to go if you dont wish it  i promised that i would go when captain battleax talked of carrying me off the day before yesterday with a hundred soldiers no doubt he could get me on board  there are a great many more than a hundred men in britannula as good as their soldiers to take a man away by force and he the president of the republic such a thing was never heard of i would not stir if i were you say the word to me and i will undertake that not one of these men shall touch you  i thought of his proposition and the more i thought of it the more unreasonable it did appear that i who had committed no offence against any law should be forced on board the john bright and i had no doubt that jack would be as good as his word but there were two causes which persuaded me that i had better go i had pledged my word when it had been suggested that i should at the moment be carried on boardwhich might no doubt then have been done by the soldiersi had said that if a certain time were allowed me i would again be found in the same place if i were simply there and were surrounded by a crowd of britannulans ready to fight for me i should hardly have kept my promise but a stronger reason than this perhaps actuated me it would be better for me for a while to be in england than in britannula here in britannula i should be the expresident of an abolished republic and as such subject to the notice of all men whereas in england i should be nobody and should escape the constant mortification of seeing sir ferdinando brown and then in england i could do more for the fixed period than at home in britannula here the battle was over and i had been beaten i began to perceive that the place was too small for making the primary efforts in so great a cause the very facility which had existed for the passing of the law through the assembly had made it impossible for us to carry out the law and therefore with the sense of failure strong upon me i should be better elsewhere than at home and the desire of publishing a book in which i should declare my theorythis very book which i have so nearly brought to a closemade me desire to go what could i do by publishing anything in britannula and though the manuscript might have been sent home who would see it through the press with any chance of success now i have my hopes which i own seem high and i shall be able to watch from day to day the way in which my arguments in favour of the fixed period are received by the british public therefore it was that i rejected jacks kind offer no my boy said i after a pause i do not know but that on the whole i shall prefer to go  of course if you wish it  i shall be taken there at the expense of the british public which is in itself a triumph and shall i presume be sent back in the same way if not i shall have a grievance in their parsimony which in itself will be a comfort to me and i am sure that i shall be treated well on board sir ferdinando with his eloquence will not be there and the officers are all of them good fellows i have made up my mind and i will go the next that you will hear of your father will be the publication of a little book that i shall write on the journey advocating the fixed period the matter has never been explained to them in england and perhaps my words may prevail jack by shaking his head mournfully seemed to indicate his idea that this would not be the case but jack is resolute and will never yield on any point had he been in my place and had entertained my convictions i believe that he would have deposited crasweller in spite of sir ferdinando brown and captain battleax you will come and see me on board jack when i start  they wont take me off will they  i should have thought you would have liked to have seen england  and leave eva theyd have to look very sharp before they could do that but of course ill come then i gave him my blessing told him what arrangements i had made for his income and went down to my breakfast which was to be my last meal in britannula  when that was over i was told that eva was in my study waiting to see me i had intended to have gone out to little christchurch and should still do so to bid farewell to her father but i was not sorry to have eva here in my own house as she was about to become my daughterinlaw eva has come to bid you goodbye said jack who was already in the room as i entered it  eva my dear said i  ill leave you said jack but ive told her that she must be very fond of you bygones have to be bygonesparticularly as no harm has been done then he left the room  she still had on the little round hat but as jack went she laid it aside oh mr neverbend she said i hope you do not think that i have been unkind  it is i my dear who should express that hope  i have always known how well you have loved my dear father i have been quite sure of it and he has always said so but  well eva it is all over now  oh yes and i am so happy i have got to tell you how happy i am  i hope you love jack  oh she exclaimed and in a moment she was in my arms and i was kissing her if you knew how i hate that mr grundle and jack is allall that he ought to be one of the things that makes me like him best is his great affection for you there is nothing that he would not do for you  he is a very good young man said i thinking of the manner in which he had spoken against me on the town flags  nothing said eva  and nothing that he would not do for you my dear but that is all as it should be he is a highspirited good boy and if he will think a little more of the business and a little less of cricket he will make an excellent husband  of course he had to think a little of the match when the englishmen were here and he did play well did he not he beat them all there i could perceive that eva was quite as intent upon cricket as was her lover and probably thought just as little about the business but mr neverbend must you really go  i think so it is not only that they are determined to take me but that i am myself anxious to be in england  you wish toto preach the fixed period  well my dear i have got my own notions which at my time of life i cannot lay aside i shall endeavour to ventilate them in england and see what the people there may say about them  you are not angry with me  my child how could i be angry with you what you did you did for your fathers sake  and papa you will not be angry with papa because he didnt want to give up little christchurch and to leave the pretty place which he has made himself and to go into the collegeand be killed  i could not quite answer her at the moment because in truth i was somewhat angry with him i thought that he should have understood that there was something higher to be achieved than an extra year or two among the prettinesses of little christchurch i could not but be grieved because he had proved himself to be less of a man than i had expected but as i remained silent for a few moments eva held my hand in hers and looked up into my face with beseeching eyes then my anger went and i remembered that i had no reason to expect heroism from crasweller simply because he had been my friend no dear no all feeling of anger is at an end it was natural that he should wish to remain at little christchurch and it was better than natural it was beautiful that you should wish to save him by the use of the only feminine weapon at your command  oh but i did love jack she said  i have still an hour or two before i depart and i shall run down to little christchurch to take your father by the hand once more you may be sure that what i shall say to him will not be illnatured and now goodbye my darling child my time here in britannula is but short and i cannot give up more of it even to my chosen daughter then again she kissed me and putting on her little hat went away to mrs neverbendor to jack  it was now nearly ten oclock and i had out my tricycle in order to go down as quickly as possible to little christchurch at the door of my house i found a dozen of the english soldiers with a sergeant he touched his hat and asked me very civilly where i was going when i told him that it was but five or six miles out of town he requested my permission to accompany me i told him that he certainly might if he had a vehicle ready and was ready to use it but as at that moment my luggage was brought out of the house with the view of being taken on board ship the man thought that it would be as well and much easier to follow the luggage and the twelve soldiers marched off to see my portmanteaus put safely on board the john bright  and i was againand i could not but say to myself probably for the last timeonce again on the road to little christchurch during the twenty minutes which were taken in going down there i could not but think of the walks i had had up and down with crasweller in old times talking as we went of the glories of a fixed period and of the absolute need which the human race had for such a step in civilisation probably on such occasions the majority of the words spoken had come from my own mouth but it had seemed to me then that crasweller had been as energetic as myself the period which we had then contemplated at a distance had come round and crasweller had seceded wofully i could not but feel that had he been stanch to me and allowed himself to be deposited not only willingly but joyfully he would have set an example which could not but have been efficacious barnes and tallowax would probably have followed as a matter of course and the thing would have been done my name would have gone down to posterity with those of columbus and galileo and britannula would have been noted as the most prominent among the nations of the earth instead of having become a byword among countries as a deprived republic and reannexed crown colony but all that on the present occasion had to be forgotten and i was to greet my old friend with true affection as though i had received from his hands no such ruthless ruin of all my hopes  oh mr president he said as he met me coming up the drive towards the house this is kind of you and you who must be so busy just before your departure  i could not go without a word of farewell to you i had not spoken with him since we had parted on the top of the hill on our way out to the college when the horses had been taken from the carriage and he had walked back to life and little christchurch instead of making his way to his last home and to find deposition with all the glory of a great name  it is very kind of you come in eva is not at home  i have just parted with her at my own house so she and jack are to make a match of it i need not tell you how more than contented i shall be that my son should have such a wife eva to me has been always dear almost as a daughter now she is like my own child  i am sure that i can say the same of jack  yes jack is a good lad too i hope he will stick to the business  he need not trouble himself about that he will have little christchurch and all that belongs to it as soon as i am gone i had made up my mind only to allow eva an income out of it while she was thinking of that fellow grundle that man is a knave  i could not but remember that grundle had been a fixedperiodist and that it would not become me to abuse him and i was aware that though crasweller was my sincere friend he had come to entertain of late an absolute hatred of all those beyond myself who had advocated his own deposition  jack at any rate is happy said i and eva you and i crasweller have had our little troubles to imbitter the evenings of our life  you are yet in the full daylight  my ambition has been disappointed i cannot conceal the fact from myselfnor from you it has come to pass that during the last year or two we have lived with different hopes and these hopes have been founded altogether on the position which you might occupy  i should have gone mad up in that college neverbend  i would have been with you  i should have gone mad all the same i should have committed suicide  to save yourself from an honourabledeposition  the fixed day coming at a certain known hour the feeling that it must come though it came at the same time so slowly and yet so fast every day growing shorter day by day and every season month by month the sight of these chimneys  that was a mistake crasweller that was a mistake the cremation should have been elsewhere  a man should have been an angel to endure itor so much less than a man i struggledfor your sake who else would have struggled as i did to oblige a friend in such a matter  i know iti know it  but life under such a weight became impossible to me you do not know what i endured even for the last year believe me that man is not so constituted as to be able to make such efforts  he would get used to it mankind would get used to it  the first man will never get used to it that college will become a madhouse you must think of some other mode of letting them pass their last year make them drunk so that they shall not know what they are doing drug them and make them senseless or better still come down upon them with absolute power and carry them away to instant death let the veil of annihilation fall upon them before they know where they are the fixed period with all its damnable certainty is a mistake i have tried it and i know it when i look back at the last year which was to be the last not of my absolute life but of my true existence i shudder as i think what i went through i am astonished at the strength of my own mind in that i did not go mad no one would have made such an effort for you as i made those other men had determined to rebel since the feeling of the fixed period came near to them it is impossible that human nature should endure such a struggle and not rebel i have been saved now by these englishmen who have come here in their horror and have used their strength to prevent the barbarity of your benevolence but i can hardly keep myself quiet as i think of the sufferings which i have endured during the last month  but crasweller you had assented  true i did assent but it was before the feeling of my fate had come near to me you may be strong enough to bear it there is nothing so hard but that enthusiasm will make it tolerable but you will hardly find another who will not succumb who would do more for you than i have done who would make a greater struggle what honester man is there whom you know in this community of ours and yet even me you drove to be a liar think how strong must have been the facts against you when they have had this effect to have died at your behest at the instant would have been as nothing any dangerany immediate certaintywould have been childsplay but to have gone up into that frightful college and there to have remained through that year which would have wasted itself so slowly and yet so fastthat would have required a heroism which as i think no greek no roman no englishman ever possessed  then he paused and i was aware that i had overstayed my time think of it he continued think of it on board that vessel and try to bring home to yourself what such a phase of living would mean then he grasped me by the hand and taking me out put me upon my tricycle and returned into the house  as i went back to gladstonopolis i did think of it and for a moment or two my mind wavered he had convinced me that there was something wrong in the details of my system but notwhen i came to argue the matter with myselfthat the system itself was at fault but now at the present moment i had hardly time for meditation i had been surprised at craswellers earnestness and also at his eloquence and i was in truth more full of his words than of his reasons but the time would soon come when i should be able to devote tranquil hours to the consideration of the points which he had raised the long hours of enforced idleness on board ship would suffice to enable me to sift his objections which seemed at the spur of the moment to resolve themselves into the impatience necessary to a years quiescence crasweller had declared that human nature could not endure it was it not the case that human nature had never endeavoured to train itself as i got back to gladstonopolis i had already a glimmering of an idea that we must begin with human nature somewhat earlier and teach men from their very infancy to prepare themselves for the undoubted blessings of the fixed period but certain aids must be given and the cremating furnace must be removed so as to be seen by no eye and smelt by no nose  as i rode up to my house there was that eternal guard of soldiersa dozen men with abominable guns and ungainly military hats or helmets on their heads i was so angered by their watchfulness that i was half minded to turn my tricycle and allow them to pursue me about the island they could never have caught me had i chosen to avoid them but such an escape would have been below my dignity and moreover i certainly did wish to go i therefore took no notice of them when they shouldered their arms but went into the house to give my wife her last kiss now neverbend remember you wear the flannel drawers i put up for you as soon as ever you get out of the opposite tropics remember it becomes frightfully cold almost at once and whatever you do dont forget the little bag these were mrs neverbends last words to me i there found jack waiting for me and we together walked down to the quay mother would like to have gone too said jack  it would not have suited there are so many things here that will want her eye  all the same she would like to have gone i had felt that it was so but yet she had never pressed her request  on board i found sir ferdinando and all the ships officers with him in full dress he had come as i supposed to see that i really went but he assured me taking off his hat as he addressed me that his object had been to pay his last respects to the late president of the republic nothing could now be more courteous than his conduct or less like the bully that he had appeared to be when he had first claimed to represent the british sovereign in britannula and i must confess that there was absent all that tone of domineering ascendancy which had marked his speech as to the fixed period the fixed period was not again mentioned while he was on board but he devoted himself to assuring me that i should be received in england with every distinction and that i should certainly be invited to windsor castle i did not myself care very much about windsor castle but to such civil speeches i could do no other than make civil replies and there i stood for half an hour grimacing and paying compliments anxious for the moment when sir ferdinando would get into the sixoared gig which was waiting for him and return to the shore to me it was of all halfhours the weariest but to him it seemed as though to grimace and to pay compliments were his second nature at last the moment came when one of the junior officers came up to captain battleax and told him that the vessel was ready to start now sir ferdinando said the captain i am afraid that the john bright must leave you to the kindness of the britannulists  i could not be left in more generous hands said sir ferdinando nor in those of warmer friends the britannulists speak english as well as i do and will i am sure admit that we boast of a common country  but not a common government said i determined to fire a parting shot but sir ferdinando is quite right in expecting that he personally will receive every courtesy from the britannulists nor will his rule be in any respect disobeyed until the island shall with the agreement of england again have resumed its own republican position here i bowed and he bowed and we all bowed then he departed taking jack with him leaning on whose arm he stepped down into the boat and as the men put their oars into the water i jumped with a sudden start at the sudden explosion of a subsidiary cannon which went on firing some dozens of times till the proper number had been completed supposed to be due to an officer of such magnitude     chapter xii  our voyage to england   the boat had gone ashore and returned before the john bright had steamed out of the harbour then everything seemed to change and captain battleax bade me make myself quite at home he trusted he said that i should always dine with him during the voyage but that i should be left undisturbed during all other periods of the day he dined at seven oclock but i could give my own orders as to breakfast and tiffin he was sure that lieutenant crosstrees would have pleasure in showing me my cabins and that if there was anything on board which i did not feel to be comfortable it should be at once altered lieutenant crosstrees would tell my servant to wait upon me and would show me all the comfortsand discomfortsof the vessel with that i left him and was taken below under the guidance of the lieutenant as mr crosstrees became my personal friend during the voyagemore peculiarly than any of the other officers all of whom were my friendsi will give some short description of him he was a young man perhaps eightandtwenty years old whose great gift in the eyes of all those on board was his personal courage stories were told to me by the junior officers of marvellous things which he had done which though never mentioned in his own presence either by himself or by others seemed to constitute for him a special characterso that had it been necessary that any one should jump overboard to attack a shark all on board would have thought that the duty as a matter of course belonged to lieutenant crosstrees indeed as i learnt afterwards he had quite a peculiar name in the british navy he was a small fairhaired man with a pallid face and a bright eye whose idiosyncrasy it was to conceive that life afloat was infinitely superior in all its attributes to life on shore if there ever was a man entirely devoted to his profession it was lieutenant crosstrees for women he seemed to care nothing nor for bishops nor for judges nor for members of parliament they were all as children skipping about the world in their foolish playful ignorance whom it was the sailors duty to protect next to the sailor came the soldier as having some kindred employment but at a very long interval among sailors the british sailorthat is the british fighting sailorwas the only one really worthy of honour and among british sailors the officers on board hm gunboat the john bright were the happy few who had climbed to the top of the tree captain battleax he regarded as the sultan of the world but he was the sultans vizier and having the discipline of the ship altogether in his own hands was to my thinking its very master i should have said beforehand that a man of such sentiments and feelings was not at all to my taste everything that he loved i have always hated and all that he despised i have revered nevertheless i became very fond of him and found in him an opponent to the fixed period that has done more to shake my opinion than crasweller with all his feelings or sir ferdinando with all his arguments and this he effected by a few curt words which i have found almost impossible to resist come this way mr president he said here is where you are to sleep and considering that it is only a ship i think youll find it fairly comfortable anything more luxurious than the place assigned to me i could not have imagined on board ship i afterwards learned that the cabins had been designed for the use of a travelling admiral and i gathered from the fact that they were allotted to me an idea that england intended to atone for the injury done to the country by personal respect shown to the late president of the republic  i at any rate shall be comfortable while i am here that in itself is something nevertheless i have to feel that i am a prisoner  not more so than anybody else on board said the lieutenant  a guard of soldiers came up this morning to look after me what would that guard of soldiers have done supposing that i had run away  we should have had to wait till they had caught you but nobody conceived that to be possible the president of a republic never runs away in his own person there will be a cup of tea in the officers messroom at five oclock i will leave you till then as you may wish to employ yourself i went up immediately afterwards on deck and looking back over the tafferel could only just see the glittering spires of gladstonopolis in the distance  now was the time for thought i found an easy seat on the stern of the vessel and sat myself down to consider all that crasweller had said to me he and i had partedperhaps for ever i had not been in england since i was a little child and i could not but feel now that i might be detained there by circumstances or die there or that crasweller who was ten years my senior might be dead before i should have come back and yet no ordinary farewell had been spoken between us in those last words of his he had confined himself to the fixed period so full had his heart been of the subject and so intent had he felt himself to be on convincing me and what was the upshot of what he had said not that the doctrine of the fixed period was in itself wrong but that it was impracticable because of the horrors attending its last moments these were the solitude in which should be passed the one last year the sight of things which would remind the old man of coming death and the general feeling that the business and pleasures of life were over and that the stillness of the grave had been commenced to this was to be added a certainty that death would come on some prearranged day these all referred manifestly to the condition of him who was to go and in no degree affected the welfare of those who were to remain he had not attempted to say that for the benefit of the world at large the system was a bad system that these evils would have befallen crasweller himself there could be no doubt though a dozen companions might have visited him daily he would have felt the college to be a solitude because he would not have been allowed to choose his promiscuous comrades as in the outer world but custom would no doubt produce a cure for that evil when a man knew that it was to be so the dozen visitors would suffice for him the young man of thirty travels over all the world but the old man of seventy is contented with the comparative confinement of his own town or perhaps of his own house as to the ghastliness of things to be seen they could no doubt be removed out of sight but even that would be cured by custom the business and pleasures of life at the prescribed time were in general but a pretence at business and a reminiscence of pleasure the man would know that the fated day was coming and would prepare for it with infinitely less of the anxious pain of uncertainty than in the outer world the fact that death must come at the settled day would no doubt have its horror as long as the man were able habitually to contrast his position with that of the few favoured ones who had within his own memory lived happily to a more advanced age but when the time should come that no such old man had so existed i could not but think that a frame of mind would be created not indisposed to contentment sitting there and turning it all over in my mind while my eyes rested on the bright expanse of the glassclear sea i did perceive that the fixed period with all its advantages was of such a nature that it must necessarily be postponed to an age prepared for it craswellers eloquence had had that effect upon me i did see that it would be impossible to induce in the present generation a feeling of satisfaction in the system i should have declared that it would not commence but with those who were at present unborn or indeed to allay the natural fears of mothers not with those who should be born for the next dozen years it might have been well to postpone it for another century i admitted so much to myself with the full understanding that a theory delayed so long must be endangered by its own postponement how was i to answer for the zeal of those who were to come so long after me i sometimes thought of a more immediate date in which i myself might be the first to be deposited and that i might thus be allowed to set an example of a happy final year passed within the college but then how far would the tallowaxes and barneses and exors of the day be led by my example  i must on my arrival in england remodel altogether the fixed period and name a day so far removed that even jacks children would not be able to see it it was with sad grief of heart that i so determined all my dreams of a personal ambition were at once shivered to the ground nothing would remain of me but the name of the man who had caused the republic of britannula to be destroyed and her government to be resumed by her old mistress i must go to work and with pen ink and paper with long written arguments and studied logic endeavour to prove to mankind that the world should not allow itself to endure the indignities and weakness and selfish misery of extreme old age i confess that my belief in the efficacy of spoken words of words running like an electric spark from the lips of the speaker right into the heart of him who heard them was stronger far than my trust in written arguments they must lack a warmth which the others possess and they enter only on the minds of the studious whereas the others touch the feelings of the world at large i had already overcome in the breasts of many listeners the difficulties which i now myself experienced i would again attempt to do so with a british audience i would again enlarge on the meanness of the man who could not make so small a sacrifice of his latter years for the benefit of the rising generation but even spoken words would come cold to me and would fall unnoticed on the hearts of others when it was felt that the doctrine advocated could not possibly affect any living man thinking of all this i was very melancholy when i was summoned down to tea by one of the stewards who attended the officers mess  mr president will you take tea coffee cocoa chocolate or preserved dates there are muffins and crumpets dry toast buttered toast plumcake seedcake peachfritters applemarmalade and bread and butter there are putup fruits of all kinds of which you really wouldnt know that they hadnt come this moment from graperies and orchardhouses but we dont put them on the table because we think that we cant eat quite so much dinner after them this was the invitation which came from a young naval lad who seemed to be about fifteen years old  hold your tongue percy said an elder officer the fruits are not here because lord alfred gorged himself so tremendously that we were afraid his mother the duchess would withdraw him from the service when she heard that he had made himself sick  there are curaçoa chartreuse pepperwick mangostino and russian brandy on the sideboard suggested a third  i shall have a glass of madeirajust a thimbleful said another who seemed to be a few years older than lord alfred percy then one of the stewards brought the madeira which the young man drank with great satisfaction this wine has been seven times round the world he said and the only time for drinking it is fiveoclock teathat is if you understand what good living means i asked simply for a cup of tea which i found to be peculiarly good partly because of the cream which accompanied it i then went upstairs to take a constitutional walk with mr crosstrees on the deck i saw you sitting there for a couple of hours very thoughtful said he and i wouldnt disturb you i hope it doesnt make you unhappy that you are carried away to england  had it done so i dont know whether i should have gonealive  they said that when it was suggested you promised to be ready in two days  i did say sobecause it suited me but i can hardly imagine that they would have carried me on board with violence or that they would have put all gladstonopolis to the sword because i declined to go on board  brown had told us that we were to bring you off dead or alive and dead or alive i think we should have had you if the soldiers had not succeeded the sailors would have taken you in hand when i asked him why there was this great necessity for kidnapping me he assured me that feeling in england had run very high on the matter and that sundry bishops had declared that anything so barbarous could not be permitted in the twentieth century it would be as bad they said as the cannibals of new zealand  that shows the absolute ignorance of the bishops on the subject  i daresay but there is a prejudice about killing an old man or a woman young men dont matter  allow me to assure you mr crosstrees said i that your sentiment is carrying you far away from reason to the state the life of a woman should be just the same as that of a man the state cannot allow itself to indulge in romance  you get a sailor and tell him to strike a woman and see what hell say  the sailor is irrational of course we are supposing that it is for the public benefit that the woman should be struck it is the same with an old man the good of the commonwealthand his ownrequires that beyond a certain age he shall not be allowed to exist he does not work and he cannot enjoy living he wastes more than his share of the necessaries of life and becomes on the aggregate an intolerable burden read shakespeares description of man in his last stage      second childishness and mere oblivion     sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything   and the stage before is merely that of the lean and slippered pantaloon for his own sake would you not save mankind from having to encounter such miseries as these  you cant do it mr president  i very nearly did do it the britannulist assembly in the majesty of its wisdom passed a law to that effect i was sorry afterwards that i had spoken of the majesty of the assemblys wisdom because it savoured of buncombe our assemblys wisdom was not particularly majestic but i had intended to allude to the presumed majesty attached to the highest council in the state  your assembly in the majesty of its wisdom could do nothing of the kind it might pass a law but the law could be carried out only by men the parliament in england which is i take it quite as majestic as the assembly in britannula  i apologise for the word mr crosstrees which savours of the ridiculous i did not quite explain my idea at the moment  it is forgotten he said and i must acknowledge that he never used the word against me again the parliament in england might order a threemonthsold baby to be slain but could not possibly get the deed done  not if it were for the welfare of great britain  not to save great britain from destruction strength is very strong but it is not half so powerful as weakness i could with the greatest alacrity in the world fire that big gun in among battalions of armed men so as to scatter them all to the winds but i could not point it in the direction of a single girl we went on discussing the matter at considerable length and his convictions were quite as strong as mine he was sure that under no circumstances would an old man ever be deprived of his life under the fixed period i was as confident as he on the other sideor at any rate pretended to be soand told him that he made no allowance for the progressive wisdom of mankind but we parted as friends and soon after went to dinner  i was astonished to find how very little the captain had to do with his officers on board ship he lived nearly alone having his first lieutenant with him for a quarter of an hour every morning on the occasion of this my first day on board he had a dinnerparty in honour of my coming among them and two or three days before we reached england he had another i dined with him regularly every day except twice when i was invited to the officers mess i breakfasted alone in my own cabin where everything was provided for me that i could desire and always lunched and took fiveoclock tea with the officers i remained alone till one oclock and spent four hours every morning during our entire journey in composing this volume as it is now printed i have put it into the shape of a story because i think that i may so best depict the feelings of the people around me as i made my great endeavour to carry out the fixed period in britannula and because i may so describe the kind of opposition which was shown by the expression of those sentiments on which lieutenant crosstrees depended i do not at this minute doubt but that crasweller would have been deposited had not the john bright appeared whether barnes and tallowax would have followed peaceably may be doubted they however are not men of great weight in britannula and the officers of the law might possibly have constrained them to have followed the example which crasweller had set but i do confess that i doubt whether i should have been able to proceed to carry out the arrangements for the final departure of crasweller looking forward i could see eva kneeling at my feet and could acknowledge the invincible strength of that weakness to which crosstrees had alluded a godlike heroism would have been demandeda heroism which must have submitted to have been called brutaland of such i knew myself not to be the owner had the british parliament ordered the threemonthsold baby to be slaughtered i was not the man to slaughter it even though i were the sworn servant of the british parliament upon the whole i was glad that the john bright had come into our waters and had taken me away on its return to england it was a way out of my immediate trouble against which i was able to expostulate and to show with some truth on my side that i was an injured man all this i am willing to admit in the form of a tale which i have adopted for my present work and for which i may hope to obtain some popularity in england once on shore there i shall go to work on a volume of altogether a different nature and endeavour to be argumentative and statistical as i have here been fanciful though true to details  during the whole course of my journey to england captain battleax never said a word to me about the fixed period he was no doubt a gallant officer and possessed of all necessary gifts for the management of a 250ton steam swivelgun but he seemed to me to be somewhat heavy he never even in conversation alluded to britannula and spoke always of the dockyard at devonport as though i had been familiar with its every corner he was very particular about his clothes and i was told by lieutenant crosstrees on the first day that he would resent it as a bitter offence had i come down to dinner without a white cravat hes right you know those things do tell crosstrees had said to me when i had attempted to be jocose about these punctilios i took care however always to put on a white cravat both with the captain and with the officers after dinner with the captain a cup of coffee was always brought in on a silver tray in a silver coffeepot this was leisurely consumed and then as i soon understood the captain expected that i should depart i learnt afterwards that he immediately put his feet up on the sofa and slept for the remainder of the evening i retired to the lieutenants cabin and there discussed the whole history of britannula over many a prolonged cigar  did you really mean to kill the old men said lord alfred percy to me one day regularly to cut their throats you know and carry them out and burn them  i did not mean it but the law did  every poor old fellow would have been put an end to without the slightest mercy  not without mercy i rejoined  now theres my governors father said lord alfred you know who he is  the duke of northumberland im informed  hes a terrible swell he owns three castles and half a county and has half a million ayear i can hardly tell you what sort of an old fellow he is at home there isnt any one who doesnt pay him the most profound respect and hes always doing good to everybody do you mean to say that some constable or crematorsome sort of first hangmanwould have come to him and taken him by the nape of his neck and cut his throat just because he was sixtyeight years old i cant believe that anybody would have done it  but the duke is a man  yes hes a man no doubt  if he committed murder he would be hanged in spite of his dukedom  i dont know how that would be said lord alfred hesitating i cannot imagine that my grandfather should commit a murder  but he would be hanged i can tell you that though it be very improbableimpossible as you and i may think itthe law is the same for him as for others why should not all other laws be the same also  but it would be murder  what is your idea of murder  killing people  then you are murderers who go about with this great gun of yours for the sake of killing many people  weve never killed anybody with it yet  you are not the less murderers if you have the intent to murder are soldiers murderers who kill other soldiers in battle the murderer is the man who illegally kills now in accordance with us everything would have been done legally and im afraid that if your grandfather were living among us he would have to be deposited like the rest  not if sir ferdinando were there said the boy i could not go on to explain to him that he thus ran away from his old argument about the duke but i did feel that a new difficulty would arise from the extreme veneration paid to certain characters in england how would it be with the royal family would it be necessary to exempt them down to the extremest cousins and if so how large a body of cousins would be generated i feared that the fixed period could only be good for a republic in which there were no classes violently distinguished from their inferior brethren if so it might be well that i should go to the united states and there begin to teach my doctrine no other republic would be strong enough to stand against those hydraheaded prejudices with which the ignorance of the world at large is fortified i dont believe continued the boy bringing the conversation to an end that all the men in this ship could take my grandfather and kill him in cold blood  i was somewhat annoyed on my way to england by finding that the men on boardthe sailors the stokers and stewardsregarded me as a most cruel person the prejudices of people of this class are so strong as to be absolutely invincible it is necessary that a new race should come up before the prejudices are eradicated they were civil enough in their demeanour to me personally but they had all been taught that i was devoted to the slaughter of old men and they regarded me with all that horror which the modern nations have entertained for cannibalism i heard a whisper one day between two of the stewards hed have killed that old fellow that came on board as sure as eggs if we hadnt got there just in time to prevent him  not with his own hands said a listening junior  yes with his own hands that was just the thing he wouldnt allow it to be done by anybody else it was thus that they regarded the sacrifice that i had thought to make of my own feelings in regard to crasweller i had no doubt suggested that i myself would use the lancet in order to save him from any less friendly touch i believed afterwards that when the time had come i should have found myself incapacitated for the operation the natural weakness incidental to my feelings would have prevailed but now that promiseonce so painfully made and since that as i had thought forgotten by all but myselfwas remembered against me as a proof of the diabolical inhumanity of my disposition  i believe that they think that we mean to eat them i said one day to crosstrees he had gradually become my confidential friend and to him i made known all the sorrows which fell upon me during the voyage from the ignorance of the men around me i cannot boast that i had in the least affected his opinion by my arguments but he at any rate had sense enough to perceive that i was not a bloodyminded cannibal but one actuated by a true feeling of philanthropy he knew that my object was to do good though he did not believe in the good to be done  youve got to endure that said he  do you mean to say that when i get to england i shall be regarded with personal feelings of the same kind  yes so i imagine there was an honesty about crosstrees which would never allow him to soften anything  that will be hard to bear  the first reformers had to bear such hardships i dont exactly remember what it was that socrates wanted to do for his ungrateful fellowmortals but they thought so badly of him that they made him swallow poison your galileo had a hard time when he said that the sun stood still why should we go further than jesus christ for an example if you are not able to bear the incidents you should not undertake the business  but in england i should not have a single disciple there would not be one to solace or to encourage me would it not be well that i should throw myself into the ocean and have done with a world so ungrateful in britannula they had known my true disposition there i had received the credit due to a tender heart and loving feelings no one thought there that i wanted to eat up my victims or that i would take a pleasure in spilling their blood with my own hands and tidings so misrepresenting me would have reached england before me and i should there have no friend even lieutenant crosstrees would be seen no more after i had gone ashore then came upon me for the first time an idea that i was not wanted in england at allthat i was simply to be brought away from my own home to avoid the supposed mischief i might do there and that for all british purposes it would be well that i should be dropped into the sea or left ashore on some desert island i had been taken from the place where as governing officer i had undoubtedly been of useand now could be of use no longer nobody in england would want me or would care for me and i should be utterly friendless there and alone for aught i knew they might put me in prison and keep me there so as to be sure that i should not return to my own people if i asked for my liberty i might be told that because of my bloodthirstiness it would be for the general welfare that i should be deprived of it when sir ferdinando brown had told me that i should certainly be asked down to windsor i had taken his flowery promises as being worth nothing i had no wish to go to windsor but what should i do with myself immediately on my arrival would it not be best to return at once to my own countryif only i might be allowed to do so all this made me very melancholy but especially the feeling that i should be regarded by all around as a monster of cruelty i could not but think of the words which lieutenant crosstrees had spoken to me the saviour of the world had his disciples who believed in him and the one dear youth who loved him so well i almost doubted my own energy as a teacher of progress to carry me through the misery which i saw in store for me  i shall not have a very bright time when i arrive in england i said to my friend crosstrees two days before our expected arrival  it will be all new and there will be plenty for you to see  you will go upon some other voyage  yes we shall be wanted up in the baltic at once we are very good friends with russia but no dog is really respected in this world unless he shows that he can bite as well as bark  i shall not be respected because i can neither bark nor bite what will they do with me  we shall put you on shore at plymouth and send you up to londonwith a guard of honour  and what will the guard of honour do with me  ah for that i cannot answer he will treat you with all kind of respect no doubt  it has not occurred to you to think said i where he will deposit me why should it do so but to me the question is one of some moment no one there will want me nobody knows me they to whom i must be the cause of some little trouble will simply wish me out of the way and the world at large if it hears of me at all will simply have been informed of my cruelty and malignity i do not mean to destroy myself  dont do that said the lieutenant in a piteous tone  but it would be best were it not that certain scruples prevent one what would you advise me to do with myself to begin with he paused before he replied and looked painfully into my face you will excuse my asking you because little as my acquaintance is with you it is with you alone of all englishmen that i have any acquaintance  i thought that you were intent about your book  what shall i do with my book who will publish it how shall i create an interest for it is there one who will believe at any rate that i believe in the fixed period  i do said the lieutenant  that is because you first knew me in britannula and have since passed a month with me at sea you are my one and only friend and you are about to leave meand you also disbelieve in me you must acknowledge to yourself that you have never known one whose position in the world was more piteous or whose difficulties were more trying then i left him and went down to complete my manuscript
