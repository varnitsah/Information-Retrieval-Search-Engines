was fading into evening it had been cloudy weather but the clouds had softened and broken up now they were lost in slowly darkening blue the sea was perfectly and utterly still it seemed to sleep but in its sleep it still waxed with the rising tide the eye could not mark its slow increase but beatrice standing upon the farthest point of the dog rocks idly noted that the long brown weeds which clung about their sides began to lift as the water took their weight till at last the delicate pattern floated out and lay like a womans hair upon the green depth of sea meanwhile a mist was growing dense and soft upon the quiet waters it was not blown up from the west it simply grew like the twilight making the silence yet more silent and blotting away the outlines of the land beatrice gave up studying the seaweed and watched the gathering of these fleecy hosts  what a curious evening she said aloud to herself speaking in a low full voice i have not seen one like it since mother died and that is seven years ago ive grown since then grown every way and she laughed somewhat sadly and looked at her own reflection in the quiet water  she could not have looked at anything more charming for it would have been hard to find a girl of nobler mien than beatrice granger as on this her twentysecond birthday she stood and gazed into that misty sea  of rather more than middle height and modelled like a statue strength and health seemed to radiate from her form but it was her face with the stamp of intellect and power shadowing its womans loveliness that must have made her remarkable among women even more beautiful than herself there are many girls who have rich brown hair like some autumn leaf here and there just yellowing into gold girls whose deep grey eyes can grow tender as a doves or flash like the stirred waters of a northern sea and whose bloom can bear comparison with the wilding rose but few can show a face like that which upon this day first dawned on geoffrey bingham to his sorrow and his hope it was strong and pure and sweet as the keen sea breath and looking on it one must know that beneath this fair cloak lay a wit as fair and yet it was all womanly here was not the hard sexless stamp of the cultured female she who owned it was capable of many things she could love and she could suffer and if need be she could dare or die it was to be read upon that lovely brow and face and in the depths of those grey eyesthat is by those to whom the book of character is open and who wish to study it  but beatrice was not thinking of her loveliness as she gazed into the water she knew that she was beautiful of course her beauty was too obvious to be overlooked and besides it had been brought home to her in several more or less disagreeable ways  seven years she was thinking since the night of the death fog that was what old edward called it and so it was i was only so high then and following her thoughts she touched herself upon the breast and i was happy too in my own way why cant one always be fifteen and believe everything one is told and she sighed seven years and nothing done yet work work and nothing coming out of the work and everything fading away i think that life is very dreary when one has lost everything and found nothing and loves nobody i wonder what it will be like in another seven years  she covered her eyes with her hands and then taking them away once more looked at the water such light as struggled through the fog was behind her and the mist was thickening at first she had some difficulty in tracing her own likeness upon the glassy surface but gradually she marked its outline it stretched away from her and its appearance was as though she herself were lying on her back in the water wrapped about with the fleecy mist how curious it seems she thought what is it that reflection reminds me of with the white all round it  next instant she gave a little cry and turned sharply away she knew now it recalled her mother as she had last seen her seven years ago    chapter ii  at the bell rock  a mile or more away from where beatrice stood and saw visions and further up the coastline a second group of rocks known from their colour as the red rocks or sometimes for another reason as the bell rocks juts out between half and threequarters of a mile into the waters of the welsh bay that lies behind rumball point at low tide these rocks are bare so that a man may walk or wade to their extremity but when the flood is full only one or two of the very largest can from time to time be seen projecting their weedwreathed heads through the wash of the shorebound waves in certain sets of the wind and tide this is a terrible and most dangerous spot in rough weather as more than one vessel have learnt to their cost so long ago as 1780 a threedecker manofwar went ashore there in a furious winter gale and with one exception every living soul on board of her to the number of seven hundred was drowned the one exception was a man in irons who came safely and serenely ashore seated upon a piece of wreckage nobody ever knew how the shipwreck happened least of all the survivor in irons but the tradition of the terror of the scene yet lives in the district and the spot where the bones of the drowned men still peep grimly through the sand is not unnaturally supposed to be haunted ever since this catastrophe a large bell it was originally the bell of the illfated vessel itself and still bears her name hms thunder stamped upon its metal has been fixed upon the highest rock and in times of storm and at high tide sends its solemn note of warning booming across the deep  but the bell was quiet now and just beneath it in the shadow of the rock whereon it was placed a man half hidden in seaweed with which he appeared to have purposely covered himself was seated upon a piece of wreck in appearance he was a very fine man bigshouldered and broad limbed and his age might have been thirtyfive or a little more of his frame however what between the mist and the unpleasantly damp seaweed with which he was wreathed not much was to be seen but such light as there was fell upon his face as he peered eagerly over and round the rock and glinted down the barrels of the double tenbore gun which he held across his knee it was a striking countenance with its brownish eyes dark peaked beard and strong features very powerful and very able and yet there was a certain softness in the face which hovered round the region of the mouth like light at the edge of a dark cloud hinting at gentle sunshine but little of this was visible now geoffrey bingham barristeratlaw of the inner temple ma was engaged with a very serious occupation he was trying to shoot curlew as they passed over his hidingplace on their way to the mud banks where they feed further along the coast  now if there is a thing in the world which calls for the exercise of mans every faculty it is curlew shooting in a mist perhaps he may wait for an hour or even two hours and see nothing not even an oystercatcher then at last from miles away comes the faint wild call of curlew on the wing he strains his eyes the call comes nearer but nothing can he see at last seventy yards or more to the right he catches sight of the flicker of beating wings and like a flash they are gone again a callthe curlew are flighting he looks and looks in his excitement struggling to his feet and raising his head incautiously far above the sheltering rock there they come a great flock of thirty or more bearing straight down on him a hundred yards offeightysixtynow up goes the gun but alas and alas they catch a glimpse of the light glinting on the barrels and perhaps of the head behind them and in another second they have broken and scattered this way and that way twisting off like a wisp of gigantic snipe to vanish with melancholy cries into the depth of mist  this is bad but the ardent sportsman sits down with a groan and waits listening to the soft lap of the tide and then at last virtue is rewarded first of all two wild duck come over cleaving the air like arrows the mallard is missed but the left barrel reaches the duck and down it comes with a full and satisfying thud hardly have the cartridges been replaced when the wild cry of the curlew is once more heardquite close this time there they are looming large against the fog bang down goes the first and lies flapping among the rocks like a flash the second is away to the left bang after him and caught him too hark to the splash as he falls into the deep water fifty yards away and then the mist closes in so densely that shooting is done with for the day well that right and left has been worth three hours wait in the wet seaweed and the violent cold that may followthat is to any man who has a soul for true sport  just such an experience as this had befallen geoffrey bingham he had bagged his wild duck and his brace of curlewthat is he had bagged one of them for the other was floating in the seawhen a sudden increase in the density of the mist put a stop to further operations he shook the wet seaweed off his rough clothes and having lit a short briar pipe set to work to hunt for the duck and the first curfew he found them easily enough and then walking to the edge of the rocks up the sides of which the tide was gradually creeping peered into the mist to see if he could find the other presently the fog lifted a little and he discovered the bird floating on the oily water about fifty yards away a little to the left the rocks ran out in a peak and he knew from experience that the tide setting towards the shore would carry the curlew past this peak so he went to its extremity sat down upon a big stone and waited all this while the tide was rising fast though intent as he was upon bringing the curlew to bag he did not pay much heed to it forgetting that it was cutting him off from the land at last after more than halfanhour of waiting he caught sight of the curlew again but as bad luck would have it it was still twenty yards or more from him and in deep water he was determined however to get the bird if he could for geoffrey hated leaving his game so he pulled up his trousers and set to work to wade towards it for the first few steps all went well but the fourth or fifth landed him in a hole that wet his right leg nearly up to the thigh and gave his ankle a severe twist reflecting that it would be very awkward if he sprained his ankle in such a lonely place he beat a retreat and bethought him unless the curlew was to become food for the dogfish that he had better strip bodily and swim for it thisfor geoffrey was a man of determined mindhe decided to do and had already taken off his coat and waistcoat to that end when suddenly some sort of a boathe judged it to be a canoe from the slightness of its shapeloomed up in the mist before him an idea struck him the canoe or its occupant if anybody could be insane enough to come out canoeing in such water might fetch the curlew and save him a swim  hi he shouted in stentorian tones hullo there  yes answered a womans gentle voice across the waters  oh he replied struggling to get into his waistcoat again for the voice told him that he was dealing with some befogged lady im sure i beg your pardon but would you do me a favour there is a dead curlew floating about not ten yards from your boat if you wouldnt mind  a white hand was put forward and the canoe glided on towards the bird presently the hand plunged downwards into the misty waters and the curlew was bagged then while geoffrey was still struggling with his waistcoat the canoe sped towards him like a dream boat and in another moment it was beneath his rock and a sweet dim face was looking up into his own    now let us go back a little alas that the privilege should be peculiar to the recorder of things done and see how it came about that beatrice granger was present to retrieve geoffrey binghams dead curlew  immediately after the unpleasant idea recorded in the last or to be more accurate in the first chapter of this comedy had impressed itself upon beatrices mind she came to the conclusion that she had seen enough of the dog rocks for one afternoon thereon like a sensible person she set herself to quit them in the same way that she had reached them namely by means of a canoe she got into her canoe safely enough and paddled a little way out to sea with a view of returning to the place whence she came but the further she went out and it was necessary that she should go some way on account of the rocks and the currents the denser grew the fog sounds came through it indeed but she could not clearly distinguish whence they came till at last well as she knew the coast she grew confused as to whither she was heading in this dilemma while she rested on her paddle staring into the dense surrounding mist and keeping her grey eyes as wide open as nature would allow and that was very wide she heard the report of a gun behind her to the right arguing to herself that some wildfowler on the water must have fired it who would be able to direct her she turned the canoe round and paddled swiftly in the direction whence the sound came presently she heard the gun again both barrels were fired in there to the right but some way off she paddled on vigorously but now no more shots came to guide her therefore for a while her search was fruitless at last however she saw something looming through the mist ahead it was the red rocks though she did not know it and she drew near with caution till geoffreys shout broke upon her ears  she picked up the dead bird and paddled towards the dim figure who was evidently wrestling with something she could not see what  here is the curlew sir she said  oh thank you answered the figure on the rock i am infinitely obliged to you i was just going to swim for it i cant bear losing my game it seems so cruel to shoot birds for nothing  i dare say that you will not make much use of it now that you have got it said the gentle voice in the canoe curlew are not very good eating  that is scarcely the point replied the crusoe on the rock the point is to bring them home apr√®s cela  the birdstuffer said the voice  no answered crusoe the cook  a laugh came back from the canoeand then a question  pray mr bingham can you tell me where i am i have quite lost my reckoning in the mist  he started how did this mysterious young lady in a boat know his name  you are at the red rocks there is the bell that grey thing missmiss  beatrice granger she put in hastily my father is the clergyman of bryngelly i saw you when you and lady honoria bingham looked into the school yesterday i teach in the school she did not tell him however that his face had interested her so much that she had asked his name  again he started he had heard of this young lady somebody had told him that she was the prettiest girl in wales and the cleverest but that her father was not a gentleman  oh he said taking off his hat in the direction of the canoe isnt it a little risky miss granger for you to be canoeing alone in this mist  yes she answered frankly but i am used to it i go out canoeing in all possible weathers it is my amusement and after all the risk does not matter much she added more to herself than to him  while he was wondering what she meant by that dark saying she went on quickly  do you know mr bingham i think that you are in more danger than i am it must be getting near seven oclock and the tide is high at a quarter to eight unless i am mistaken there is by now nearly half a mile of deep water between you and the shore  my word he said i forgot all about the tide what between the shooting and looking for that curlew and the mist it never occurred to me that it was getting late i suppose i must swim for it that is all  no no she answered earnestly it is very dangerous swimming here the place is full of sharp rocks and there is a tremendous current  well then what is to be done will your canoe carry two if so perhaps you would kindly put me ashore  yes she said it is a double canoe but i dare not take you ashore here there are too many rocks and it is impossible to see the ripple on them in this mist we should sink the canoe no you must get in and i must paddle you home to bryngelly thats all now that i know where i am i think that i can find the way  really he said you are very good  not at all she answered you see i must go myself anyhow so i shall be glad of your help it is nearly five miles by water you know and not a pleasant night  there was truth in this geoffrey was perfectly prepared to risk a swim to the shore on his own account but he did not at all like the idea of leaving this young lady to find her own way back to bryngelly through the mist and gathering darkness and in that frail canoe he would not have liked it if she had been a man for he knew that there was great risk in such a voyage so after making one more fruitless suggestion that they should try and reach the shore taking the chance of rocks sunken or otherwise and then walk home to which beatrice would not consent he accepted her offer  at the least you will allow me to paddle he said as she skilfully brought the canoe right under his rock which the tide was now high enough to allow her to do  if you like she answered doubtfully my hands are a little sore and of course with a glance at his broad shoulders you are much stronger but if you are not used to it i dare say that i should get on as well as you  nonsense he said sharply i will not allow you to paddle me for five miles  she yielded without another word and very gingerly shifted her seat so that her back was towards the bow of the canoe leaving him to occupy the paddling place opposite to her  then he handed her his gun which together with the dead birds she carefully stowed in the bottom of the frail craft next with great caution he slid down the rock till his feet rested in the canoe  be careful or you will upset us she said leaning forward and stretching out her hand for him to support himself by  then it was as he took it that he for the first time really saw her face with the mist drops hanging to the bent eyelashes and knew how beautiful it was    chapter iii  a confession of faith  are you ready he said recovering himself from the pleasing shock of this sergedraped vision of the mist  yes said beatrice you must head straight out to sea for a littlenot too far for if we get beyond the shelter of rumball point we might founder in the rollersthere are always rollers therethen steer to the left i will tell you when and mr bingham please be careful of the paddle it has been spliced and wont bear rough usage  all right he answered and they started gaily enough the light canoe gliding swiftly forward beneath his sturdy strokes  beatrice was leaning back with her head bent a little forward so that he could only see her chin and the sweet curve of the lips above it but she could see all his face as it swayed towards her with each motion of the paddle and she watched it with interest it was a new type of face to her so strong and manly and yet so gentle about the mouthalmost too gentle she thought what made him marry lady honoria beatrice wondered she did not look particularly gentle though she was such a graceful woman  and thus they went on for some time each wondering about the other and at heart admiring the other which was not strange for they were a very proper pair but saying no word till at last after about a quarter of an hours hard paddling geoffrey paused to rest  do you do much of this kind of thing miss granger he said with a gasp because it is rather hard work  she laughed ah she said i thought you would scarcely go on paddling at that rate yes i canoe a great deal in the summer time it is my way of taking exercise and i can swim well so i am not afraid of an upset at least it has been my way for the last two years since a lady who was staying here gave me the canoe when she went away before that i used to row in a boatthat is before i went to college  college what college girton  oh no nothing half so grand it was a college where you get certificates that you are qualified to be a mistress in a board school i wish it had been girton  do youyou are too good for that he was going to add but changed it toi think you were as well away i dont care about the girton stamp those of them whom i have known are so hard  so much the better for them she answered i should like to be hard as a stone a stone cannot feel dont you think that women ought to learn then  do you he asked  yes certainly  have you learnt anything  i have taught myself a little and picked up something at the college but i have no real knowledge only a smattering of things  what do you knowfrench and german  yes  latin  yes i know something of it  greek  i can read it fairly but i am not a greek scholar  mathematics  no i gave them up there is no human nature about mathematics they work everything to a fixed conclusion that must result life is not like that what ought to be a square comes out a right angle and x always equals an unknown quantity which is never ascertained till you are dead  good gracious thought geoffrey to himself between the strokes of the paddle what an extraordinary girl a fleshandblood bluestocking and a lovely one into the bargain at any rate i will bowl her out this time  perhaps you have read law too he said with suppressed sarcasm  i have read some she answered calmly i like law especially equity law it is so subtle and there is such a mass of it built upon such a small foundation it is like an overgrown mushroom and the top will fall off one day however hard the lawyers try to prop it up perhaps you can tell me  no im sure i cannot he answered im not a chancery man i am common law and i dont take all knowledge for my province you positively alarm me miss granger i wonder that the canoe does not sink beneath so much learning  do i she answered sweetly i am glad that i have lived to frighten somebody i meant that i like equity to study but if i were a barrister i would be common law because there is so much more life and struggle about it existence is not worth having unless one is struggling with something and trying to overcome it  dear me what a reposeful prospect said geoffrey aghast he had certainly never met such a woman as this before  repose is only good when it is earned went on the fair philosopher and in order to fit one to earn some more otherwise it becomes idleness and that is misery fancy being idle when one has such a little time to live the only thing to do is to work and stifle thought i suppose that you have a large practice mr bingham  you should not ask a barrister that question he answered laughing it is like looking at the pictures which an artist has turned to the wall no to be frank i have not i have only taken to practising in earnest during the last two years before i was a barrister in name and that is all  then why did you suddenly begin to work  because i lost my prospects miss grangerfrom necessity in short  oh i beg your pardon she said with a blush which of course he could not see i did not mean to be rude but it is very lucky for you is it not  indeed some people dont think so why is it lucky  because you will now rise and become a great man and that is more than being a rich man  and why do you think that i shall become a great man he asked stopping paddling in his astonishment and looking at the dim form before him  oh because it is written on your face she answered simply  her words rang true there was no flattery or artifice in them geoffrey felt that the girl was saying just what she thought  so you study physiognomy as well he said well miss granger it is rather odd considering all things but i will say to you what i have never said to any one before i believe that you are right i shall rise if i live i feel that i have it in me  at this point it possibly occurred to beatrice that considering the exceeding brevity of their acquaintance they were drifting into somewhat confidential conversation at any rate she quickly changed the topic  i am afraid you are growing tired she said but we must be getting on it will soon be quite dark and we have still a long way to go look there and she pointed seaward  he looked the whole bank of mist was breaking up and bearing down on them in enormous billows of vapour presently these were rolling over them so darkening the heavy air that though the pair were within four feet of each other they could scarcely see one anothers faces as yet they felt no wind the dense weight of mist choked the keen impelling air  i think the weather is breaking we are going to have a storm said beatrice a little anxiously  scarcely were the words out of her mouth when the mist passed away from them and from all the seaward expanse of ocean not a wrack of it was left and in its place the strong seabreath beat upon their faces far in the west the angry disc of the sun was sinking into the foam a great red ray shot from its bent edge and lay upon the awakened waters like a path of fire the ominous light fell full upon the little boat and full upon beatrices lips then it passed on and lost itself in the deep mists which still swathed the coast  oh how beautiful it is she cried raising herself and pointing to the glory of the dying sun  it is beautiful indeed he answered but he looked not at the sunset but at the womans face before him glowing like a saints in its golden aureole for this also was most beautifulso beautiful that it stirred him strangely  it is like she began and broke off suddenly  what is it like he asked  it is like finding truth at last she answered speaking as much to herself as to him why one might make an allegory out of it we wander in mist and darkness shaping a vague course for home and then suddenly the mists are blown away glory fills the air and there is no more doubt only before us is a splendour making all things clear and lighting us over a deathless sea it sounds rather too grand she added with a charming little laugh but there is something in it somewhere if only i could express myself oh look  as she spoke a heavy stormcloud rolled over the vanishing rim of the sun for a moment the light struggled with the eclipsing cloud turning its dull edge to the hue of copper but the cloud was too strong and the light vanished leaving the sea in darkness  well he said your allegory would have a dismal end if you worked it out it is getting as dark as pitch and theres a good deal in that if only i could express myself  beatrice dropped poetry and came down to facts in a way that was very commendable  there is a squall coming up mr bingham she said you must paddle as hard as you can i do not think we are more than two miles from bryngelly and if we are lucky we may get there before the weather breaks  yes if we are lucky he said grimly as he bent himself to the work but the question is where to paddle toits so dark had not we better run for the shore  we are in the middle of the bay now she answered and almost as far from the nearest land as we are from bryngelly besides it is all rocks no you must go straight on you will see the poise light beyond coed presently you know coed is four miles on the other side of bryngelly so when you see it head to the left  he obeyed her and they neither of them spoke any more for some time indeed the rising wind made conversation difficult and so far as geoffrey was concerned he had little breath left to spare for words he was a strong man but the unaccustomed labour was beginning to tell on him and his hands were blistering for ten minutes or so he paddled on through a darkness which was now almost total wondering where on earth he was wending for it was quite impossible to see for all he knew to the contrary he might be circling round and round he had only one thing to direct him the sweep of the continually rising wind and the wash of the gathering waves so long as these struck the canoe which now began to roll ominously on the starboard side he must he thought be keeping a right course but in the turmoil of the rising gale and the confusion of the night this was no very satisfactory guide at length however a broad and brilliant flash sprung out across the sea almost straight ahead of him it was the poise light  he altered his course a little and paddled steadily on and now the squall was breaking fortunately it was not a very heavy one or their frail craft must have sunk and they with it but it was quite serious enough to put them in great danger the canoe rose to the waves like a feather but she was broadside on and rise as she would they began to ship a little water and they had not seen the worst of it the weather was still thickening  still he held on though his heart sank within him while beatrice said nothing presently a big wave came he could just see its white crest gleaming through the gloom then it was on them the canoe rose to it gallantly it seemed to curl right over her making the craft roll till geoffrey thought that the end had come but she rode it out not however without shipping more than a bucket of water without saying a word beatrice took the cloth cap from her head and leaning forward began to bale as best she could and that was not very well  this will not do he called i must keep her head to the sea or we shall be swamped  yes she answered keep her head up we are in great danger  he glanced to his right another white sea was heaving down on him he could just see its glittering crest with all his force he dug the paddle into the water the canoe answered to it she came round just in time to ride out the wave with safety but the paddle snapped it was already sprung and the weight he put upon it was more than it could bear right in two it broke some nine inches above that blade which at the moment was buried in the water he felt it go and despair took hold of him  great heavens he cried the paddle is broken  beatrice gasped  you must use the other blade she said paddle first one side and then on the other and keep her head on  till we sink he answered  no till we are savednever talk of sinking  the girls courage shamed him and he obeyed her instructions as best he could by dint of continually shifting what remained of the paddle from one side of the canoe to the other he did manage to keep her head on to the waves that were now rolling in apace but in their hearts they both wondered how long this would last  have you got any cartridges she asked presently  yes in my coat pocket he answered  give me two if you can manage it she said  in an interval between the coming of two seas he contrived to slip his hand into a pocket and transfer the cartridges apparently she knew something of the working of a gun for presently there was a flash and a report quickly followed by another  give me some more cartridges she cried he did so but nothing followed  it is no use she said at length the cartridges are wet i cannot get the empty cases out but perhaps they may have seen or heard them old edward is sure to be watching for me you had better throw the rest into the sea if you can manage it she added by way of an afterthought we may have to swim presently  to geoffrey this seemed very probable and whenever he got a chance he acted on the hint till at length he was rid of all his cartridges just then it began to rain in torrents though it was not warm the perspiration was streaming from him at every pore and the rain beating on his face refreshed him somewhat also with the rain the wind dropped a little  but he was becoming tired out and he knew it soon he would no longer be able to keep the canoe straight and then they must be swamped and in all human probability drowned so this was to be the end of his life and its ambitions before another hour had run its course he would be rolling to and fro in the arms of that angry sea what would his wife honoria say when she heard the news he wondered perhaps it would shock her into some show of feeling and effie his dear little sixyearold daughter well thank god she was too young to feel his loss for long by the time that she was a woman she would almost have forgotten that she ever had a father but how would she get on without him to guide her her mother did not love children and a growing girl would continually remind her of her growing years he could not tell he could only hope for the best  and for himself what would become of him after the short sharp struggle for life should he find endless sleep or what he was a christian and his life had not been worse than that of other men indeed though he would have been the last to think it he had some redeeming virtues but now at the end the spiritual horizon was as dark as it had been at the beginning there before him were the gates of death but not yet would they roll aside and show the traveller what lay beyond their frowning face how could he tell perhaps they would not open at all perhaps he now bade his last farewell to consciousness to earth and sky and sea and love and all lovely things well that might be better than some prospects at that moment geoffrey bingham in the last agony of doubt would gladly have exchanged his hopes of life beyond for a certainty of eternal sleep that faith which enables some of us to tread this awful way with an utter confidence is not a wide prerogative and as yet at any rate it was not his though the time might come when he would attain it there are not very many even among those without reproach who can lay them down in the arms of death knowing most certainly that when the veil is rent away the countenance that they shall see will be that of the blessed guardian of mankind alas he could not be altogether sure and where doubt exists hope is but a pinpricked bladder he sighed heavily murmured a little formula of prayer that had been on his lips most nights during thirty yearshe had learnt it as a child at his mothers kneeand then while the tempest roared around him gathered up his strength to meet the end which seemed inevitable at any rate he would die like a man  then came a reaction his vital forces rose again he no longer felt fearful he only wondered with a strange impersonal wonder as a man wonders about the vital affairs of another then from wondering about himself he began to wonder about the girl who sat opposite to him with the rain came a little lightning and by the first flash he saw her clearly her beautiful face was set and as she bent forward searching the darkness with her wide eyes it wore he thought an almost defiant air  the canoe twisted round somewhat he dug his broken paddle into the water and once more brought her head on to the sea then he spoke  are you afraid he asked of beatrice  no she answered i am not afraid  do you know that we shall probably be drowned  yes i know it they say the death is easy i brought you here forgive me that i should have tried to row you ashore as you said  never mind me a man must meet his fate some day do not think of me but i cant keep her head on much longer you had better say your prayers  beatrice bent forward till her head was quite near his own the wind had blown some of her hair loose and though he did not seem to notice it at the time he remembered afterwards that a lock of it struck him on the face  i cannot pray she said i have nothing to pray to i am not a christian  the words struck him like a blow it seemed so awful to think of this proud and brilliant woman now balanced on the verge of what she believed to be utter annihilation even the courage that induced her at such a moment to confess her hopeless state seemed awful  try he said with a gasp  no she answered i do not fear to die death cannot be worse than life is for most of us i have not prayed for years not sincewell never mind i am not a coward it would be cowardly to pray now because i may be wrong if there is a god who knows all he will understand that  geoffrey said no more but laboured at the broken paddle gallantly and with an everfailing strength the lightning had passed away and the darkness was very great for the hurrying clouds hid the starlight presently a sound arose above the turmoil of the storm a crashing thunderous sound towards which the send of the sea gradually bore them the sound came from the waves that beat upon the bryngelly reef  where are we drifting to he cried  into the breakers where we shall be lost she answered calmly give up paddling it is of no use and try to take off your coat i have loosened my skirt perhaps we can swim ashore  he thought to himself that in the dark and breakers such an event was not probable but he said nothing and addressed himself to the task of getting rid of his coat and waistcoatno easy one in that confined space meanwhile the canoe was whirling round and round like a walnut shell upon a flooded gutter for some distance before the waves broke upon the reef and rocks they swept in towards them with a steady foamless swell on reaching the shallows however they pushed their white shoulders high into the air curved up and fell in thunder on the reef  the canoe rode towards the breakers sucked upon its course by a swelling sea  goodbye called geoffrey to beatrice as stretching out his wet hand he found her own and took it for companionship makes death a little easier  goodbye she cried clinging to his hand oh why did i bring you into this  for in their last extremity this woman thought rather of her companion in peril than of herself  one more turn then suddenly the canoe beneath them was lifted like a straw and tossed high into the air a mighty mass of water boiled up beneath it and around it then the foam rushed in and vaguely geoffrey knew that they were wrapped in the curve of a billow  a swift and mighty rush of water crashand his senses left him    chapter iv  the watcher at the door  this was what had happened just about the centre of the reef is a large flattopped rockit may be twenty feet in the squareknown to the bryngelly fishermen as table rock in ordinary weather even at high tide the waters scarcely cover this rock but when there is any sea they wash over it with great violence on to this rock geoffrey and beatrice had been hurled by the breaker fortunately for them it was thickly overgrown with seaweed which to some slight extent broke the violence of their fall as it chanced geoffrey was knocked senseless by the shock but beatrice whose hand he still held fell on to him and with the exception of a few bruises and a shake escaped unhurt  she struggled to her knees gasping the water had run off the rock and her companion lay quiet at her side she put down her face and called into his ear but no answer came and then she knew that he was either dead or senseless  at this second beatrice caught a glimpse of something white gleaming in the darkness instinctively she flung herself upon her face gripping the long tough seaweed with one hand the other she passed round the body of the helpless man beside her straining him with all her strength against her side  then came a wild long rush of foam the water lifted her from the rock but the seaweed held and when at length the sea had gone boiling by beatrice found herself and the senseless form of geoffrey once more lying side by side she was half choked desperately she struggled up and round looking shoreward through the darkness heavens there not a hundred yards away a light shone upon the waters it was a boats light for it moved up and down she filled her lungs with air and sent one long cry for help ringing across the sea a moment passed and she thought that she heard an answer but because of the wind and the roar of the breakers she could not be sure then she turned and glanced seaward again the foaming terror was rushing down upon them again she flung herself upon the rock and grasping the slippery seaweed twined her left arm about the helpless geoffrey  it was on them  oh horror even in the turmoil of the boiling waters beatrice felt the seaweed give now they were being swept along with the rushing wave and death drew very near but still she clung to geoffrey once more the air touched her face she had risen to the surface and was floating on the stormy water the wave had passed loosing her hold of geoffrey she slipped her hand upwards and as he began to sink clutched him by the hair then treading water with her feet for happily for them both she was as good a swimmer as could be found upon that coast she managed to open her eyes there not sixty yards away was the boats light oh if only she could reach it she spat the salt water from her mouth and once more cried aloud the light seemed to move on  then another wave rolled forward and once more she was pushed down into the cruel depths for with that dead weight hanging to her she could not keep above them it flashed into her mind that if she let him go she might even now save herself but even in that last terror this beatrice would not do if he went she would go with him  it would have been better if she had let him go  down she wentdown down i will hold him beatrice said in her heart i will hold him till i die then came waves of light and a sound as of wind whispering through the trees andall grew dark        i tell yer it aint no good eddard shouted a man in the boat to an old sailor who was leaning forward in the bows peering into the darkness we shall be right on to the table rocks in a minute and all drown together put about mateput about  damn yer screamed the old man turning so that the light from the lantern fell on his furrowed fiercely anxious face and long white hair streaming in the wind damn yer ye cowards i tells yer i heard her voicei heard it twice screaming for help if you put the boat about by goad when i get ashore ill kill yer ye lubbersold man as i am ill kill yer if i swing for it  this determined sentiment produced a marked effect upon the boats crew there were eight of them altogether they did not put the boat about they only lay upon their oars and kept her head to the seas  the old man in the bow peered out into the gloom he was shaking not with cold but with agitation  presently he turned his head with a yell  give waygive way theres something on the wave  the men obeyed with a will  back he roared againback water  they backed and the boat answered but nothing was to be seen  shes gone oh goad shes gone groaned the old man you may put about now lads and the lords will be done  the light from the lantern fell in a little ring upon the seething water suddenly something white appeared in the centre of this illuminated ring edward stared at it it was floating upwards it vanishedit appeared again it was a womans face with a yell he plunged his arms into the sea  i have herlend an hand lads  another man scrambled forward and together they clutched the object in the water  look out dont pull so hard you fool blow me if there aint another and shes got him by the hair so steady steady  a long heave from strong arms and the senseless form of beatrice was on the gunwale then they pulled up geoffrey beside her for they could not loose her desperate grip of his dark hair and together rolled them into the boat  theyre dead i doubt said the second man  help turn em on their faces over the seat solet the water drain from their innards its the only chance now give me that sail to cover themso youll live yet miss beatrice you aint dead i swear old eddard has saved you old eddard and the good goad together  meanwhile the boat had been got round and the men were rowing for bryngelly as warmhearted sailors will when life is at stake they all knew beatrice and loved her and they remembered it as they rowed the gloom was little hindrance to them for they could almost have navigated the coast blindfold besides here they were sheltered by the reef and shore  in five minutes they were round a little headland and the lights of bryngelly were close before them on the beach people were moving about with lanterns  presently they were there hanging on their oars for a favourable wave to beach with at last it came and they gave way together running the large boat half out of the surf a dozen men plunged into the water and dragged her on they were safe ashore  have you got miss beatrice shouted a voice  ay weve got her and another too but i doubt theyre gone wheres doctor  here here answered a voice bring the stretchers  a stout thickset man who had been listening wrapped up in a dark cloak turned his face away and uttered a groan then he followed the others as they went to work not offering to help but merely following  the stretchers were brought and the two bodies laid upon them face downwards and covered over  where to said the bearers as they seized the poles  the vicarage answered the doctor i told them to get things ready there in case they should find her run forward one of you and say that we are coming  the men started at a trot and the crowd ran after them  who is the other somebody asked  mr binghamthe tall lawyer who came down from london the other day tell policemanrun to his wife shes at mrs joness and thinks he has lost his way in the fog coming home from bell rock  the policeman departed on his melancholy errand and the procession moved swiftly across the sandy beach and up the stonepaved way by which boats were dragged down the cliff to the sea the village of bryngelly lay to the right it had grown away from the church which stood dangerously near the edge of the cliff on the further side of the church and a little behind it partly sheltered from the sea gales by a group of stunted firs was the vicarage a low singlestoried stoneroofed building tenanted for twentyfive years past and more by beatrices father the rev joseph granger the best approach to it from the bryngelly side was by the churchyard through which the men with the stretchers were now winding followed by the crowd of sightseers  might as well leave them here at once said one of the bearers to the other in welsh i doubt they are both dead enough  the person addressed assented and the thickset man wrapped in a dark cloak who was striding along by beatrices stretcher groaned again clearly he understood the welsh tongue a few seconds more and they were passing through the stunted firs up to the vicarage door in the doorway stood a group of people the light from a lamp in the hall struck upon them throwing them into strong relief foremost holding a lantern in his hand was a man of about sixty with snowwhite hair which fell in confusion over his rugged forehead he was of middle height and carried himself with something of a stoop the eyes were small and shifting and the mouth hard he wore short whiskers which together with the eyebrows were still tinged with yellow the face was ruddy and healthy looking indeed had it not been for the dirty white tie and shabby black coat one would have taken him to be what he was in heart a farmer of the harder sort somewhat weatherbeaten and anxious about the timesa man who would take advantage of every drop in the rate of wages in fact he was beatrices father and a clergyman  by his side and leaning over him was elizabeth her elder sister there was five years between them she was a poor copy of beatrice or to be more accurate beatrice was a grand development of elizabeth they both had brown hair but elizabeths was straighter and faintcoloured not rich and ruddying into gold elizabeths eyes were also grey but it was a cold washedout grey like that of a february sky and so with feature after feature and with the expression also beatrices was noble and open if at times defiant looking at her you knew that she might be a mistaken woman or a headstrong woman or both but she could never be a mean woman whichever of the ten commandments she might choose to break it would not be that which forbids us to bear false witness against our neighbour anybody might read it in her eyes but in her sisters he might discern her fathers shifty hardness watered by womans weaker will into something like cunning for the rest elizabeth had a very fair figure but lacked her sisters rounded loveliness though the two were so curiously alike that at a distance you might well mistake the one for the other one might almost fancy that nature had experimented upon elizabeth before she made up her mind to produce beatrice just to get the lines and distances the elder sister was to the other what the pale unfinished model of clay is to the polished statue in ivory and gold  oh my god my god groaned the old man look they have got them on the stretchers they are both dead oh beatrice beatrice and only this morning i spoke harshly to her  dont be so foolish father said elizabeth sharply they may only be insensible  ah ah he answered it does not matter to you you dont care about your sister you are jealous of her but i love her though we do not understand each other here they come dont stand staring there go and see that the blankets and things are hot stop doctor tell me is she dead  how can i tell till i have seen her the doctor answered roughly shaking him off and passing through the door  bryngelly vicarage was a very simply constructed house on entering the visitor found himself in a passage with doors to the right and left that to the right led to the sittingroom that to the left to the diningroom both of them long low and narrow chambers following the passage down for some seven paces it terminated in another which ran at right angles to it for the entire length of the house on the further side of this passage were several bedroom doors and a room at each end that at the end to the right was occupied by beatrice and her sister the next was empty the third was mr grangers and the fourth the spare room this with the exception of the kitchens and servants sleeping place which were beyond the diningroom made up the house  fires had been lit in both of the principal rooms geoffrey was taken into the diningroom and attended by the doctors assistant and beatrice into the sittingroom and attended by the doctor himself in a few seconds the place had been cleared of all except the helpers and the work began the doctor looked at beatrices cold shrunken form and at the foam upon her lips he lifted the eyelid and held a light before the contracted pupil then he shook his head and set to work with a will we need not follow him through the course of his dreadful labours with which most people will have some acquaintance hopeless as they seemed he continued them for hour after hour  meanwhile the assistant and some helpers were doing the same service for geoffrey bingham the doctor himself a thin cleverlooking man occasionally stepping across the passage to direct them and see how things were getting on now although geoffrey had been in the water the longer his was by far the better case for when he was immersed he was already insensible and a person in this condition is very hard to drown it is your struggling fighting breathing creature who is soonest made an end of in deep waters therefore it came to pass that when the scrubbing with hot cloths and the artificial respiration had gone on for somewhere about twenty minutes geoffrey suddenly crooked a finger the doctors assistant a buoyant youth fresh from the hospitals gave a yell of exultation and scrubbed and pushed away with everincreasing energy presently the subject coughed and a minute later as the agony of returning life made itself felt he swore most heartily  hes all right now called the assistant to his employer hes swearing beautifully  dr chambers pursuing his melancholy and unpromising task in the other room smiled sadly and called to the assistant to continue the treatment which he did with much vigour  presently geoffrey came partially to life still suffering torments the first thing he grew aware of was that a tall elegant woman was standing over him looking at him with a half puzzled and half horrified air vaguely he wondered who it might be the tall form and cold handsome face were so familiar to him and yet he could not recall the name it was not till she spoke that his numbed brain realized that he was looking on his own wife  well dear she said i am so glad that you are better you frightened me out of my wits i thought you were drowned  thank you honoria he said faintly and then groaned as a fresh attack of tingling pain shook him through and through  i hope nobody said anything to effie geoffrey said presently  yes the child would not go to bed because you were not back and when the policeman came she heard him tell mrs jones that you were drowned and she has been almost in a fit ever since they had to hold her to prevent her from running here  geoffreys white face assumed an air of the deepest distress how could you frighten the child so he murmured please go and tell her that i am all right  it was not my fault said lady honoria with a shrug of her shapely shoulders besides i can do nothing with effie she goes on like a wild thing about you  please go and tell her honoria said her husband  oh yes ill go she answered really i shall not be sorry to get out of this i begin to feel as though i had been drowned myself and she looked at the steaming cloths and shuddered goodbye geoffrey it is an immense relief to find you all right the policeman made me feel quite queer i cant get down to give you a kiss or i would well goodbye for the present my dear  goodbye honoria said her husband with a faint smile  the medical assistant looked a little surprised he had never it is true happened to be present at a meeting between husband and wife when one of the pair had just been rescued by a hairsbreadth from a violent and sudden death and therefore wanted experience to go on but it struck him that there was something missing the lady did not seem to him quite to fill the part of the heaventhanking spouse it puzzled him very much perhaps he showed this in his face at any rate lady honoria who was quick enough read something there  he is safe now is he not she asked it will not matter if i go away  no my lady answered the assistant he is out of danger i think it will not matter at all  lady honoria hesitated a little she was standing in the passage then she glanced through the door into the opposite room and caught a glimpse of beatrices rigid form and of the doctor bending over it her head was thrown back and the beautiful brown hair which was now almost dry again streamed in masses to the ground while on her face was stamped the terrifying seal of death  lady honoria shuddered she could not bear such sights will it be necessary for me to come back tonight she said  i do not think so he answered unless you care to hear whether miss granger recovers  i shall hear that in the morning she said poor thing i cannot help her  no lady honoria you cannot help her she saved your husbands life they say  she must be a brave girl will she recover  the assistant shook his head she may possibly it is not likely now  poor thing and so young and beautiful what a lovely face and what an arm it is very awful for her and lady honoria shuddered again and went  outside the door a small knot of sympathisers was still gathered notwithstanding the late hour and the badness of the weather  thats his wife said one and they opened to let her pass  then why dont she stop with him asked a woman audibly if it had been my husband id have sat and hugged him for an hour  ay youd have killed him with your hugging you would somebody answered  lady honoria passed on suddenly a thickset man emerged from the shadow of the pines she could not see his face but he was wrapped in a large cloak  forgive me he said in the hoarse voice of one struggling with emotions which he was unable to conceal but you can tell me does she still live  do you mean miss granger she asked  yes of course beatricemiss granger  they do not know but they think  yes yesthey think  that she is dead  the man said never a word he dropped his head upon his breast and turning vanished again into the shadow of the pines  how very odd thought lady honoria as she walked rapidly along the cliff towards her lodging i suppose that man must be in love with her well i do not wonder at it i never saw such a face and arm what a picture that scene in the room would make she saved geoffrey and now shes dead if he had saved her i should not have wondered it is like a scene in a novel  from all of which it will be seen that lady honoria was not wanting in certain romantic and artistical perceptions    chapter v  elizabeth is thankful  geoffrey lying before the fire newly hatched from death had caught some of the conversation between his wife and the assistant who had recovered him to life so she was gone that brave beautiful atheist girlgone to test the truth and she had saved his life  for some minutes the assistant did not enter he was helping in another room at last he came  what did you say to lady honoria geoffrey asked feebly did you say that miss granger had saved me  yes mr bingham at least they tell me so at any rate when they pulled her out of the water they pulled you after her she had hold of your hair  great heavens he groaned and my weight must have dragged her down is she dead then  we cannot quite say yet not for certain we think that she is  pray god she is not dead he said more to himself than to the other then aloudleave me i am all right go and help with her but stop come and tell me sometimes how it goes with her  very well i will send a woman to watch you and he went  meanwhile in the other room the treatment of the drowned went slowly on two hours had passed and as yet beatrice showed no signs of recovery the heart did not beat no pulse stirred but as the doctor knew life might still linger in the tissues slowly very slowly the body was turned to and fro the head swaying and the long hair falling now this way and now that but still no sign every resource known to medical skill such as hot air rubbing artificial respiration electricity was applied and applied in vain but still no sign  elizabeth pale and pinched stood by handing what might be required she did not greatly love her sister they were antagonistic and their interests clashed or she thought they did but this sudden death was awful in a corner pitiful to see offering groans and ejaculated prayers to heaven sat the old clergymen their father his white hair about his eyes he was a weak coarsegrained man but in his own way his clever and beautiful girl was dear to him and this sight wrung his soul as it had not been wrung for years  shes gone he said continually shes gone the lords will be done there must be another mistress at the school now seventy pounds a year she will costseventy pounds a year  do be quiet father said elizabeth sharply  ay ay it is very well for you to tell me to be quiet you are quiet because you dont care you never loved your sister but i have loved her since she was a little fairhaired child and so did your poor mother beatrice was the last word she spoke  be quiet father said elizabeth still more sharply the old man making no reply sank back into a semitorpor rocking himself to and fro upon his chair  meanwhile without intermission the work went on  it is no use said the assistant at last as he straightened his weary frame and wiped the perspiration from his brow she must be dead we have been at it nearly three hours now  patience said the doctor if necessary i shall go on for fouror till i drop he added  ten minutes more passed everybody knew that the task was hopeless but still they hoped  great heavens said the assistant presently starting back from the body and pointing at its face did you see that  elizabeth and mr granger sprang to their feet crying what what  sit still sir said the doctor waving them back then addressing his helper and speaking in a constrained voice i thought i saw the right eyelid quiver williams pass the battery  so did i answered williams as he obeyed  full power said the doctor again it is kill or cure now  the shock was applied for some seconds without result then suddenly a long shudder ran up the limbs and a hand stirred next moment the eyes were opened and with pain and agony beatrice drew a first breath of returning life ten minutes more and she had passed through the gates of death back to this warm and living world  let me die she gasped faintly i cannot bear it oh let me die  hush said the doctor you will be better presently  ten minutes more passed when the doctor saw by her eyes that beatrice wished to say something he bent his head till it nearly touched her lips  dr chambers she whispered was he drowned  no he is safe he has been brought round  she sigheda longdrawn sigh half of pain half of relief then she spoke again  was he washed ashore  no no you saved his life you had hold of him when they pulled you out now drink this and go to sleep  beatrice smiled sweetly but said nothing then she drank as much of the draught as she could and shortly afterwards obeyed the last injunction also and went to sleep  meanwhile a rumour of this wonderful recovery had escaped to without the housepassing from one watcher to the other till at length it reached the ears of the solitary man crouched in the shadow of the pines he heard and starting as though he had been shot strode to the door of the vicarage here his courage seemed to desert him for he hesitated  knock squire knock and ask if it is true said a woman the same who had declared that she would have hugged her husband back to life  this remark seemed to encourage the man at any rate he did knock presently the door was opened by elizabeth  go away she said in her sharp voice the house must be kept quiet  i beg your pardon miss granger said the visitor in a tone of deep humiliation i only wanted to know if it was true that miss beatrice lives  why said elizabeth with a start is it you mr davies i am sure i had no idea step into the passage and i will shut the door there how long have you been outside  oh since they brought them up but is it true  yes yes it is true she will recover now and you have stood all this time in the wet night i am sure that beatrice ought to be flattered  not at all it seemed so awful andii take such an interest and he broke off  such an interest in beatrice said elizabeth drily supplying the hiatus yes so it seems and suddenly as though by chance she moved the candle which she held in such fashion that the light fell full upon owen davies face it was a slow heavy countenance but not without comeliness the skin was fresh as a childs the eyes were large blue and mild and the brown hair grew in waves that many a woman might have envied indeed had it not been for a short but strongly growing beard it would have been easy to believe that the countenance was that of a boy of nineteen rather than of a man over thirty neither time nor care had drawn a single line upon it it told of perfect and robust health and yet bore the bloom of childhood it was the face of a man who might live to a hundred and still look young nor did the form belie it  mr davies blushed up to his eyes blushed like a girl beneath elizabeths scrutiny naturally i take an interest in a neighbours fate he said in his slow deliberate way she is quite safe then  i believe so answered elizabeth  thank god he said or rather it seemed to break from him in a sigh of relief how did the gentleman mr bingham come to be found with her  how should i know she answered with a shrug beatrice saved his life somehow clung fast to him even after she was insensible  it is very wonderful i never heard of such a thing what is he like  he is one of the finestlooking men i ever saw answered elizabeth always watching him  ah but he is married i think miss granger  oh yes he is married to the daughter of a peer very much marriedand very little i should say  i do not quite understand miss granger  dont you mr davies then use your eyes when you see them together  i should not see anything i am not quick like you he added  how do you mean to get back to the castle tonight mr davies you cannot row back in this wind and the seas will be breaking over the causeway  oh i shall manage i am wet already an extra ducking wont hurt me and i have had a chain put up to prevent anybody from being washed away and now i must be going goodnight  goodnight mr davies  he hesitated a moment and then added would youwould you mind telling your sisterof course i mean when she is strongerthat i came to inquire after her  i think that you can do that for yourself mr davies elizabeth said almost roughly i mean it will be more appreciated and she turned upon her heel  owen davies ventured no further remarks he felt that elizabeths manner was a little crushing and he was afraid of her as well i suppose that she does not think i am good enough to pay attention to her sister he thought to himself as he plunged into the night and rain well she is quite righti am not fit to black her boots oh god i thank thee that thou hast saved her life i thank theei thank thee he went on speaking aloud to the wild winds as he made his way along the cliff if she had been dead i think that i must have died too oh god i thank theei thank thee  the idea that owen davies esq jp dl of bryngelly castle absolute owner of that rising little wateringplace and of one of the largest and most prosperous slate quarries in wales worth in all somewhere between seven and ten thousand a year was unfit to black her beautiful sisters boots was not an idea that had struck elizabeth granger had it struck her indeed it would have moved her to laughter for elizabeth had a practical mind  what did strike her as she turned and watched the rich squires sturdy form vanish through the doorway into the dark beyond was a certain sense of wonder supposing she had never seen that shiver of returning life run up those white limbs supposing that they had grown colder and colder till at length it was evident that death was so firmly citadelled within the silent heart that no human skill could beat his empire back what then owen davies loved her sister this she knew and had known for years but would he not have got over it in time would he not in time have been overpowered by the sense of his own utter loneliness and given his hand if not his heart to some other woman and could not she who held his hand learn to reach his heart and to whom would that hand have been given the hand and all that went with it what woman would this shy welsh hermit without friends or relations have ever been thrown in with except herselfelizabethwho loved him as much as she could love anybody which perhaps was not very much who at any rate desired sorely to be his wife would not all this have come about if she had never seen that eyelid tremble and that slight quiver run up her sisters limbs it wouldshe knew it would  elizabeth thought of it as for a moment she stood in the passage and a cold hungry light came into her neutral tinted eyes and shone upon her pale face but she choked back the thought she was scarcely wicked enough to wish that her sister had not been brought back to life she only speculated on what might have happened if this had come about just as one works out a game of chess from a given hypothetical situation of the pieces  perhaps too the same end might be gained in some other way perhaps mr davies might still be weaned from his infatuation the wall was difficult but it would have to be very difficult if she could not find a way to climb it it never occurred to elizabeth that there might be an open gate she could not conceive it possible that a woman might positively reject owen davies and his seven or ten thousand a year and that woman a person in an unsatisfactory and uncongenial almost in a menial position reject bryngelly castle with all its luxury and opportunities of wealth and leisure no the sun would set in the east before such a thing happened the plan was to prevent the occasion from arising the hungry light died on elizabeths face and she turned to enter the sick room when suddenly she met her father coming out  who was that at the front he asked carefully closing the door  mr davies of bryngelly castle father  and what did mr davies want at this time of night to know about beatrice  yes she answered slowly he came to ask after beatrice or to be more correct he has been waiting outside for three hours in the rain to learn if she recovered  waiting outside for three hours in the rain said the clergyman astonishedsquire davies standing outside the house what for  because he was so anxious about beatrice and did not like to come in i suppose  so anxious about beatriceah so anxious about beatrice do you think elizabethumyou know there is no doubt beatrice is very well favouredvery handsome they say  i do not think anything about it father she answered and as for beatrices looks they are a matter of opinion i have mine and now dont you think we had better go to bed the doctors and betty are going to stop up all night with mr bingham and beatrice  yes elizabeth i suppose that we had better go i am sure we have much to be thankful for tonight what a merciful deliverance and if poor beatrice had gone the parish must have found another schoolmistress and it would have meant that we lost the salary we have a great deal to be thankful for elizabeth  yes said elizabeth very deliberately we have    chapter vi  owen davies at home  owen davies tramped along the cliff with a light heart the wild lashing of the rain and the roaring of the wind did not disturb him in the least they were disagreeable but he accepted them as he accepted existence and all its vanities without remark or mental comment there is a class of mind of which this is the prevailing attitude very early in their span of life those endowed with such a mind come to the conclusion that the world is too much for them they cannot understand it so they abandon the attempt and as a consequence in their own torpid way they are among the happiest and most contented of men problems on which persons of keener intelligence and more aspiring soul fret and foam their lives away as rushing water round a rock do not even break the placid surface of their days such men slip past them they look out upon the stars and read of the mystery of the universe speeding on for ever through the limitless wastes of space and are not astonished in their childhood they were taught that god made the sun and the stars to give light on the earth that is enough for them and so it is with everything poverty and suffering war pestilence and the inequalities of fate madness life and death and the spiritual wonders that hedge in our being are things not to be inquired into but accepted so they accept them as they do their dinner or a tradesmans circular  in some cases this mental state has its root in deep and simple religious convictions and in some it springs from a preponderance of healthful animal instincts over the higher but more troublesome spiritual parts the ox chewing the cud in the fresh meadow does not muse upon the past and future and the gull blown like a foamflake out against the sunset does not know the splendour of the sky and sea even the savage is not much troubled about the scheme of things in the beginning he was torn out of the reeds and in the end he melts into the unknown and for the rest there are beef and wives and foes to conquer but then oxen and gulls are not so far as we know troubled with any spiritual parts at all and in the noble savage such things are not cultivated they come with civilization  but perhaps in the majority this condition so necessary to the more placid forms of happiness is born of a conjunction of physical and religious developments so it was at least with the rich and fortunate man whom we have seen trudging along the windswept cliff by nature and education he was of a strongly and simply religious mind as he was in body powerful placid and healthy to an exasperating degree it may be said that it is easy to be religious and placid on ten thousand a year but owen davies had not always enjoyed ten thousand a year and one of the most romantic and beautiful seats in wales from the time he was seventeen when his mothers death left him an orphan till he reached the age of thirty some six years from the date of the opening of this history he led about as hard a life as fate could find for any man some people may have heard of sugar drogers or sailing brigs which trade between this country and the west indies carrying coal outwards and sugar home  on board one of these owen davies worked in various capacities for thirteen long years he did his drudgery well but he made no friends and always remained the same shy silent and pious man then suddenly a relation died without a will and he found himself heirinlaw to bryngelly castle and all its revenues owen expressed no surprise and to all appearance felt none he had never seen his relation and never dreamed of this romantic devolution of great estates upon himself but he accepted the good fortune as he had accepted the ill and said nothing the only people who knew him were his shipmates and they could scarcely be held to know him they were acquainted with his appearance and the sound of his voice and his method of doing his duty also they were aware although he never spoke of religion that he read a chapter of the bible every evening and went to church whenever they touched at a port but of his internal self they were in total ignorance this did not however prevent them from prophesying that davies was a deep one who now that he had got the cash would blue it in a way which would astonish them  but davies did not excel in azure feats the news of his good fortune reached him just as the brig on which he was going to sail as firstmate was taking in her cargo for the west indies he had signed his contract for the voyage and to the utter astonishment of the lawyer who managed the estates he announced that he should carry it out in vain did the man of affairs point out to his client that with the help of a cheque of ¬£100 he could arrange the matter for him in ten minutes mr davies merely replied that the property could wait he should go the voyage and retire afterwards the lawyer held up his hands and then suddenly remembered that there are women in the west indies as in other parts of the world doubtless his queer client had an object in this voyage as a matter of fact he was totally wrong owen davies had never interchanged a tender word with a woman in his life he was a creature of routine and it was part of his routine to carry out his agreements to the letter that was all  as a last resource the lawyer suggested that mr davies should make a will  i do not think it necessary was the slow and measured answer the property has come to me by chance if i die it may as well go to somebody else in the same way  the lawyer stared very well he said it is against my advice but you must please yourself do you want any money  owen thought for a moment yes he said i think i should like to have ten pounds they are building a theatre there and i want to subscribe to it  the lawyer gave him the ten pounds without a word he was struck speechless and in this condition he remained for some minutes after the door had closed behind his client then he sprung up with a single ejaculation mad mad like his great uncle  but owen davies was not in the least mad at any rate not then he was only a creature of habit in due course his agreement fulfilled he sailed his brig home from the west indies for the captain was drowned in a gale then he took a secondclass ticket to bryngelly where he had never been in his life before and asked his way to the castle he was told to go to the beach and he would see it he did so leaving his seachest behind him and there about two hundred paces from the land and built upon a solitary mountain of rock measuring half a mile or so round the base he perceived a vast medi√¶val pile of fortified buildings with turrets towering three hundred feet into the air and edged with fire by the setting sun he gazed on it with perplexity could it be that this enormous island fortress belonged to him and if so how on earth did one get to it for some little time he walked up and down wondering too shy to go to the village for information meanwhile though he did not notice her a wellgrown girl of about fifteen remarkable for her great grey eyes and the promise of her beauty was watching his evident perplexity from a seat beneath a rock not without amusement at last she rose and with the confidence of bold fifteen walked straight up to him  do you want to get the castle sir she asked in a low sweet voice the echoes of which owen davies never forgot  yesoh i beg your pardon for now for the first time he saw that he was talking to a young lady  then i am afraid that you are too latemrs thomas will not show people over after four oclock she is the housekeeper you know  ah well the fact is i did not come to see over the place i came to live there i am owen davies and the place was left to me  beatrice for of course it was she stared at him in amazement so this was the mysterious sailor about whom there had been so much talk in bryngelly  oh she said with embarrassing frankness what an odd way to come home well it is high tide and you will have to take a boat i will show you where you can get one old edward will row you across for sixpence and she led the way round a corner of the beach to where old edward sat from early morn to dewy eve upon the thwarts of his biggest boat seeking those whom he might row  edward said the young lady here is the new squire mr owen davies who wants to be rowed across to the castle edward a gnarled and twisted specimen of the sailor tribe with small eyes and a face that reminded the observer of one of those quaint countenances on the handle of a walking stick stared at her in astonishment and then cast a look of suspicion on the visitor  have he got papers of identification about him miss he asked in a stage whisper  i dont know she answered laughing he says that he is mr owen davies  well praps he is and praps he aint anyway it isnt my affair and sixpence is sixpence  all of this the unfortunate mr davies overheard and it did not add to his equanimity  now sir if you please said edward sternly as he pulled the little boat up to the edge of the breakwater a vision of mrs thomas shot into owens mind if the boatman did not believe in him what chance had he with the housekeeper he wished he had brought the lawyer down with him and then he wished that he was back in the sugar brig  now sir said edward still more sternly putting down his hesitation to an impostors consciousness of guilt  um said owen to the young lady i beg your pardon i dont even know your name and i am sure i have no right to ask it but would you mind rowing across with me it would be so kind of you you might introduce me to the housekeeper  again beatrice laughed the merry laugh of girlhood she was too young to be conscious of any impropriety in the situation and indeed there was none but her sense of humour told her that it was funny and she became possessed with a not unnatural curiosity to see the thing out  oh very well she said i will come  the boat was pushed off and very soon they reached the stone quay that bordered the harbour of the castle about which a little village of retainers had grown up seeing the boat arrive some of these people sauntered out of the cottages and then thinking that a visitor had come under the guidance of miss beatrice to look at the antiquities of the castle which was the show place of the neighbourhood sauntered back again then the pair began the zigzag ascent of the rock mountain till at last they stood beneath the mighty mass of building which although it was hoary with antiquity was by no means lacking in the comforts of modern civilization the water for instance being brought in pipes laid beneath the sea from a mountain top two miles away on the mainland  isnt there a view here said beatrice pointing to the vast stretch of land and sea i think mr davies that you have the most beautiful house in the whole world your greatuncle who died a year ago spent more than fifty thousand pounds on repairing and refurbishing it they say he built the big drawingroom there where the stone is a little lighter it is fiftyfive feet long just think fifty thousand pounds  it is a large sum said owen in an unimaginative sort of way while in his heart he wondered what on earth he should do with this white elephant of a medi√¶val castle and its drawing room fiftyfive feet long  he does not seem much impressed thought beatrice to herself as she tugged away at the postern bell i think he must be stupid he looks stupid  presently the door was opened by an activelooking little old woman with a high voice  mrs thomas thought owen to himself she is even worse than i expected  now you must please to go away began the formidable housekeeper in her shrillest key it is too late to show visitors over why bless us its you miss beatrice with a strange man what do you want  beatrice looked at her companion as a hint that he should explain himself but he said nothing  this is your new squire she said not without a certain pride i found him wandering about the beach he did not know how to get here so i brought him over  lord miss beatrice and how do you know its him said mrs thomas how do you know it aint a housebreaker  oh im sure he cannot be answered beatrice aside because he isnt clever enough  then followed a long discussion mrs thomas stoutly refused to admit the stranger without evidence of identity and beatrice embracing his cause as stoutly pressed his claims as for the lawful owner he made occasional feeble attempts to prove that he was himself but mrs thomas was not to be imposed upon in this way at last they came to a dead lock  yd better go back to the inn sir said mrs thomas with scathing sarcasm and come up tomorrow with proofs and your luggage  havent you got any letters with you suggested beatrice as a last resource  as it happened owen had a letter one from the lawyer to himself about the property and mentioning mrs thomass name as being in charge of the castle he had forgotten all about it but at this interesting juncture it was produced and read aloud by beatrice mrs thomas took it and having examined it carefully through her hornrimmed spectacles was constrained to admit its authenticity  im sure i apologise sir she said with a halfdoubtful courtesy and much tact but one cant be too careful with all these trampseses about i never should have thought from the look of you sir how as you was the new squire  this might be candid but it was not flattering and it caused beatrice to snigger behind her handkerchief in true schoolgirl fashion however they entered and were led by mrs thomas with solemn pomp through the great and little halls the stone parlour and the oak parlour the library and the huge drawingroom in which the white heads of marble statues protruded from the bags of brown holland wherewith they were wrapped about in a manner ghastly to behold at length they reached a small octagonshaped room that facing south commanded a most glorious view of sea and land it was called the ladys boudoir and joined another of about the same size which in its former owners time had been used as a smokingroom  if you dont mind madam said the lord of all this magnificence i should like to stop here i am getting tired of walking and there he stopped for many years the rest of the castle was shut up he scarcely ever visited it except occasionally to see that the rooms were properly aired for he was a methodical man  as for beatrice she went home still chuckling to receive a severe reproof from elizabeth for her forwardness but owen davies never forgot the debt of gratitude he owed her in his heart he felt convinced that had it not been for her he would have fled before mrs thomas and her hornrimmed eyeglasses to return no more the truth of the matter was however that young as was beatrice he fell in love with her then and there only to fall deeper and deeper into that drear abyss as years went on he never said anything about it he scarcely even gave a hint of his hopeless condition though of course beatrice divined something of it as soon as she came to years of discretion but there grew up in owens silent lonely breast a great and overmastering desire to make this greyeyed girl his wife he measured time by the intervals that elapsed between his visions of her no period in his life was so wretched and utterly purposeless as those two years which passed while she was at her training college he was a very passive lover as yet his gathering passion did not urge him to extremes and he could never make up his mind to declare it the box was in his hand but he feared to throw the dice  but he drew as near to her as he dared once he gave beatrice a flower it was when she was seventeen and awkwardly expressed a hope that she would wear it for his sake the words were not much and the flower was not much but there was a look about the mans eyes and a suppressed passion and energy in his voice which told their tale to the keenwitted girl after this he found that she avoided him and bitterly regretted his boldness for beatrice did not like him in that way to a girl of her curious stamp his wealth was nothing she did not covet wealth she coveted independence and had the sense to know that marriage with such a man would not bring it a cage is a cage whether the bars are of iron or gold he bored her she despised him for his want of intelligence and enterprise that a man with all this wealth and endless opportunity should waste his life in such fashion was to her a thing intolerable she knew if she had half his chance that she would make her name ring from one end of europe to the other in short beatrice held owen as deeply in contempt as her sister elizabeth studying him from another point of view held him in reverence and putting aside any human predilections beatrice would never have married a man whom she despised she respected herself too much  owen davies saw all this as through a glass darkly and in his own slow way cast about for a means of drawing near he discovered that beatrice was passionately fond of learning and also that she had no means to obtain the necessary books so he threw open his library to her it was one of the best in wales he did more he gave orders to a london bookseller to forward him every new book of importance that appeared in certain classes of literature and all of these he placed at her disposal having first carefully cut the leaves with his own hand this was a bait beatrice could not resist she might dread or even detest mr davies but she loved his books and if she quarrelled with him her well of knowledge would simply run dry for there were no circulating libraries at bryngelly and if there had been she could not have afforded to subscribe to them so she remained on good terms with him and even smiled at his futile attempts to keep pace with her studies poor man reading did not come naturally to him he was much better at cutting leaves he studied the times and certain religious works that was all but he wrestled manfully with many a detested tome in order to be able to say something to beatrice about it and the worst of it was that beatrice always saw through it and showed him that she did it was not kind perhaps but youth is cruel  and so the years wore on till at length beatrice knew that a crisis was at hand even the tardiest and most retiring lover must come to the point at last if he is in earnest and owen davies was very much in earnest of late to her dismay he had so far come out of his shell as to allow himself to be nominated a member of the school council of course she knew that this was only to give him more opportunities of seeing her as a member of the council he could visit the school of which she was mistress as often as he chose and indeed he soon learned to take a lively interest in village education about twice a week he would come in just as the school was breaking up and offer to walk home with her seeking for a favourable opportunity to propose hitherto she had always warded off this last event but she knew that it must happen not that she was actually afraid of the man himself he was too much afraid of her for that what she did fear was the outburst of wrath from her father and sister when they learned that she had refused owen davies it never occurred to her that elizabeth might be playing a hand of her own in the matter  from all of which it will be clear if indeed it has not become so already that beatrice granger was a somewhat illregulated young woman born to bring trouble on herself and all connected with her had she been otherwise she would have taken her good fortune and married owen davies in which case her history need never have been written    chapter vii  a matrimonial tale  before geoffrey bingham dropped off into a troubled sleep on that eventful night of storm he learned that the girl who had saved his life at the risk and almost at the cost of her own was out of danger and in his own and more reticent way he thanked providence as heartily as did owen davies then he went to sleep  when he woke feeling very sick and so stiff and sore that he could scarcely move the broad daylight was streaming through the blinds the place was perfectly quiet for the doctors assistant who had brought him back to life and who lay upon a couch at the further end of the room slept the sleep of youth and complete exhaustion only an eightday clock on the mantelpiece ticked in that solemn and aggressive way which clocks affect in the stillness geoffrey strained his eyes to make out the time and finally discovered that it wanted a few minutes to six oclock then he fell to wondering how miss granger was and to repeating in his own mind every scene of their adventure till the last when they were whirled out of the canoe in the embrace of that whitecrested billow  he remembered nothing after that nothing but a rushing sound and a vision of foam he shuddered a little as he thought of it for his nerves were shaken it is not pleasant to have been so very near the end and the beginning and then his heart went out with renewed gratitude towards the girl who had restored him to life and light and hope just at this moment he thought that he heard a sound of sobbing outside the window he listened the sound went on he tried to rise only to find that he was too stiff to manage it so as a last resource he called the doctor  what is the matter answered that young gentleman jumping up with the alacrity of one accustomed to be suddenly awakened do you feel queer  yes i do rather answered geoffrey but it isnt that there is somebody crying outside here  the doctor put on his coat and going to the window drew the blind  why so there is he said its a little girl with yellow hair and without a hat  a little girl answered geoffrey why it must be effie my daughter please let her in  all right cover yourself up and i can do that through the window it isnt five feet from the ground accordingly he opened the window and addressing the little girl asked her what her name was  effie she sobbed in answer effie bingham ive come to look for daddie  all right my dear dont cry so your daddie is here come and let me lift you in  another moment and there appeared through the open window the very sweetest little face and form that ever a girl of six was blessed with for the face was pink and white and in it were set two beautiful dark eyes which contrasting with the golden hair made the child a sight to see but alas just now the cheeks were stained with tears and round the large dark eyes were rings almost as dark nor was this all the little dress was hooked awry on one tiny foot all drenched with dew there was no boot and on the yellow curls no hat  oh daddie daddie cried the child catching sight of him and struggling to reach her fathers arms you isnt dead is you daddie  no my love no answered her father kissing her why should you think that i was dead didnt your mother tell you that i was safe  oh daddie she answered they came and said that you was drownded and i cried and wished that i was drownded too then mother came home at last and said that you were better and was cross with me because i went on crying and wanted to come to you but i did go on crying i cried nearly all night and when it got light i did dress myself all but one shoe and my hat which i could not find and i got out of the house to look for you  and how did you find me my poor little dear  oh i heard mother say you was at the vicarage so i waited till i saw a man and asked him which way to go and he did tell me to walk along the cliff till i saw a long white house and then when he saw that i had no shoe he wanted to take me home but i ran away till i got here but the blinds were down so i did think that you were dead daddie dear and i cried till that gentleman opened the window  after that geoffrey began to scold her for running away but she did not seem to mind it much for she sat upon the edge of the couch her little face resting against his own a very pretty sight to see  you must go back to mrs jones effie and tell your mother where you have been  i cant daddie ive only got one shoe she answered pouting  but you came with only one shoe  yes daddie but i wanted to come and i dont want to go back tell me how you was drownded  he laughed at her logic and gave way to her for this little daughter was very near to his heart nearer than anything else in the world so he told her how he was drownded and how a lady had saved his life  effie listened with wide set eyes and then said that she wanted to see the lady which she presently did at that moment there came a knock at the door and mr granger entered accompanied by dr chambers  how do you do sir said the former i must introduce myself seeing that you are not likely to remember me when last i saw you you looked as dead as a beached dogfish my names granger the reverend j granger vicar of bryngelly one of the very worst livings on this coast and thats saying a great deal  i am sure mr granger im under a deep debt of gratitude to you for your hospitality and under a still deeper one to your daughter but i hope to thank her personally for that  never speak of it said the clergyman hot water and blankets dont cost much and you will have to pay for the brandy and the doctor how is he doctor  he is getting on very well indeed mr granger but i daresay you find yourself rather stiff mr bingham i see your head is pretty badly bruised  yes he answered laughing and so is my body shall i be able to go home today  i think so said the doctor but not before this evening you had better keep quiet till then you will be glad to hear that miss beatrice is getting on very well hers was a wonderful recovery the most wonderful i ever saw i had quite given her up though i should have kept on the treatment for another hour you ought to be grateful to miss beatrice mr bingham but for her you would not have been here  i am most grateful he answered earnestly shall i be able to see her today  yes i think so some time this afternoon say at three oclock is that your little daughter what a lovely child she is well i will look in again about twelve all that you require to do now is to keep quiet and rub in some arnica  about an hour afterwards the servant girl brought geoffrey some breakfast of tea and toast he felt quite hungry but when it came to the pinch he could not eat much effie who was starving made up for this deficiency however she ate all the toast and a couple of slices of bread and butter after it scarcely had they finished when her father observed a shade of anxiety come upon his little daughters face  what is it effie he asked  i think replied effie in evident trepidation i think that i hear mother outside and anne too  well dear they have come to see me  yes and to scold me because i ran away and the child drew nearer to her father in a fashion which would have made it clear to any observer that the relations between her and her mother were somewhat strained  effie was right presently there was a knock at the door and lady honoria entered calm and pale and elegant as ever she was followed by a darkeyed somewhat impertinentlooking french bonne who held up her hands and ejaculated mon dieu as she appeared  i thought so said lady honoria speaking in french to the bonne there she is and she pointed at the runaway effie with her parasol  mon dieu said the woman again vous voil√† enfin et moi qui suis accabl√©e de peur et votre ch√®re m√®re aussi oh mais que cest m√©chant et regardez donc avec un soulier seulement mais cest affreux  hold your tongue said geoffrey sharply and leave miss effie alone she came to see me  anne ejaculated mon dieu once more and collapsed  really geoffrey said his wife the way you spoil that child is something shocking she is wilful as can be and you make her worse it is very naughty of her to run away like that and give us such a hunt how are we to get her home i wonder with only one shoe  her husband bit his lip and his forehead contracted itself above the dark eyes it was not the first time that he and lady honoria had come to words about the child with whom his wife was not in sympathy indeed she had never forgiven effie for appearing in this world at all lady honoria did not belong to that class of women who think maternity is a joy  anne he said take miss effie and carry her till you can find a donkey she can ride back to the lodgings the nurse murmured something in french about the child being as heavy as lead  do as i bid you he said sharply in the same language effie my love give me a kiss and go home thank you for coming to see me  the child obeyed and went lady honoria stood and watched her go tapping her little foot upon the floor and with a look upon her cold handsome face that was not altogether agreeable to see    it had sometimes happened that in the course of his married life geoffrey returned home with a little of that added fondness which absence is fabled to beget on these occasions he was commonly so unfortunate as to find that lady honoria belied the saying that she greeted him with arrears of grievances and was if possible more frigid than ever  was this to be repeated now that he had come back from what was so near to being the longest absence of all it looked like it he noted symptoms of the rising storm symptoms with which he was but too well acquainted and both for his own sake and for hersfor above all things geoffrey dreaded these bitter matrimonial bickeringstried to think of something kind to say it must be owned that he did not show much tact in the subject he selected though it was one which might have stirred the sympathies of some women it is so difficult to remember that one is dealing with a lady honoria  if ever we have another child he began gently  excuse me interrupting you said the lady with a suavity which did not however convey any idea of the speakers inward peace but it is a kindness to prevent you from going on in that line one darling is ample for me  well said the miserable geoffrey with an effort even if you dont care much about the child yourself it is a little unreasonable to object because she cares for me and was sorry when she thought that i was dead really honoria sometimes i wonder if you have any heart at all why should you be put out because effie got up early to come and see mean example which i must admit you did not set her and as to her shoe he added smiling  you may laugh about her shoe geoffrey she interrupted but you forget that even little things like that are no laughing matter now to us the childs shoes keep me awake at night sometimes defoy has not been paid for i dont know how long i have a mind to get her sabotsand as to heart  well broke in geoffrey reflecting that bad as was the emotional side of the question it was better than the commercialas to heart  you are scarcely the person to talk of it that is all i wonder how much of yours you gave me  really honoria he answered not without eagerness and his mind filled with wonder was it possible that his wife had experienced some kind of call and was about to concern herself with his heart one way or the other if so it was strange for she had never shown the slightest interest in it before  yes she went on rapidly and with gathering vehemence you speak about your heartwhich he had not doneand yet you know as well as i do that if i had been a girl of no position you would never have offered me the organ on which you pretend to set so high a value or did your heart run wildly away with you and drag us into love and a cottagea flat i mean if so i should prefer a little less heart and a little more common sense  geoffrey winced twice indeed feeling that her ladyship had hit him as it were with both barrels for as a matter of fact he had not begun with any passionate devotion and again lady honoria and he were now just as poor as though they had really married for love  it is hardly fair to go back on bygones and talk like this he said even if your position had something to do with it only at first of course you must remember that when we married mine was not without attractions two thousand a year to start on and a baronetcy and eight thousand a year in the near future were notbut i hate talking about that kind of thing why do you force me to it nobody could know that my uncle who was so anxious that i should marry you would marry himself at his age and have a son and heir it was not my fault honoria perhaps you would not have married me if you could have foreseen it  very probably not she answered calmly and it is not my fault that i have not yet learned to live with peace of mind and comfort on seven hundred a year it was hard enough to exist on two thousand till your uncle died and now  well and now honoria if you will only have patience and put up with things for a while you shall be rich enough i will make money for you as much money as you want i have many friends i have not done so badly at the bar this year  two hundred pounds nineteen shillings and sevenpence minus ninetyseven pounds rent of chambers and clerk said lady honoria with a disparaging accent on the sevenpence  i shall double it next year and double that again the next and so on i work from morning till night to get on that you may havewhat you live for he said bitterly  ah i shall be sixty before that happy day comes and want nothing but scandal and a bath chair i know the bar and its moaning she added with acid wit you dream you imagine what you would like to come true but you are deceiving me and yourself it will be like the story of sir robert binghams property once again we shall be beggars all our days i tell you geoffrey that you had no right to marry me  then at length he lost his temper this was not the first of these scenesthey had grown frequent of late and this bitter water was constantly dropping  right he said and may i ask what right you had to marry me when you dont even pretend you ever cared one straw for me but just accepted me as you would have accepted any other man who was a tolerably good match i grant that i first thought of proposing to you because my uncle wished it but if i did not love you i meant to be a good husband to you and i should have loved you if you would let me but you are cold and selfish you looked upon a husband merely as a steppingstone to luxury you have never loved anybody except yourself if i had died last night i believe that you would have cared more about having to go into mourning than for the fact of my disappearance from your life you showed no more feeling for me when you came in than you would have if i had been a strangernot so much as some women might have for a stranger i wonder sometimes if you have any feeling left in you at all i should think that you treat me as you do because you do not care for me and do care for some other person did i not know you to be utterly incapable of caring for anybody do you want to make me hate you honoria  geoffreys low concentrated voice and earnest manner told his wife who was watching him with something like a smile upon her clearcut lips how deeply he was moved he had lost his selfcontrol and exposed his heart to hera thing he rarely did and that in itself was a triumph which she did not wish to pursue at the moment geoffrey was not a man to push too far  if you have quite finished geoffrey there is something i should like to say  oh curse it all he broke in  yes she said calmly and interrogatively and made a pause but as he did not specially apply his remark to anybody or anything she continued if these flowers of rhetoric are over what i have to say is this i do not intend to stay in this horrid place any longer i am going tomorrow to my brother garsington they asked us both you may remember but for reasons best known to yourself you would not go  you know my reasons very well honoria  i beg your pardon i have not the slightest idea what they were said lady honoria with conviction may i hear them  well if you wish to know i will not go to the house of a man who haswell left my club as garsington left it and who had it not been for my efforts would have left it in an even more unpleasant and conspicuous fashion and his wife is worse than he is  i think you are mistaken lady honoria said coldly and with the air of a person who shuts the door of a room into which she does not wish to look and any way it all happened years ago and has blown over but i do not see the necessity of discussing the subject further i suppose that we shall meet at dinner tonight i shall take the early train tomorrow  do what suits you honoria perhaps you would prefer not returning at all  thank you no i will not lay myself open to imputations i shall join you in london and will make the best of a bad business thank heaven i have learned how to bear my misfortunes and with this parthian shot she left the room  for a minute or two her husband felt as though he almost hated her then he thrust his face into the pillow and groaned  she is right he said to himself we must make the best of a bad business but somehow i seem to have made a mess of my life and yet i loved her oncefor a month or two  this was not an agreeable scene and it may be said that lady honoria was a vulgar person but not even the advantage of having been brought up on the knees of marchionesses is a specific against vulgarity if a lady happens unfortunately to set her heart what there is of it meanly on mean things    chapter viii  explanatory  about two oclock geoffrey rose and with some slight assistance from his reverend host struggled into his clothes then he lunched and while he did so mr granger poured his troubles into his sympathetic ear  my father was a herefordshire farmer mr bingham he said and i was bred up to that line of life myself he did well my father did as in those days a careful man might what is more he made some money by cattledealing and i think that turned his head a little anyway he was minded to make a gentleman of me as he called it so when i was eighteen i was packed off to be made a parson of whether i liked it or no well i became a parson and for four years i had a curacy at a town called kingston in herefordshire not a bad sort of little townperhaps you happen to know it while i was there my father who was getting beyond himself took to speculating he built a row of villas at leominster or at least he lent a lawyer the money to build them and when they were built nobody would hire them it broke my father he was ruined over those villas i have always hated the sight of a villa ever since mr bingham and shortly afterwards he died as near bankruptcy as a mans nose is to his mouth  after that i was offered this living ¬£150 a year it was at the best and like a fool i took it the old parson who was here before me left an only daughter behind him the living had ruined him as it ruins me and as i say he left his daughter my wife that was behind him and a pretty good bill for dilapidations i had against the estate but there wasnt any estate so i made the best of a bad business and married the daughter and a sweet pretty woman she was poor dear very like my beatrice only without the brains i cant make out where beatrices brains come from indeed for i am sure i dont set up for having any she was well born too my wife was of an old cornish family but she had nowhere to go to and i think she married me because she didnt know what else to do and was fond of the old place she took me on with it as it were well it turned out pretty well till some eleven years ago when our boy was born though i dont think we ever quite understood each other she never got her health back after that and seven years ago she died i remember it was on a night wonderfully like last nightmist first then storm the boy died a few years afterwards i thought it would have broken beatrices heart she has never been the same girl since but always full of queer ideas i dont pretend to follow  and as for the life ive had of it here mr bingham you wouldnt believe it if i was to tell you the living is small enough but the place is as full of dissent as a mackerelboat of fish and as for getting the titheswell i cannot thats all if it wasnt for a bit of farming that i do not but what the prices are down to nothing and for what the visitors give in the season and for the help of beatrices salary as certificated mistress i should have been in the poorhouse long ago and shall be yet i often think i have had to take in a border before now to make both ends meet and shall again i expect  and now i must be off up to my bit of a farm the old sow is due to litter and i want to see how she is getting on please god shell have thirteen again and do well ill order the fly to be here at five though i shall be back before thenthat is i told elizabeth to do so she has gone out to do some visiting for me and to see if she cant get in two pounds five of tithe that has been due for three months if anybody can get it its elizabeth well goodbye if you are dull and want to talk to beatrice she is up and in there i daresay you will suit one another shes a very queer girl beatrice quite beyond me with her ideas and it was a funny thing her holding you so tight but i suppose providence arranged that goodbye for the present mr bingham and this curious specimen of a clergyman vanished leaving geoffrey quite breathless  it was halfpast two oclock and the doctor had told him that he could see miss granger at three he wished that it was three for he was tired of his own thoughts and company and naturally anxious to renew his acquaintance with the strange girl who had begun by impressing him so deeply and ended by saving his life there was complete quiet in the house betty the maidofallwork was employed in the kitchen both the doctors had gone and elizabeth and her father were out today there was no wind it had blown itself away during the night and the sight of the sunbeams streaming through the windows made geoffrey long to be in the open air he had no book at hand to read and whenever he tried to think his mind flew back to that hateful matrimonial quarrel  it was hard on him geoffrey thought that he should be called upon to endure such scenes he could no longer disguise the truth from himselfhe had buried his happiness on his weddingday looking back across the years he well remembered how different a life he had imagined for himself in those days he was tired of knocking about and of youthful escapades even that kind of social success which must attend a young man who was handsome clever a good fellow and blessed with large expectations had at the age of sixandtwenty entirely lost its attractiveness therefore he had turned no deaf ear to his uncle sir robert bingham who was then going on for seventy when he suggested that it might be well of geoffrey settled down and introduced him to lady honoria  lady honoria was eighteen then and a beauty of the rather thin but statuesque type which attracts men up to five or six and twenty and then frequently bores if it does not repel them moreover she was clever and well read and pretended to be intellectually and poetically inclined as ladies not specially favoured by apollo sometimes dobefore they marry cold she always was nobody ever heard of lady honoria stretching the bounds of propriety but geoffrey put this down to a sweet and becoming modesty which would vanish or be transmuted in its season also she affected a charming innocence of all vulgar business matters which both deceived and enchanted him never but once did she allude to ways and means before marriage and then it was to say that she was glad that they should be so poor till dear sir robert died he had promised to allow them fifteen hundred a year and they had seven more between them as this would enable them to see so much more of each other  at last came the happy day and this white virgin soul passed into geoffreys keeping for a week or so things went fairly well and then disenchantment began he learned by slow but sure degrees that his wife was vain selfish and extravagant and worst of all that she cared very little about him the first shock was when he accidentally discovered four or five days after marriage that honoria was intimately acquainted with every detail of sir robert binghams property and young as she was had already formed a scheme to make it more productive after the old mans death  they went to live in london and there he found that lady honoria although by far too cold and prudent a woman to do anything that could bring a breath of scandal upon her name was as fond of admiration as she was heartless it seemed to geoffrey that he could never be free from the collection of young men who hung about her skirts some of them were very good fellows whom he liked exceedingly still on the whole he would have preferred to remain unmarried and associate with them at the club also the continual round of society and going out brought heavier expenses on him that he could well support and thus little by little poor geoffreys dream of matrimonial bliss faded into thin air but fortunately for himself he possessed a certain share of logic and sweet reasonableness in time he learnt to see that the fault was not altogether with his wife who was by no means a bad sort of woman in her degree but her degree differed from his degree she had married for freedom and wealth and to gain a larger scope wherein to exercise those tastes which inherited disposition and education had given to her as she believed that he had married her because she was the daughter of a peer  lady honoria like many another woman of her stamp was the overbred or sometimes the underbred product of a too civilized age and class those primitive passions and virtues on which her husband had relied to make the happiness of their married life simply did not exist for her the passions had been bred and educated out of her for many generations they have been found inconvenient and disquieting attributes in woman as for the old virtues such as love of children and the ordinary round of domestic duty they simply bored her on the whole though sharp of tongue she rarely lost her temper for her vices like her virtues were of a somewhat negative order but the fury which seized her when she learned for certain that she was to become a mother was a thing that her unfortunate husband never forgot and never wished to see again at length the child was born a fact for which geoffrey at least was very thankful  take it away i do not want to see it said lady honoria to the scandalised nurse when the little creature was brought to her wrapped in its long robes  give it to me nursei do said her husband    from that moment geoffrey gave all the pentup affection of his bruised soul to this little daughter and as the years went on they grew very dear to each other but an activeminded stronghearted ablebodied man cannot take a babe as the sole companion of his existence probably geoffrey would have found this out in time and might have drifted into some mode of life more or less undesirable had not an accident occurred to prevent it in his dotage geoffreys old uncle sir robert bingham fell a victim to the wiles of an adventuress and married her then he promptly died and eight months afterwards a posthumous son was born  to geoffrey this meant ruin his allowance stopped and his expectations vanished at one fell swoop he pulled himself together however as a bravehearted man does under such a shock and going to his wife he explained to her that he must now work for his living begging her to break down the barrier that was between them and give him her sympathy and help she met him with tears and reproaches the one thing that touched her keenly the one thing which she feared and hated was poverty and all that poverty means to women of her rank and nature but there was no help for it the charming house in bolton steet had to be given up and purgatory must be faced in a flat near the edgware road lady honoria was miserable indeed had it not been that fortunately for herself she possessed plenty of relations more or less grand whom she might continually visit for weeks and even for months at a stretch she could scarcely have endured her altered life  but strangely enough geoffrey soon found that he was happier than he had been since his marriage to begin with he set to work like a man and work is a great source of happiness to all vigorousminded folk it is not in truth a particularly cheerful occupation to pass endless days in hanging about lawcourts amongst a crowd of unbriefed juniors and many nights in reading up the law one has forgotten and threading the many intricacies of the judicature act but it happened that his father a younger brother of sir roberts had been a solicitor and though he was dead and all direct interest with the firm was severed yet another uncle remained in it and the partners did not forget geoffrey in his difficulties  they sent him what work they could without offending their standing counsel and he did it well then by degrees he built up quite a large general practice of the kind known as deviling now there are few things more unsatisfactory than doing another mans work for nothing but every case fought means knowledge gained and what is more it is advertisement so it came to pass that within less than two years from the date of his money misfortunes geoffrey binghams dark handsome face and square strong form became very well known in the courts  what is that mans name said one wellknown qc to another still more well known as they sat waiting for their chops in the bar grill room and saw geoffrey his wig pushed back from his forehead striding through the doorway on the last day of the sitting which preceded the commencement of this history  bingham answered the other hes only begun to practise lately but hell be at the top of the tree before he has done he married very well you know old garsingtons daughter a charming woman and handsome too  he looks like it grunted the first and as a matter of fact such was the general opinion  for as beatrice had said geoffrey bingham was a man who had success written on his forehead it would have been almost impossible for him to fail in whatever he undertook    chapter ix  what beatrice dreamed  geoffrey lay upon his back watching the still patch of sunshine and listening to the ticking of the clock as he passed all these and many other events in solemn review till the series culminated in his vivid recollection of the scene of that very morning  i am sick of it he said at last aloud sick and tired she makes my life wretched if it wasnt for effie upon my word id    by jove it is three oclock i will go and see miss granger shes a woman not a female ghost at any rate though she is a freethinkerwhich he added as he slowly struggled off the couch is a very foolish thing to be  very shakily for he was sadly knocked about geoffrey hobbled down the long narrow room and through the door which was ajar the opposite door was also set half open he knocked softly and getting no answer pushed it wide and looked in thinking that he had perhaps made some mistake as to the room on a sofa placed about twothirds down its length lay beatrice asleep she was wrapped in a kind of dressinggown of some simple blue stuff and all about her breast and shoulders streamed her lovely curling hair her sweet face was towards him its pallor relieved only by the long shadow of the dark lashes and the bent bow of the lips one white wrist and hand hung down almost to the floor and beneath the spread curtain of the sunlit hair her bosom heaved softly in her sleep she looked so wondrously beautiful in her rest that he stopped almost awed and gazed and gazed again feeling as though a present sense and power were stilling his heart to silence it is dangerous to look upon such quiet loveliness and very dangerous to feel that pressure at the heart a truly wise man feeling it would have fled knowing that seeds sown in such silences may live to bloom upon a bitter day and shed their fruit into the waters of desolation but geoffrey was not wisewho would have been he still stood and gazed till the sight stamped itself so deeply on the tablets of his heart that through all the years to come no heats of passion no frosts of doubt and no sense of loss could ever dull its memory  the silent sun shone on the silent woman slept and in silence the watcher gazed and as he looked a great fear a prescience of evil that should come entered into geoffrey and took possession of him a cloud without crossed the ray of sunlight and turned it it wavered for a second it rested on his breast flashed back to hers then went out and as it flashed and died he seemed to know that henceforth for life till death ay and beyond his fate and that sleeping womans were one fate it was but a momentary knowledge the fear shook him and was gone almost before he understood its foolishness but it had been with him and in after days he remembered it  just then beatrice woke opening her grey eyes their dreamy glance fell upon him looking through him and beyond him rather than at him then she raised herself a little and stretching out both her arms towards him spoke aloud  so have you have come back to me at last she said i knew that you would come and i have waited  he made no answer he did not know what to say indeed he began to think that he also must be dreaming for a little while beatrice still looked at him in the same absent manner then suddenly started up the red blood streaming to her brow  why mr bingham she said is it really you what was it that i said oh pray forgive me whatever it was i have been asleep dreaming such a curious dream and talking in my sleep  do not alarm yourself miss granger he answered recovering himself with a jerk you did not say anything dreadful only that you were glad to see me what were you dreaming about  beatrice looked at him doubtfully perhaps his words did not ring quite true  i think that i had better tell you as i have said so much she answered besides it was a very curious dream and if i believed in dreams it would rather frighten me only fortunately i do not sit down and i will tell it to you before i forget it it is not very long  he took the chair to which she pointed and she began speaking in the voice of one yet laden with the memories of sleep  i dreamed that i stood in space far to my right was a great globe of light and to my left was another globe and i knew that the globes were named life and death from the globe on the right to the globe on the left and back again a golden shuttle in which two flaming eyes were set was shot continually and i knew also that this was the shuttle of destiny weaving the web of fate presently the shuttle flew leaving behind it a long silver thread and the eyes in the shuttle were such as your eyes again the shuttle sped through space and this time its eyes were like my eyes and the thread it left behind it was twisted from a womans hair half way between the globes of life and death my thread was broken but the shuttle flew on and vanished for a moment the thread hung in air then a wind rose and blew it so that it floated away like a spiders web till it struck upon your silver thread of life and began to twist round and round it as it twisted it grew larger and heavier till at last it was thick as a great tress of hair and the silver line bent beneath the weight so that i saw it soon must break then while i wondered what would happen a white hand holding a knife slid slowly down the silver line and with the knife severed the wrappings of womans hair which fell and floated slowly away like a little cloud touched with sunlight till they were lost in darkness but the thread of silver that was your line of life sprang up quivering and making a sound like sighs till at last it sighed itself to silence  then i seemed to sleep and when i woke i was floating upon such a misty sea as we saw last night i had lost all sight of land and i could not remember what the stars were like nor how i had been taught to steer nor understand where i must go i called to the sea and asked it of the stars and the sea answered me thus  hope has rent her raiment and the stars are set  i called again and asked of the land where i should go and the land did not answer but the sea answered me a second time  child of the mist wander in the mist and in darkness seek for light  then i wept because hope had rent her starry garment and in darkness i must seek for light and while i still wept you rose out of the sea and sat before me in the boat i had never seen you before and still i felt that i had known you always you did not speak and i did not speak but you looked into my heart and saw its trouble then i looked into your heart and read what was written and this was written  woman whom i knew before the past began and whom i shall know when the future is ended why do you weep  and my heart answered i weep because i am lost upon the waters of the earth because hope has rent her starry robes and in everlasting darkness i must seek for light that is not then your heart said i will show you light and bending forward you touched me on the breast  and suddenly an agony shook me like the agonies of birth and death and the sky was full of greatwinged angels who rolled up the mist as a cloth and drew the veils from the eyes of night and there her feet upon the globe and her starset head piercing the firmament of heaven stood hope breathing peace and beauty she looked north and south and east and west then she looked upwards through the arching vaults of heaven and wherever she set her eyes bright with holy tears the darkness shrivelled and sorrow ceased and from corruption arose the incorruptible i gazed and worshipped and as i did so again the sea spoke unquestioned  in darkness thou hast found light in death seek for wisdom  then once more hope rent her starry robes and the angels drew down a veil over the eyes of night and the sea swallowed me and i sank till i reached the deep foundations of mortal death and there in the halls of death i sat for ages upon ages till at last i saw you come and on your lips was the word of wisdom that makes all things clear but what it was i cannot remember then i stretched out my hand to greet you and woke and that is all my dream    beatrice ceased her grey eyes set wide as though they still strove to trace their spiritual vision upon the air of earth her breast heaving and her lips apart  great heaven he said what an imagination you must have to dream such a dream as that  imagination she answered returning to her natural manner i have none mr bingham i used to have but i lost it when i losteverything else can you interpret my dream of course you cannot it is nothing but nonsensesuch stuff as dreams are made of that is all  it may be nonsense i daresay it is but it is beautiful nonsense he answered i wish ladies had more of such stuff to give the world  ah well dreams may be wiser than wakings and nonsense than learned talk for all we know but theres an end of it i do not know why i repeated it to you i am sorry that i did repeat it but it seemed so real it shook me out of myself this is what comes of breaking in upon the routine of life by being three parts drowned one finds queer things at the bottom of the sea you know by the way i hope that you are recovering i do not think that you will care to go canoeing again with me mr bingham  there was an opening for a compliment here but geoffrey felt that it would be too much in earnest if spoken so he resisted the temptation  what miss granger he said should a man say to a lady who but last night saved his life at the risk indeed almost at the cost of her own  it was nothing she answered colouring i clung to you that was all more by instinct than from any motive i think i had a vague idea that you might float and support me  miss granger the occasion is too serious for polite fibs i know how you saved my life i do not know how to thank you for it  then dont thank me at all mr bingham why should you thank me i only did what i was bound to do i would far rather die than desert a companion in distress of any sort we all must die but it would be dreadful to die ashamed you know what they say that if you save a person from drowning you will do them an injury afterwards that is how they put it here in some parts the saying is the other way about but i am not likely ever to do you an injury so it does not make me unhappy it was an awful experience you were senseless so you cannot know how strange it felt lying upon the slippery rock and seeing those great white waves rush upon us through the gloom with nothing but the night above and the sea around and death between the two i have been lonely for many years but i do not think that i ever quite understood what loneliness really meant before you see she added by way of an afterthought i thought that you were dead and there is not much company in a corpse  well he said one thing is it would have been lonelier if we had gone  do you think so she answered looking at him inquiringly i dont quite see how you make that out if you believe in what we have been taught as i think you do wherever it was you found yourself there would be plenty of company and if like me you do not believe in anything why then you would have slept and sleep asks for nothing  did you believe in nothing when you lay upon the rock waiting to be drowned miss granger  nothing she answered only weak people find revelation in the extremities of fear if revelation comes at all surely it must be born in the heart and not in the senses i believed in nothing and i dreaded nothing except the agony of death why should i be afraid supposing that i am mistaken and there is something beyond is it my fault that i cannot believe what have i done that i should be afraid i have never harmed anybody that i know of and if i could believe i would i wish i had died she went on passionately it would be all over now i am tired of the world tired of work and helplessness and all the little worries which wear one out i am not wanted here i have nothing to live for and i wish that i had died  some day you will think differently miss granger there are many things that a woman like yourself can live forat the least there is your work  she laughed drearily my work if you only knew what it is like you would not talk to me about it every day i roll my stone up the hill and every night it seems to roll down again but you have never taught in a village school how can you know i work all day and in the evening perhaps i have to mend the tablecloths orwhat do you thinkwrite my fathers sermons it sounds curious does it not that i should write sermons but i do i wrote the one he is going to preach next sunday it makes very little difference to him what it is so long as he can read it and of course i never say anything which can offend anybody and i do not think that they listen much very few people go to church in bryngelly  dont you ever get any time to yourself then  oh yes sometimes i do and then i go out in my canoe or read and am almost happy after all mr bingham it is very wrong and ungrateful of me to speak like this i have more advantages than ninetenths of the world and i ought to make the best of them i dont know why i have been speaking as i have and to you whom i never saw till yesterday i never did it before to any living soul i assure you it is just like the story of the man who came here last year with the divining rod there is a cottage down on the cliffit belongs to mr davies who lives in the castle well they have no drinking water near and the new tenant made a great fuss about it so mr davies hired men and they dug and dug and spent no end of money but could not come to water at last the tenant fetched an old man from some parish a long way off who said that he could find springs with a divining rod he was a curious old man with a crutch and he came with his rod and hobbled about till at last the rod twitched just at the tenants back doorat least the diviner said it did at any rate they dug there and in ten minutes struck a spring of water which bubbled up so strongly that it rushed into the house and flooded it and what do you think after all the water was brackish you are the man with the divining rod mr bingham and you have made me talk a great deal too much and after all you see it is not nice talk you must think me a very disagreeable and wicked young woman and i daresay i am but somehow it is a relief to open ones mind i do hope mr bingham that you will seein short that you will not misunderstand me  miss granger he answered there is between us that which will always entitle us to mutual respect and confidencethe link of life and death had it not been for you i should not sit here to listen to your confidence today you may tell me that a mere natural impulse prompted you to do what you did i know better it was your will that triumphed over your natural impulse towards selfpreservation well i will say no more about it except this if ever a man was bound to a woman by ties of gratitude and respect i am bound to you you need not fear that i shall take advantage of or misinterpret your confidence here he rose and stood before her his dark handsome face bowed in proud humility miss granger i look upon it as an honour done to me by one whom henceforth i must reverence among all women the life you gave back to me and the intelligence which directs it are in duty bound to you and i shall not forget the debt  beatrice listened to his words spoken in that deep and earnest voice which in after years became so familiar to her majestys judges and to parliamentlistened with a new sense of pleasure rising in her heart she was this mans equal what he could dare she could dare where he could climb she could followay and if need be show the path and she felt that he acknowledged it in his sight she was something more than a handsome girl to be admired and deferred to for her beautys sake he had placed her on another levelone perhaps that few women would have wished to occupy but beatrice was thankful to him it was the first taste of supremacy that she had ever known  it is something to stir the proud heart of such a woman as beatrice in that moment when for the first time she feels herself a conqueror victorious not through the vulgar advantage of her sex not by the submission of mans coarser sense but rather by the overbalancing weight of mind  do you know she said suddenly looking up you make me very proud and she stretched out her hand to him  he took it and bending touched it with his lips there was no possibility of misinterpreting the action and though she coloured a littlefor till then no man had even kissed the tip of her fingershe did not misinterpret it it was an act of homage and that was all  and so they sealed the compact of their perfect friendship for ever and a day  then came a moments silence it was geoffrey who broke it  miss granger he said will you allow me to preach you a lecture a very short one  go on she said  very well do not blame me if you dont like it and do not set me down as a prig though i am going to tell you your faults as i read them in your own words you are proud and ambitious and the cramped lines in which you are forced to live seem to strangle you you have suffered and have not learned the lesson of sufferinghumility you have set yourself up against fate and fate sweeps you along like spray upon the gale yet you go unwilling in your impatience you have flown to learning for refuge and it has completed your overthrow for it has induced you to reject as nonexistent all that you cannot understand because your finite mind cannot search infinity because no answer has come to all your prayers because you see misery and cannot read its purpose because you suffer and have not found rest you have said there is naught but chance and become an atheist as many have done before you is it not true  go on she answered bowing her head to her breast so that the long rippling hair almost hid her face  it seems a little odd geoffrey said with a short laugh that i with all my imperfections heaped upon me should presume to preach to youbut you will know best how near or how far i am from the truth so i want to say something i have lived for thirtyfive years and seen a good deal and tried to learn from it and i know this in the long run unless we of our own act put away the opportunity the world gives us our due which generally is not much so much for things temporal if you are fit to rule in time you will rule if you do not then be content and acknowledge your own incapacity and as for things spiritual i am sure of thisthough of course one does not like to talk much of these mattersif you only seek for them long enough in some shape you will find them though the shape may not be that which is generally recognised by any particular religion but to build a wall deliberately between oneself and the unseen and then complain that the way is barred is simply childish  and what if ones wall is built mr bingham  most of us have done something in that line at different times he answered and found a way round it  and if it stretches from horizon to horizon and is higher than the clouds what then  then you must find wings and fly over it  and where can any earthly woman find those spiritual wings she asked and then sank her head still deeper on her breast to cover her confusion for she remembered that she had heard of wanderers in the dusky groves of human passion yes even m√¶nad wanderers who had suddenly come face to face with their own soul and that the cruel paths of earthly love may yet lead the feet which tread them to the ivory gates of heaven  and remembering these beautiful myths though she had no experience of love and knew little of its ways beatrice grew suddenly silent nor did geoffrey give her an answer though he need scarcely have feared to do so  for were they not discussing a purely abstract question    chapter x  lady honoria makes arrangements  in another moment somebody entered the room it was elizabeth she had returned from her tithe collecting expeditionwith the tithe the door of the sittingroom was still ajar and geoffrey had his back towards it so it happened that nobody heard elizabeths rather catlike step and for some seconds she stood in the doorway without being perceived she stood quite still taking in the whole scene at a glance she noticed that her sister held her head down so that her hair shadowed her and guessed that she did so for some reasonprobably because she did not wish her face to be seen or was it to show off her lovely hair she noticed also the half shy half amused and altogether interested expression upon geoffreys countenanceshe could see that in the little giltedged lookingglass which hung over the fireplace nor did she overlook the general air of embarrassment that pervaded them both  when she came in elizabeth had been thinking of owen davies and of what might have happened had she never seen the tide of life flow back into her sisters veins she had dreamed of it all night and had thought of it all day even in the excitement of extracting the back tithe from the recalcitrant and rather coarseminded welsh farmer with strong views on the subject of tithe it had not been entirely forgotten the farmer was a tenant of owen davies and when he called her a parson in petticoats and wus and went on in delicate reference to her powers of extracting cash to liken her to a twolegged corkscrew only screwier she perhaps not unnaturally reflected that if everpace beatricecertain things should come about she would remember that farmer for elizabeth was blessed with a very long memory as some people had learnt to their cost and generally sooner or later she paid her debts in full not forgetting the overdue interest  and now as she stood in the doorway unseen and noted these matters something occurred to her in connection with this dominating idea which like ideas in general had many side issues at any rate a look of quick intelligence shone for a moment in her light eyes like a sickly sunbeam on a faint december mist then she moved forward and when she was close behind geoffrey spoke suddenly  what are you both thinking about she said in her clear thin voice you seem to have exhausted your conversation  geoffrey made an exclamation and fairly jumped from his chair a feat which in his bruised condition really hurt him very much beatrice too started violently she recovered herself almost instantly however  how quietly you move elizabeth she said  not more quietly than you sit beatrice i have been wondering when anybody was going to say anything or if you were both asleep  for her part beatrice speculated how long her sister had been in the room their conversation had been innocent enough but it was not one that she would wish elizabeth to have overheard and somehow elizabeth had a knack of overhearing things  you see miss granger said geoffrey coming to the rescue both our brains are still rather waterlogged and that does not tend to a flow of ideas  quite so said elizabeth my dear beatrice why dont you tie up your hair you look like a crazy jane not but what you have very nice hair she added critically do you admire good hair mr bingham  of course i do he answered gallantly but it is not common  only beatrice bit her lip with vexation i had almost forgotten about my hair she said i must apologise for appearing in such a state i would have done it up after dinner only i was too stiff and while i was waiting for betty i went to sleep  i think there is a bit of ribbon in that drawer i saw you put it there yesterday answered the precise elizabeth yes here it is if you like and mr bingham will excuse it i can tie it back for you and without waiting for an answer she passed behind beatrice and gathering up the dense masses of her sisters locks tied them round in such fashion that they could not fall forward though they still rolled down her back  just then mr granger came back from his visit to the farm he was in high good humour the pig had even surpassed her former efforts and increased in a surprising manner to the number of fifteen indeed elizabeth thereon produced the two pounds odd shillings which she had corkscrewed out of the recalcitrant dissenting farmer and the sight added to mr grangers satisfaction  would you believe it mr bingham he said in this miserably paid parish i have nearly a hundred pounds owing to me a hundred pounds in tithe there is old jones who lives out towards the bell rock he owes three years tithethirtyfour pounds eleven and fourpence he can pay and he wont paysays hes a baptist and is not going to pay parsons duesthough for the matter of that he is nothing but an old beer tub of a heathen  why dont you proceed against him then mr granger  proceed i have proceeded ive got judgment and i mean to issue execution in a few days i wont stand it any longer he went on working himself up and shaking his head as he spoke till his thin white hair fell about his eyes i will have the law of him and the others too you are a lawyer and you can help me i tell you theres a spirit abroad which just comes to justno man isnt to pay his lawful debts except of course the parson and the squire they must pay or go to the court but there is law left and ill have it before they play the irish game on us here and he brought down his fist with a bang upon the table  geoffrey listened with some amusement so this was the weak old mans sore pointmoney he was clearly very strong about thatas strong as lady honoria indeed but with more excuse elizabeth also listened with evident approval but beatrice looked pained  dont get angry father she said perhaps he will pay after all it is bad to take the law if you can manage any other wayit breeds so much ill blood  nonsense beatrice said her sister sharply father is quite right theres only one way to deal with them and that is to seize their goods i believe you are socialist about property as you are about everything else you want to pull everything down from the queen to the laws of marriage all for the good of humanity and i tell you that your ideas will be your ruin defy custom and it will crush you you are running your head against a brick wall and one day you will find which is the harder  beatrice flushed but answered her sisters attack which was all the sharper because it had a certain spice of truth in it  i never expressed any such views elizabeth so i do not see why you should attribute them to me i only said that legal proceedings breed bad blood in a parish and that is true  i did not say you expressed them went on the vigorous elizabeth you look themthey ooze out of your words like water from a peat bog everybody knows you are a radical and a freethinker and everything else that is bad and mad and contrary to that state of life in which it has pleased god to call you the end of it will be that you will lose the mistresship of the schooland i think it is very hard on father and me that you should bring disgrace on us with your strange ways and immoral views and now you can make what you like of it  i wish that all radicals were like miss beatrice said geoffrey who was feeling exceedingly uncomfortable with a feeble attempt at polite jocosity but nobody seemed to hear him elizabeth who was now fairly in a rage a faint flush upon her pale cheeks her light eyes all ashine and her thin fingers clasped stood fronting her beautiful sister and breathing spite at every pore but it was easy for geoffrey who was watching her to see that it was not her sisters views she was attacking it was her sister it was that soft strong loveliness and the glory of that face it was the deep gentle mind erring from its very greatness and the bright intellect which lit it like a lamp it was the learning and the power that give them play would set a world aflame as easily as they did the heart of the slowwitted hermit squire whom elizabeth covetedthese were the things that elizabeth hated and bitterly assailed  accustomed to observe geoffrey saw this instantly and then glanced at the father the old man was frightened clearly he was afraid of elizabeth and dreaded a scene he stood fidgeting his feet about and trying to find something to say as he glanced apprehensively at his elder daughter through his thin hanging hair  lastly geoffrey looked at beatrice who was indeed well worth looking at her face was quite pale and the clear grey eyes shone out beneath their dark lashes she had risen drawing herself to her full height which her exquisite proportions seemed to increase and was looking at her sister presently she said one word and one only but it was enough  elizabeth  her sister opened her lips to speak again but hesitated and changed her mind there was something in beatrices manner that checked her  well she said at length you should not irritate me so beatrice  beatrice made no reply she only turned towards geoffrey and with a graceful little bow said  mr bingham i am sure that you will forgive this scene the fact is we all slept badly last night and it has not improved our tempers  there was a pause of which mr granger took a hurried and rather undignified advantage  um ah he said by the way beatrice what was it i wanted to say ah i knowhave you written i mean written out that sermon for next sunday my daughter he added addressing geoffrey in explanationum copies my sermons for me she writes a very good hand  remembering beatrices confidence as to her sermon manufacturing functions geoffrey felt amused at her fathers na√Øve way of describing them and beatrice also smiled faintly as she answered that the sermon was ready just then the roll of wheels was heard without and the only fly that bryngelly could boast pulled up in front of the door  here is the fly come for you mr bingham said mr grangerand as i live her ladyship with it elizabeth see if there isnt some tea ready and the old gentleman who had all the traditional love of the lower middleclass englishman for a title trotted off to welcome her ladyship  presently lady honoria entered the room a sweet if rather a set smile upon her handsome face and with a graceful mien that became her tall figure exceedingly well for to do lady honoria justice she was one of the most ladylike women in the country and so far as her personal appearance went a very perfect type of the class to which she belonged  geoffrey looked at her saying to himself that she had clearly recovered her temper and that he was thankful for it this was not wonderful for it is observable that the more aristocratic a ladys manners are the more disagreeable she is apt to be when she is crossed  well geoffrey dear she said you see i have come to fetch you i was determined that you should not get yourself drowned a second time on your way home how are you nowbut i need not ask you look quite well again  it is very kind of you honoria said her husband simply but it was doubtful if she heard him for at the moment she was engaged in searching out the soul of beatrice with one of the most penetrating and comprehensive glances that young lady had ever enjoyed the honour of receiving there was nothing rude about the look it was too quick but beatrice felt that quick as it might be it embraced her altogether nor was she wrong  there is no doubt about it lady honoria thought to herself she is lovelylovely everywhere it was clever of her to leave her hair down it shows the shape of her head so well and she is tall enough to stand it that blue wrapper suits her too very few women could show such a figure as herslike a greek statue i dont like her she is different from most of us just the sort of girl men go wild about and women hate  all this passed through her mind in a flash for a moment lady honorias blue eyes met beatrices grey ones and she knew that beatrice liked her no better than she did beatrice those eyes were a trifle too honest and like the deep clear water they resembled apt to throw up shadows of the passing thoughts above  false and cold and heartless thought beatrice i wonder how a man like that could marry her and how much he loves her  thus the two women took each others measure at a glance each finding the other wanting by her standard nor did they ever change that hastily formed judgment  it was all done in a few secondsin that hesitating moment before the words we summon answer on our lips the next lady honoria was sweeping towards her with outstretched hand and her most gracious smile  miss granger she said i owe you a debt i never can repaymy dear husbands life i have heard all about how you saved him it is the most wonderful thinggrace darling born again i cant think how you could do it i wish i were half as brave and strong  please dont lady honoria said beatrice i am so tired of being thanked for doing nothing except what it was my duty to do if i had let mr bingham go while i had the strength to hold on to him i should have felt like a murderess today i beg you to say no more about it  one does not often find such modesty united to so much courage and if you will allow me to say it so much beauty answered lady honoria graciously well i will do as you wish but i warn you your fame will find you out i hear they have an account of the whole adventure in todays papers headed a welsh heroine  how did you hear that honoria asked her husband  oh i had a telegram from garsington and he mentions it she answered carelessly  telegram from garsington hence these smiles thought he i suppose that she is going tomorrow  i have some other news for you miss granger went on lady honoria your canoe has been washed ashore very little injured the old boatmanedward i think they call himhas found it and your gun in it too geoffrey it had stuck under the seat or somewhere but i fancy that you must both have had enough canoeing for the present  i dont know lady honoria answered beatrice one does not often get such weather as last nights and canoeing is very pleasant every sweet has its salt you know or in other words one may always be upset  at that moment betty the awkward welsh serving lass with a forearm about as shapely as the hind leg of an elephant and a most unpleasing habit of snorting audibly as she moved shuffled in with the teatray in her wake came the slim elizabeth to whom lady honoria was introduced  after this conversation flagged for a while till lady honoria feeling that things were getting a little dull set the ball rolling again  what a pretty view you have of the sea from these windows she said in her welltrained and monotonously modulated voice i am so glad to have seen it for you know i am going away tomorrow  beatrice looked up quickly  my husband is not going she went on as though in answer to an unspoken question i am playing the part of the undutiful wife and running away from him for exactly three weeks it is very wicked of me isnt it but i have an engagement that i must keep it is most tiresome  geoffrey sipping his tea smiled grimly behind the shelter of his cup she does it uncommonly well he thought to himself  does your little girl go with you lady honoria asked elizabeth  well no i think not i cant bear parting with heryou know how hard it is when one has only one child but i think she would be so bored where i am going to stay for there are no other children there and besides she positively adores the sea so i shall have to leave her to her fathers tender mercies poor dear  i hope effie will survive it i am sure said geoffrey laughing  i suppose that your husband is going to stay on at mrs joness said the clergyman  really i dont know what are you going to do geoffrey mrs joness rooms are rather expensive for people in our impoverished condition besides i am sure that she cannot look after effie just think she has eight children of her own poor old dear and i must take anne with me she is effies french nurse you know a perfect treasure i am going to stay in a big house and my experience of those big houses is that one never gets waited on at all unless one takes a maid you see what is everybodys business is nobodys business im sure i dont know how you will get on with the child geoffrey she takes such a lot of looking after  oh dont trouble about that honoria he answered i daresay that effie and i will manage somehow  here one of those peculiar gleams of intelligence which marked the advent of a new idea passed across elizabeths face she was sitting next her father and bending whispered to him beatrice saw it and made a motion as though to interpose but before she could do so mr granger spoke  look here mr bingham he said if you want to move would you like a room here terms strictly moderate but cant afford to put you up for nothing you know and living rough and ready youd have to take us as you find us but there is a dressingroom next to my room where your little girl could sleep and my daughters would look after her between them and be glad of the job  again beatrice opened her lips as though to speak but closed them without speaking thus do our opportunities pass before we realise that they are at hand  instinctively geoffrey had glanced towards beatrice he did not know if this idea was agreeable to her he knew that her work was hard and he did not wish to put extra trouble upon her for he guessed that the burden of looking after effie would ultimately fall upon her shoulders but her face told him nothing it was quite passive and apparently indifferent  you are very kind mr granger he said hesitating i dont want to go away from bryngelly just at present and it would be a good plan in some ways that is if the trouble to your daughters would not be too much  i am sure that it is an excellent plan broke in lady honoria who feared lest difficulties should arise as to her appropriation of annes services how lucky that i happened to mention it there will be no trouble about our giving up the rooms at mrs joness because i know she has another application for them  very well said geoffrey not liking to raise objections to a scheme thus publicly advocated although he would have preferred to take time to consider something warned him that bryngelly vicarage would prove a fateful abode for him then elizabeth rose and asked lady honoria if she would like to see the rooms her husband and effie would occupy  she said she should be delighted and went off followed by mr granger fussing in the rear  dont you think that you will be a little dull here mr bingham said beatrice  on the contrary he answered why should i be dull i cannot be so dull as i should be by myself  beatrice hesitated and then spoke again we are a curious family mr bingham you may have seen as much this afternoon had you not better think it over  if you mean that you do not want me to come i wont he said rather bluntly and next second felt that he had made a mistake  i beatrice answered opening her eyes i have no wishes in the matter the fact is that we are poor and let lodgingsthat is what it comes to if you think they will suit you you are quite right to take them  geoffrey coloured he was a man who could not bear to lay himself open to the smallest rebuff from a woman and he had brought this on himself beatrice saw it and relented  of course mr bingham so far as i am concerned i shall be the gainer if you do come i do not meet so many people with whom i care to associate and from whom i can learn that i wish to throw a chance away  i think you misunderstand me a little he said i only meant that perhaps you would not wish to be bothered with effie miss granger  she laughed why i love children it will be a great pleasure to me to look after her so far as i have time  just then the others returned and their conversation came to an end  its quite delightful geoffreysuch funny oldfashioned rooms i really envy you if there was one thing in the world that lady honoria hated it was an oldfashioned room well and now we must be going oh you poor creature i forgot that you were so knocked about i am sure mr granger will give you his arm  mr granger ambled forward and geoffrey having made his adieus and borrowed a clerical hat mr grangers concession to custom for in most other respects he dressed like an ordinary farmer was safely conveyed to the fly  and so ended geoffreys first day at bryngelly vicarage    chapter xi  beatrice makes an appointment  lady honoria leaned back in the cab and sighed a sigh of satisfaction  that is a capital idea she said i was wondering what arrangements you could make for the next three weeks it is ridiculous to pay three guineas a week for rooms just for you and effie the old gentleman only wants that for board and lodging together for i asked him  i daresay it will do said geoffrey when are we to shift  tomorrow in time for dinner or rather supper these barbarians eat supper you know i go by the morning train you see so as to reach garsington by teatime i daresay you will find it rather dull but you like being dull the old clergyman is a low stamp of man and a bore and as for the eldest daughter elizabeth shes too awfulshe reminds me of a rat but beatrice is handsome enough though i think her horrid too youll have to console yourself with her and i daresay you will suit each other  why do you think her horrid honoria  oh i dont know she is clever and odd and i hate odd women why cant they be like other people think of her being strong enough to save your life like that too she must have the muscle of an amazonits downright unwomanly but there is no doubt about her beauty she is as nearly perfect as any girl i ever saw though too independent looking if only one had a daughter like that how one might marry her i would not look at anything under twenty thousand a year she is too good for that lumbering welsh squire shes engaged toothe man who lives in the castlethough they say that he is fairly rich  engaged said geoffrey how do you know that she is engaged  oh i dont know it at all but i suppose she is if she isnt she soon will be for a girl in that position is not likely to throw such a chance away at any rate hes head over ears in love with her i saw that last night he was hanging about for hours in the rain outside the door with a face like a ghost till he knew whether she was dead or alive and he has been there twice to inquire this morning mr granger told me but she is too good for him from a business point of view she might marry anybody if only she were put in the way of it  somehow geoffreys lively interest in beatrice sensibly declined on the receipt of this intelligence of course it was nothing to him indeed he was glad to hear that she was in the way of such a comfortable settlement but it is unfortunately a fact that one cannot be quite as much interested in a young and lovely lady who is the potential property of a lumbering welsh squire as in one who belongs to herself  the old adam still survives in most men however rightthinking they may be and this is one of its methods of selfassertion  well he said i am glad to hear she is in such a good way she deserves it i think the welsh squire is in luck miss granger is a remarkable woman  too remarkable by half said lady honoria drily here we are and there is effie skipping about like a wild thing as usual i think that child is demented  on the following morningit was fridaylady honoria accompanied by anne departed in the very best of tempers for the next three weeks at any rate she would be free from the galling associations of straightened meansfree to enjoy the luxury and refined comfort to which she had been accustomed and for which her soul yearned with a fierce longing that would be incomprehensible to folk of a simpler mind everybody has his or her ideal heaven if only one could fathom it some would choose a sublimated intellectual leisure made happy by the best literature of all the planets some a model state with themselves as presidents in which through their beneficent efforts the latest radical notions could actually be persuaded to work to everybodys satisfaction others a happy hunting ground where the game enjoyed the fun as much as they did and so on ad infinitum  lady honoria was even more modest give her a well appointed town and country house a few powdered footmen plenty of carriages and other needful things including of course the entr√©e to the upper celestial ten and she would ask no more from age to age let us hope that she will get it one day it would hurt nobody and she is sure to find plenty of people of her own way of thinkingthat is if this world supplies the raw material  she embraced effie with enthusiasm and her husband with a chastened warmth and went a pious prayer on her lips that she might never again set eyes upon bryngelly  it will not be necessary for us to follow lady honoria in her travels that afternoon effie and her father had great fun they packed up geoffrey who was rapidly recovering from his stiffness pushed the things into the portmanteaus and effie jumped on them those which would not go in they bundled loose into the fly till that vehicle looked like an old clothes ship then as there was no room left for them inside they walked down to the vicarage by the beach a distance of about threequarters of a mile stopping on their way to admire the beautiful castle in one corner of which owen davies lived and moved  oh daddy said the child i wish you would buy a house like that for you and me to live in why dont you daddy  havent got the money dear he answered  will you ever have the money daddy  i dont know dear perhaps one daywhen i am too old to enjoy it he added to himself  it would take a great many pennies to buy a house like that wouldnt it daddy said effie sagely  yes dear more than you could count he answered and the conversation dropped  presently they came to a boatshed placed opposite the village and close to highwater mark here a man it was old edward was engaged in mending a canoe geoffrey glanced at it and saw that it was the identical canoe out of which he had so nearly been drowned  look effie said he that is the boat out of which i was upset effie opened her wide eyes and stared at the frail craft  it is a horrid boat she said i dont want to look at it  youre quite right little miss said old edward touching his cap it aint safe and somebody will be drowned out of it one of these days i wish it had gone to the bottom i do but miss beatrice she is that foolhardy there aint no doing nothing with her  i fancy that she has learnt a lesson said geoffrey  may be may be grumbled the old man but women folk are hard to teach they never learn nothing till its too late they dont and then when theyve been and done it theyre sorry but whats the good o that  meanwhile another conversation was in progress not more than a quarter of a mile away on the brow of the cliff stood the village of bryngelly and at the back of the village was a school a plain whitewashed building roofed with stone which though amply sufficient and suitable to the wants of the place was little short of an abomination in the eyes of her majestys school inspectors who from time to time descended upon bryngelly for purposes of examination and faultfinding they yearned to see a stately redbrick edifice with all the latest improvements erected at the expense of the ratepayers but as yet they yearned in vain the school was supported by voluntary contributions and thanks to beatrices energy and good teaching the dreaded board with its fads and extravagance had not yet clutched it  beatrice had returned to her duties that afternoon for a nights rest brought back its vigour to her strong young frame she had been greeted with enthusiasm by the children who loved her as well they might for she was very gentle and sweet with them though few dared to disobey her besides her beauty impressed them though they did not know it beauty of a certain sort has perhaps more effect on children than on any other class heedless and selfish as they often seem to be they feel its power it is an outward expression of the thoughts and dreams that bud in their unknowing hearts and is somehow mixed up with their ideas of god and heaven thus there was in bryngelly a little girl of ten a very clever and highly excitable child jane llewellyn by name born of parents of strict calvinistic views as it chanced some months before the opening of this story a tub thumper of high renown and considerable rude oratorical force visited the place and treated his hearers to a lively discourse on the horrors of hell  in the very front row her eyes wide with fear sat this poor little child between her parents who listened to the minister with much satisfaction and a little way back sat beatrice who had come out of curiosity  presently the preacher having dealt sufficiently in terrifying generalities went on to practical illustrations for after the manner of his class he was delivering an extemporary oration look at that child he said pointing to the little girl she looks innocent does she not but if she does not find salvation my brethren i tell you that she is damned if she dies tonight not having found salvation she will go to hell her delicate little body will be tormented for ever and ever  here the unfortunate child fell forward with a shriek  you ought to be ashamed of yourself sir said beatrice aloud  she had been listening to all this illjudged rant with growing indignation and now in her excitement entirely forgot that she was in a place of worship then she ran forward to the child who had swooned poor little unfortunate she never recovered the shock when she came to herself it was found that her finely strung mind had given way and she lapsed into a condition of imbecility but her imbecility was not always passive occasionally fits of passionate terror would seize upon her she would cry out that the fiends were coming to drag her down to torment and dash herself against the wall in fear hideous to behold then it was found that there was but one way to calm her it was to send for beatrice beatrice would come and take the poor thin hands in hers and gaze with her calm deep eyes upon the wasted horrorstricken face till the child grew quiet again and shivering sobbed herself to sleep upon her breast  and so it was with all the children her power over them was almost absolute they loved her and she loved them all  and now the schooling was almost done for the day it was beatrices custom to make the children sing some simple song before they broke up she stood in front of them and gave the time while they sung and a pretty sight it was to see her do it on this particular afternoon just as the first verse was finished the door of the room opened and owen davies entered bearing some books under his arm beatrice glanced round and saw him then with a quick stamp of her foot went on giving the time  the children sung lustily and in front of them stood beatrice dressed in simple white her graceful form swaying as she marked the musics time nearer and nearer drew owen davies till at length he stood quite close his lips slightly apart his eyes fixed upon her like the eyes of one who dreams and his slow heavy face faintly lit with the glow of strong emotion  the song ended the children at a word from their mistress filed past her headed by the pupil teachers and then with a shout seizing their caps ran forth this way and that welcoming the free air when they were all gone and not till then beatrice turned suddenly round  how do you do mr davies she said  he started visibly i did not know that you had seen me he answered  oh yes i saw you mr davies only i could not stop the song to say how do you do by the way i have to thank you for coming to inquire after me  not at all miss beatrice not at all it was a most dreadful accident i cannot tell you how thankful i ami cant indeed  it is very good of you to take so much interest in me said beatrice  not at all miss beatrice not at all whowho could help taking interest in you i have brought you some booksthe life of darwinit is in two volumes i think that i have heard you say that darwin interests you  yes thank you very much have you read it  no but i have cut it darwin doesnt interest me you know i think that he was a rather misguided person may i carry the books home for you  thank you but i am not going straight home i am going to old edwards shed to see my canoe  as a matter of fact this was true but the idea was only that moment born in her mind beatrice had been going home as she wanted to see that all things were duly prepared for geoffrey and his little daughter but to reach the vicarage she must pass along the cliff where there were few people and this she did not wish to do to be frank she feared lest mr davies should take the opportunity to make that offer of his hand and heart which hung over her like a nightmare now the way to edwards shed lay through the village and down the cliff and she knew that he would never propose in the village  it was very foolish of her no doubt thus to seek to postpone the evil day but the strongestminded women have their weak points and this was one of beatrices she hated the idea of this scene she knew that when it did come there would be a scene not that her resolution to refuse the man had ever faltered but it would be painful and in the end it must reach the ears of her father and elizabeth that she had actually rejected mr owen davies and then what would her life be worth she had never suspected it it had never entered into her mind to suspect that though her father might be vexed enough nothing on this earth would more delight the heart of elizabeth  presently having fetched her hat beatrice accompanied by her admirer bearing the life of darwin under his arm started to walk down to the beach they went in silence beatrice just a little ahead she ventured some remark about the weather but owen davies made no reply he was thinking he wanted to say something but he did not know how to say it they were at the head of the cliff now and if he wished to speak he must do so quickly  miss beatrice he said in a somewhat constrained voice  yes mr daviesoh look at that seagull it nearly knocked my hat off  but he was not to be put off with the seagull miss beatrice he said again are you going out walking next sunday afternoon  how can i tell mr davies it may rain  but if it does not rainplease tell me you generally do walk on the beach on sunday miss beatrice i want to speak to you i hope you will allow me i do indeed  then suddenly she came to a decision this kind of thing was unendurable it would be better to get it over turning round so suddenly that owen started she said  if you wish to speak to me mr davies i shall be in the amphitheatre opposite the red rocks at four oclock on sunday afternoon but i had much rather that you did not come i can say no more  i shall come he answered doggedly and they went down the steps to the boatshed  oh look daddy said effie here comes the lady who was drownded with you and a gentleman and to beatrices great relief the child ran forward and met them  ah thought geoffrey to himself that is the man honoria said she was engaged to well i dont think very much of her taste  in another minute they had arrived geoffrey shook hands with beatrice and was introduced to owen davies who murmured something in reply and promptly took his departure  they examined the canoe together and then walked slowly up to the vicarage beatrice holding effie by the hand opposite the reef they halted for a minute  there is the table rock on which we were thrown mr bingham said beatrice and here is where they carried us ashore the sea does not look as though it would drown any one tonight does it seeand she threw a stone into itthe ripples run as evenly as they do on a pond  she spoke idly and geoffrey answered her idly for they were not thinking of their words rather were they thinking of the strange chance that had brought them together in an hour of deadly peril and now left them together in an hour of peace perhaps too they were wondering to what end this had come about for agnostics atheists or believers are we not most of us fatalists at heart    chapter xii  the writing on the sand  geoffrey found himself very comfortable at the vicarage and as for effie she positively revelled in it beatrice looked after her taking her to bed at night and helping her to dress in the morning and beatrice was a great improvement upon anne when geoffrey became aware of this he remonstrated saying that he had never expected her to act as nurse to the child but she replied that it was a pleasure to her to do so which was the truth in other ways too the place was all that he desired he did not like elizabeth but then he did not see very much of her and the old farmer clergyman was amusing in his way with his endless talk of tithes and crops and the iniquities of the rebellious jones on whom he was going to distrain  for the first day or two geoffrey had no more conversations with beatrice most of the time she was away at the school and on the saturday afternoon when she was free he went out to the red rocks curlew shooting at first he thought of asking her to come too but then it occurred to him that she might wish to go out with mr davies to whom he still supposed she was engaged it was no affair of his yet he was glad when he came back to find that she had been out with effie and not with mr davies  on sunday morning they all went to church including beatrice it was a bare little church and the congregation was small mr granger went through the service with about as much liveliness as a horse driving a machine he ground it out prayers psalms litany lessons all in the same depressing way till geoffrey felt inclined to go to sleep and then took to watching beatrices sweet face instead he wondered what made her look so sad hers was always a sad face when in repose that he knew but today it was particularly so and what was more she looked worried as well as sad once or twice he saw her glance at mr davies who was sitting opposite the solitary occupant of an enormous pew and he thought that there was apprehension in her look but mr davies did not return the glance to judge from his appearance nothing was troubling his mind  indeed geoffrey studying him in the same way that he instinctively studied everybody whom he met thought that he had never before seen a man who looked quite so oxlike and absolutely comfortable and yet he never was more completely at fault the man seemed stolid and cold indeed but it was the coldness of a volcano his heart was afire all the human forces in him all the energies of his sturdy life had concentrated themselves in a single passion for the woman who was so near and yet so far from him he had never drawn upon the store had never frittered his heart away this woman strange and unusual as it may seem was absolutely the first whose glance or voice had ever stirred his blood his passion for her had grown slowly for years it had been growing ever since the greyeyed girl on the brink of womanhood had conducted him to his castle home it was no fancy no light desire to pass with the year which brought it owen had little imagination that soil from which loves spring with the rank swiftness of a tropic bloom to fade at the first chill breath of change his passion was an unalterable fact it was rooted like an oak on our stiff english soil its fibres wrapped his heart and shot his being through and if so strong a gale should rise that it must fall then he too would be overthrown  for years now he had thought of little else than beatrice to win her he would have given all his wealth ay thrice over if that were possible to win her to know her his by right and his alone ah that would be heaven his blood quivered and his mind grew dim when he thought of it what would it be to see her standing by him as she stood now and know that she was his wife there is no form of passion more terrible than this its very earthiness makes it awful  the service went on at last mr granger mounted the pulpit and began to read his sermon of which the text was but the greatest of these is charity geoffrey noticed that he bungled over some of the words then suddenly remembered beatrice had told him that she had written the sermon and was all attention he was not disappointed notwithstanding mr grangers infamous reading and his habit of dropping his voice at the end of a sentence instead of raising it the beauty of the thoughts and diction was very evident it was indeed a discourse that might equally well have been delivered in a mahomedan or a buddhist place of worship there was nothing distinctively christian about it it merely appealed to the good in human nature but of this neither the preacher nor his audience seemed to be aware indeed few of the latter were listening at all the sermon was short and ended with a passage of real power and beautyor rather it did not end for closing the ms sheets mr granger followed on with a few impromptu remarks of his own  and now brethren he said i have been preaching to you about charity but i wish to add one remark charity begins at home there is about a hundred pounds of tithe owing to me and some of it has been owing for two years and more if that tithe is not paid i shall have to put distraint on some of you and i thought that i had better take this opportunity to tell you so  then he gave the benediction  the contrast between this businesslike speech and the beautiful periods which had gone before was so ridiculous that geoffrey very nearly burst out laughing and beatrice smiled so did the rest of the congregation excepting one or two who owed tithe and owen davies who was thinking of other things  as they went through the churchyard geoffrey noticed something beatrice was a few paces ahead holding effies hand presently mr davies passed him apparently without seeing him and greeted beatrice who bowed slightly in acknowledgment he walked a little way without speaking then geoffrey just as they reached the church gate heard him say at four this afternoon then again she bowed her head and he turned and went as for geoffrey he wondered what it all meant was she engaged to him or was she not  dinner was a somewhat silent meal mr granger was thinking about his tithe also about a sick cow elizabeths thoughts pursued some dark and devious course of their own not an altogether agreeable one to judge from her face beatrice looked pale and worried even effies sallies did not do more than make her smile as for geoffrey himself he was engaged in wondering in an idle sort of way what was going to happen at four oclock  you is all very dull said effie at last with a charming disregard of grammar  people ought to be dull on sunday effie answered beatrice with an effort at least i suppose so she added  elizabeth who was aggressively religious frowned at this remark she knew her sister did not mean it  what are you going to do this afternoon beatrice she asked suddenly she had seen owen davies go up and speak to her sister and though she had not been near enough to catch the words scented an assignation from afar  beatrice coloured slightly a fact that escaped neither her sister nor geoffrey  i am going to see jane llewellyn she answered jane llewellyn was the crazy little girl whose tale has been told up to that moment beatrice had no idea of going to see her but she knew that elizabeth would not follow her there because the child could not endure elizabeth  oh i thought that perhaps you were going out walking  i may walk afterwards answered beatrice shortly  so there is an assignation thought elizabeth and a cold gleam of intelligence passed across her face  shortly after dinner beatrice put on her bonnet and went out ten minutes passed and elizabeth did the same then mr granger announced that he was going up to the farm there was no service till six to see about the sick cow and asked geoffrey if he would like to accompany him he said that he might as well if effie could come and having lit his pipe they started  meanwhile beatrice went to see the crazy child she was not violent today and scarcely knew her before she had been in the house ten minutes the situation developed itself  the cottage stood about twothirds of the way down a straggling street which was quite empty for bryngelly slept after dinner on sunday at the top of this street appeared elizabeth a bible in her hand as though on district visiting intent she looked down the street and seeing nobody went for a little walk then returning once more looked down the street this time she was rewarded the door of the llewellyns cottage opened and beatrice appeared instantly elizabeth withdrew to such a position that she could see without being seen and standing as though irresolute awaited events beatrice turned and took the road that led to the beach  then elizabeths irresolution disappeared she also turned and took the road to the cliff walking very fast passing behind the vicarage she gained a point where the beach narrowed to a width of not more than fifty yards and sat down presently she saw a man coming along the sand beneath her walking quickly it was owen davies she waited and watched seven or eight minutes passed and a woman in a white dress passed it was beatrice walking slowly  ah said elizabeth setting her teeth as i thought rising she pursued her path along the cliff keeping three or four hundred yards ahead which she could easily do by taking short cuts it was a long walk and elizabeth who was not fond of walking got very tired of it but she was a woman with a purpose and as such hard to beat so she kept on steadily for nearly an hour till at length she came to the spot known as the amphitheatre this amphitheatre situated almost opposite the red rocks was a halfring of cliff the sides of which ran in a semicircle almost down to the waters edge that is at high tide in the centre of the segment thus formed was a large flat stone so placed that anybody in certain positions on the cliff above could command a view of it though it was screened by the projecting walls of rock from observation from the beach elizabeth clambered a little way down the sloping side of the cliff and looked on the stone his back towards her sat owen davies slipping from stratum to stratum of the broken cliff elizabeth drew slowly nearer till at length she was within fifty paces of the seated man here ensconcing herself behind a cleft rock she also sat down it was not safe to go closer but in case she should by any chance be observed from above she opened the bible on her knee as though she had sought this quiet spot to study its pages  three or four minutes passed and beatrice appeared round the projecting angle of the amphitheatre and walked slowly across the level sand owen davies rose and stretched out his hand to welcome her but she did not take it she only bowed and then seated herself upon the large flat stone owen also seated himself on it but some three or four feet away elizabeth thrust her white face forward till it was almost level with the lips of the cleft rock and strained her ears to listen alas she could not hear a single word  you asked me to come here mr davies said beatrice breaking the painful silence i have come  yes he answered i asked you to come because i wanted to speak to you  yes said beatrice looking up from her occupation of digging little holes in the sand with the point of her parasol her face was calm enough but her heart beat fast beneath her breast  i want to ask you he said speaking slowly and thickly if you will be my wife  beatrice opened her lips to speak then seeing that he had only paused because his inward emotion checked his words shut them again and went on digging little holes she wished to rely on the whole case as a lawyer would say  i want to ask you he repeated to be my wife i have wished to do so for some years but i have never been able to bring myself to it it is a great step to take and my happiness depends on it do not answer me yet he went on his words gathering force as he spoke listen to what i have to tell you i have been a lonely man all my life at sea i was lonely and since i have come into this fortune i have been lonelier still i never loved anybody or anything till i began to love you and then i loved you more and more and more till now i have only one thought in all my life and that thought is of you while i am awake i think of you and when i am asleep i dream of you listen beatrice listeni have never loved any other woman i have scarcely spoken to oneonly you beatrice i can give you a great deal and everything i have shall be yours only i should be jealous of youyes very jealous  here she glanced at his face it was outwardly calm but white as death and in the blue eyes generally so placid shone a fire that by contrast looked almost unholy  i think that you have said enough mr davies beatrice answered i am very much obliged to you i am much honoured for in some ways i am not your equal but i do not love you and i cannot marry you and i think it best to tell you so plainly once and for all and unconsciously she went on digging the holes  oh do not say that he answered almost in a moan for gods sake dont say that it will kill me to lose you i think i should go mad marry me and you will learn to love me  beatrice glanced at him again and a pang of pity pierced her heart she did not know it was so bad a case as this it struck her too that she was doing a foolish thing from a worldly point of view the man loved her and was very eligible he only asked of her what most women are willing enough to give under circumstances so favourable to their wellbeingherself but she never liked him he had always repelled her and she was not a woman to marry a man whom she did not like also during the last week this dislike and repulsion had hardened and strengthened vaguely as he pleaded with her beatrice wondered why and as she did so her eye fell upon the pattern she was automatically pricking in the sand it had taken the form of letters and the letters were g e o f f r egreat heaven could that be the answer she flushed crimson with shame at the thought and passed her foot across the telltale letters as she believed obliterating them  owen saw the softening of her eyes and saw the blush and misinterpreted them thinking that she was relenting by instinct rather than from any teaching of experience he attempted to take her hand with a turn of the arm so quick that even elizabeth watching with all her eyes saw nothing of the movement beatrice twisted herself free  dont touch me she said sharply you have no right to touch me i have answered you mr davies  owen withdrew his hand abashed and for a moment sat still his chin resting on his breast a very picture of despair nothing indeed could break the stolid calm of his features but the violence of his emotion was evident in the quick shivering of his limbs and his short deep breaths  can you give me no hope he said at last in a slow heavy voice for gods sake think before you answeryou dont know what it means to me it is nothing to youyou cannot feel i feel and your words cut like a knife i know that i am heavy and stupid but i feel as though you had killed me you are heartless quite heartless  again beatrice softened a little she was touched and flattered where is the woman who would not have been  what can i say to you mr davies she answered in a kinder voice i cannot marry you how i can i marry you when i do not love you  plenty of women marry men whom they do not love  then they are bad women answered beatrice with energy  the world does not think so he said again the world calls those women bad who love where they cannot marry and the world is always right marriage sanctifies everything  beatrice laughed bitterly do you think so she said i do not i think that marriage without love is the most unholy of our institutions and that is saying a good deal supposing i should say yes to you supposing that i married you not loving you what would it be for for your money and your position and to be called a married woman and what do you suppose i should think of myself in my heart then no no i may be bad but i have not fallen so low as that find another wife mr davies the world is wide and there are plenty of women in it who will love you for your own sake or who at any rate will not be so particular forget me and leave me to go my own wayit is not your way  leave you to go your own way he answered almost with passionthat is leave you to some other man oh i cannot bear to think of it i am jealous of every man who comes near you do you know how beautiful you are you are too beautifulevery man must love you as i do oh if you took anybody else i think that i should kill him  do not speak like that mr davies or i shall go  he stopped at once dont go he said imploringly listen you said that you would not marry me because you did not love me supposing that you learned to love me say in a years time beatrice would you marry me then  i would marry any man whom i loved she answered  then if you learn to love me you will marry me  oh this is ridiculous she said it is not probable it is hardly possible that such a thing should happen if it had been going to happen it would have happened before  it might come about he answered your heart might soften towards me oh say yes to this it is a small request it costs you nothing and it gives me hope without which i cannot live say that i may ask you once more and that then if you love me you will marry me  beatrice thought for a moment such a promise could do her no harm and in the course of six months or a year he might get used to the idea of living without her also it would prevent a scene it was weak of her but she dreaded the idea of her having refused owen davies coming to her fathers ears  if you wish it mr davies she said so be it only i ask you to understand this i am in no way tied to you i give you no hope that my answer should you renew this offer a year hence or at any other time will differ from that i give you today i do not think there is the slightest probability of such a thing also it must be understood that you are not to speak to my father about this matter or to trouble me in any way do you consent  yes he answered i consent you have me at your mercy  very well and now mr davies goodbye no do not walk back with me i had rather go by myself but i want to say this i am very sorry for what has happened i have not wished it to happen i have never encouraged it and my hands are clean of it but i am sorry sorry beyond measure and i repeat what i said beforeseek out some other woman and marry her  that is the cruellest thing of all the cruel things which you have said he answered  i did not mean it to be cruel mr davies but i suppose that the truth often is and now goodbye and beatrice stretched out her hand  he touched it and she turned and went but owen did not go he sat upon the rock his head bowed in misery he had staked all his hopes upon this woman she was the one desirable thing to him the one star in his somewhat leaden sky and now that star was eclipsed her words were unequivocal they gave but little hope beatrice was scarcely a woman to turn round in six months or a year on the contrary there was a fixity about her which frightened him what could be the cause of it how came it that she should be so ready to reject him and all he had to offer her after all she was a girl in a small position she could not be looking forward to a better match nor would the prospect move her one way or another there must be a reason for it perhaps he had a rival surely that must be the cause some enemy had done this thing but who  at this moment a womans shadow fell athwart him  oh have you come back he cried springing to his feet  if you mean beatrice answered a voiceit was elizabethsshe went down to the beach ten minutes ago i happened to be on the cliff and i saw her  oh i beg your pardon miss granger he said faintly i did not see who it was  elizabeth sat down upon the rock where her sister had sat and seeing the little holes in the breach began indolently to clear them of the sand which beatrice had swept over them with her foot this was no difficult matter for the holes were deeply dug and it was easy to trace their position presently they were nearly all clearthat is the letters were legible  you have had a talk with beatrice mr davies  yes he answered apathetically  elizabeth paused then she took her bull by the horns  are you going to marry beatrice mr davies she asked  i dont know he answered slowly and without surprise it seemed natural to him that his own central thought should be present in her mind i love her dearly and want to marry her  she refused you then  yes  elizabeth breathed more freely  but i can ask her again  elizabeth frowned what could this mean it was not an absolute refusal beatrice was playing some game of her own  why did she put you off so mr davies do not think me inquisitive i only ask because i may be able to help you  i know you are very kind help me and i shall always be grateful to you i do not knowi almost think that there must be somebody else only i dont know who it can be  ah said elizabeth who had been gazing intently at the little holes in the beach which she had now cleared of the sand of course that is possible she is a curious girl beatrice is what are those letters mr davies  he looked at them idly something your sister was writing while i talked to her i remember seeing her do it  g e o f f r ewhy it must be meant for geoffrey yes of course it is possible that there is somebody else mr davies geoffreyhow curious  why is it curious miss granger who is geoffrey  elizabeth laughed a disagreeable little laugh that somehow attracted owens attention more than her words  how should i know it must be some friend of beatrices and one of whom she is thinking a great deal or she would not write his name unconsciously the only geoffrey that i know is mr geoffrey bingham the barrister who is staying at the vicarage and whose life beatrice saved she paused to watch her companions face and saw a new idea creep across its stolidity but of course she went on it cannot be mr bingham that she was thinking of because you see he is married  married he said yes but hes a man for all that and a very handsome one  yes i should call him handsomea fine man elizabeth answered critically but as beatrice said the other day the great charm about him is his talk and power of mind he is a very remarkable man and the world will hear of him before he has done but however all this is neither here nor there beatrice is a curious woman and has strange ideas but i am sure that she would never carry on with a married man  but he might carry on with her miss elizabeth  she laughed do you really think that a man like mr bingham would try to flirt with girls without encouragement men like that are as proud as women and prouder the lady must always be a step ahead but what is the good of talking about such a thing it is all nonsense beatrice must have been thinking of some other geoffreyor it was an accident of something why mr davies if you for one moment really believed that dear beatrice could be guilty of such a shameless thing as to carry on a flirtation with a married man would you have asked her to marry you would you still think of asking such a woman as she must be to become your wife  i dont know i suppose not he said doubtfully  you suppose not i know you better than you know yourself you would rather never marry at all than take such a woman as she would be proved to be but it is no good talking such stuff if you have a rival you may be sure it is some unmarried man  owen reflected in his heart that on the whole he would rather it was a married one since a married man at any rate could not legally take possession of beatrice but elizabeths rigid morality alarmed him and he did not say so  do you know i feel a little upset miss elizabeth he answered i think i will be going by the way i promised to say nothing of this to your father i hope that you will not do so either  most certainly not said elizabeth and indeed it would be the last thing she would wish to do well goodbye mr davies do not be downhearted it will all come right in the end you will always have me to help you remember  thank you thank you he said earnestly and went  elizabeth watched him round the wall of rock with a cold and ugly smile set upon her face  you fool she thought you fool to tell me that you love her dearly and want to marry her you want to get that sweet face of hers do you you never shall id spoil it first dear beatrice she is not capable of carrying on a love affair with a married manoh certainly not why shes in love with him already and he is more than half in love with her if she hadnt been would she have put owen off not she give them time and we shall see they will ruin each otherthey must ruin each other it wont be childs play when two people like that fall in love they will not stop at sighs there is too much human nature about them it was a good idea to get him into the house and to see her go on with that child effie just as though she was its motherit makes me laugh ah beatrice with all your wits you are a silly woman and one day my dear girl i shall have the pleasure of exposing you to owen the idol will be unveiled and there will be an end of your chances with him for he cant marry you after that then my turn will come it is a question of timeonly a question of time  so brooded elizabeth in her heart madded with malicious envy and passionate jealousy she loved this man owen davies as much as she could love anybody at the least she dearly loved the wealth and station of which he was the visible centre and she hated the sister whom he desired if she could only discredit that sister and show her to be guilty of womans worst crime misplaced unlegalised affection surely she thought owen would reject her  she was wrong she did not know how entirely he desired to make beatrice his wife or realise how forgiving a man can be who has such an end to gain it is of the women who already weary them and of their infidelity that men are so ready to make examples not of those who do not belong to them and whom they long for night and day to these they can be very merciful    chapter xiii  geoffrey lectures  meanwhile beatrice was walking homewards with an uneasy mind the trouble was upon her she had it is true succeeded in postponing it a little but she knew very well that it was only a postponement owen davies was not a man to be easily shaken off she almost wished now that she had crushed the idea once and for all but then he would have gone to her father and there must have been a scene and she was weak enough to shrink from that especially while mr bingham was in the house she could well imagine the dismay not to say the fury of her moneyloving old father if he were to hear that she had refusedactually refusedowen davies of bryngelly castle and all his wealth  then there was elizabeth to be reckoned with elizabeth would assuredly make her life a burden to her beatrice little guessed that nothing would suit her sisters book better oh if only she could shake the dust of bryngelly off her feet but that too was impossible she was quite without money she might it was true succeed in getting another place as mistress to a school in some distant part of england were it not for an insurmountable obstacle here she received a salary of seventyfive pounds a year of this she kept fifteen pounds out of which slender sum she contrived to dress herself the rest she gave to her father now as she well knew he could not keep his head above water without this assistance which small as it was made all the difference to their household between poverty and actual want if she went away supposing even that she found an equally wellpaid post she would require every farthing of the money to support herself there would be nothing left to send home it was a pitiable position here was she who had just refused a man worth thousands a year quite unable to get out of the way of his importunity for the want of seventyfive pounds paid quarterly well the only thing to do was to face it out and take her chance on one point she was however quite clear she would not marry owen davies she might be a fool for her pains but she would not do it she respected herself too much to marry a man she did not love a man whom she positively disliked no never she exclaimed aloud stamping her foot upon the shingle  never what said a voice within two yards of her  she started violently and looked round there his back resting against a rock a pipe in his mouth an open letter on his knee and his hat drawn down almost over his eyes sat geoffrey he had left effie to go home with mr granger and climbing down a sloping place in the cliff had strolled along the beach the letter on his knee was one from his wife it was short and there was nothing particular in it effies name was not even mentioned it was to see if he had not overlooked it that he was reading the note through again no it merely related to lady honorias safe arrival gave a list of the people staying at the halla fast lot geoffrey noticed a certain mr dunstan whom he particularly disliked among themand the number of brace of partridges which had been killed on the previous day then came an assurance that honoria was enjoying herself immensely and that the new french cook was simply perfect the letter ending with love  never what miss granger he said again as he lazily folded up the sheet  never mind of course she answered recovering herself how you startled me mr bingham i had no idea there was anybody on the beach  it is quite free is it not he answered getting up i thought you were going to trample me into the pebbles its almost alarming when one is thinking about a sunday nap to see a young lady striding along then suddenly stop stamp her foot and say no never luckily i knew that you were about or i should really have been frightened  how did you know that i was about beatrice asked a little defiantly it was no business of his to observe her movements  in two ways look he said pointing to a patch of white sand that i think is your footprint  well what of it said beatrice with a little laugh  nothing in particular except that it is your footprint he answered then i happened to meet old edward who was loafing along and he informed me that you and mr davies had gone up the beach there is his footprintmr daviess i meanbut you dont seem to have been very sociable because here is yours right in the middle of it therefore you must have been walking in indian file and a little way back in parallel lines with quite thirty yards between you  why do you take the trouble to observe things so closely she asked in a half amused and half angry tone  i dont knowa habit of the legal mind i suppose one might make quite a romance out of those footprints on the sand and the little subsequent events but you have not heard all my thrilling tale old edward also informed me that he saw your sister miss elizabeth going along the cliff almost level with you from which he concluded that you had argued as to the shortest way to the red rocks and were putting the matter to the proof  elizabeth said beatrice turning a shade paler what can she have been doing i wonder  taking exercise probably like yourself well i seat myself with my pipe in the shadow of that rock when suddenly i see mr davies coming along towards bryngelly as though he were walking for a wager his hat fixed upon the back of his head literally he walked over my legs and never saw me then you follow and ejaculate no neverand that is the end of my story have i your permission to walk with you or shall i interfere with the development of the plot  there is no plot and as you said just now the beach is free beatrice answered petulantly  they walked on a few yards and then he spoke in another tonethe meaning of the assignation he had overheard in the churchyard grew clear to him now  i believe that i have to congratulate you miss granger he said and i do so very heartily it is not everybody who is so fortunate as to  beatrice stopped and half turning faced him  what do you mean mr bingham she said i do not understand your dark sayings  mean oh nothing particular except that i wished to congratulate you on your engagement  my engagement what engagement  it seems that there is some mistake he said and struggle as he might to suppress it his tone was one of relief i understood that you had become engaged to be married to mr owen davies if i am wrong i am sure i apologise  you are quite wrong mr bingham i dont know who put such a notion into your head but there is no truth in it  then allow me to congratulate you on there being no truth in it you see that is the beauty of nine affairs matrimonial out of tenthere are two or more sides of them if they come off the amiable and disinterested observer can look at the bright sideas in this case lots of money romantic castle by the sea gentleman of unexceptional antecedents c c c if on the other hand they dont cause can still be found for thankfulnesslady might do better after all castle by the sea rather draughty and cold in spring gentlemen most estimable but perhaps a little dull and so on you see  there was a note of mockery about his talk which irritated beatrice exceedingly it was not like mr bingham to speak so it was not even the way that a gentleman out of his teens should speak to a lady on such a subject he knew this as well as she did and was secretly ashamed of himself but the truth must out though geoffrey did not admit it even to himself he was bitterly and profoundly jealous and jealous people have no manners beatrice could not however be expected to know this and naturally grew angry  i do not quite understand what you are talking about mr bingham she said putting on her most dignified air and beatrice could look rather alarming you have picked up a piece of unfounded gossip and now you take advantage of it to laugh at me and to say rude things of mr davies it is not kind  oh no it was the footsteps miss granger and the gossip and the appointment you made in the churchyard that i unwillingly overheard not the gossip alone which led me into my mistake of course i have now to apologise  again beatrice stamped her foot she saw that he was still mocking her and felt that he did not believe her  there he went on stung into unkindness by his biting but unacknowledged jealousy for she was righton reflection he did not quite believe what she said as to her not being engaged how unfortunate i ami have said something to make you angry again why did you not walk with mr davies i should then have remained guiltless of offence and you would have had a more agreeable companion you want to quarrel with me what shall we quarrel about there are many things on which we are diametrically opposed let us start one  it was too much for though his words were nothing the tone in which he spoke gave them a sting beatrice already disturbed in mind by the scene through which she had passed her breast already throbbing with a vague trouble of which she did not know the meaning for once in her life lost control of herself and grew hysterical her grey eyes filled with tears the corners of her sweet mouth dropped and she looked very much as though she were going to burst out weeping  it is most unkind of you she said with a half sob if you knew how much i have to put up with you would not speak to me like that i know that you do not believe me very well i will tell you the truth yes though i have no business to do it and you have no rightnone at allto make me do it i will tell you the truth because i cannot bear that you should not believe me mr davies did want me to marry him and i refused him i put him off for a while i did this because i knew that if i did not he would go to my father it was cowardly but my father would make my life wretched and again she gave a halfchoked sob  much has been said and written about the effect produced upon men by the sight of a lady in or on the border line of tears and there is no doubt that this effect is considerable man being in his right mind is deeply moved by such a spectacle also he is frightened because he dreads a scene now most people would rather walk ten miles in their dress shoes than have to deal with a young lady in hysterics however modified putting the peculiar circumstances of the case aside geoffrey was no exception to this rule it was all very well to cross spears with beatrice who had quite an equal wit and was very capable of retaliation but to see her surrender at discretion was altogether another thing indeed he felt much ashamed of himself  please dontdontbe put out he said he did not like to use the word cry i was only laughing at you but i ought not to have spoken as i did i did not wish to force your confidence indeed i did not i never thought of such a thing i am so sorry  his remorse was evidently genuine and beatrice felt somewhat appeased perhaps it did not altogether grieve her to learn that she could make him feel sorry  you did not force my confidence she said defiantly quite forgetting that a moment before she had reproached him for making her speak i told you because i did not choose that you should think i was not speaking the truthand now let us change the subject she imposed no reserve on him as to what she had revealed she knew that there was no necessity to do so the secret would be between themanother dangerous link  beatrice recovered her composure and they walked slowly on  tell me mr bingham she said presently how can a woman earn her livingi mean a girl like myself without any special qualifications some of them get on  well he answered that depends upon the girl what sort of a living do you mean you are earning a living now of a kind  yes but sometimes if only i could manage it i think that i should like to get away from here and take another line something bigger i do not suppose that i ever shall but i like to think of it sometimes  i only know of two things which a woman can turn to he said the stage and literature of course he added hastily the first is out of the question in your case  and so is the other i am afraid she answered shaking her head that is if by literature you mean imaginative writing and i suppose that is the only way to get into notice as i told you i lost my imaginationwell to be frank when i lost my faith at one time i used to have plenty as i used to have plenty of faith but the one went with the other i do not understand why  dont you i think i do a mind without religious sentiment is like a star without atmosphere brighter than other stars but not so soft to see religion poetry music imagination and even some of the more exalted forms of passion flourish in the same soil and are i sometimes think different manifestations of the same thing do you know it is ridiculous to hear you talk of having lost your faith because i dont believe it at the worst it has gone to sleep and will wake up again one day possibly you may not accept some particular form of faith but i tell you frankly that to reject all religion simply because you cannot understand it is nothing but a form of atrocious spiritual vanity your mind is too big for you miss granger it has run away with you but you know it is tied by a stringit cannot go far and now perhaps you will be angry again  no indeed why should i be angry i daresay that you are quite right and i only hope that i may be able to believe again i will tell you how i lost belief i had a little brother whom i loved more than anything else in the world indeed after my mother died he was the only thing i really had to love for i think that my father cares more for elizabeth than he does for me she is so much the better at business matters and elizabeth and i never quite got on i daresay that the fault is mine but the fact remainswe are sisters but we are not intimate well my brother fell ill of a fever and for a long time he lay between life and death and i prayed for him as i never prayed for anybody or anything beforeyes i prayed that i might die instead of him then he passed through the crisis and got better and i thanked god thinking that my prayers had been answered oh how happy i was for those ten days and then this happenedmy brother got a chill a relapse followed and in three days he was dead the last words that he spoke to me were oh dont let me die beehe used to call me beeplease dont let me die dear bee but he died died in my arms and when it was over i rose from his side feeling as though my heart was dead also i prayed no more after that it seemed to me as though my prayers had been mocked at as though he had been given back to me for a little while in order that the blow might be more crushing when it fell  dont you think that you were a little foolish in taking such a view said geoffrey have you not been amused sometimes to read about the early christianshow the lead would not boil the martyr or the lion would not eat him or the rain from a blue sky put out the fire and how the pagan king at once was converted and accepted a great many difficult doctrines without further delay the athanasian creed was not necessarily true because the fire would not light or the sword would not cut nor excuse me were all your old beliefs wrong because your prayer was unanswered it is an ancient story that we cannot tell whether the answering of our petitions will be good or ill for us of course i do not know anything about such things but it seems to me rash to suppose that providence is going to alter the working of its eternal laws merely to suit the passing wishes of individualswishes too that in many cases would bring unforeseen sorrows if fulfilled besides i daresay that the poor child is happier dead than he would have been had he lived it is not an altogether pleasant world for most of us  yes mr bingham i know and i daresay that i should have got over the shock in time only after that i began to read i read the histories of the religions and compared them and i read the works of those writers who have risen up to attack them i found or i thought that i found the same springs of superstition in them allsuperstitions arising from elementary natural causes and handed on with variations from race to race and time to time in some i found the same story only with a slightly altered face and i learned moreover that each faith denied the other and claimed truth for itself alone  after that too i went to the college and there i fell in with a lady one of the mistresses who was the cleverest woman that i ever knew and in her way a good woman but one who believed that religion was the curse of the world and who spent all her spare time in attacking it in some form or other poor thing she is dead now and so you see what between these causes and the continual spectacle of human misery which to my mind negatives the idea of a merciful and watching power at last it came to pass that the only altar left in my temple is an altar to the unknown god  geoffrey like most men who have had to think on these matters did not care to talk about them much especially to women for one thing he was conscious of a tendency to speech less reverent than his thought but he had not entered beatrices church of darkness indeed he had turned his back on it for ever though like most people he had at different periods of his past life tarried an hour in its porch so he ventured on an objection  i am no theologian he said and i am not fond of discussion on such matters but there are just one or two things i should like to say it is no argument to my mind at least to point to the existence of evil and unhappiness among men as a proof of the absence of a superior mercy for what are men that such things should not be with them man too must own some master if he has doubts let him look up at the marshalling of the starry heaven and they will vanish  no said beatrice i fear not kant said so but before that moli√®re had put the argument in the mouth of a fool the starry heavens no more prove anything than does the running of the raindrops down the windowpane it is not a question of size and quantity  i might accept the illustration answered geoffrey one example of law is as good as another for my purpose i see in it all the working of a living will but of course that is only my way of looking at it not yours  no i am afraid said beatrice all this reasoning drawn from material things does not touch me that is how the pagans made their religions and it is how paley strives to prove his they argued from the out to the in from the material to the spiritual it cannot be if christianity is true it must stand upon spiritual feet and speak with a spiritual voice to be heard not in the thunderstorm but only in the hearts of men the existence of creative force does not demonstrate the existence of a redeemer if anything it tends to negative it for the power that creates is also the power which destroys what does touch me however is the thought of the multitude of the dead that is what we care for not for an eternal force ever creating and destroying think of them allall the souls of unheardof races almost animal who passed away so long ago can ours endure more than theirs and do you think that the spirit of an ethiopian who died in the time of moses is anywhere now  there was room for them all on earth answered geoffrey the universe is wide it does not dismay me there are mysteries in our nature the nature we think we knowshall there be none in that which we know not worlds die to live again when after millions of ages the conditions become once more favourable to life and why should not a man we are creatures of the world we reflect its every light and shadow we rejoice in its rejoicing its every feature has a tiny parallel in us why should not our fate be as its fate and its fate is so far as we know eternal it may change from gas to chaos from chaos to active life from active life to seeming death then it may once more pass into its elements and from those elements back again to concrete being and so on for ever always changing but always the same so much for natures allegory it is not a perfect analogy for man is a thing apart from all things else it may be only a hint or a type but it is something  now to come to the question of our religion i confess i draw quite a different conclusion from your facts you say that you trace the same superstitions in all religions and that the same spiritual myths are in some shape present in almost all well does not this suggest that the same great truth underlies them all taking from time to time the shape which is best suited to the spiritual development of those professing each every great new religion is better than the last you cannot compare osirianism with buddhism or buddhism with christianity or mahomedanism with the arabian idol worship take the old illustrationtake a cut crystal and hold it in the sun and you will see many different coloured rays come from its facets they look different but they are all born of the same great light they are all the same light may it not be so with religion let your altar be to the unknown god if you likefor who can give an unaltering likeness to the power above usbut do not knock your altar down  depend upon it miss granger all indications to the contrary notwithstanding there is a watching providence without the will of which we cannot live and if we deliberately reject that providence setting up our intelligence in its place sorrow will come of it even here for it is wiser than we i wish that you would try and look at the question from another point of viewfrom a higher point of view i think you will find that it will bear a great deal of examination and that you will come to the conclusion that the dictum of the wiseacre who says there is nothing because he can see nothing is not necessarily a true one there that is all i have to say and i wish that i could say it better  thank you said beatrice i will why here we are at home i must go and put effie to bed    and here it may be stated that geoffreys advice was not altogether thrown away beatrice did try looking at the question again and if faith did not altogether come back to her at least hope did and the greatest of these which is charity had never deserted her hope came slowly back not by argument probably but rather by example in the sea of doubt she saw another buoyed up if it were but on broken pieces of the ship this encouraged her geoffrey believed and shebelieved in geoffrey indeed is not this the secret of womans philosophyeven to some extent of that of such a woman as beatrice let the faith or unfaith of this that or the other rabbi answer for me she saysit is her last argument she believes in this or that or some other philosopher that is her creed and geoffrey was the person in whom beatrice began to believe all the more wholly because she had never believed in any one before whatever else she was to lose this at least she won when she saved his life    chapter xiv  drifting  on the day following their religious discussion an accident happened which resulted in geoffrey and beatrice being more than ever thrown in the company of each other during the previous week two cases of scarlatina had been reported among the school children and now it was found that the complaint had spread so much that it was necessary to close the school this meant of course that beatrice had all her time upon her hands and so had geoffrey it was his custom to bathe before breakfast after which he had nothing to do for the rest of the day beatrice with little effie also bathed before breakfast from the ladies bathingplace a quarter of a mile off and sometimes he would meet her as she returned glowing with health and beauty like venus new risen from the cyprian sea her halfdried hair hanging in heavy masses down her back then after breakfast they would take effie down to the beach and her auntie as the child learned to call beatrice would teach her lessons and poetry till she was tired and ran away to paddle in the sea or look for prawns among the rocks  meanwhile the childs father and beatrice would talknot about religion they spoke no more on that subject nor about owen davies but of everything else on earth beatrice was a merry woman when she was happy and they never lacked subjects of conversation for their minds were very much in tune in booklearning beatrice had the advantage of geoffrey for she had not only read enormously she also remembered what she read and could apply it her critical faculty too was very keen he on the other hand had more knowledge of the world and in his rich days had travelled a good deal and so it came to pass that each could always find something to tell the other never for one second were they dull not even when they sat for an hour or so in silence for it was the silence of complete companionship  so the long morning would wear away all too quickly and they would go in to dinner to be greeted with a cold smile by elizabeth and heartily enough by the old gentleman who never thought of anything out of his own circle of affairs after dinner it was the same story either they went walking to look for ferns and flowers or perhaps geoffrey took his gun and hid behind the rocks for curlew sending beatrice who knew the coast by heart a mile round or more to some headland in order to put them on the wing then she would come back springing towards him from rock to rock and crouch down beneath a neighbouring seaweedcovered boulder and they would talk together in whispers or perhaps they would not talk at all for fear lest they should frighten the flighting birds and geoffrey would first search the heavens for curlew or duck and seeing none would let his eyes fall upon the pure beauty of beatrices face showing so clearly against the tender sky and wonder what she was thinking about till suddenly feeling his gaze she would turn with a smile as sweet as the first rosy blush of dawn upon the waters and ask him what he was thinking about and he would laugh and answer you whereon she would smile again and perhaps blush a little feeling glad at heart she knew not why  then came teatime and the quiet when they sat at the open window and geoffrey smoked and listened to the soft surging of the sea and the harmonious whisper of the night air in the pines in the corner mr granger slept in his armchair or perhaps he had gone to bed altogether for he liked to go to bed at halfpast eight as the old herefordshire farmer his father had done before him and at the far end of the room sat elizabeth doing her accounts by the light of a solitary candle or if they failed her reading some book of a devotional and inspired character but over the edge of the book or from the page of crabbed accounts her eyes would glance continually towards the handsome pair in the windowplace and she would smile as she saw that it went well only they never saw the glances or noted the smile when geoffrey looked that way which was not often for elizabethold elizabeth as he always called her to himselfdid not attract him all he saw was her sharp but capablelooking form bending over her work and the light of the candle gleaming on her strawcoloured hair and falling in gleaming white patches on her hard knuckles  and so the happy day would pass and bedtime come and with it unbidden dreams  geoffrey thought no ill of all this as of course he ought to have thought he was not the ravening lion of fictionso rarely if ever to be met with in real lifegoing about seeking whom he might devour he had absolutely no designs on beatrices affections any more than she had on his and he had forgotten that first fell prescience of evil to come once or twice it is true qualms of doubt did cross his mind in the earlier days of their intimacy but he put them by as absurd he was no believer in the tender helplessness of fullgrown women his experience having been that they are amply capableand for the most part more than capableof looking after themselves it seemed to him a thing ridiculous that such a person as beatrice who was competent to form opinions and a judgment upon all the important questions of life should be treated as a child and that he should remove himself from bryngelly lest her young affections should become entangled he felt sure that they would never be entrapped in any direction whatsoever without her full consent  then he ceased to think about the matter at all indeed the mere idea of such a thing involved a supposition that would only have been acceptable to a conceited mannamely that there was a possibility of this young ladys falling in love with him what right had he to suppose anything of the sort it was an impertinence that there was another sort of possibilitynamely of his becoming more attached to her than was altogether desirabledid however occur to him once or twice but he shrugged his shoulders and put it by after all it was his look out and he did not much care it would do her no harm at the worst but very soon all these shadowy forebodings of dawning trouble vanished quite they were lost in the broad sweet lights of friendship byandby when friendships day was done they might arise again called by other names and wearing a sterner face  it was ridiculousof course it was ridiculous he was not going to fall in love like a boy at his time of life all he felt was gratitude and interestall she felt was amusement in his society as for the intimacyfelt rather than expressedthe intimacy that could already almost enable the one to divine the others thought that could shape her mood to his and his to hers that could cause the same thing of beauty to be a common joy and discover unity of mind in opinions the most oppositewhy it was only natural between people who had together passed a peril terrible to think of so they took the goods the gods provided and drifted softly onwhither they did not stop to inquire  one day however a little incident happened that ought to have opened the eyes of both they had arranged or rather there was a tacit understanding that they should go out together in the afternoon geoffrey was to take his gun and beatrice a book but it chanced that just before dinner as she walked back from the village where she had gone to buy some thread to mend effies clothes beatrice came face to face with mr davies it was their first meeting without witnesses since the sunday of which the events have been described and naturally therefore rather an awkward one owen stopped short so that she could not pass him with a bow and then turned and walked beside her after a remark or two about the weather the springs of conversation ran dry  you remember that you are coming up to the castle this afternoon he said at length  to the castle she answered no i have heard nothing of it  did not your sister tell you she made an engagement for herself and you a week or more ago you are to bring the little girl she wants to see the view from the top of the tower  then beatrice remembered elizabeth had told her and she had thought it best to accept the situation the whole thing had gone out of her mind  oh i beg your pardon i do remember now but i have made another planhow stupid of me  you had forgotten he said in his heavy voice it is easy for you to forget what i have been looking forward to for a whole week what is your planto go out walking with mr bingham i suppose  yes answered beatrice to go out with mr bingham  ah you go out with mr bingham every day now  and what if i do said beatrice quickly surely mr davies i have a right to go out with whom i like  yes of course but the engagement to come to the castle was made first are you not going to keep it  of course i am going to keep it i always keep my engagements when i have any  very well then i shall expect you at three oclock  beatrice went on home in a curiously irritated condition of mind she did not naturally want to go to the castle and she did want to go out with geoffrey however there was no help for it  when she came in to dinner she found that geoffrey was not there he had it seemed gone to lunch with dr chambers whom he had met on the beach before he returned they were all three starting for the castle beatrice leaving a message to this effect with betty  about a quarter of an hour afterwards geoffrey came back to fetch his gun and beatrice but beatrice was gone and all that he could extract from betty was that she had gone to see mr davies  he was perfectly furious though all the while he knew how unreasonable was his anger he had been looking forward to the expedition and this sudden change of plan was too much for his temper off he started however to pass a thoroughly miserable afternoon he seemed to miss beatrice more each step and gradually to grow more and more angry at what he called her rudeness of course it never occurred to him that what he was really angry at was her going to see mr davies or that in truth her society had become so delightful to him that to be deprived of it even for an afternoon was to be wretched to top everything he only got three good shots that afternoon and he missed them all which made him crosser than ever  as for beatrice she enjoyed herself just as little at the castle as geoffrey did on the beach owen davies took them through the great unused rooms and showed them the pictures but she had seen them before and though some of them were very fine did not care to look at them againat any rate not that afternoon but elizabeth gazed at them with eager eyes and mentally appraised their value wondering if they would ever be hers  what is this picture she asked pointing to a beautiful portrait of a dutch burgomaster by rembrandt  that answered davies heavily for he knew nothing of painting and cared less that is a velasquez valued for probate at ¬£3000no referring to the catalogue and reading i beg your pardon the next is the velasquez that is a rembrandt in the masters best style showing all his wonderful mastery over light and shade it was valued for probate at ¬£4000 guineas  four thousand guineas said elizabeth fancy having a thing worth four thousand guineas hanging on a wall  and so they went on elizabeth asking questions and owen answering them by the help of the catalogue till to beatrices relief they came at length to the end of the pictures then they took some tea in the little sitting room of the master of all this magnificence owen to her great annoyance sat opposite to beatrice staring at her with all his eyes while she drank her tea with effie sitting in her lap and elizabeth observing it bit her lip in jealousy she had thought it well to bring her sister here it would not do to let mr davies think she was keeping beatrice out of his way but his mute idol worship was trying to her feelings after tea they went to the top of the tower and effie rejoiced exceedingly in the view which was very beautiful here owen got a word with elizabeth  your sister seems to be put out about something he said  i daresay she answered carelessly beatrice has an uncertain temper i think she wanted to go out shooting with mr bingham this afternoon  had owen been a less religious person he might have sworn as it was he only said mr binghamit is always mr bingham from morning to night when is he going away  in another week i believe beatrice will be sorry i think she makes a great companion of him and now i think that we must be getting home and she went leaving this poisoned shaft to rankle in his breast  after they had returned to the vicarage and beatrice had heard effie her prayers and tucked her up in her small white bed she went down to the gate to be quiet for a little while before supper geoffrey had not yet come in  it was a lovely autumn evening the sea seemed to sleep and the little clouds from which the sunset fires had paled lay like wreaths of smoke upon the infinite blue sky why had not mr bingham come back she wondered he would scarcely have time to dress supposing that an accident had happened to him nonsense what accident could happen he was so big and strong he seemed to defy accidents and yet had it not been for her there would be little enough left of his strength today ah she was glad that she had lived to be able to save him from death there he came looming like a giant in the evening mist  there was a small handgate beside the large one on which she leant geoffrey stalked straight up to it as though he did not see her he saw her well enough but he was cross with her  she allowed him to pass through the gate which he shut slowly perhaps to give her an opportunity of speaking if she wished to do so then thinking that he did not see her she spoke in her soft musical voice  did you have good sport mr bingham  no he answered shortly i saw very little and i missed all i saw  i am so sorry except for the birds i hate the birds to be killed did you not see me in this white dress i saw you fifty yards away  yes miss granger he answered i saw you  and you were going by without speaking to me it was very rude of youwhat is the matter  not so rude as it was of you to arrange to walk out with me and then to go and see mr davies instead  i could not help it mr bingham it was an old engagement which i had forgotten  quite so ladies generally have an excuse for doing what they want to do  it is not an excuse mr bingham beatrice answered with dignity there is no need for me to make excuses to you about my movements  of course not miss granger but it would be more polite to tell me when you change your mindnext time you know however i have no doubt that the castle has attractions for you  she flashed one look at him and turned to go and as she did so his heart relented he grew ashamed  miss granger dont go forgive me i do not know what has become of my manners i spoke as i should not the fact is i was put out at your not coming to tell you the honest truth i missed you dreadfully  you missed me that is very nice of you one likes to be missed but if you missed me for one afternoon how will you get on a week hence when you go away and miss me altogether  beatrice spoke in a bantering tone and laughed as she spoke but the laugh ended in something like a sigh he looked at her for a moment looked till she dropped her eyes  heaven only knows he answered sadly  let us go in said beatrice in a constrained voice how chill the air has turned    chapter xv  only goodnight  five more days passed all too quickly and once more monday came round it was the 22nd of october and the michaelmas sittings began on the 24th on the morrow tuesday geoffrey was to return to london there to meet lady honoria and get to work at chambers that very morning indeed a brief the biggest he had yet receivedit was marked thirty guineashad been forwarded to him from his chambers with a note from his clerk to the effect that the case was expected to be in the special jury list on the first day of the sittings and that the clerk had made an appointment for him with the solicitors for 515 on the tuesday the brief was sent to him by his uncles firm and marked with you the attorneygeneral and mr candleton qc the wellknown leader of the probate and divorce court bar never before had geoffrey found himself in such honourable company that is on the back of a brief and not a little was he elated thereby  but when he came to look into the case his joy abated somewhat for it was one of the most perplexing that he had ever known the will contested which was that of a yorkshire moneylender disposed of property to the value of over ¬£80000 and was propounded by a niece of the testator who when he died if not actually weak in his mind was in his dotage and superstitious to the verge of insanity the niece to whom all the property was leftto the exclusion of the son and daughter of the deceased both married and living away from homestayed with the testator and looked after him shortly before his death however he and this niece had violently quarrelled on account of an intimacy which the latter had formed with a married man of bad repute who was a discharged lawyers clerk so serious had been the quarrel that only three days before his death the testator had sent for a lawyer and formally by means of a codicil deprived the niece of a sum of ¬£2000 which he had left her all the rest of his property being divided between his son and daughter three days afterwards however he duly executed a fresh will in the presence of two servants by which he left all his property to the niece to the entire exclusion of his own children this will though very short was in proper form and was written by nobody knew whom the servants stated that the testator before signing it was perfectly acquainted with its contents for the niece had made him repeat them in their presence they also declared however that he seemed in a terrible fright and said twice its behind me its behind me  within an hour of the signing of the will the testator was found dead apparently from the effects of fear but the niece was not in the room at the time of death the only other remarkable circumstance in the case was that the disreputable lover of the niece had been seen hanging about the house at dusk the testator having died at ten oclock at night there was also a further fact the son on receiving a message from the niece that his father was seriously worse had hurried with extraordinary speed to the house passing some one or somethinghe could not tell whatthat seemed to be running apparently from the window of the sick mans room which was on the ground floor and beneath which footmarks were afterwards found of these footmarks two casts had been taken of which photographs were forwarded with the brief they had been made by naked feet of small size and in each case the little joint of the third toe of the right foot seemed to be missing but all attempts to find the feet that made them had hitherto failed the will was contested by the next of kin for whom geoffrey was one of the counsel upon the usual grounds of undue influence and fraud but as it seemed at present with small prospect of success for though the circumstances were superstitious enough there was not the slightest evidence of either this curious case of which the outlines are here written is briefly set out because it proved to be the foundation of geoffreys enormous practice and reputation at the bar  he read the brief through twice thought it over well and could make little of it it was perfectly obvious to him that there had been foul play somewhere but he found himself quite unable to form a workable hypothesis was the person who had been seen running away concerned in the matterif it was a person if so was he the author of the footprints of course the exlawyers clerk had something to do with it but what in vain did geoffrey cudgel his brains every idea that occurred to him broke down somewhere or other  we shall lose this he said aloud in despair suspicious circumstances are not enough to upset a will and then addressing beatrice who was sitting at the table working  here miss granger you have a smattering of law see if you can make anything of this and he pushed the heavy brief towards her  beatrice took it with a laugh and for the next threequarters of an hour her fair brow was puckered up in a way quaint to see at last she finished and shut the brief up let me look at the photographs she said  geoffrey handed them to her she very carefully examined first one and then the other and as she did so a light of intelligence broke out upon her face  well portia have you got it he asked  i have got something she answered i do not know if it is right dont you see the old man was superstitious they frightened him first of all by a ghostly voice or some such thing into signing the will and then to death after he had signed it the lawyers clerk prepared the willhe would know how to do it then he was smuggled into the room under the bed or somewhere dressed up as a ghost perhaps the sending for the son by the niece was a blind the thing that was seen running away was a boythose footprints were made by a boy i have seen so many thousands on the sands here that i could swear to it he was attracted to the house from the road which was quite near by catching sight of something unusual through the blind the brief says there were no curtains or shutters now look at the photographs of the footprints see in no 1 found outside the window the toes are pressed down deeply into the mud the owner of the feet was standing on tiptoe to get a better view but in no 2 which was found near where the son thought he saw a person running the toes are spread out quite wide that is the footprint of some one who was in a great hurry now it is not probable that a boy had anything to do with the testators death why then was the boy running so hard i will tell you because he was frightened at something he had seen through the blind so frightened was he that he will not come forward or answer the advertisements and inquiries find a boy in that town who has a joint missing on the third toe of the right foot and you will soon know all about it  by jove said geoffrey what a criminal lawyer you would make i believe that you have got it but how are we to find this boy with the missing toejoint every possible inquiry has already been made and failed nobody has seen such a boy whose deficiency would probably be known by his parents or schoolfellows  yes said beatrice it has failed because the boy has taken to wearing shoes which indeed he would always have to do at school his parents if he has any would perhaps not speak of his disfigurement and no one else might know of it especially if he were a newcomer in the neighbourhood it is quite possible that he took off his boots in order to creep up to the window and now i will tell you how i should set to work to find him i should have every bathingplace in the river running through the townthere is a rivercarefully watched by detectives in this weather the autumn was an unusually warm one boys of that class often paddle and sometimes bathe if they watch close enough they will probably find a boy with a missing toe joint among the number  what a good idea said geoffrey i will telegraph to the lawyers at once i certainly believe that you have got the clue  and as it turned out afterwards beatrice had got it her suppositions were right in almost every particular the boy who proved to be the son of a pedlar who had recently come into the town was found wading and by a clever trick which need not be detailed frightened into telling the truth as he had previously frightened himself into holding his tongue he had even as beatrice conjectured taken off his boots to creep up to the window and as he ran away in his fright had dropped them into a ditch full of water there they were found and went far to convince the jury of the truth of his story thus it was that beatrices quick wit laid the foundations of geoffreys great success    this particular monday was a field day at the vicarage jones had proved obdurate no power on earth could induce him to pay the ¬£34 11s 4d due on account of tithe therefore mr granger fortified by a judgment duly obtained had announced his intention of distraining upon joness hay and cattle jones had replied with insolent defiance if any bailiff or auctioneer or such people came to sell his hay he would kill him or them  so said jones and summoned his supporters many of whom owed tithe and none of whom wished to pay it to do battle in his cause for his part mr granger retained an auctioneer of undoubted courage who was to arrive on this very afternoon supported by six policemen and carry out the sale beatrice felt nervous about the whole thing but elizabeth was very determined and the old clergyman was now bombastic and now despondent the auctioneer arrived duly by the one oclock train he was a tall ablebodied man not unlike geoffrey in appearance indeed at twenty yards distance it would have been difficult to tell them apart the sale was fixed for halfpast two and mr johnsonthat was the auctioneers namewent to the inn to get his dinner before proceeding to business he was informed of the hostile demonstration which awaited him and that an english member of parliament had been sent down especially to head the mob but being a man of mettle poohpoohed the whole affair  all bark sir he said to geoffrey all bark and no bite im not afraid of these people why if they wont bid for the stuff i will buy it in myself  all right said geoffrey but i advise you to look out i fancy that the old man is a rough customer  then geoffrey went back to his dinner  as they sat at the meal through a gap in the fir trees they saw that the great majority of the population of bryngelly was streaming up towards the scene of the sale some to agitate and some to see the fun  it is pretty well time to be off said geoffrey are you coming mr granger  well answered the old gentleman i wished to do so but elizabeth thinks that i had better keep away and after all you know he added airily perhaps it is as well for a clergyman not to mix himself up too much in these temporal matters no i want to go and see about some pigs at the other end of the parish and i think that i shall take this opportunity  you are not going mr bingham are you asked beatrice in a voice which betrayed her anxiety  oh yes he answered of course i am i would not miss the chance for worlds why beecham bones is going to be there the member of parliament who has just done his four months for inciting to outrage we are old friends i was at school with him poor fellow he was mad even in those days and i want to chaff him  i think that you had far better not go mr bingham said beatrice they are a very rough set  everybody is not so cowardly as you are put in elizabeth i am going at any rate  thats right miss elizabeth said geoffrey we will protect each other from the revolutionary fury of the mob come it is time to start  and so they went leaving beatrice a prey to melancholy forebodings  she waited in the house for the best part of an hour making pretence to play with effie then her anxiety got the better of her she put on her hat and started leaving effie in charge of the servant betty  beatrice walked quickly along the cliff till she came in sight of joness farm from where she stood she could make out a great crowd of men and even when the wind turned towards her catch the noise of shouting presently she heard a sound like the report of a gun saw the crowd break up in violent confusion and then cluster together again in a dense mass  what could it mean beatrice wondered  as the thought crossed her mind she perceived two men running towards her with all their speed followed by a woman three minutes more and she saw that the woman was elizabeth  the men were passing her now  what is it she cried  murder they answered with one voice and sped on towards bryngelly  another moment and elizabeth was at hand horror written on her pale face  beatrice clutched at her who is it she cried  mr bingham gasped her sister go and help hes shot dead and she too was gone  beatrices knees loosened her tongue clave to the roof of her mouth the solid earth spun round and round geoffrey killed geoffrey killed she cried in her heart but though her ears seemed to hear the sound of them no words came from her lips oh what should she do where should she hide herself in her grief  a few yards from the path grew a stunted tree with a large flat stone at its root thither beatrice staggered and sank upon the stone while still the solid earth spun round and round  presently her mind cleared a little and a keener pang of pain shot through her soul she had been stunned at first now she felt  perhaps it was not true perhaps elizabeth had been mistaken or had only said it to torment her she rose she flung herself upon her knees there by the stone and prayed this first time for many yearsshe prayed with all her soul oh god if thou art spare him his life and me this agony in her dreadful pangs of grief her faith was thus reborn and as all human beings must in their hour of mortal agony beatrice realised her dependence on the unseen she rose and weak with emotion sank back on to the stone the people were streaming past her now talking excitedly somebody came up to her and stood over her  oh heaven it was geoffrey  is it you she gasped elizabeth said that you were murdered  no no it was not i it is that poor fellow johnson the auctioneer jones shot him i was standing next him i suppose your sister thought that i fell he was not unlike me poor fellow  beatrice looked at him went red went white then burst into a flood of tears  a strange pang seized upon his heart it thrilled through him shaking him to the core why was this woman so deeply moved could it be nonsense he stifled the thought before it was born  dont cry geoffrey said the people will see you beatrice for the first time he called her by her christian name pray do not cry it distresses me you are upset and no wonder that fellow beecham bones ought to be hanged and i told him so it is his work though he never meant it to go so far hes frightened enough now i can tell you  beatrice controlled herself with an effort  what happened he said i will tell you as we walk along no dont go up to the farm he is not a pleasant sight poor fellow when i got up there beecham bones was spouting away to the mobhis long hair flying about his backexciting them to resist laws made by brutal thieving landlords and all that kind of gibberish telling them that they would be supported by a great party in parliament c c the people however took it all goodnaturedly enough they had a beautiful effigy of your father swinging on a pole with a placard on his breast on which was written the robber of the widow and the orphan and they were singing welsh songs only i saw jones who was more than half drunk cursing and swearing in welsh and english when the auctioneer began to sell jones went into the house and bones went with him after enough had been sold to pay the debt and while the mob was still laughing and shouting suddenly the back door of the house opened and out rushed jones now quite drunk a gun in his hand and bones hanging on to his coattails i was talking to the auctioneer at the moment and my belief is that the brute thought that i was johnson at any rate before anything could be done he lifted the gun and fired at me as i think the charge however passed my head and hit poor johnson full in the face killing him dead that is all the story  and quite enough too said beatrice with a shudder what times we live in i feel quite sick  supper that night was a very melancholy affair old mr granger was altogether thrown off his balance and even elizabeths iron nerves were shaken  it could not be worse it could not be worse moaned the old man rising from the table and walking up and down the room  nonsense father said elizabeth the practical he might have been shot before he had sold the hay and then you would not have got your tithe  geoffrey could not help smiling at this way of looking at things from which however mr granger seemed to draw a little comfort from constantly thinking about it and the daily pressure of necessity money had come to be more to the old man than anything else in the world  hardly was the meal done when three reporters arrived and took down geoffreys statement of what had occurred for publication in various papers while beatrice went away to see about packing effies things they were to start by a train leaving for london at halfpast eight on the following morning when beatrice came back it was halfpast ten and in his irritation of mind mr granger insisted upon everybody going to bed elizabeth shook hands with geoffrey congratulating him on his escape as she did so and went at once but beatrice lingered a little at last she came forward and held out her hand  goodnight mr bingham she said  goodnight i hope that this is not goodbye also he added with some anxiety  of course not broke in mr granger beatrice will go and see you off i cant i have to go and meet the coroner about the inquest and elizabeth is always busy in the house luckily they wont want you there were so many witnesses  then it is only goodnight said beatrice  she went to her room elizabeth who shared it was already asleep or pretending to be asleep then beatrice undressed and got into bed but rest she could not it was only goodnight a last goodnight he was going awayback to his wife back to the great rushing world and to the life in which she had no share very soon he would forget her other interests would arise other women would become his friends and he would forget the welsh girl who had attracted him for a while or remember her only as the companion of a rough adventure what did it mean why was her heart so sore why had she felt as though she should die when they told her that he was dead  then the answer rose in her breast she loved him it was useless to deny the truthshe loved him body and heart and soul with all her mind and all her strength she was his and his alonetoday tomorrow and for ever he might go from her sight she might never never see him more but love him she always must and he was married  well it was her misfortune it could not affect the solemn truth what should she do now how should she endure her life when her eyes no longer saw his eyes and her ears never heard his voice she saw the future stretch itself before her as a vision she saw herself forgotten by this man whom she loved or from time to time remembered only with a faint regret she saw herself growing slowly old her beauty fading yearly from her face and form companioned only by the love that grows not old oh it was bitter bitter and yet she would not have it otherwise even in her pain she felt it better to have found this deep and ruinous joy to have wrestled with the angel and been worsted than never to have looked upon his face if she could only know that what she gave was given back again that he loved her as she loved him she would be content she was innocent she had never tried to draw him to her she had used no touch or look no womans arts or lures such as her beauty placed at her command there had been no word spoken scarcely a meaning glance had passed between them nothing but frank and free companionship as of man with man she knew he did not love his wife and that his wife did not love himthis she could see but she had never tried to win him from her and though she sinned in thought though her heart was guiltyoh her hands were clean  her restlessness overcame her she could no longer lie in bed elizabeth watching through her veil of sleep saw beatrice rise put on a wrapper and going to the window throw it wide at first she thought of interfering for elizabeth was a prudent person and did not like draughts but her sisters movements excited her curiosity and she refrained beatrice sat down on the foot of her bed and leaning her arm upon the windowsill looked out upon the lovely quiet night how dark the pine trees massed against the sky how soft was the whisper of the sea and how vast the heaven through which the stars sailed on  what was it then this love of hers was it mere earthly passion no it was more it was something grander purer deeper and quite undying whence came it then if she was as she had thought only a child of earth whence came this deep desire which was not of the earth had she been wrong had she a soulsomething that could love with the body and through the body and beyond the bodysomething of which the body with its yearnings was but the envelope the hand or instrument oh now it seemed to beatrice that this was so and that called into being by her love she and her soul stood face to face acknowledging their unity once she had held that it was phantasy that such spiritual hopes were but exhalations from a heart unsatisfied that when love escapes us on the earth in our despair we swear it is immortal and that we shall find it in the heavens now beatrice believed this no more love had kissed her on the eyes and at his kiss her sleeping spirit was awakened and she saw a vision of the truth  yes she loved him and must always love him but she could never know on earth that he was hers and if she had a spirit to be freed after some few years would not his spirit have forgotten hers in that far hereafter of their meeting  she dropped her brow upon her arm and softly sobbed what was there left for her to do except to sobtill her heart broke  elizabeth lying with wideopen ears heard the sobs elizabeth peering through the moonlight saw her sisters form tremble in the convulsion of her sorrow and smiled a smile of malice  the thing is done she thought she cries because the man is going dont cry beatrice dont cry we will get your plaything back for you oh with such a bait it will be easy he is as sweet on you as you on him  there was something evil something almost devilish in this scene of the one watching woman holding a clue to and enjoying the secret tortures of the other plotting the while to turn them to her innocent rivals destruction and her own advantage elizabeths jealousy was indeed bitter as the grave  suddenly beatrice ceased sobbing she lifted her head and by a sudden impulse threw out the passion of her heart with all her concentrated strength of mind towards the man she loved murmuring as she did so some passionate despairing words which she knew  at this moment geoffrey sleeping soundly dreamed that he saw beatrice seated by her window and looking at him with eyes which no earthly obstacle could blind she was speaking her lips moved but though he could hear no voice the words she spoke floated into his mind       be a god and hold me         with a charm      be a man and fold me         with thine arm       teach me only teach love         as i ought      i will speak thy speech love         think thy thought       meet if thou require it         both demands      laying flesh and spirit         in thy hands       that shall be tomorrow         not tonight      i must bury sorrow         out of sight       must a little weep love         foolish me      and so fall asleep love         loved by thee  geoffrey heard them in his heart then they were gone the vision of beatrice was gone and suddenly he awoke  oh what was this flood of inarticulate passionladen thought that beat upon his brain telling of beatrice wave after wave it came utterly overwhelming him like the heavy breath of flowers stirred by a night windlike a message from another world it was real it was no dream no fancy she was present with him though she was not there her thought mingled with his thought her being beat upon his own his heart throbbed his limbs trembled he strove to understand and could not but in the mystery of that dread communion the passion he had trodden down and refused acknowledgment took life and form within him it grew like the indians magic tree from seed to blade from blade to bud and from bud to bloom in that moment it became clear to him he knew he loved her and knowing what such a love must mean for him if not for her geoffrey sank back and groaned  and beatrice of a sudden she ceased speaking to herself she felt her thought flung back to her weighted with anothers thought she had broken through the barriers of earth the quick electric message of her heart had found a path to him she loved and come back answered but in what tongue was that answer writ alas she could not read it any more than he could read the message at first she doubted surely it was imagination then she remembered it was absolutely proved that people dying could send a vision of themselves to others far away and if that could be why not this no it was truth a solemn truth she knew he felt her thought she knew that his life beat upon her life oh here was mystery and here was hope for if this could be and it was what might not be if her blind strength of human love could so overstep the boundaries of human power and by the sheer might of its volition mock the physical barriers that hemmed her in what had she to fear from distance from separation ay from death itself she had grasped a clue which might one day before the seeming end or afterwhat did it matterlay strange secrets open to her gaze she had heard a whisper in an unknown tongue that could still be learned answering lifes agonizing cry with a song of glory if only he loved her some day all would be well some day the barriers would fall crumbling with the flesh they would fall and set her naked spirit free to seek its other self and then having found her love what more was there to seek what other answer did she desire to all the problems of her life than this of unity attained at lastunity attained in death  and if he did not love her how could he answer her surely that message could not pass except along the golden chord of love which ever makes its sweetest music when pain strikes it with a hand of fear  the troubled glory passedit throbbed itself away the spiritual gusts of thought grew continually fainter till like the echoes of a dying harp like the breath of a falling gale they slowly sank to nothingness then wearied with an extreme of wild emotion beatrice sought her bed again and presently was lost in sleep    when geoffrey woke on the next morning after a little reflection he came to the decision that he had experienced a very curious and moving dream consequent on the exciting events of the previous day or on the pain of his impending departure he rose packed his bageverything else was readyand went in to breakfast beatrice did not appear till it was half over she looked very pale and said that she had been packing effies things geoffrey noticed that she barely touched his fingers when he rose to shake hands with her and that she studiously avoided his glance then he began to wonder if she also had strangely dreamed  next came the bustle of departure effie was despatched in the fly with the luggage and betty the fat welsh servant to look after her beatrice and geoffrey were to walk to the station  time for you to be going mr bingham said mr granger there goodbye goodbye god bless you never had such charming lodgers before hope you will come back again im sure by the way they are certain to summon you as a witness at the trial of that villain jones  goodbye mr granger geoffrey answered you must come and see me in town a change will do you good  well perhaps i may i have not had a change for twentyfive years never could afford it arent you going to say goodbye to elizabeth  goodbye miss granger said geoffrey politely many thanks for all your kindness i hope we shall meet again  do you answered elizabeth so do i i am sure that we shall meet again and i am sure that i shall be glad to see you when we do mr bingham she added darkly  in another minute he had left the vicarage and with beatrice at his side was walking smartly towards the station  this is very melancholy he said after a few moments silence  going away generally is she answeredeither for those who go or those who stay behind she added  or for both he said  then came another pause he broke it  miss beatrice may i write to you  certainly if you like  and will you answer my letters  yes i will answer them  if i had my way then you should spend a good deal of your time in writing he said you dont know he added earnestly what a delight it has been to me to learn to know you i have had no greater pleasure in my life  i am glad beatrice answered shortly  by the way geoffrey said presently there is something i want to ask you you are as good as a reference book for quotations you know some lines have been haunting me for the last twelve hours and i cannot remember where they come from  what are they she asked looking up and geoffrey saw or thought he saw a strange fear shining in her eyes  here are four of them he answered unconcernedly we have no time for long quotations       that shall be tomorrow         not tonight      i must bury sorrow         out of sight  beatrice heardheard the very lines which had been upon her lips in the wild midnight that had gone her heart seemed to stop she became white as the dead stumbled and nearly fell with a supreme effort she recovered herself  i think that you must know the lines mr bingham she said in a low voice they come from a poem of brownings called a womans last word  geoffrey made no answer what was he to say for a while they walked on in silence they were getting close to the station now separation perhaps for ever was very near an overmastering desire to know the truth took hold of him  miss beatrice he said again you look pale did you sleep well last night  no mr bingham  did you have curious dreams  yes i did she answered looking straight before her  he turned a shade paler then it was true  beatrice he said in a half whisper what do they mean  as much as anything else or as little she answered  what are people to do who dream such dreams he said again in the same constrained voice  forget them she whispered  and if they come back  forget them again  and if they will not be forgotten  she turned and looked him full in the eyes  die of them she said then they will be forgotten or  or what beatrice  here is the station said beatrice and betty is quarrelling with the flyman    five minutes more and geoffrey was gone    chapter xvi  the flat near the edgware road  geoffreys journey to town was not altogether a cheerful one to begin with effie wept copiously at parting with her beloved auntie as she called beatrice and would not be comforted the prospect of rejoining her mother and the voluble anne had no charms for effie they all three got on best apart geoffrey himself had also much to think about and found little satisfaction in the thinking he threw his mind back over the events of the past few weeks he remembered how he had first seen beatrices face through the thick mist on the red rocks and how her beauty had struck him as no beauty ever had before then he thought of the adventure of their shipwreck and of the desperate courage with which she had saved his life almost at the cost of her own he thought too of that scene when on the following day he had entered the room where she was asleep when the wandering ray of light had wavered from her breast to his own when that strange presentiment of the ultimate intermingling of their lives had flashed upon him and when she had awakened with an unearthly greeting on her lips while effie slowly sobbed herself to silence in the corner opposite to him one by one he recalled every phase and scene of their evergrowing intimacy till the review culminated in his mysterious experience of the past night and the memory of beatrices parting words  of all men geoffrey was among those least inclined to any sort of superstition from boyhood he had been noted for common sense and a somewhat disbelieving turn of mind but he had intellect and imagination which is simply intellect etherealised without these with his peculiar mental constitution he would for instance probably have been a religious sceptic having them he was nothing of the sort so in this matter of his experience of the previous night and generally of the strange and almost unnatural sympathy in which he found himself with this lady common sense and the results of his observation and experience pointed to the whole thing being nonsensethe result of propinquity sir propinquity and a pretty faceand nothing more  but here his intellect and his imagination stepped in telling him plainly that it was not nonsense that he had not merely made a donkey of himself over an hysterical or possibly a lovesick girl they told him that because a thing is a mystery it is not necessarily a folly though mysteries are for the most part dealt in by fools they suggested that there may be many things and forces above us and around us invisible as an electric current intangible as light yet existent and capable of manifestation under certain rare and favourable conditions  and was it not possible that such conditions should unite in a woman like beatrice who combined in herself a beauty of body which was only outpassed by the beauty of her mind it was no answer to say that most women could never inspire the unearthly passion with which he had been shaken some ten hours past or that most men could never become aware of the inspiration has not humanity powers and perceptions denied to the cattle of the fields and may there not be men and women as far removed from their fellows in this respect as these are from the cattle  but the weak point of mysterious occurrences is that they lead nowhere and do not materially alter the facts of life one cannot for instance plead a mystery in a court of law so dropping the imaginative side of the question as one beyond him geoffrey came to its practical aspect only to find it equally thorny  odd as it may seem geoffrey did not to this moment know the exact position which he occupied in the mind of beatrice or that she occupied in his he was not in love with her at least not in a way in which he had ever experienced the influence of that on the whole inconvenient and disagreeable passion at any rate he argued from the hypothesis that he was not in love with her this he refused to admit now in the light of day though he had admitted it fully in the watches of the night it would not do to admit it but he was forced to acknowledge that she had crept into his life and possessed it so completely that then and for months afterwards except in deep sleep or in hours of severe mental strain not a single half hour would pass without bringing its thought of beatrice everything that was beautiful or grand or elevating reminded him of herand what higher compliment could a mistress have if he listened to glorious music the voice of beatrice spoke to him through the notes if he watched the clouds rolling in heavy pomp across a broken sky he thought of beatrice if some chance poem or novel moved him why beatrice was in his mind to share the pleasure all of which was very interesting and in some ways delightful but under our current system not otherwise than inconvenient to a married man  and now beatrice was gone and he must come back to his daily toil sweetened by honorias bitter complaints of their poverty and see her no more the thought made geoffreys heart ache with a physical pain but his reason told him that it was best so after all there were no bones broken there had been no love scenes no kiss no words that cannot be recalled whatever there was lay beneath the surface and while appearances were kept up all was well no doubt it was an hypocrisy but then hypocrisy is one of the great pillars of civilization and how does it matter what the heart says while the lips are silent the recording angel can alone read hearts and he must often find them singularly contradictory and untrustworthy writings  die of them die of her dreams no beatrice would not die of them and certainly he should not probably in the end she would marry that pious earthly lump owen davies it was not pleasant to think of it was even dreadful but really if she were to ask him his opinion as a friend he should tell her it was the best thing that she could do of course it would be hypocrisy again the lips would give his heart the lie but when the heart rises in rebellion against the intelligence it must be suppressed unfortunately however though a small member it is very strong    they reached london at last and as had been arranged anne the french bonne met them at the station to take effie home geoffrey noticed that she looked smarter and less to his taste than ever however she embraced effie with an enthusiasm which the child scarcely responded to and at the same time carried on an ocular flirtation with a ticket collector although early in the year for yellow fogs london was plunged in a dense gloom it had been misty that morning at bryngelly and become more and more so as the day advanced but though it was not yet four oclock london was dark as night luckily however it is not far from paddington to the flat near the edgware road where geoffrey lived so having personally instructed the cabman he left anne to convoy effie and the luggage and went on to the temple by underground railway with an easy mind  shortly after geoffrey reached his chambers in pump court the solicitor arrived as had been arranged not his unclewho was he learned very unwellbut a partner to his delight he then found that beatrices ghost theory was perfectly accurate the boy with the missing toejoint had been discovered who saw the whole horrible tragedy through a crack in the blind moreover the truth had been wrung from him and he would be produced at the trialindeed a proof of his evidence was already forthcoming also some specimens of the exlawyers clerks handwriting had been obtained and were declared by two experts to be identical with the writing on the will one thing however disturbed him neither the attorneygeneral nor mr candleton was yet in town so no conference was possible that evening however both were expected that nightthe attorneygeneral from devonshire and mr candleton from the continent so the case being first on the list it was arranged that the conference should take place at ten oclock on the following morning  on arriving home geoffrey was informed that lady honoria was dressing and had left a message saying he must be quick and do likewise as a gentleman was coming to dinner accordingly he went to his own roomwhich was at the other end of the flatand put on his dress clothes before going to the diningroom however he said goodnight to effiewho was in bed but not asleepand asked her what time she had reached home  at twenty minutes past five daddy effie said promptly  twenty minutes past five why you dont mean to say that you were an hour coming that little way did you get blocked in the fog  no daddy but  but what dear  anne did tell me not to say  but i tell you to say dearnever mind anne  anne stopped and talked to the ticketman for a long long time  oh did she he said  at that moment the parlourmaid came to say that lady honoria and the gentleman were waiting for dinner geoffrey asked her casually what time miss effie had reached home  about halfpast five sir anne said the cab was blocked in the fog  very well tell her ladyship that i shall be down in a minute  daddy said the child i havent said my prayers mother did not come and anne said it was all nonsense about prayers auntie did always hear me my prayers  yes dear and so will i there kneel upon my lap and say them  in the middle of the prayerswhich effie did not remember as well as she might have donethe parlourmaid arrived again  please sir her ladyship  tell her ladyship i am coming and that if she is in a hurry she can go to dinner go on love  then he kissed her and put her to bed again  daddy said effie as he was going shall i see auntie beatrice any more  i hope so dear  and shall you see her any more you want to see her dont you daddy she did love you very much  geoffrey could bear it no longer the truth is always sharper when it comes from the mouth of babes and sucklings with a hurried goodnight he fled  in the little drawingroom he found lady honoria very well dressed and also her friend whose name was mr dunstan geoffrey knew him at once for an exceedingly wealthy man of small birth and less breeding but a burning and a shining light in the garsington set mr dunstan was anxious to raise himself in society and he thought that notwithstanding her poverty lady honoria might be useful to him in this respect hence his presence there tonight  how do you do geoffrey said his wife advancing to greet him with a kiss of peace you look very well but what an immense time you have been dressing poor mr dunstan is starving let me see you know mr dunstan i think dinner mary  geoffrey apologised for being late and shook hands politely with mr dunstansaint dunstan he was generally called on account of his rather clerical appearance and in sarcastic allusion to his somewhat shady reputation then they went in to dinner  sorry there is no lady for you geoffrey but you must have had plenty of ladies society lately by the way how is missmiss granger would you believe it mr dunstan that shocking husband of mine has been passing the last month in the company of one of the loveliest girls i ever saw who knows latin and law and everything else under the sun she began by saving his life they were upset together out of a canoe you know isnt it romantic  saint dunstan made some appropriateor rather inappropriateremark to the effect that he hoped mr bingham had made the most of such unrivalled opportunities adding with a deep sigh that no lovely young lady had ever saved his life that he might live for her c c  here geoffrey broke in without much ceremony to him it seemed a desecration to listen while this person was making his feeble jokes about beatrice  well dear he said addressing his wife and what have you been doing with yourself all this time  mourning for you geoffrey and enjoying myself exceedingly in the intervals we have had a delightful time have we not mr dunstan mr dunstan has also been staying at the hall you know  how could it be otherwise when you were there lady honoria answered the saint in that strain of compliment affected by such men and which to tell the truth jarred on its object who was after all a lady  you know geoffrey she went on the garsingtons have refurnished the large hall and their drawingroom it cost eighteen hundred pounds but the result is lovely the drawingroom is done in handpainted white satin walls and all and the hall in old oak  indeed he answered reflecting the while that lord garsington might as well have paid some of his debts before he spent eighteen hundred pounds on his drawingroom furniture  then the saint and lady honoria drifted into a long and animated conversation about their fellow guests which geoffrey scarcely tried to follow indeed the dinner was a dull one for him and he added little or nothing to the stock of talk  when his wife left the room however he had to say something so they spoke of shooting the saint had a redeeming featurehe was somewhat of a sportsman though a poor one and he described to geoffrey a new pair of hammerless guns which he had bought for a trifling sum of a hundred and forty guineas recommending the pattern to his notice  yes answered geoffrey i daresay that they are very nice but you see they are beyond me a poor man cannot afford so much for a pair of guns  oh if that is all answered his guest i will sell you these they are a little long in the stock for me and you can pay me when you like or hang it all i have plenty of guns ill be generous and give them to you if i cannot afford to be generous i dont know who can  thank you very much mr dunstan answered geoffrey coldly but i am not in the habit of accepting such presents from myacquaintances will you have a glass of sherryno then shall we join lady honoria  this speech quite crushed the vulgar but not illmeaning saint and geoffrey was sorry for it a moment after he had made it but he was weary and out of temper why did his wife bring such people to the house very shortly afterwards their guest took his leave reflecting that bingham was a conceited ass and altogether too much for him and i dont believe that he has got a thousand a year he reflected to himself and the title is his wifes i suppose that is what he married her for shes a much better sort than he is any way though i dont quite make her out eitherone cant go very far with her but she is the daughter of a peer and worth cultivating but not when bingham is at homenot if i know it  what have you said to mr dunstan to make him go away so soon geoffrey asked his wife  said to him oh i dont know he offered to give me a pair of guns and i told him that i did not accept presents from my acquaintances really honoria i dont want to interfere with your way of life but i do not understand how you can associate with such people as this mr dunstan  associate with him answered lady honoria do you suppose i want to associate with him do you suppose that i dont know what the man is but beggars cannot be choosers he may be a cad but he has thirty thousand a year and we simply cannot afford to throw away an acquaintance with thirty thousand a year it is too bad of you geoffrey she went on with rising temper when you know all that i must put up with in our miserable povertystricken life to take every opportunity of making yourself disagreeable to the people i think it wise to ask to come and see us here i return from comfort to this wretched place and the first thing that you do is make a fuss mr dunstan has got boxes at several of the best theaters and he offered to let me have one whenever i likedand now of course there is an end of it it is too bad i say  it is really curious honoria said her husband to see what obligations you are ready to put yourself under in search of pleasure it is not dignified of you to accept boxes at theatres from this gentleman  nonsense there is no obligation about it if he gave us a box of course he would make a point of looking in during the evening and then telling his friends that it was lady honoria bingham he was speaking tothat is the exchange i want to go to the theatre he wants to get into good societythere you have the thing in a nutshell it is done every day the fact of the matter is geoffrey she went on looking very much as though she were about to burst into a flood of angry tears as i said just now beggars cannot be choosersi cannot live like the wife of a bankers clerk i must have some amusement and some comfort before i become an old woman if you dont like it why did you entrap me into this wretched marriage before i was old enough to know better or why do you not make enough money to keep me in a way suitable to my position  we have argued that question before honoria said geoffrey keeping his temper with difficulty and now there is another thing i wish to say to you do you know that detestable woman anne stopped for more than half an hour at paddington station this evening flirting with a ticket collector instead of bringing effie home at once as i told her to do i am very angry about it she is not to be relied on we shall have some accident with the child before we have done cannot you discharge her and get another nurse  no i cannot she is the one comfort i have where am i going to find another woman who can make dresses like anneshe saves me a hundred a yeari dont care if she flirted with fifty ticket collectors i suppose you got this story from effie the child ought to be whipped for talebearing and i daresay that it is not true  effie will certainly not be whipped answered geoffrey sternly i warn you that it will go very badly with anybody who lays a finger on her  oh very well ruin the child go your own way geoffrey at any rate i am not going to stop here to listen to any more abuse goodnight and she went  geoffrey sat down and lit a cigarette a pleasant homecoming he thought to himself honoria shall have money as much as she can spendif i kill myself to get it she shall have it what a life what a life i wonder if beatrice would treat her husband like thisif she had one  he laughed aloud at the absurdity of the idea and then with a gesture of impatience threw his cigarette into the fire and went to his room to try and get some sleep for he was thoroughly wearied    chapter xvii  geoffrey wins his case  before ten oclock on the following morning having already spent two hours over his brief that he had now thoroughly mastered geoffrey was at his chambers which he had some difficulty in reaching owing to the thick fog that still hung over london and indeed all england  to his surprise nothing had been heard either of the attorneygeneral or of mr candleton the solicitors were in despair but he consoled them by saying that one or the other was sure to turn up in time and that a few words would suffice to explain the additional light which had been thrown on the case he occupied his half hour however in making a few rough notes to guide him in the altogether improbable event of his being called on to open and then went into court the case was first on the list and there were a good many counsel engaged on the other side just as the judge took his seat the solicitor with an expression of dismay handed geoffrey a telegram which had that moment arrived from mr candleton it was dated from calais on the previous night and ran am unable to cross on account of thick fog you had better get somebody else in parsons and douse  and we havent got another brief prepared said the agonised solicitor what is more i can hear nothing of the attorneygeneral and his clerk does not seem to know where he is you must ask for an adjournment mr bingham you cant manage the case alone  very well said geoffrey and on the case being called he rose and stated the circumstances to the court but the court was crusty it had got the fog down its throat and altogether it didnt seem to see it moreover the other side marking its advantage objected strongly the witnesses brought at great expense were there his lordship was there the jury was there if this case was not taken there was no other with which they could go on c c  the court took the same view and lectured geoffrey severely every counsel in a case the court remembered when it was at the bar used to be able to open that case at a moments notice and though things had it implied no doubt deteriorated to a considerable extent since those palmy days every counsel ought still to be prepared to do so on emergency  of course however if he geoffrey told the court that he was absolutely unprepared to go on with the case it would have no option but to grant an adjournment  i am perfectly prepared to go on with it my lord geoffrey interposed calmly  very well said the court in a mollified tone then go on i have no doubt that the learned attorneygeneral will arrive presently  then as is not unusual in a probate suit followed an argument as to who should open it the plaintiff or the defendant geoffrey claimed that this right clearly lay with him and the opposing counsel raised no great objection thinking that they would do well to leave the opening in the hands of a rather inexperienced man who would very likely work his side more harm than good so somewhat to the horror of the solicitors who thought with longing of the eloquence of the attorneygeneral and the unrivalled experience and finesse of mr candleton geoffrey was called upon to open the case for the defendants propounding the first will  he rose without fear or hesitation and with but one prayer in his heart that no untimely attorneygeneral would put in an appearance he had got his chance the chance for which many able men have to wait long years and he knew it and meant to make the most of it naturally a brilliant speaker geoffrey was not as so many good speakers are subject to fits of nervousness and he was moreover thoroughly master of his case in five minutes judge jury and counsel were all listening to him with attention in ten they were absorbed in the lucid and succinct statement of the facts which he was unfolding to them his ghost theory was at first received with a smile but presently counsel on the other side ceased to smile and began to look uneasy if he could prove what he said there was an end of their case when he had been speaking for about forty minutes one of the opposing counsel interrupted him with some remark and at that moment he noticed that the attorneygenerals clerk was talking to the solicitor beneath him  bother it he is coming thought geoffrey  but no the solicitor bending forward informed him that the attorneygeneral had been unavoidably detained by some important government matter and had returned his brief  well we must get on as we can geoffrey said  if you continue like that we shall get on very well whispered the solicitors and then geoffrey knew that he was doing well  yes mr bingham said his lordship  then geoffrey went on with his statement  at lunch time it was a question whether another leader should be briefed geoffrey said that so far as he was concerned he could get on alone he knew every point of the case and he had got a friend to take a note for him while he was speaking  after some hesitation the solicitors decided not to brief fresh counsel at this stage of the case but to leave it entirely in his hands  it would be useless to follow the details of this remarkable will suit which lasted two days and attracted much attention geoffrey won it and won it triumphantly his address to the jury on the whole case was long remembered in the courts rising as it did to a very high level of forensic eloquence few who saw it ever forgot the sight of his handsome face and commanding presence as he crushed the case of his opponents like an eggshell and then with calm and overwhelming force denounced the woman who with her lover had concocted the cruel plot that robbed her uncle of life and her cousins of their property till at the last pointing towards her with outstretched hand he branded her to the jury as a murderess  few in that crowded court have forgotten the tragic scene that followed when the trembling woman worn out by the long anxiety of the trial and utterly unnerved by her accusers brilliant invective rose from her seat and cried  we did itit is true that we did it to get the money but we did not mean to frighten him to death and then fell fainting to the groundor geoffrey binghams quiet words as he sat down  my lord and gentlemen of the jury i do not think it necessary to carry my case any further  there was no applause the occasion was too dramatically solemn but the impression made both upon the court and the outside public to whom such a scene is peculiarly fitted to appeal was deep and lasting  geoffrey himself was under little delusion about the matter he had no conceit in his composition but neither had he any false modesty he merely accepted the situation as really powerful men do accept such eventswith thankfulness but without surprise he had got his chance at last and like any other able man whatever his walk of life he had risen to it that was all most men get such chances in some shape or form and are unable to avail themselves of them geoffrey was one of the exceptions as beatrice had said he was born to succeed as he sat down he knew that he was a made man  and yet while he walked home that night his ears still full of the congratulations which had rained in on him from every quarter he was conscious of a certain pride he will have felt as geoffrey felt that night whose lot it has been to fight long and strenuously against circumstances so adverse as to be almost overwhelming knowing in his heart that he was born to lead and not to follow and who at last by one mental effort with no friendly hand to help and no friendly voice to guide has succeeded in bursting a road through the difficulties which hemmed him in and has suddenly found himself not above competition indeed but still able to meet it he will not have been too proud of that endeavour it will have seemed but a little thing to hima thing full of faults and imperfections and falling far short of his ideal he will not even have attached a great importance to his success because if he is a person of this calibre he must remember how small it is when all is said and done that even in his day there are those who can beat him on his own ground and also that all worldly success like the most perfect flower yet bears in it the elements of decay but he will have reflected with humble satisfaction on those long years of patient striving which have at length lifted him to an eminence whence he can climb on and on scarcely encumbered by the jostling crowd till at length worn out the time comes for him to fall  so geoffrey thought and felt the thing was to be done and he had done it honoria should have money now she should no longer be able to twit him with their poverty yes and a better thought still beatrice would be glad to hear of his little triumph  he reached home rather late honoria was going out to dinner with a distinguished cousin and was already dressing geoffrey had declined the invitation which was a short one because he had not expected to be back from chambers in this enthusiasm however he went to his wifes room to tell her of the event  well she said what have you been doing i think that you might have arranged to come out with me my going out so much by myself does not look well oh i forgot of course you are in that case  yesthat is i was i have won the case here is a very fair report of it in the st jamess gazette if you care to read it  good heavens geoffrey how can you expect me to read all that stuff when i am dressing  i dont expect you to honoria only as i say i have won the case and i shall get plenty of work now  will you i am glad to hear it perhaps we shall be able to escape from this horrid flat if you do there anne je vous lai toujours dit cette robe ne me va pas bien  mais milady la robe va parfaitement  that is your opinion grumbled lady honoria well it isnt mine but it will have to do goodnight geoffrey i daresay that you will have gone to bed when i get back and she was gone  geoffrey picked up his st jamess gazette with a sigh he felt hurt and knew that he was a fool for his pains lady honoria was not a sympathetic person it was not fair to expect it from her still he felt hurt he went upstairs and heard effie her prayers  where has you beed daddyto the smoky town the temple was euphemistically known to effie as the smoky town  yes dear  you go to the smoky town to make bread and butter dont you daddy  yes dear to make bread and butter  and did you make any daddy  yes effie a good deal today  then where is it in your pocket  no love not exactly i won a big lawsuit today and i shall get a great many pennies for it  oh answered effie meditatively i am glad that you did win you do like to win doesnt you daddy dear  yes love  then i will give you a kiss daddy because you did win and she suited the action to the word  geoffrey went from the little room with a softened heart he dressed and ate some dinner  then he sat down and wrote a long letter to beatrice telling her all about the trial and not sparing her his reasons for adopting each particular tactic and line of argument which conduced to the great result  and though his letter was four sheets in length he knew that beatrice would not be bored at having to read it    chapter xviii  the rising star  as might be expected the memorable case of parsons and douse proved to be the turning point in geoffreys career which was thenceforward one of brilliant and startling success on the very next morning when he reached his chambers it was to find three heavy briefs awaiting him and they proved to be but the heralds of an uninterrupted flow of lucrative business of course he was not a queens counsel but now that his great natural powers of advocacy had become generally known solicitors frequently employed him alone or gave him another junior so that he might bring those powers to bear upon juries now it was too that geoffrey reaped the fruits of the arduous legal studies which he had followed without cessation from the time when he found himself thrown upon his own resources and which had made a sound lawyer of him as well as a brilliant and effective advocate soon even with his great capacity for work he had as much business as he could attend to when fortune gives good gifts she generally does so with a lavish hand  thus it came to pass that about three weeks after the trial of parsons and douse geoffreys uncle the solicitor died and to his surprise left him twenty thousand pounds believing he said in his will which was dated three days before the testators death that this sum will assist him to rise to the head of his profession  now that it had dawned upon her that her husband really was a success honorias manner towards him modified very considerably she even became amiable and once or twice almost affectionate when geoffrey told her of the twenty thousand pounds she was radiant  why we shall be able to go back to bolton street now she said and as luck will have it our old house is to let i saw a bill in the window yesterday  yes he said you can go back as soon as you like  and can we keep a carriage  no not yet i am doing well but not well enough for that next year if i live you will be able to have a carriage dont begin to grumble honoria i have got ¬£150 to spare and if you care to come round to a jewellers you can spend it on what you like  oh you delightful person said his wife  so they went to the jewellers and lady honoria bought ornaments to the value of ¬£150 and carried them home and hung over them as another class of woman might hang over her firstborn child admiring them with a tender ecstasy whenever he had a sum of money that he could afford to part with geoffrey would take her thus to a jewellers or a dressmakers and stand by coldly while she bought things to its value lady honoria was delighted it never entered into her mind that in a sense he was taking a revenge upon her and that every fresh exhibition of her rejoicings over the good things thus provided added to his contempt for her  those were happy days for lady honoria she rejoiced in this return of wealth like a schoolboy at the coming of the holidays or a halffrozen wanderer at the rising of the sun she had been miserable during all this night of poverty as miserable as her nature admitted of now she was happy again as she understood happiness for bred educated civilizedwhat you willout of the more human passions lady honoria had replaced them by this idolworship of wealth or rather of what wealth brings it gave her a positive physical satisfaction her beauty which had begun to fade came back to her she looked five years younger and all the while geoffrey watched her with an evergrowing scorn  once it broke out the bolton street house had been furnished he gave her fifteen hundred pounds to do it and with what things they owned she managed very well on that they moved into it and honoria had set herself up with a sufficient supply of grand dresses and jewellery suitable to her recovered position one day however it occurred to her that effie was a child of remarkable beauty who if properly dressed would look very nice in the drawingroom at teatime so she ordered a lovely costume for herthis deponent is not able to describe it but it consisted largely of velvet and lace geoffrey heard nothing of this dress but coming home rather early one afternoonit was on a saturday he found the child being shown off to a room full of visitors and dressed in a strange and wonderful attire with which not unnaturally she was vastly pleased he said nothing at the time but when at length the dropping fire of callers had ceased he asked who put effie into that dress  i did said lady honoria and a pretty penny it has cost i can tell you but i cant have the child come down so poorly clothed it does not look well  then she can stay upstairs said geoffrey frowning  what do you mean asked his wife  i mean that i will not have her decked out in those fine clothes they are quite unsuitable to her age there is plenty of time for her to take to vanity  i really dont understand you geoffrey why should not the child be handsomely dressed  why not great heaven honoria do you suppose that i want to see effie grow up like you to lead a life of empty pleasureseeking idleness and make a god of luxury i had rather see herhe was going to add dead first but checked himself and saidhave to work for her living dress yourself up as much as you like but leave the child alone  lady honoria was furious but she was also a little frightened she had never heard her husband speak quite like this before and there was something underneath his words that she did not quite understand still less did she understand when on the monday geoffrey suddenly told her that he had fifty pounds for her to spend as she liked then accompanied her to a mantle shop and stood patiently by smiling coldly while she invested it in lace and embroideries honoria thought that he was making reparation for his sharp words and so he was but to himself and in another sense every time he gave her money in this fashion geoffrey felt like a man who has paid off a debt of honour she had taunted him again and again with her povertythe poverty she said that he had brought her for every taunt he would heap upon her all those things in which her soul delighted he would glut her with wealth as in her hour of victory queen tomyris glutted dead cyrus with the blood of men  it was an odd way of taking a revenge and one that suited lady honoria admirably but though its victim felt no sting it gave geoffrey much secret relief also he was curious he wished to see if there was any bottom to such a womans desire for luxury if it would not bring satiety with it but lady honoria was a very bad subject for such an experiment she never showed the least sign of being satiated either with fine things with pleasures or with social delights they were her natural element and he might as soon have expected a fish to weary of the water or an eagle of the rushing air    the winter wore away and the spring came one day it was in april geoffrey who was a moderate liberal by persuasion casually announced at dinner that he was going to stand for parliament in the unionist interest the representation of one of the few metropolitan divisions which had then returned a home ruler had fallen vacant as it chanced he knew the head unionist whip very well they had been friends since they were lads at school together and this gentleman having heard geoffrey make a brilliant speech in court was suddenly struck with the idea that he was the very man to lead a forlorn hope  the upshot of it was that geoffrey was asked if he would stand and replied that he must have two days to think it over what he really wanted the two days for was to enable him to write to beatrice and receive an answer from her he had an almost superstitious faith in her judgment and did not like to act without it after carefully weighing the pros and cons his own view was that he should do well to stand probably he would be defeated and it might cost him five hundred pounds on the other hand it would certainly make his name known as a politician and he was now in a fair way to earn so large an income that he could well afford to risk the money the only great objection which he saw was that if he happened to get in it must mean that he would have to work all day and all night too well he was strong and the more work he did the betterit kept him from thinking  in due course beatrices answer came her view coincided with his own she recommended him to take the opportunity and pointed out that with his growing legal reputation there was no office in the state to which he might not aspire when he had once proved himself a capable member of parliament geoffrey read the letter through then immediately sat down and wrote to his friend the whip accepting the suggestion of the government  the next fortnight was a hard one for him but geoffrey was as good a man on the platform as in court and he had moreover the very valuable knack of suiting himself to his audience as his canvass went on it was generally recognised that the seat which had been considered hopeless was now doubtful a great amount of public interest was concentrated on the election both upon the unionist and the separatist side each claiming that the result of the poll would show to their advantage the home rule party strained every nerve against him being most anxious to show that the free and independent electors of this single division and therefore of the country at large held the government policy in particular horror letters were obtained from great authorities and freely printed irish members fresh from gaol were brought down to detail their grievances it was even suggested that one of them should appear on the platform in prison garbin short every electioneering engine known to political science was brought to bear to forward the fortunes of either side  as time went on lady honoria who had been somewhat indifferent at first grew quite excited about the result for one thing she found that the contest attached an importance to herself in the eyes of the truly great which was not without its charm on the day of the poll she drove about all day in an open carriage under a bright blue parasol having effie who had become very bored by her side and two noble lords on the front seat as a consequence the result was universally declared by a certain section of the press to be entirely due to the efforts of an unprincipled but titled and lovely woman it was even said that like another lady of rank in a past generation she kissed a butcher in order to win his vote but those who made the remark did not know lady honoria she was incapable of kissing a butcher or indeed anybody else her inclinations did not lie in that direction  in the end geoffrey was returned by a magnificent majority of ten votes reduced on a scrutiny to seven he took his seat in the house on the following night amidst loud unionist cheering in the course of the evenings debate a prominent member of the government made allusion to his return as a proof of the triumph of unionist principles thereon a very leading member of the separatist opposition retorted that it was nothing of the sort that it was a matter of common notoriety that the honourable members return was owing to the unusual and most uncommon ability displayed by him in the course of his canvass aided as it was by artfully applied and aristocratic feminine influence this was a delicate allusion to honoria and her blue parasol  as geoffrey and his wife were driving back to bolton street after the declaration of the poll a little incident occurred geoffrey told the coachman to stop at the first telegraph office and getting out of the carriage wired to beatrice in by ten votes  who have you been telegraphing to geoffrey asked lady honoria  i telegraphed to miss granger he answered  ah so you still keep up a correspondence with that pupil teacher girl  yes i do i wish that i had a few more such correspondents  indeed you are easy to please i thought her one of the most disagreeable young women whom i ever met  then it does not say much for your taste honoria  his wife made no further remark but she had her thoughts honoria possessed good points among others she was not a jealous person she was too cold and too indifferent to be jealous but she did not like the idea of another woman obtaining an influence over her husband who as she now began to recognise was one of the most brilliant men of his day and who might well become one of the most wealthy and powerful clearly he existed for her benefit not for that of any other woman she was no fool and she saw that a considerable intimacy must exist between the two otherwise geoffrey would not have thought of telegraphing to beatrice at such a moment  within a week of his election geoffrey made a speech it was not a long speech nor was it upon any very important issue but it was exceedingly good of its kind good enough to be reported verbatim indeed and those listening to it recognised that they had to deal with a new man who would one day be a very big man there is no place where an able person finds his level quicker than in the house of commons composed as it is for the most part of more or less wealthy or frantic mediocrities but geoffrey was not a mediocrity he was an exceedingly able and powerful man and this fact the house quickly recognised  for the next few months geoffrey worked as men rarely work all day he was at his chambers or in court and at night he sat in the house getting up his briefs when he could but he always did get them up no solicitors had to complain that the interests of their client were neglected by him also he still found time to write to beatrice for the rest he went out but little and except in the way of business associated with very few indeed he grew more and more silent and reserved till at last he won the reputation of being cold and hard not that he was really so he threw himself head and soul into his work with a fixed determination to reach the top of the tree he knew that he should not care very much about it when he got there but he enjoyed the struggle  geoffrey was not a truly ambitious man he was no mere selfseeker he knew the folly of ambition too well and its end was always clearly before his eyes he often thought to himself that if he could have chosen his lot he would have asked for a cottage with a good garden five hundred a year and somebody to care for but perhaps he would soon have wearied of his cottage he worked to stifle thought and to some extent he succeeded but he was at bottom an affectionatenatured man and he could not stifle the longing for sympathy which was his secret weakness though his pride would never allow him to show it what did he care for his triumphs when he had nobody with whom to share them all he could share were their fruits and these he gave away freely enough it was but little that geoffrey spent upon his own gratification a certain share of his gains he put by the rest went in expenses the house in bolton street was a very gay place in those days but its master took but little part in its gaieties  and what was the fact the longer he remained separated from beatrice the more intensely did he long for her society it was of no use try as he would he could not put that sweet face from his mind it drew him as a magnet draws a needle success did not bring him happiness except in the sense that it relieved him from money cares  people of coarse temperament only can find real satisfaction in worldly triumphs and eat drink and be merry for tomorrow they die men like geoffrey soon learn that this also is vanity on the contrary as his mind grew more and more wearied with the strain of work melancholy took an ever stronger hold of it had he gone to a doctor he might have been told that his liver was out of order which was very likely true but this would not mend matters what a world he might have cried what a world to live in when all the mans happiness depends upon his liver he contracted an accursed habit of looking on the black side of things trouble always caught his eye  it was no wonderful case men of large mind are very rarely happy men it is your little animalminded individual who can be happy thus women who reflect less are as a class much happier and more contented than men but the largeminded man sees too far and guesses too much of what he cannot see he looks forward and notes the dusty end of his laborious days he looks around and shudders at the unceasing misery of a coarse struggling world the sight of the pitiful beggar babe craving bread on tottering feet pierces his heart he cannot console himself with a reflection that the child had no business to be born or that if he denuded himself of his last pound he would not materially help the class which bred it  and above the garish lights of earthly joys and the dim reek of earthly wretchedness he sees the solemn firmament that veils his races destiny for such a man in such a mood even religion has terrors as well as hopes and while the gloom gathers about his mind these are with him more and more what lies beyond that arching mystery to whose horizon he daily draws more closewhose doors may even now be opening for him a hundred hands point out a hundred roads to knowledgethey are lost half way only the cold spiritual firmament unlit by any guiding stars unbrightened by the flood of human day and unshadowed by the veils of human night still bends above his head in awful changelessness and still his weary feet draw closer to the portals of the west  it is very sad and wrong but it is not altogether his fault it is rather a fault of the age of overeducation of overstriving to be wise cultivate the searching spirit and it will grow and rend you the spirit would soar it would see but the flesh weighs it down and in all flesh there is little light yet at times brooding on some unnatural height of thought its eyes seem to be opened and it catches gleams of terrifying days to come or perchance discerns the hopeless gates of an immeasurable night  oh for that simpler faith which ever recedes farther from the ken of the cultivated questioning mind there alone can peace be found and for the foolish who discard it setting up mans wisdom at a sign soon the human lot will be one long fear grown scientific and weary with the weight of knowledge they will reject their ancient gods and no smugfaced positivism will bring them consolation science here and there illumining the gloom of destiny with its poor electric lights cries out that they are guiding stars but they are no stars and they will flare away let us pray for darkness more darkness lest to our bewildered sight they do but serve to show that which shall murder hope    so think geoffrey and his kin and in their unexpressed dismay turn seeking refuge from their physical and spiritual loneliness but for the most part finding none nature still strong in them points to the dear fellowship of woman and they make the venture to find a mate not a companion but as it chanced in geoffreys case he did find such a companion in beatrice after he had by marriage built up an impassable wall between them  and yet he longed for her society with an intensity that alarmed him he had her letters indeed but what are letters one touch of a beloved hand is worth a thousand letters in the midst of his great success geoffrey was wretched at heart yet it seemed to him that if he once more could have beatrice at his side though only as a friend he would find rest and happiness    when a mans heart is thus set upon an object his reason is soon convinced of its innocence even of its desirability and a kindly fate will generally contrive to give him the opportunity of ruin which he so ardently desires    chapter xix  geoffrey has a visitor  and beatricehad she fared better during these long months alas not at all she had gone away from the bryngelly station on that autumn morning of farewell sick at heart and sick at heart she had remained through all the long winter months sorrow and bitterness had been her portion and now in the happiness of spring sorrow and bitterness were with her still she loved him she longed for his presence and it was denied to her she could not console herself as can some women nor did her deep passion wear away on the contrary it seemed to grow and gather with every passing week neither did she wish to lose it she loved too well for that it was better to be thus tormented by conscience and by hopelessness than to lose her cause of pain  one consolation beatrice had and one only she knew that geoffrey did not forget her his letters told her this these letters indeed were everything to hera woman can get so much more comfort out of a letter than a man next to receiving them she loved to answer them she was a good and even a brilliant letter writer but often and often she would tear up what she had written and begin again there was not much news in bryngelly it was difficult to make her letters amusing also the farcical nature of the whole proceeding seemed to paralyse her it was ridiculous having so much to say to be able to say nothing not that beatrice wished to indite loveletterssuch an idea had never crossed her mind but rather to write as they had talked yet when she tried to do so the results were not satisfactory to her the words looked strange on papershe could not send them  in geoffreys meteorlike advance to fame and fortune she took the keenest joy and interest far more than he did indeed though like that of most other intelligent creatures her soul turned with loathing from the dreary fustian of politics she would religiously search the parliamentary column from beginning to end on the chance of finding his name or the notice of a speech by him the law reports also furnished her with a happy huntingground in which she often found her game  but they were miserable months to rise in the morning to go through the round of daily dutythinking of geoffrey to come home wearied and finally to seek refuge in sleep and dreams of himthis was the sum of them then there were other troubles to begin with things had gone from bad to worse at the vicarage the tithes scarcely came in at all and every day their poverty pinched them closer had it not been for beatrices salary it was difficult to see how the family could have continued to exist she gave it almost all to her father now only keeping back a very small sum for her necessary clothing and such sundries as stamps and writing paper even then elizabeth grumbled bitterly at her extravagance in continuing to buy a daily paper asking what business she had to spend sixpence a week on such a needless luxury but beatrice would not make up her mind to dock the paper with its occasional mention of geoffrey  again owen davies was a perpetual anxiety to her his infatuation for herself was becoming notorious everybody saw it except her father mr grangers mind was so occupied with questions connected with tithe that fortunately for beatrice little else could find an entry owen dogged her about he would wait whole hours outside the school or by the vicarage gate merely to speak a few words to her sometimes when at length she appeared he seemed to be struck dumb he could say nothing but would gaze at her with his dull eyes in a fashion that filled her with vague alarm he never ventured to speak to her of his love indeed but he looked it which was almost as bad another thing was that he had grown jealous the seed which elizabeth had planted in his mind had brought forth abundantly though of course beatrice did not know that this was her sisters doing  on the very morning that geoffrey went away mr davies had met her as she was walking back from the station and asked her if mr bingham had gone when she replied that this was so she had distinctly heard him murmur thank god thank god subsequently she discovered also that he bribed the old postman to keep count of the letters which she sent and received from geoffrey  these things filled beatrice with alarm but there was worse behind mr davies began to send her presents first such things as prize pigeons and fowls then jewellery the pigeons and fowls she could not well return without exciting remark but the jewellery she sent back by one of the school children first came a bracelet then a locket with his photograph inside and lastly a case that when she opened it which her curiosity led her to do nearly blinded her with light it was a diamond necklace and she had never seen such diamonds before but from their size and lustre she knew that each stone must be worth hundreds of pounds beatrice put it in her pocket and carried it until she met him which she did in the course of that afternoon  mr davies she said before he could speak and handing him the package this has been sent to me by mistake will you kindly take it back  he took it abashed  mr davies she went on looking him full in the eyes i hope that there will be no more such mistakes please understand that i cannot accept presents from you  if mr bingham had sent it you would have accepted it he muttered sulkily  beatrice turned and flashed such a look on him that he fell back and left her but it was true and she knew that it was true if geoffrey had given her a sixpence with a hole in it she would have valued it more than all the diamonds on earth oh what a position was hers and it was wrong too she had no right to love the husband of another woman but right or wrong the fact remained she did love him  and the worst of it was that as she well knew sooner or later all this about mr davies must come to the ears of her father and then what would happen one thing was certain in his present povertystricken condition he would move heaven and earth to bring about her marriage to this rich man her father never had been very scrupulous where money was concerned and the pinch of want was not likely to make him more so  nor we may be sure did all this escape the jealous eye of elizabeth things looked black for her but she did not intend to throw up the cards on that account only it was time to lead trumps in other words beatrice must be fatally compromised in the eyes of owen davies if by any means this could be brought about so far things had gone well for her schemes beatrice and geoffrey loved each other of that elizabeth was certain but the existence of this secret underhand affection would avail her naught unless it could be ripened into acts everybody is free to indulge in secret predilections but if once they are given way to if once a womans character is compromised then the world avails itself of its opportunities and destroys her what man thought elizabeth would marry a compromised woman if beatrice could be compromised owen davies would not take her to wifetherefore this must be brought about  it sounds wicked and unnatural impossible that sister should so treat sister the reader of this history may say thinking of her own and of her affectionate and respectable surroundings but it is not impossible if you who doubt will study the law reports and no worse occupation can be wished to you you will find that such things are possible human nature can rise to strange heights and it can also fall to depths beyond your fathoming because a thing is without parallel in your own small experience it in no way follows that it cannot be  elizabeth was a very remorseless person she was moreshe was a woman actuated by passion and by greed the two strongest motives known to the human heart but with her recklessness she united a considerable degree of intelligence or rather of intellect had she been a savage she might have removed her sister from her path by a more expeditious way being what she was she merely strove to effect the same end by a method not punishable by law in short by murdering her reputation would she be responsible if her sister went wrong and was thus utterly discredited in the eyes of this man who wished to marry her and whom elizabeth wished to marry of course not that was beatrices affair but she could give her every chance of falling into temptation and this it was her fixed design to do  circumstances soon gave her an opportunity the need of money became very pressing at the vicarage they had literally no longer the wherewithal to live the tithe payers absolutely refused to fulfil their obligations as it happened jones the man who had murdered the auctioneer was never brought to trial he died shortly after his arrest in a fit of delirium tremens and nervous prostration brought on by the sudden cessation of a supply of stimulants and an example was lost that had he been duly hanged might have been made of the results of defying the law mr granger was now too poor to institute any further proceedings which in the state of public feeling in wales might or might not succeed he could only submit and submission meant beggary indeed he was already a beggar in this state of affairs he took counsel with elizabeth pointing out that they must either get money or starve now the only possible way to get money was by borrowing it and mr grangers suggestion was that he should apply to owen davies who had plenty indeed he would have done so long ago but that the squire had the reputation of being an exceedingly closefisted man  but this proposition did not at all suit elizabeths book her great object had been to conceal mr daviess desires as regards beatrice from her father and her daily dread was that he might become acquainted with them from some outside source she knew very well that if her father went up to the castle to borrow money it would be lent or rather given freely enough but she also knew that the lender would almost certainly take the opportunity the very favourable opportunity to unfold his wishes as regards the borrowers daughter the one thing would naturally lead to the otherthe promise of her fathers support of owens suit would be the consideration for the money received how gladly that support would be given was also obvious to her and with her father pushing beatrice on the one side and owen davies pushing her on the other how could elizabeth be sure that she would not yield beatrice would be the very person to be carried away by an idea of duty their father would tell her that he had got the money on this undertaking and it was quite possible that her pride might bring her to fulfil a bond thus given however distasteful the deed might be to her personally no her father must at all hazards be prevented from seeking assistance from owen davies and yet the money must be had from somewhere or they would be ruined  ah she had itgeoffrey bingham should lend the money he could well afford it now and she shrewdly guessed that he would not grudge the coat off his back if he thought that by giving it he might directly or indirectly help beatrice her father must go up to town to see him she would have no letterwriting one never knows how a letter may be read he must see mr bingham and if possible bring him down to bryngelly in a moment every detail of the plot became clear to elizabeths mind and then she spoke  you must not go to mr davies father she said he is a hard man and would only refuse and put you in a false position you must go to mr bingham listen he is rich now and he is very fond of you and of beatrice he will lend you a hundred pounds at once you must go to london by the early train tomorrow and drive straight to his chambers and see him it will cost two pounds to get there and back but that cannot be helped it is safer than writing and i am sure that you will not go for nothing and see here father bring mr bingham back with you for a few days if you can it will be a little return for his kindness and i know that he is not well beatrice had a letter from him in which he said that he was so overworked that he thought he must take a little rest soon bring him back for whitsunday  mr granger hesitated demurred and finally yielded the weak querulous old farmer clergyman worn out with many daily cares and quite unsupported by mental resources was but a tool in elizabeths able hands he did not indeed feel any humiliation at the idea of trying to borrow the cash for his nature was not finely strung and money troubles had made him callous to the verge of unscrupulousness but he did not like the idea of a journey to london where he had not been for more than twenty years and the expenditure that it entailed still he acted as elizabeth bade him even to keeping the expedition secret from beatrice beatrice as her sister explained to him was proud as lucifer and might raise objections if she knew that he was going to london to borrow money of mr bingham this indeed she would certainly have done  on the following afternoonit was the friday before whitsunday and the last day of the easter sittingsgeoffrey sat in his chambers in the worst possible spirits thoroughly stale and worn out with work there was a consultation going on and his client a pigheaded norfolk farmer who was bent upon proceeding to trial with some extraordinary action for trespass against his own landlord was present with his solicitor geoffrey in a few short clear words had explained the absurdity of the whole thing and strongly advised him to settle for the client had insisted on seeing him refusing to be put off with a written opinion but the farmer was not satisfied and the solicitor was now endeavouring to let the pure light of law into the darkness of his injured soul  geoffrey threw himself back in his chair pushed the dark hair from his brow and pretended to listen but in a minute his mind was far away heavens how tired he was well there would be rest for a few daystill tuesday when he had a matter that must be attended tothe house had risen and so had the courts what should he do with himself honoria wished to go and stay with her brother lord garsington and for a wonder to take effie with her he did not like it but he supposed that he should have to consent one thing was he would not go he could not endure garsington dunstan and all their set should he run down to bryngelly the temptation was very great that would be happiness indeed but his common sense prevailed against it no it was better that he should not go there he would leave bryngelly alone if beatrice wished him to come she would have said so and she had never even hinted at such a thing and if she had he did not think that he would have gone but he lacked the heart to go anywhere else he would stop in town rest and read a novel for geoffrey when he found time was not above this frivolous occupation possibly under certain circumstances he might even have been capable of writing one at that moment his clerk entered and handed him a slip of paper with something written on it he opened it idly and read  revd mr granger to see you told him you were engaged but he said he would wait  geoffrey started violently so violently that both the solicitor and the obstinate farmer looked up  tell the gentleman that i will see him in a minute he said to the retreating clerk and then addressing the farmer well sir i have said all that i have to say i cannot advise you to continue this action indeed if you wish to do so you must really direct your solicitor to retain some other counsel as i will not be a party to what can only mean a waste of money good afternoon and he rose  the farmer was convoyed out grumbling in another moment mr granger entered dressed in a somewhat threadbare suit of black and his thin white hair hanging as usual over his eyes geoffrey glanced at him with apprehension and as he did so noticed that he had aged greatly during the last seven months had he come to tell him some ill news of beatricethat she was ill or dead or going to be married  how do you do mr granger he said as he stretched out his hand and controlling his voice as well as he could how are you this is a most unexpected pleasure  how do you do mr bingham answered the old man while he seated himself nervously in a chair placing his hat with a trembling hand upon the floor beside him yes thank you i am pretty well not very grandworn out with trouble as the sparks fly upwards he added with a vague automatic recollection of the scriptural quotation  i hope that miss elizabeth and bethat your daughters are well also said geoffrey unable to restrain his anxiety  yes yes thank you mr bingham elizabeth isnt very grand either complains of a pain in her chest a little bilious perhapsshe always is bilious in the spring  and miss beatrice  oh i think shes wellvery quiet you know and a little pale perhaps but she is always quieta strange woman beatrice mr bingham a very strange woman quite beyond me i do not understand her and dont try to not like other women at all takes no pleasure in things seemingly curious with her good looksvery curious but nobody understands beatrice  geoffrey breathed a sigh of relief and how are tithes being paid mr granger not very grandly i fear i saw that scoundrel jones died in prison  mr granger woke up at once before he had been talking almost at random the subject of his daughters did not greatly interest him what did interest him was this money question nor was it very wonderful the poor narrowminded old man had thought about money till he could scarcely find room for anything else indeed nothing else really touched him closely he broke into a long story of his wrongs and drawing a paper from his breast pocket with shaking finger pointed out to geoffrey how that his clerical income for the last six months had been at the rate of only forty pounds a year upon which sum even a welsh clergyman could not consider himself passing rich geoffrey listened and sympathised then came a pause  thats how weve been getting on at bryngelly mr bingham mr granger said presently starving pretty well starving its only you who have been making money weve been sitting on the same dockleaf while you have become a great man if it had not been for beatrices salaryshes behaved very well about the salary has beatricei am sure i dont understand how the poor girl clothes herself on what she keeps i know that she had to go without a warm cloak this winter because she got a cough from itwe should have been in the workhouse and thats where we shall be yet and he rubbed the back of his withered hand across his eyes  geoffrey gasped beatrice with scarcely enough means to clothe herselfbeatrice shivering and becoming ill from the want of a cloak while he lived in luxury it made him sick to think of it for a moment he could say nothing  i have come hereive come went on the old man in a broken voice broken not so much by shame at having to make the request as from fear lest it should be refused to ask you if you could lend me a little money i dont know where to turn i dont indeed or i would not do it mr bingham i have spent my last pound to get here if you could lend me a hundred pounds id give you note of hand for it and try to pay it back little by little we might take twenty pounds a year from beatrices salary  dont pleasedo not talk of such a thing ejaculated the horrified geoffrey where the devil is my chequebook oh i know i left it in bolton street here this will do as well and he took up a draft note made out to his order and rapidly signing his name on the back of it handed it to mr granger it was in payment of the fees in the great case of parsons and douse and some other matters mr granger took the draft and holding it close to his eyes glanced at the amount it was ¬£200  but this is double what i asked for he said doubtfully am i to return you ¬£100  no no answered geoffrey i daresay that you have some debts to pay thank heaven i can get on very well and earn more money than i want not enough clothingit is shocking to think of he added more to himself than to his listener  the old man rose his eyes full of tears god bless you he said god bless you i do not know how to thank youi dont indeed and he caught geoffreys hand between his trembling palms and pressed it  please do not say any more mr granger it really is only a matter of mutual obligation no no i dont want any note of hand if i were to die it might be used against you you can pay me whenever it is convenient  you are too good mr bingham said the old clergyman where could another man be found who would lend me ¬£200 without security where indeed by the way he added i forgot my mind is in such a whirl will you come back with me for a few days to bryngelly we shall all be so pleased if you can do come mr bingham you look as though you want a change you do indeed  geoffrey dropped his hand heavily on the desk but half an hour before he had made up his mind not to go to bryngelly and nowthe vision of beatrice rose before his eyes beatrice who had gone cold all winter and never told him one word of their biting povertythe longing for the sight of beatrice came into his heart and like a hurricane swept the defences of his reason to the level ground temptation overwhelmed him he no longer struggled against it he must see her if it was only to say goodbye  thank you he said quietly lifting his bowed head yes i have nothing particular to do for the next day or two i think that i will come when do you go back  well i thought of taking the night mail but i feel so tired i really dont know i think i shall go by the nine oclock train tomorrow  that will suit me very well said geoffrey and now what are you going to do tonight you had better come and dine and sleep at my house no dress clothes oh never mind there are some people coming but they wont care a clergyman is always dressed come along and i will get that draft cashed the bank is shut but i can manage it    chapter xx  back at bryngelly  geoffrey and mr granger reached bolton street about six oclock the drawingroom was still full of callers lady honorias young men mustered in great force in those days they were very inoffensive young men and geoffrey had no particular objection to them only he found it difficult to remember all their names when geoffrey entered the drawingroom there were no fewer than five of them to say nothing of two stray ladies all superbly dressed and sitting metaphorically at honorias very pretty feet otherwise their contributions to the general store of amusement did not amount to much for her ladyship did most of the talking  geoffrey introduced mr granger whom honoria could not at first remember nor did she receive the announcement that he was going to dine and stay the night with any particular enthusiasm the young men melted away at geoffreys advent like mists before a rising sun he greeted them civilly enough but with him they had nothing in common to tell the truth they were a little afraid of him this man with his dark handsome face sealed with the stamp of intellect his powerfullooking form ill dressed according to their standard and his great and growing reputation was a person with whom they had no sympathy and who they felt had no sympathy with them we talk as though there is one heaven and one hell for all of us but here must be some mistake an impassable gulf yawns between the different classes of mankind what has such a man as geoffrey to do with the feeble male and female butterflies of a london drawingroom there is only one link between them they live on the same planet  when the fine young men and the two stray ladies had melted away geoffrey took mr granger up to his room coming downstairs again he found lady honoria waiting for him in the study  is that individual really going to dine and sleep here she asked  certainly honoria and he has brought no dress clothes he answered  really geoffrey it is too bad of you said the lady with some pardonable irritation why do you bring people to dinner in this promiscuous way it will quite upset the table just fancy asking an old welsh clergyman to dine who has not the slightest pretensions to being a gentleman when one has the prime minister and a bishop comingand a clergyman without dress clothes too what has he come for  he came to see me on business and as to the people coming to dinner if they dont like it they can grumble when they go home by the way honoria i am going down to wales for a day or two tomorrow i want a change  indeed going to see the lovely beatrice i suppose you had better be careful geoffrey that girl will get you into a mess and if she does there are plenty of people who are ready to make an example of you you have enemies enough i can tell you i am not jealous it is not in my line but you are too intimate with that girl and you will be sorry for it one day  nonsense said geoffrey angrily but nevertheless he felt that lady honorias words were words of truth it struck him moreover that she must feel this strongly or she would not have spoken in that tone honoria did not pose as a household philosopher still he would not draw back now his heart was set on seeing beatrice  am i to understand went on his wife that you still object to my staying with the garsingtons i think it is a little hard if i do not make a fuss about your going to see your village paragon that you should refuse to allow me to visit my own brother  geoffrey felt that he was being bargained with it was degrading but in the extremity of his folly he yielded  go if you like he said shortly but if you take effie mind she is properly looked after that is all and he abruptly left the room  lady honoria looked after him slowly nodding her handsome head ah she said to herself i have found out how to manage you now you have your weak point like other people master geoffreyand it spells beatrice only you must not go too far i am not jealous but i am not going to have a scandal for fifty beatrices i will not allow you to lose your reputation and position just imagine a man like that pining for a village girlshe is nothing more and they talk about his being so clever well he always liked ladies society that is his failing and now he has burnt his fingers they all do sooner or later especially these clever men the women flatter them thats it of course the girl is trying to get hold of him and she might do worse but so surely as my name is honoria bingham i will put a spoke in her wheel before she has done bah and they laugh at the power of women when a man like geoffrey with all the world to lose grows lovesick for a pretty face it is a very pretty face by the way i do believe that if i were out of the way he would marry her but i am in the way and mean to stay there well it is time to dress for dinner i only hope that old clown of a clergyman wont do something ridiculous i shall have to apologise for him  dinnertime had come it was a quarter past eight and the room was filled with highly bred people all more or less distinguished mr granger had duly appeared arrayed in his threadbare black coat relieved however by a pair of geoffreys dress shoes as might have been expected the great folk did not seem surprised at his presence or to take any particular notice of his attire the fact being that such people never are surprised a zulu chief in full war dress would only excite a friendly interest in their breasts on the contrary they recognised vaguely that the old gentleman was something out of the common run and as such worth cultivating indeed the prime minister hearing casually that he was a clergyman from wales asked to be introduced to him and at once fell into conversation about tithes a subject of which mr granger was thoroughly master  presently they went down to dinner mr granger escorting the wife of the bishop a fat and somewhat apoplectic lady blessed with an excellent appetite on his other side was the prime minister and between the two he got on very well especially after a few glasses of wine indeed both the apoplectic wife of the bishop and the head of her majestys government were subsequently heard to declare that mr granger was a very entertaining person to the former he related with much detail how his daughter had saved their hosts life and to the latter he discoursed upon the subject of tithes favouring him with his ideas of what legislation was necessary to meet the question somewhat to his own surprise he found that his views were received with attention and even with respect in the main too they received the support of the bishop who likewise felt keenly on the subject of tithes never before had mr granger had such a good dinner nor mingled with company so distinguished he remembered both till his dying day  next morning geoffrey and mr granger started before lady honoria was up into the details of their long journey to wales in a crowded thirdclass carriage we need not enter geoffrey had plenty to think of but his fears had vanished as fears sometimes do when we draw near to the object of them and had been replaced by a curious expectancy he saw now or thought he saw that he had been making a mountain out of a molehill probably it meant nothing at all there was no real danger beatrice liked him no doubt possibly she had even experienced a fit of tenderness towards him such things come and such things go time is a wonderful healer of moral distempers and few young ladies endure the chains of an undesirable attachment for a period of seven whole months it made him almost blush to think that this might be so and that the gratuitous extension of his misfortune to beatrice might be nothing more than the working of his own unconscious vanitya vanity which did she know of it would move her to angry laughter  he remembered how once when he was quite a young fellow he had been somewhat smitten with a certain lady who certainly if he might judge from her words and acts reciprocated the sentiment and he remembered also how when he met that lady some months afterwards she treated him with a cold indifference indeed almost with an insolence that quite bewildered him making him wonder how the same person could show in such different lights till at length mortified and ashamed by his mistake he had gone away in a rage and seen her face no more of course he had set it down to female infidelity he had served her turn she had made a fool of him and that was all she wanted now he might enjoy his humiliation it did not occur to him that it might be simple cussedness to borrow an energetic american term or that she had not really changed but was angry with him for some reason which she did not choose to show it is difficult to weigh the motives of women in the scales of male experience and many other men besides geoffrey have been forced to give up the attempt and to console themselves with the reflection that the inexplicable is generally not worth understanding  yes probably it would be the same case over again and yet and yetwas beatrice of that class had she not too much of a mans straightforwardness of aim to permit her to play such tricks in the bottom of his soul he thought that she had but he would not admit it to himself the fact of the matter was that half unknowingly he was trying to drug his conscience he knew that in his longing to see her dear face once more he had undertaken a dangerous thing he was about to walk with her over an abyss on a bridge which might bear them ormight break so long as he walked there alone it would be well but would it bear them both alas for the frailty of human nature this was the truth but he would not and did not acknowledge it he was not going to make love to beatrice he was going to enjoy the pleasure of her society in friendship there could be no harm  it is not difficult thus to still the qualms of an uneasy mind more especially when the thing in question at its worst is rather an offence against local custom than against natural law in many countries of the worldin nearly all countries indeed at different epochs of their historyit would have been no wrong that geoffrey and beatrice should love each other and human nature in strong temptation is very apt to override artificial barriers erected to suit the convenience or promote the prosperity of particular sections of mankind but as we have heard even though all things may be lawful yet all things are not expedient to commit or even to condone an act because the principle that stamps it as wrong will admit of argument on its merits is mere sophistry by the aid of which we might prove ourselves entitled to defy the majority of laws of all calibres laws vary to suit the generations but each generation must obey its own or confusion will ensue a deed should be judged by its fruits it may even be innocent in itself yet if its fruits are evil the doer in a sense is guilty  thus in some countries to mention the name of your motherinlaw entails the most unpleasant consequences on that intimate relation nobody can say that to name the lady is a thing wicked in itself yet the man who knowing the penalties which will ensue allows himself even in a fit of passion against that relative to violate the custom and mention her by name is doubtless an offender thus too the result of an entanglement between a woman and a man already married generally means unhappiness and hurt to all concerned more especially to the women whose prospects are perhaps irretrievably injured thereby it is useless to point to the example of the patriarchs some foreign royal families and many respectable turks it is useless to plead that the love is deep and holy love for which a man or woman might well live and die or to show extenuating circumstances in the fact of loneliness need of sympathy and that the existing marriage is a hollow sham the rule is clear a man may do most things except cheat at cards or run away in action a woman may break halfadozen hearts or try to break them and finally put herself up at auction and take no harm at allbut neither of them may in any event do this  not that geoffrey to do him justice had any such intentions most men are incapable of plots of that nature if they fall it is when the voice of conscience is lost in the whirlwind of passion and counsel is darkened by the tumultuous pleadings of the heart their sin is that they will most of them allow themselves to be put in positions favourable to the development of these disagreeable influences it is not safe to light cigarettes in a powder factory if geoffrey had done what he ought to have done he would never have gone to bryngelly and there would have been no story to tell or no more than there usually is    at length mr granger and his guest reached bryngelly there was nobody to meet them for nobody knew that they were coming so they walked up to the vicarage it was strange to geoffrey once more to pass by the little church through those wellremembered windtorn pines and see that low long house it seemed wonderful that all should still be just as it was that there should be no change at all when he himself had seen so much there was beatrices home where was beatrice  he passed into the house like a man in a dream in another moment he was in the long parlour where he had spent so many happy hours and elizabeth was greeting him he shook hands with her and as he did so noticed vaguely that she too was utterly unchanged her strawcoloured hair was pushed back from the temples in the same way the mouth wore the same hard smile her light eyes shone with the same cold look she even wore the same brown dress but she appeared to be very pleased to see him as indeed she was for the game looked well for elizabeth her father kissed her hurriedly and bustled from the room to lock up his borrowed cash leaving them together  somehow geoffreys conversational powers failed him where was beatrice she ought to be back from school it was holiday time indeed could she be away  he made an effort and remarked absently that things seemed very unchanged at bryngelly  you are looking for beatrice said elizabeth answering his thought and not his words she has gone out walking but i think she will be back soon excuse me but i must go and see about your room  geoffrey hung about a little then he lit his pipe and strolled down to the beach with a vague unexpressed idea of meeting beatrice he did not meet beatrice but he met old edward who knew him at once  lord sir he said its queer to see you here again specially when i thinks as how i saw you first and you a dead un to all purposes with your mouth open and miss beatrice ahanging on to your hair fit to pull your scalp off you never was nearer old davy than you was that night sir nor wont be and now youve been spared to become a parliament man i hears and much good may you do thereit will take all your time sirand i think sir that i should like to drink your health  geoffrey put his hand in his pocket and gave the old man a sovereign he could afford to do so now  does miss beatrice go out canoeing now he asked while edward mumbled his astonished thanks  at times sirthanking you kindly it aint many suvrings as comes my waythough i hate the sight on it i do id like to stave a hole in the bottom of that there cranky concern it aint safe and thats the fact therell be another accent out of it one of these fine days and no coming to next time but lord bless you its her way of pleasuring herself shes a queer un is miss beatrice and she gets queerer and queerer what with their being so tight screwed up at the vicarage no tithes and that and one thing and another not but what im thinking sir he added in a portentous whisper as the squire has got summut to do with it hes a courting of her he is hes as hard after her as a dog fish after a stray herring and why she cant just say yes and marry him im sure i dont know  perhaps she doesnt like him said geoffrey coldly  may be sir may be maids all have their fancies in whatsoever walk o life it has pleased god to stick em but its a wonderful pity it is he aint no great shakes he aint but hes a sound manno girl cant want a sounderlived quiet all his days you see sir and whats more hes got the money and moneys tight up at the vicarage sir gals must give up their fancies sometimes sir lord a brace of brats and shed forget all about em im seventy years old and ive seen their ways sir though in a humble calling you should say a word to her sir shed thank you kindly five years after youd do her a good turn sir you would and not a bad un as the saying goes and give it the lieno beg your pardon that is the other way roundshes bound to do you the bad turn having saved your life though i dont see how she could do that unless begging your pardon she made you fall in love with her being married which though strange wouldnt be wunnerful seeing what she is and seeing how i has been in love with her myself since she was seven old missus and all who died eight years gone and well rid of the rheumatics  beatrice was one of the few subjects that could unlock old edwards breast and geoffrey retired before his confusing but suggestive eloquence hurriedly bidding the old man goodnight he returned to the house and leaning on the gate watched the twilight dying on the bosom of the west  suddenly a bunch of wild roses in her girdle beatrice emerged from the gathering gloom and stood before him face to face    chapter xxi  the third appeal  face to face they stood while at the vision of her sweetness his heart grew still face to face and the faint light fell upon her tender loveliness and died in her deep eyes and the faint breeze fragrant with the breath of pines gently stirred her hair oh it was worth living to see her thus  i beg your pardon she said in a puzzled tone stepping forward to pass the gate  beatrice  she gave a little cry and clutched the railing else she would have fallen one moment she stayed so looking up towards his face that was hid in the deepening shadowlooking with wild eyes of hope and fear and love  is it you she said at length or another dream  it is i beatrice he answered amazed  she recovered herself with an effort  then why did you frighten me so she asked it was unkindoh i did not mean to say anything cross what did i say i forget i am so glad that you have come and she put her hand to her forehead and looked at him again as one might gaze at a ghost from the grave  did you not expect me geoffrey asked  expect you no no more than i expected and she stopped suddenly  it is very odd he said i thought you knew that your father was going to ask me down i returned from london with him  from london she murmured i did not know elizabeth did not tell me anything about it i suppose that she forgot  here i am at any rate and how are you  oh well now quite well there i am all right again it is very wrong to frighten people in that way mr bingham she added in her usual voice let me pass through the gate and i will shake hands with youif she added in a tone of gentle mockery one may shake hands with so great a man but i told you how it would be did i not just before we were drowned together you know how is effie  effie flourishes he answered do you know you do not look very grand your father told me that you had a cold in the winter and geoffrey shivered as he thought of the cause  oh thank you i have nothing to complain of i am strong and well how long do you stay here  not long perhaps till tuesday morning perhaps till monday  beatrice sighed happiness is short she had not brought him here she would not have lifted a finger to bring him here but since he had come she wished that he was going to stay longer  it is supper time she said let us go in  so they went in and ate their supper it was a happy meal mr granger was in almost boisterous spirits it is wonderful what a difference the possession of that two hundred pounds made in his demeanour he seemed another man it was true that a hundred of it must go in paying debts but a hundred would be left which meant at least a years respite for him elizabeth too relaxed her habitual grimness the two hundred pounds had its influence on her also and there were other genial influences at work in her dark secret heart beatrice knew nothing of the money and sat somewhat silent but she too was happy with the wild unreal happiness that sometimes visits us in dreams  as for geoffrey if lady honoria could have seen him she would have stared in astonishment of late he had been a very silent man many people indeed had found him a dull companion but under the influence of beatrices presence he talked and talked brilliantly perhaps he was unconsciously striving to show at his very best before her as a man naturally does in the presence of a woman whom he loves so brilliantly did he talk that at last they all sat still and listened to him and they might have been worse employed  at length supper was done and elizabeth retired to her room presently too mr granger was called out to christen a sick baby and went grumbling and they were left alone they sat in the windowplace and looked out at the quiet night  tell me about yourself said beatrice  so he told her he narrated all the steps by which he had reached his present position and showed her how from it he might rise to the topmost heights of all she did not look at him and did not answer him but once when he paused thinking that he had talked enough about himself she said go on tell me some more  at last he had told her all  yes she said you have the power and the opportunity and you will one day be among the foremost men of your generation  i doubt it he said with a sigh i am not ambitious i only work for the sake of work not for what it will bring one day i daresay that i shall weary of it all and leave it but while i do work i like to be among the first in my degree  oh no she answered you must not give it up you must go on and on promise me she continued looking at him for the first timepromise me that while you have health and strength you will persevere till you stand alone and quite preeminent then you can give it up  why should i promise you this beatrice  because i ask it of you once i saved your life mr bingham and it gives me some little right to direct its course i wish that the man whom i saved to the world should be among the first men in the world not in wealth which is an accident but in intellect and force promise me this and i shall be happy  i promise you he said i promise that i will try to rise because you ask it not because the prospect attracts me but as he spoke his heart was wrung it was bitter to hear her speak thus of a future in which she would have no share which as her words implied would be a thing utterly apart from her as much apart as though she were dead  yes he said again you gave me my life and it makes me very unhappy to think that i can give you nothing in return oh beatrice i will tell you what i have never told to any one i am lonely and wretched with the exception of yourself i do not think that there is anybody who really cares fori mean who really sympathises with me in the world i daresay that it is my own fault and it sounds a humiliating thing to say and in a fashion a selfish thing i never should have said it to any living soul but you what is the use of being great when there is nobody to work for things might have been different but the world is a hard place if youif you  at this moment his hand touched hers it was accidental but in the tenderness of his heart he yielded to the temptation and took it then there was a moments pause and very gently she drew her hand away and thrust it in her bosom  you have your wife to share your fortune she said you have effie to inherit it and you can leave your name to your country  then came a heavy pause  and you he said breaking it what future is there for you  she laughed softly women have no future and they ask none at least i do not now though once i did it is enough for them if they can ever so little help the lives of others that is their happiness and their reward isrest    just then mr granger came back from his christening and beatrice rose and went to bed  looks a little pale doesnt she mr bingham said her father i think she must be troubled in her mind the fact iswell there is no reason why i should not tell you she thinks so much of you and you might say a word to brighten her upwell its about mr davies i fancy you know that she likes him and is vexed because he does not come forward well you seeof course i may be mistaken but i have sometimes thought that he may i have seen him look as if he was thinking of it though of course it is more than beatrice has got any right to expect shes only got herself and her good looks to give him and hes a rich man think of it mr bingham and the old gentleman turned up his eyes piously just think what a thing it would be for her and indeed for all of us if it should please god to send a chance like that in her way she would be rich for life and such a position but it is possible one never knows he might take a fancy to her at any rate mr bingham i think you could cheer her up a little there is no need for her to give up hope yet  geoffrey burst into a short grim laugh the idea of beatrice languishing for owen davies indeed the irony of the whole position was too much for his sense of humour  yes he said i daresay that it might be a good match for her but i do not know how she would get on with mr davies  get on why well enough of course women are soft and can squeeze into most holes especially if they are well lined besides he may be a bit heavy but i think she is pining for him and its a pity that she should waste her life like that what are you going to bed well goodnightgoodnight  geoffrey did go to bed but not to sleep for a long while he lay awake thinking he thought of the last night which he had spent in this little room of its strange experiences of all that had happened since and of the meeting of today could he after that meeting any longer doubt what were the feelings with which beatrice regarded him it was difficult to so and yet there was still room for error then he thought of what old edward had said to him and of what mr granger had said with reference to beatrice and owen davies the views of both were crudely and even vulgarly expressed but they coincided and what was more there was truth in them and he knew it the idea of beatrice marrying mr davies to put it mildly was repulsive to him but had he any claim to stand between her and so desirable a settlement in life clearly he had not his conscience told him so  could it be right moreover that this kind of tie which existed between them should be knitted more closely what would it mean trouble and nothing but trouble more especially to beatrice who would fret her days away to no end he had done wrong in coming here at all he had done wrong in taking her hand he would make the only reparation in his power as though in such a case as that of beatrice reparation were now possible he would efface himself from her life and see her no more then she might learn to forget him or at the worst to remember him with but a vague regret yes cost what it might he would force himself to do it before any actual mischief ensued the only question was should he not go further should he not tell her that she would do well to marry mr davies  pondering over this most painful question at last he went to sleep  when men in geoffreys unhappy position turn penitent and see the error of their ways the prudent resolves that ensue are apt to overshoot the mark and to partake of an aggressive nature not satisfied with leaving things alone they must needs hasten to proclaim their newfound virtue to the partner of their fault and advertise their infallible specific to be taken by the partner for restoring the status quo ante sometimes as a consequence of this pious zeal they find themselves misunderstood or even succeed in precipitating the catastrophe which they laudably desire to prevent    the morrow was whitsunday and a day that geoffrey had occasion to remember for the rest of his life they all met at breakfast and shortly afterwards went to church the service being at halfpast ten by way of putting into effect the good resolutions with which he was so busy paving an inferno of his own geoffrey did not sit by beatrice but took a seat at the end of the little church close to the door and tried to console himself by looking at her  it was a curious sullennatured day and although there was not very much sun the air was as hot as though they were in midsummer had they been in a volcanic region geoffrey would have thought that such weather preceded a shock of earthquake as it was he knew that the english climate was simply indulging itself at the expense of the population but as up to the present the season had been cold this knowledge did not console him indeed he felt so choked in the stuffy little church that just before the sermon which he happened to be aware was not written by beatrice he took an opportunity to slip out unobserved not knowing where to go he strolled down to the beach on which there was nobody to be seen for as has been observed bryngelly slept on sundays presently however a man approached walking rapidly and to all appearance aimlessly in whom he recognised owen davies he was talking to himself while he walked and swinging his arms geoffrey stepped aside to let him pass and as he did so was surprised and even shocked to see the change in the man his plump healthylooking face had grown thin and wore a half sullen half pitiful expression there were dark circles round his blue eyes once so placid and his hair would have been the better for cutting geoffrey wondered if he had had an illness at that moment owen chanced to look round and saw him  how do you do mr bingham he said i heard that you were here they told me at the station last night you see this is a small place and one likes to know who comes and goes he added as though in excuse  he walked on and geoffrey walked with him  you do not look well mr davies he said have you been laid up  no no he answered i am quite right it is only my mind that is ill  indeed said geoffrey thinking that he certainly did look strange perhaps you live too much alone and it depresses you  yes i live alone because i cant help myself what is a man to do mr bingham when the woman he loves will not marry him wont look at him treats him like dirt  marry somebody else suggested geoffrey  oh it is easy for you to say thatyou have never loved anybody and you dont understand i cannot marry anybody else i want her only  her whom  who why beatricewhom else could a man want to marry if once he had seen her but she will not have me she hates me  really said geoffrey  yes really and do you know why shall i tell you why i will tell you and he grasped him by the arm and whispered hoarsely in his ear because she loves you mr bingham  i tell you what it is mr davies said geoffrey shaking his arm free i am not going to stand this kind of thing you must be off your head  dont be angry with me he answered it is true i have watched her and i know that it is true why does she write to you every week why does she always start and listen when anybody mentions your name oh mr bingham owen went on piteously be mercifulyou have your wife and lots of women to make love to if you wishleave me beatrice if you dont i think that i shall go crazed i have always loved her ever since she was a child and now my love travels faster and grows stronger every day and carries me away with it like a rock rolling down a hill you can only bring beatrice to shame but i can give her everything as much money as she wants all that she wants and i will make her a good husband i will never leave her side  i have no doubt that would be delightful for her answered geoffrey but does it not strike you that all this is just a little undignified these remarks interesting as they are should be made to miss granger not to me mr davies  i know he said but i dont care it is my only chance and what do i mind about being undignified oh mr bingham i have never loved any other woman i have been lonely all my days do not stand in my path now if you only knew what i have suffered how i have prayed god night after night to give me beatrice you would help me say that you will help me you are one of those men who can do anything she will listen to you if you tell her to marry me she will do so and i shall bless you my whole life  geoffrey looked upon this abject suppliant with the most unmitigated scorn there is always something contemptible in the sight of one man pleading to another for assistance in his love affairsthat is a business which he should do for himself how much greater then is the humiliation involved when the amorous person asks the aid of one whom he believes to be his rivalhis successful rivalin the ladys affection  do you know mr davies geoffrey said i think that i have had enough of this i am not in a position to force miss granger to accept advances which appear to be unwelcome according to your account but if i get an opportunity i will do this i will tell her what you say you really must manage the rest for yourself good morning to you mr davies  he turned sharply and went while owen watched him go  i dont believe him he groaned to himself he will try to make her his lover oh god help mei cannot bear to think of it but if he does and i find him out let him be careful i will ruin him yes i will ruin him i have the money and i can do it ah he thinks me a fool they all think me a fool but i havent been quiet all these years for nothing i can make a noise if necessary and if he is a villain god will help me to destroy him i have prayed to god and god will help me  then he went back to the castle owen davies was a type of the class of religious men who believe that they can enlist the almighty on the side of their desires provided only that those desires receive the sanction of human law or custom    thus within twentyfour hours geoffrey received no less than three appeals to help the woman whom he loved to the arms of a distasteful husband no wonder then that he grew almost superstitious about the matter    chapter xxii  a night of storm  that afternoon the whole vicarage party walked up to the farm to inspect another litter of young pigs it struck geoffrey remembering former editions that the reproductive powers of mr grangers old sow were something little short of marvellous and he dreamily worked out a calculation of how long it would take her and her progeny to produce a pig to every square yard of the area of plucky little wales it seemed that the thing could be done in six years which was absurd so he gave up calculating  he had no words alone with beatrice that afternoon indeed a certain coldness seemed to have sprung up between them with the almost supernatural quickness of a loving womans intuition she had divined that something was passing in his mind inimical to her most vital interests so she shunned his company and received his conventional advances with a politeness which was as cold as it was crushing this did not please geoffrey it is one thing in her own interests of course to make up your mind heroically to abandon a lady whom you do not wish to compromise and quite another to be snubbed by that lady before the moment of final separation though he never put the idea into words or even defined it in his mindfor geoffrey was far too anxious and unhappy to be flippant at any rate in thoughthe would at heart have wished her to remain the same indeed to wax ever tenderer till the fatal time of parting arrived and even to show appreciation of his virtuous conduct  but to the utter destruction of most such hands as geoffrey held loving women never will play according to the book their conduct imperils everything for it is obvious that it takes two to bring an affair of this nature to a dignified conclusion even when the stakes are highest and the matter is one of life and death beatrice after all was very much of a woman and she did not behave much better than any other woman would have done she was angry and suspicious and she showed it with the result that geoffrey grew angry also it was cruel of her he thought considering all things he forgot that she could know nothing of what was in his mind however much she might guess also as yet he did not know the boundless depth and might of her passion for him and all that it meant to her had he realised this he would have acted very differently    they came home and took tea then mr granger and elizabeth made ready to go to evening service to geoffreys dismay beatrice did the same he had looked forward to a quiet walk with herreally this was not to be borne fortunately or rather unfortunately she was ready the first and he got a word with her  i did not know that you were going to church he said i thought that we might have had a walk together very likely i shall have to go away early tomorrow morning  indeed answered beatrice coldly but of course you have your work to attend to i told elizabeth that i was coming to church and i must go it is too sultry to walk there will be a storm soon  at this moment elizabeth came in  well beatrice she said are you coming to church father has gone on  beatrice pretended not to hear and reflected a moment he would go away and she would see him no more could she let slip this last hour oh she could not do it  in that moment of reflection her fate was sealed  no she answered slowly i dont think that i am coming it is too sultry to go to church i daresay that mr bingham will accompany you  geoffrey hastily disclaimed any such intention and elizabeth started alone ah she said to herself i thought that you would not come my dear  well said geoffrey when she had well gone shall we go out  i think it is pleasanter here answered beatrice  oh beatrice dont be so unkind he said feebly  as you like she replied there is a fine sunsetbut i think that we shall have a storm  they went out and turned up the lonely beach the place was utterly deserted and they walked a little way apart almost without speaking the sunset was magnificent great flakes of golden cloud were driven continually from a home of splendour in the west towards the cold lined horizon of the land the sea was still quiet but it moaned like a thing in pain the storm was gathering fast  what a lovely sunset said geoffrey at length  it is a fatal sort of loveliness she answered it will be a bad night and a wet morrow the wind is rising shall we turn  no beatrice never mind the wind i want to speak to you if you will allow me to do so  yes said beatrice what about mr bingham  to make good resolutions in a matter of this sort is comparatively easy but the carrying of them out presents some difficulties geoffrey consciencestricken into priggishness wished to tell her that she would do well to marry owen davies and found the matter hard meanwhile beatrice preserved silence  the fact is he said at length i most sincerely hope you will forgive me but i have been thinking a great deal about you and your future welfare  that is very kind of you said beatrice with an ominous humility  this was disconcerting but geoffrey was determined and he went on in a somewhat flippant tone born of the most intense nervousness and hatred of his task never had he loved her so well as now in this moment when he was about to counsel her to marry another man and yet he persevered in his folly for as so often happens the shrewd insight and knowledge of the world which distinguished geoffrey as a lawyer when dealing with the affairs of others quite deserted him in this crisis of his own life and that of the woman who worshipped him  since i have been here he said i have had made to me no less than three appeals on your behalf and by separate peopleby your father who fancies that you are pining for owen davies by owen davies who is certainly pining for you and by old edward intervening as a kind of domestic amicus curi√¶  indeed said beatrice in a voice of ice  all these three urged the same thingthe desirability of your marrying owen davies  beatrices face grew quite pale her lips twitched and her grey eyes flashed angrily  really she said and have you any advice to give on the subject mr bingham  yes beatrice i have i have thought it over and i think thatforgive me againthat if you can bring yourself to it perhaps you had better marry him he is not such a bad sort of man and he is well off  they had been walking rapidly and now they were reaching the spot known as the amphitheatre that same spot where owen davies had proposed to beatrice some seven months before  beatrice passed round the projecting edge of rock and walked some way towards the flat slab of stone in the centre before she answered while she did so a great and bitter anger filled her heart she saw or thought she saw it all geoffrey wished to be rid of her he had discerned an element of danger in their intimacy and was anxious to make that intimacy impossible by pushing her into a hateful marriage suddenly she turned and faced himturned like a thing at bay the last red rays of the sunset struck upon her lovely face made more lovely still by its stamp of haughty anger they lay upon her heaving breast full in the eyes she looked him with those wide angry eyes of hersnever before had he seen her so imperial a mien her dignity and the power of her presence literally awed him for at times beatrices beauty was of that royal stamp which when it hides a heart is a compelling force conquering and born to conquer  does it not strike you mr bingham she said quietly that you are taking a very great liberty does it not strike you that no man who is not a relation has any right to speak to a woman as you have spoken to methat in short you have been guilty of what in most people would be an impertinence what right have you to dictate to me as to whom i should or should not marry surely of all things in the world that is my own affair  geoffrey coloured to the eyes as would have been the case with most men of his class he felt her accusation of having taken a liberty of having presumed upon an intimacy more keenly than any which she could have brought against him  forgive me he said humbly i can only assure you that i had no such intention i only spokeilljudgedly i fearbecausebecause i felt driven to it  beatrice took no notice of his words but went on in the same cold voice  what right have you to speak of my affairs with mr davies with an old boatman or even with my father had i wished you to do so i should have asked you by what authority do you constitute yourself an intermediary for the purpose of bringing about a marriage which you are so good as to consider would be to my pecuniary interest do you not know that such a matter is one which the woman concerned the woman whose happiness and selfrespect are at stake alone can judge of i have nothing more to say except this i said just now that you had been guilty of what would in most people be an impertinence well i will add something in this case mr bingham there are circumstances which make ita cruel insult  she stopped speaking then suddenly without the slightest warning burst into passionate weeping as she did so the first rush of the storm passed over them winnowing the air as with a thousand eagles wings and was lost on the moaning depths beyond  the light went out of the sky now geoffrey could only see the faint outlines of her weeping face one moment he hesitated and one only then nature prevailed against him for the next she was in his arms  beatrice scarcely resisted him her energies seemed to fail her or perhaps she had spent them in her bitter words her head fell upon his shoulder and there she sobbed her fill presently she lifted it and their lips met in a first long kiss it was finished this was the end of itand thus did geoffrey prosper owen daviess suit  oh you are cruel cruel he whispered in her ear you must have known i loved you beatrice that i spoke against myself because i thought it to be my duty you must have known that to my sin and sorrow i have always loved you that you have never been an hour from my mind that i have longed to see your face like a sick man for the light tell me did you not know it beatrice  how should i know she answered very softly i could only guess and if indeed you love me how could you wish me to marry another man i thought that you had learned my weakness and took this way to reproach me oh geoffrey what have we done what is there between you and meexcept our love  it would have been better if we had been drowned together at the first he said heavily  no no she answered for then we never should have loved one another better first to love and then to die  do not speak so he said let us sit here and be happy for a little while tonight and leave trouble till tomorrow  and where on a bygone day beatrice had tarried with another wooer side by side they sat upon the great stone and talked such talk as lovers use  above them moaned the rising gale though sheltered as they were by cliffs its breath scarcely stirred their hair in front of them the long waves boomed upon the beach while far out to sea the crescent moon draped in angry light seemed to ride the waters like a boat    and were they alone with their great bliss or did they only dream nay they were alone with love and lovers joys and all the truth was told and all their doubts were done now there was an end of hopes and fears now reason fell and love usurped his throne and at that royal coming heaven threw wide her gates oh sweetest and most dear oh dearest and most sweet oh to have lived to find this happy houroh in this hour to die  see heaviness is behind us see now we are one blow you winds blow out your stormy heart we know the secret of your strength you rush to your desire fall deep waters of the sea fall in thunder at the feet of earth we hear the music of your pleading  earth and seas and winds sing your great chant of love heaven and space and time echo back the melody for life has called to us the answer of his riddle heart to heart we sit and lips to lips and we are more wise than solomon and richer than barbarian kings for happiness is ours  to this end were we born dearest and most sweet and from all time predestinate to this end sweetest and most dear do we live and die in death to find completer unity for here is that secret of the world which wise men search and cannot find and here too is the gate of heaven  look into my eyes and let me gaze on yours and listen how these things shall be the world is but a mockery and a shadow is our flesh for where once they were there shall be naught only love is real love shall endure till all the suns are dead and yet be young  kiss me thou conqueror for destiny is overcome sorrow is gone by and the flame that we have hallowed upon this earthly altar shall still burn brightly and yet more bright when yonder stars have lost their fire  but alas words cannot give a fitting form to such a song as this let music try but music also folds her wings for in so supreme an hour  a bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast  and through that opened door come sights and sounds such as cannot be written    they tell us it is madness that this unearthly glory is but the frenzy of a passion gross in its very essence let those think it who will but to dreamers let them leave their dreams why then at such a time do visions come to children of the world like beatrice and geoffrey why do their doubts vanish and what is that breath from heaven which they seem to feel upon their brow the intoxication of earthly love born of the meeting of youth and beauty so be it slave bring more such wine and let us drinkto immortality and to those dear eyes that mirror forth a spirits face  such loves indeed are few for they must be real and deep and natures thus shaped are rare nor do they often cross each others line of life yes there are few who can be borne so high and none can breathe that ether long soon the wings which love lent them in his hour of revelation will shrink and vanish and the borrowers will fall back to the level of this world happy if they escape uncrushed perchance even in their lifedays they may find these spirit wings again overshadowing the altar of their vows in the hour of earthly marriage if by some happy fate marriage should be within their reach or like the holy pinions of the goddess nout folded about a coffin in the time of earthly death but scant are the occasions and few there are who know them    thus soared beatrice and geoffrey while the wild night beat around them making a fit accompaniment to their stormy loves and thus they too fell from heaven to earth  we must be going geoffrey it grows late said beatrice oh geoffrey geoffrey what have we done what can be the end of all this it will bring trouble on you i know that it must the old saying will come true i saved your life and i shall bring ruin on you  it is characteristic of beatrice that already she was thinking of the consequences to geoffrey not of those to herself  beatrice said geoffrey we are in a desperate position do you wish to face it and come away with me far away to the other side of the world  no no she answered vehemently it would be your ruin to abandon the career that is before you what part of the world could you go to where you would not be known besides there is your wife to think of ah god your wifewhat would she say of me you belong to her you have no right to desert her and there is effie too no geoffrey no i have been wicked enough to learn to love youoh as you were never loved before if it is wicked to do what one cannot helpbut i am not bad enough for this walk quicker geoffrey we shall be late and they will suspect something  poor beatrice the pangs of conscience were finding her out  we are in a dreadful position he said again oh dearest i have been to blame i should never have come back here it is my fault and though i never thought of this i did my best to please you  and i thank you for it she answered do not deceive yourself geoffrey whatever happens promise me never for one moment to believe that i reproached or blamed you why should i blame you because you won my heart let me sooner blame the sea on which we floated the beach where we walked the house in which we lived and the destiny that brought us together i am proud and glad to love you dear but i am not so selfish as to wish to ruin you geoffreyi had rather die  dont talk so he said i cannot bear it what are we to do am i to go away and see you no more how can we live so beatrice  yes geoffrey she answered heavily taking him by the hand and gazing up into his face you are to go away and see me no more not for years and years this is what we have brought upon ourselves it is the price that we must pay for this hour which has gone you are to go away tomorrow that we may be put out of temptation and you must come back no more sometimes i shall write to you and sometimes perhaps you will write to me till the thing becomes a burden then you can stop and whether you forget me or notand geoffrey i do not think you willyou will know that i shall never forget you whom i saved from the seato love me  there was something so sweet and infinitely tender about her words instinct as they were with natural womanly passion that geoffrey bent at heart beneath their weight as a fir bends beneath the gentle gathering snow what was he to do how could he leave her and yet she was right he must go and go quickly lest his strength might fail him and hand in hand they should pass a bourne from which there is no return  heaven help us beatrice he said i will go tomorrow morning and if i can i will keep away  you must keep away i will not see you any more i will not bring trouble on you geoffrey  you talk of bringing trouble on me he said you say nothing of yourself and yet a man even a man with eyes on him like myself is better fitted to weather such a storm if it ruined me how much more would it ruin you  they were at the gate of the vicarage now and the wind rushed so strongly through the firs that she needed to put her lips quite close to his ear to make her words heard  stop one minute she said perhaps you do not quite understand when a woman does what i have done it is because she loves with all her life and heart and soul because all these are a part of her love for myself i no longer care anythingi have no self away from you i have ceased to be of myself or in my own keeping i am of you and in yours for myself and my own fate or name i think no more with my eyes open and of my own free will i have given everything to you and am glad and happy to give it but for you i still do care and if i took any step or allowed you to take any that could bring sorrow on you i should never forgive myself that is why we must part geoffrey and now let us go in there is nothing more to say except this if you wish to bid me goodbye a last goodbye dear geoffrey i will meet you tomorrow morning on the beach  i shall leave at halfpast eight he said hoarsely  then we will meet at seven beatrice said and led the way into the house  elizabeth and mr granger were already seated at supper they supped at nine on sunday nights it was just halfpast  dear me said the old gentleman we began to think that you two must have been out canoeing and got yourselves drowned in good earnest this time what have you been doing  we have had a long walk answered geoffrey i did not know that it was so late  one wants to be pleased with ones company to walk far on such a night as this put in elizabeth maliciously  and so we wereat least i was geoffrey answered with perfect truth and the night is not so bad as you might think at least under the lee of the cliffs it will be worse by and by  then they sat down and made a desperate show of eating supper elizabeth the keeneyed noticed that geoffreys hand was shaking now what she wondered would make the hand of a strong man shake like a leaf deep emotion might do it and elizabeth thought that she detected other signs of emotion in them both besides that of geoffreys shaking hand the plot was working well but could it be brought to a climax oh if he would only throw prudence to the winds and run away with beatrice so that she might be rid of her and free to fight for her own hand  shortly after supper both elizabeth and beatrice went to bed leaving their father with geoffrey  well said mr granger did you get a word with beatrice it was very kind of you to go that long tramp on purpose gracious how it blows we shall have the house down presently lightning too i declare  yes answered geoffrey i did  ah i hope you told her that there was no need for her to give up hope of him yet of mr davies i mean  yes i told her thatthat is if the greater includes the less he added to himself  and how did she take it  very badly said geoffrey she seemed to think that i had no right to interfere  indeed that is strange but it doesnt mean anything shes grateful enough to you at heart depend upon it she is only she did not like to say so dear me how it blows we shall have a night of it a regular gale i declare so you are going away tomorrow morning well the best of friends must part i hope that you will often come and see us goodbye  once more a sense of the irony of the position overcame geoffrey and he smiled grimly as he lit his candle and went to bed at the back of the house was a long passage which terminated at one end in the room where he slept and at the other in that occupied by elizabeth and beatrice this passage was lit by two windows and built out of it were two more roomsthat of mr granger and another which had been effies the windows of the passage like most of the others in the vicarage were innocent of shutters and geoffrey stood for a moment at one of them watching the lightning illumine the broad breast of the mountain behind then looking towards the door of beatrices room he gazed at it with the peculiar reverence that sometimes afflicts people who are very much in love and with a sigh turned and sought his own  he could not sleep it was impossible for nearly two hours he lay turning from side to side and thinking till his brain seemed like to burst tomorrow he must leave her leave her for ever and go back to his coarse unprofitable struggle with the world where there would be no beatrice to make him happy through it all and she what of her  the storm had lulled a little now it came back in strength heralded by the lightning he rose threw on a dressinggown and sat by a window watching it its tumult and fury seemed to ease his heart of some little of its pain in that dark hour a quiet night would have maddened him  in eight hourseight short hoursthis matter would be ended so far as concerned their actual intercourse it would be a secret locked for ever in their two breasts a secret eating at their hearts cruel as the worm that dieth not geoffrey looked up and threw out his hearts thought towards his sleeping love then once more as in a bygone night there broke upon his brain and being that mysterious spiritual sense stronger and more strong it grew beating on him in heavy unnatural waves till his reason seemed to reel and sink and he remembered naught but beatrice knew naught save that her very life was with him now  he stretched out his arms towards the place where she should be  beatrice he whispered to the empty air beatrice oh my love my sweet my soul hear me beatrice  there came a pause and ever the unearthly sympathy grew and gathered in his heart till it seemed to him as though separation had lost its power and across dividing space they were mingled in one being  a great gust shook the house and passed away along the roaring depths  oh what was this silently the door opened and a white draped form passed its threshold he rose gasping a terrible fear a terrible joy took possession of him the lightning flared out wildly in the eastern sky there in the fierce light she stood before himshe beatrice a sight of beauty and of dread she stood with white arms outstretched with white uncovered feet her bosom heaving softly beneath her nightdress her streaming hair unbound her lips apart her face upturned and a stamp of terrifying calm  in the wide blind eyes uplift thro the darkness and the drift  great heaven she was asleep  hush she spoke  you called me geoffrey she said in a still unnatural voice you called me my beloved and ihavecome  he rose aghast trembling like an aspen with doubt and fear trembling at the sight of the conquering glory of the woman whom he worshipped  see she drew on towards him and she was asleep oh what could he do  suddenly the draught of the great gale rushing through the house caught the opened door and crashed it to  she awoke with a wild stare of terror  oh god where am i she cried  hush for your lifes sake he answered his faculties returning hush or you are lost  but there was no need to caution here to silence for beatrices senses failed her at the shock and she sank swooning in his arms    chapter xxiii  a dawn of rain  that crash of the closing door did not awake beatrice only it awoke both elizabeth and mr granger elizabeth sat up in bed straining her eyes through the gloom to see what had happened they fell on beatrices bedsurelysurely  elizabeth slipped up catlike she crept across the room and felt with her hand at the bed beatrice was not there she sprang to the blind and drew it letting in such light as there was and by it searched the room she spoke beatrice where are you  no answer  ahh said elizabeth aloud i understand at lastat last  what should see do should she go and call her father and put them to an open shame no beatrice must come back some time the knowledge was enough she wanted the knowledge to use if necessary she did not wish to ruin her sister unless in selfdefence or rather for the cause of selfadvancement still less did she wish to injure geoffrey against whom she had no grudge so she peeped along the passage then returning crept back to her bed like a snake into a hole and watched  mr granger hearing the crash thought that the front door had blown open rising he lit a candle and went to see  but of all this geoffrey knew nothing and beatrice naturally less than nothing  she lay senseless in his arms her head rested on his shoulder her heavy hair streamed down his side almost to his knee he lifted her touched her on the forehead with his lips and laid her on the bed what was to be done bring her back to life no he dared notnot here while she lay thus her helplessness protected her but if once more she was a living loving woman here and sooh how should they escape he dared not touch her or look towards hertill he had made up his mind it was soon done here she must not bide and since of herself she could not go why he must take her now this moment however far geoffrey fell short of virtues stricter standard let this always be remembered in his favour  he opened the door and as he did so thought that he heard some one stirring in the house and so he did it was mr granger in the sittingroom hearing no more geoffrey concluded that it was the wind and turning groped his way to the bed where beatrice lay as still as death for one moment a horrible fear struck him that she might be dead he had heard of cases of somnambulists who on being startled from their unnatural sleep only woke to die it might be so with her hurriedly he placed his hand upon her breast yes her heart stirredfaintly indeed but still it stirred she had only swooned then he set his teeth and placing his arms about her lifted her as though she were a babe beatrice was no slip of a girl but a wellgrown woman of full size he never felt her weight it seemed nothing to him stealthily as one bent on midnight murder he stepped with her to the door and through it into the passage then supporting her with one arm he closed the door with his left hand stealthily in the gloom he passed along the corridor his bare feet making no noise upon the boarded floor till he reached the bisecting passage leading from the sittingrooms  he glanced up it apprehensively and what he saw froze the blood in his veins for there coming down it not eight paces from him was mr granger holding a candle in his hand what could be done to get back to his room was impossibleto reach that of beatrice was also impossible with an effort he collected his thoughts and like a flash of light it passed into his mind that the empty room was not two paces from him a stride and he had reached it oh where was the handle and oh if the room should be locked by a merciful chance it was not he stepped through the door knocking beatrices feet against the framework as he did so closed itto shut it he had no timeand stood gasping behind it  the gleam of light drew nearer merciful powers he had been seenthe old man was coming in what could he say tell the truth that was all but who would believe such a story why it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law could he expect a father to believe ita father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms he had already thought of going straight to mr granger but had abandoned the idea as hopeless who would believe this tale of sleepwalking for the first time in his life geoffrey felt terribly afraid both for beatrice and himself the hair rose on his head his heart stood still and a cold perspiration started on to his face  its very odd he heard the old man mutter to himself i could almost swear that i saw something white go into that room wheres the handle if i believed in ghostshullo my candle has blown out i must go and hunt for a match dont quite like going in there without a light  for the moment they were saved the fierce draught rushing through the open crack of the door from the illfitting window had extinguished the candle  geoffrey waited a few seconds to allow mr granger to reach his room and then once more started on his awful journey he passed out of the room in safety happily beatrice showed no signs of recovery a few quick steps and he was at her own door and now a new terror seized him what if elizabeth was also walking the house or even awake he thought of putting beatrice down at the door and leaving her there but abandoned the idea to begin with her father might see her and then how could her presence be accounted for or if he did not she would certainly suffer ill effects from the cold no he must risk it and at once though he would rather have faced a battery of guns the door fortunately was ajar geoffrey opened it with his foot entered and with his foot pushed it to again suddenly he remembered that he had never been in the room and did not know which bed belonged to beatrice he walked to the nearest a deepdrawn breath told him that it was the wrong one drawing some faint consolation from the fact that elizabeth was evidently asleep he groped his way to the second bed through the deep twilight of the room the clothes were thrown back he laid beatrice down and threw them over her then he fled  as he reached the door he saw mr grangers light disappear into his own room and heard his door close after that it seemed to him that he took but two steps and was in his own place  he burst out laughing there was as much hysteria in the laugh as a man gives way to his nerves were shattered by struggle love and fear and sought relief in ghastly merriment somehow the whole scene reminded him of one in a comic opera there was a ludicrous side to it supposing that the political opponents who already hated him so bitterly could have seen him slinking from door to door at midnight with an unconscious lady in his armswhat would they have said  he ceased laughing the fit passedindeed it was no laughing matter then he thought of the first night of their strange communion that night before he had returned to london the seed sown in that hour had blossomed and borne fruit indeed who would have dreamed it possible that he should thus have drawn beatrice to him well he ought to have known if it was possible that the words which floated through her mind could arise in his as they had done upon that night what was not possible and were there not other words written by the same masterhand which told of such things as these       nownow the door is heard      hark the stairs and near      nearerand here      now and at call the third      she enters without a word       like the doors of a casket shrine      see on either side      her two arms divide      till the heart betwixt makes sign      take me for i am thine       first i will pray do thou      that ownest the soul      yet wilt grant control      to another nor disallow      for a time restrain me now  did they not run thus oh he should have known this he could plead and this onlythat control had been granted to him  but how would beatrice fare would she come to herself safely he thought so it was only a fainting fit but when she did recover what would she do nothing rash he prayed and what could be the end of it all who might say how fortunate that the sister had been so sound asleep somehow he did not trust elizabethhe feared her  well might geoffrey fear her elizabeths sleep was that of a weasel she too was laughing at this very moment laughing not loud but longthe laugh of one who wins  she had seen him enter his burden in his arms saw him come with it to her own bedside and had breathed heavily to warn him of his mistake she had watched him put beatrice on her bed and heard him sigh and turn away nothing had escaped her as soon as he was gone she had risen and crept up to beatrice and finding that she was only in a faint had left her to recover knowing her to be in no danger elizabeth was not a nervous person then she had listened till at length a deep sigh told her of the return of her sisters consciousness after this there was a pause till presently beatrices long soft breaths showed that she had glided from swoon to sleep  the slow night wore away and at length the cold dawn crept through the window elizabeth still watching for she was not willing to lose a single scene of a drama so entrancing in itself and so important to her interests saw her sister suddenly sit up in bed and press her hands to her forehead as though she was striving to recall a dream then beatrice covered her eyes with her hands and groaned heavily next she looked at her watch rose drank a glass of water and dressed herself even to the putting on of an old grey waterproof with a hood to it for it was wet outside  she is going to meet her lover thought elizabeth i wish i could be there to see that too but i have seen enough  she yawned and appeared to wake what beatrice going out already in this pouring rain she said with feigned astonishment  yes i have slept badly and i want to get some air answered beatrice starting and colouring i suppose that it was the storm  has there been a storm said elizabeth yawning again i heard nothing of itbut then so many things happen when one is asleep of which one knows nothing at the time she added sleepily like one speaking at random mind that you are back to say goodbye to mr bingham he goes by the early train you knowbut perhaps you will see him out walking and appearing to wake up thoroughly she raised herself in bed and gave her sister one piercing look  beatrice made no answer that look sent a thrill of fear through her oh what had happened or was it all a dream had she dreamed that she stood face to face with geoffrey in his room before a great darkness struck her and overwhelmed her or was it an awful truth and if a truth how came she here again she went to the pantry found a morsel of bread and ate it for faintness still pursued her then feeling better she left the house and set her face towards the beach    it was a dreary morning the great wind had passed now it only blew in little gusts heavy with driving rain the sea was sullen and grey and grand it beat in thunder on the shore and flew over the sunken rocks in columns of leaden spray the whole earth seemed one desolation and all its grief was centred in this womans broken heart  geoffrey too was up how he had passed the remainder of that tragic night we need not inquirenot too happily we may be sure he heard the front door close behind beatrice and followed out into the rain  on the beach some half of a mile away he found her gazing at the sea a great white gull wheeling about her head no word of greeting passed between them they only grasped each others hands and looked into each others hollow eyes  come under the shelter of the cliff he said and she came she stood beneath the cliff her head bowed low her face hidden by the hood and spoke  tell me what has happened she said i have dreamed something a worse dream than any that have gone beforetell me if it is true do not spare me  and geoffrey told her all  when he had finished she spoke again  by what shall i swear she said that i am not the thing which you must think me geoffrey i swear by my love for you that i am innocent if i cameoh the shame of it if i cameto your room last night it was my feet which led me not my mind that led my feet i went to sleep i was worn out and then i knew no more till i heard a dreadful sound and saw you before me in a blaze of light after which there was darkness  oh beatrice do not be distressed he answered i saw that you were asleep it is a dreadful thing which has happened but i do not think that we were seen  i do not know she said elizabeth looked at me very strangely this morning and she sees everything geoffrey for my part i neither know nor care what i do care for is what must you think of me you must believe ohi cannot say it and yet i am innocent never never did i dream of this to come to youthusoh it is shameless  beatrice do not talk so i tell you i know it listeni drew you i did not mean that you should come i did not think that you would come but it was my doing listen to me dear and he told her that which written words can ill express  when he had finished she looked up with another face the deep shadow of her shame had left her i believe you geoffrey she said because i know that you have not invented this to shield me for i have felt it also see by it what you are to me you are my master and my all i cannot withstand you if i would i have little will apart from yours if you choose to gainsay mine and now promise me this upon your word leave me uninfluenced do not draw me to you to be your ruin i make no pretence i have laid my life at your feet but while i have any strength to struggle against it you shall never take it up unless you can do so to your own honour and that is not possible oh my dear we might have been very happy together happier than men and women often are but it is denied to us we must carry our cross we must crucify the flesh upon it perhaps sowho can saywe may glorify the spirit i owe you a great deal i have learnt much from you geoffrey i have learned to hope again for a hereafter nothing is left to me nowbut thatthat and an hour henceyour memory  oh why should i weep it is ungrateful when i have your love for which this misery is but a little price to pay kiss me dear and goand never see me more you will not forget me i know now that you will never forget me all your life afterwardsperhapswho can tell if not why thenit will indeed be bestto die        it is not well to linger over such a scene as this after all too it is nothing only another broken heart or so the world breaks so many this way and the other that it can have little pleasure in gloating over such stale scenes of agony  besides we must not let our sympathies carry us away geoffrey and beatrice deserved all they got they had no business to put themselves into such a position they had defied the customs of their world and the world avenged itself upon them and their petty passions what happens to the worm that tries to burrow on the highways grinding wheels and crushing feet these are its portion beatrice and geoffrey point a moral and adorn a tale so far as we can see and judge there was no need for them to have plunged into that everrunning river of human pain let them struggle and drown and let those who are on the bank learn wisdom from the sight and hold out no hand to help them  geoffrey drew a ring from his finger and gave it to his love it was a common flatsided silver ring that had been taken from the grave of a roman soldier one peculiarity it had however on its inner surface were roughly cut the words ave atque vale greeting and farewell it was a fitting gift to pass between people in their position beatrice trembling sorely whispered that she would wear it on her heart upon her hand she could not put it yet awhileit might be recognised  then thrice did they embrace there upon the desolate shore once as it were for past joy once for present pain and once for future hope and parted there was no talk of after meetingsthey felt them to be impossible at any rate for many years how could they meet as indifferent friends too much they loved for that it was a final parting than which death had been less dreadfulfor hope sits ever by the bed of deathand misery crushed them to the earth    he left her and happiness went out of his life as at nightfall the daylight goes out of the day well at least he had his work to go to but beatrice poor woman what had she  geoffrey left her when he had gone some thirty paces he turned again and gazed his last upon her there she stood or rather leant her hand resting against the wet rock looking after him with her wide grey eyes even through the drizzling rain he could see the gleam of her rich hair the marking of her lovely face and the carmine of her lips she motioned to him to go on he went and when he had traversed a hundred paces looked round once more she was still there but now her face was a blur and again the great white gull hovered about her head  then the mist swept up and hid her    ah beatrice with all your brains you could never learn those simple principles necessary to the happiness of woman principles inherited through a thousand generations of savage and semicivilized ancestresses to accept the situation and the master that situation brings with itthis is the golden rule of wellbeing not to put out the hand of your affection further than you can draw it back this is another at least not until you are quite sure that its object is well within your grasp if by misfortune or the anger of the fates you are endowed with those deeper qualities those extreme capacities of selfsacrificing affection such as ruined your happiness beatrice keep them in stock do not expose them to the world the world does not believe in them they are inconvenient and undesirable they are even immoral what the world wants and very rightly in a person of your attractiveness is quiet domesticity of character not the exhibition of attributes which though they might qualify you for the rank of heroine in a greek drama are nowadays only likely to qualify you for the reprobation of society  what you would rather keep your love your reprehensible love which never can be satisfied and bear its slings and arrows and die hugging a shadow to your heart straining your eyes into the darkness of that beyond whither you shall gomurmuring with your pale lips that there you will find reason and fulfilment why it is folly what ground have you to suppose that you will find anything of the sort go and take the opinion of some scientific person of eminence upon this infatuation of yours and those vague visions of glory that shall be he will explain it clearly enough will show you that your love itself is nothing but a natural passion acting in your case on a singularly sensitive and etherealised organism be frank with him tell him of your secret hopes he will smile tenderly and show you how those also are an emanation from a craving heart and the innate superstitions of mankind indeed he will laugh and illustrate the absurdity of the whole thing by a few pungent examples of what would happen if these earthly affections could be carried beyond the grave take what you can now will be the burden of his song and for goodness sake do not waste your precious hours in dreams of a to be  beatrice the world does not want your spirituality it is not a spiritual world it has no clear ideas upon the subjectit pays its religious premium and works off its aspirations at its weekly church going and would think the person a fool who attempted to carry theories of celestial union into an earthly rule of life it can sympathise with lady honoria it can hardly sympathise with you  and yet you will still choose this better part you will still live and love and lose  with blinding tears and passionate beseeching and outstretched arms through empty silence reaching  then beatrice have your will sow your seed of tears and take your chance you may find that you were right and the worldlings wrong and you may reap a harvest beyond the grasp of their poor imaginations and if you find that they are right and you are wrong what will it matter to you who sleep for of this at least you are sure if there is no future for such earthly love as yours then indeed there is none for the children of this world and all their troubling    chapter xxiv  lady honoria takes the field  geoffrey hurried to the vicarage to fetch his baggage and say goodbye he had no time for breakfast and he was glad of it for he could not have eaten a morsel to save his life he found elizabeth and her father in the sittingroom  why where have you been this wet morning mr bingham said mr granger  i have been for a walk with miss beatrice she is coming home by the village he answered i dont mind rain and i wanted to get as much fresh air as i could before i go back to the mill thank youonly a cup of teai will get something to eat as i go  how kind of him reflected mr granger no doubt he has been speaking to beatrice again about owen davies  oh by the way he added aloud did you happen to hear anybody moving in the house last night mr bingham just when the storm was at its height first of all a door slammed so violently that i got up to see what it was and as i came down the passage i could almost have sworn that i saw something white go into the spare room but my candle went out and by the time that i had found a light there was nothing to be seen  a clear case of ghosts said geoffrey indifferently it was indeed a case of ghosts and they would he reflected haunt him for many a day  how very odd put in elizabeth vivaciously her keen eyes fixed intently on his face do you know i thought that i twice saw the door of our room open and shut in the most mysterious fashion i think that beatrice must have something to do with it she is so uncanny in her ways  geoffrey never moved a muscle he was trained to keep his countenance only he wondered how much this woman knew she must be silenced somehow  excuse me for changing the subject he said but my time is short and i have none to spare to hunt the vicarage ghost by the way theres a good title for somebody mr granger i believe that i may speak of business matters before miss elizabeth  certainly mr bingham said the clergyman elizabeth is my right hand and has the best business head in bryngelly  geoffrey thought that this was very evident and went on i only want to say this if you get into any further difficulties with your rascally tithepayers mind and let me know i shall always be glad to help you while i can and now i must be going  he spoke thus for two reasons first naturally enough he meant to make it his business to protect beatrice from the pressure of poverty and well knew that it would be useless to offer her direct assistance secondly he wished to show elizabeth that it would not be to the advantage of her family to quarrel with him if she had seen a ghost perhaps this fact would make her reticent on the subject he did not know that she was playing a much bigger game for her own hand a game of which the stakes were thousands a year and that she was moreover mad with jealousy and what in such a woman must pass for love  elizabeth made no comment on his offer and before mr grangers profuse thanks were nearly finished geoffrey was gone    three weeks passed at bryngelly and elizabeth still held her hand beatrice pale and spiritless went about her duties as usual elizabeth never spoke to her in any sense that could awaken her suspicions and the ghost story was or appeared to be pretty well forgotten but at last an event occurred that caused elizabeth to take the field one day she met owen davies walking along the beach in the semiinsane way which he now affected he stopped and without further ado plunged into conversation  i cant bear it any longer he said wildly throwing up his arms i saw her yesterday and she cut me short before i could speak a word i have prayed for patience and it will not come only a voice seemed to say to me that i must wait ten days more ten short days and then beatrice my beautiful beatrice would be my wife at last  if you go on in this way mr davies said elizabeth sharply her heart filled with jealous anger you will soon be off your head are you not ashamed of yourself for making such a fuss about a girls pretty face if you want to get married marry somebody else  marry somebody else he said dreamily i dont know anybody else whom i could marry except you and you are not beatrice  no answered elizabeth angrily i should hope that i have more sense and if you wanted to marry me you would have to set about it in a different way from this i am not beatrice thank heaven but i am her sister and i warn you that i know more about her than you do as a friend i warn you to be careful supposing that beatrice were not worthy of you you would not wish to marry her would you  now owen davies was at heart somewhat afraid of elizabeth like most other people who had the privilege of her acquaintance also apart from matters connected with his insane passion he was very fairly shrewd he suspected elizabeth of something he did not know of what  no no of course not he said of course i would not marry her if she was not fit to be my wifebut i must know that first before i talk of marrying anybody else good afternoon miss elizabeth it will soon be settled now it cannot go on much longer now my prayers will be answered i know they will  you are right there owen davies thought elizabeth as she looked after him with ineffable bitterness not to say contempt your prayers shall be answered in a way that will astonish you you shall not marry beatrice and you shall marry me the fish has been on the line long enough now i must begin to pull in  curiously enough it never really occurred to elizabeth that beatrice herself might prove to be the true obstacle to the marriage she plotted to prevent she knew that her sister was fond of geoffrey bingham but when it came to the point that she would absolutely allow her affection to interfere with so glorious a success in life she never believed for one moment of course she thought it was possible that if beatrice could get possession of geoffrey she might prefer to do so but failing him judging from her own low and vulgar standard elizabeth was convinced that she would take owen it did not seem possible that what was so precious in her own eyes might be valueless and even hateful to those of her sister as for that little midnight incident well it was one thing and marriage was another people forget such events when they marry sometimes even they marry in order to forget them  yes she must strike but how elizabeth had feelings like other people she did not mind ruining her sister and rival but she would very much prefer it should not be known that hers was the hand to cut her down of course if the worst came to the worst she must do it meanwhile might not a substitute be foundsomebody in whom the act would seem not one of vengeance but of virtue ah she had it lady honoria who could be better for such a purpose than the cruelly injured wife but then how should she communicate the facts to her ladyship without involving herself again she hit upon a device much favoured by such peopleun vieux truc mais toujours bonthe pristine one of an anonymous letter which has the startling merit of not committing anybody to anything an anonymous letter to all appearance written by a servant it was the very thing most likely it would result in a searching inquiry by lady honoria in which event elizabeth of course against her will would be forced to say what she knew almost certainly it would result in a quarrel between husband and wife which might induce the former to show his hand or even to take some open step as regards beatrice she was sorry for geoffrey against whom she had no ill feeling but it could not be helped he must be sacrificed  that very evening she wrote her letter and sent it to be posted by an old servant living in london it was a masterpiece in its way especially phonetically this precious epistle which was most exceedingly ill writ in a large coarse hand ran thus  my ladimy consence druvs me to it much again my will ive tried hard my ladi not to speek first acorse of miss b as i heve knowed good and peur and also for the sakes of your evil usband that wulf in scheeps cloathin but when i think on you my ladi a lorful legel wife gud and virtus and peur and of the things as i hev seen which is enuf to bring a blush to the face of a stater i knows it is my holy dooty to rite your ladishipp as follers your ladishipp forgif me but on the nite of whittsundey last miss b grainger wint after midnite inter the room of your bad usbandas i was to mi sham ther to se afterward more nor an hour she cum out ain being carred in his harmes and if your ladishipp dont believ me let your ladishipp rite to miss elizbeth as had this same misfortune to see as your tru frend  the riter  in due course this charming communication reached lady honoria bearing a london postmark she read and reread it and soon mastered its meaning then after a nights thought she took the riters advice and wrote to elizabeth sending her a copy of the letter her own vehemently repudiating all belief in it and asking for a reply that should dissipate this foul slander from her mind for ever  the answer came by return it was short and artful  dear lady honoria bingham it ran you must forgive me if i decline to answer the questions in your letter you will easily understand that between a desire to preserve a sisters reputation and an incapacity to be appreciated by every christian to speak other than the truthit is possible for a person to be placed in the most cruel of positionsa position which i am sure will command even your sympathy though under such circumstances i have little right to expect any from a wife believing herself to have been cruelly wronged let me add that nothing short of the compulsion of a court of law will suffice to unseal my lips as to the details of the circumstances which are i trust misunderstood alluded to in the malicious anonymous letter of which you inclose a copy  that very evening as the fates would have it lady honoria and her husband had a quarrel as usual it was about effie for on most other subjects they preserved an armed neutrality its details need not be entered into but at last geoffrey who was in a sadly irritable condition of mind fairly lost his temper  the fact is he said that you are not fit to look after the child you only think of yourself honoria  she turned on him with a dangerous look upon her cold and handsome face  be careful what you say geoffrey it is you who are not fit to have charge of effie be careful lest i take her away from you altogether as i can if i like  what do you mean by that threat he asked  do you want to know then i will tell you i understand enough law to be aware that a wife can get a separation from an unfaithful husband and what is more can take away his children  again i ask what you mean said geoffrey turning cold with anger  i mean this geoffrey that welsh girl is your mistress she passed the night of whitsunday in your room and was carried from it in your arms  it is a lie he said she is nothing of the sort i do not know who gave you this information but it is a slanderous lie and somebody shall suffer for it  nobody will suffer for it geoffrey because you will not dare to stir the matter upfor the girls sake if not for your own can you deny that you were seen carrying her in your arms from your room on whitsunday night can you deny that you are in love with her  and supposing that i am in love with her is it to be wondered at seeing how you treat me and have treated me for years he answered furiously it is utterly false to say that she is my mistress  you have not answered my question said lady honoria with a smile of triumph were you seen carrying that woman in your arms and from your room at the dead of night of course it meant nothing nothing at all who would dare to asperse the character of this perfect lovely and intellectual schoolmistress i am not jealous geoffrey  i should think not honoria seeing how things are  i am not jealous i repeat but please understand that i will not have this go on in your own interests and mine why what a fool you must be dont you know that a man who has risen as you have has a hundred enemies ready to spring on him like a pack of wolves and tear him to pieces why many even of those who fawn upon you and flatter you to your face hate you bitterly in secret because you have succeeded where they have failed dont you know also that there are papers here in london which would give hundreds of pounds for the chance of publishing such a scandal as this especially against a powerful political opponent let it once come out that this obscure girl is your mistress  honoria i tell you she is nothing of the sort it is true i carried her from my room in a fainting fit but she came there in her sleep  lady honoria laughed really geoffrey i wonder that you think it worth while to tell me such nonsense keep it for the divorce court if ever we get there and see what a jury says to it look here be sensible i am not a moralist and i am not going to play the outraged wife unless you force me to it i do not mean to take any further notice of this interesting little tale as against you but if you go on with it beware i will not be made to look a fool if you are going to be ruined you can be ruined by yourself i warn you frankly that at the first sign of it i shall put myself in the right by commencing proceedings against you now of course i know this that in the event of a smash you would be glad enough to be rid of me in order that you might welcome your dear beatrice in my place but there are two things to remember first that you could not marry her supposing you to be idiot enough to wish to do so because i should only get a judicial separation and you would still have to support me secondly if i go effie goes with me for i have a right to claim her at law and that fact my dear geoffrey makes me mistress of the situation because i do not suppose that you would part with effie even for the sake of miss beatrice and now i will leave you to think it over  and with a little nod she sailed out of the room completely victorious she was indeed reflected geoffrey mistress of the situation supposing that she brought a suit against him where would he be she must have evidence or she would not have known the story the whole drama had clearly been witnessed by someone probably either by elizabeth or the servant girl and that some one had betrayed it to honoria and possibly to others the thought made him sick he was a man of the world and a practical lawyer and though indeed they were innocent he knew that under the circumstances few would be found to believe it at the very best there must be a terrible and shocking scandal and beatrice would lose her good name he placed himself in the position of counsel for the petitioner in a like case and thought how he would crush and crumple such a defence in his address to the jury a probable tale forsooth  undoubtedly too honoria would be acting wisely from her point of view public sympathy would be with her throughout he knew that as it was he was believed generally to owe much of his success to his handsome and highborn wife now it would be said that he had used her as a ladder and then thrown her over with all this however he might cope he could even bear with the vulgar attacks of a vulgar press and the gibes and jeers of his political and personal enemies but to lose effie he could not bear and if such a case were brought against him it was almost certain that he would lose her for if he was worsted custody of the child would be given to the injured wife  then there was beatrice to be considered the same malicious tongue that had revealed this matter to honoria would probably reveal it to the rest of the world and even if he escaped the worst penalties of outraged morality they would certainly be wreaked upon her beatrices reputation would be blasted her employment lost and her life made a burden to her yes decidedly honoria had the best of the position decidedly also she spoke words of weight and common sense  what was to be done was there no way out of it all that night as geoffrey sat in the house his arms folded on his breast and to appearance intently listening to the long harangues of the opposition this question haunted him he argued the situation out this way and that way till at the last he came to a conclusion either he must wait for the scandal to leak out let beatrice be ruined and direct his efforts to the softening of honoria and generally to selfpreservation or he must take the bull by the horns must abandon his great career and his country and seek refuge in another land say america taking beatrice and effie with him once the child was out of the jurisdiction of course no court could force her from him  of the two courses even in so far as he himself was concerned what between the urgency of the matter and the unceasing pressure of his passion geoffrey inclined to the latter the relations between himself and honoria had for years been so strained so totally different from those which should exist between man and wife that they greatly mitigated in his mind the apparent iniquity of such a step nor would he feel much compunction at removing the child from her mother for there was no love lost between the two and as time went on he guessed shrewdly there would be less and less for the rest he had some seventeen thousand pounds in hand he would take half and leave honoria half he knew that he could always earn a living wherever he went and probably much more than a living and of whatever he earned a strict moiety should be paid to honoria but first and above everything there was beatrice to be considered she must be saved even if he ruined himself to save her  lady honoria it is scarcely necessary to say had little idea that she was driving her husband to such dangerous and determined councils she wanted to frighten geoffrey not to lose him and all he meant to her this was the last thing that she would wish to do she did not greatly care about the beatrice incident but her shrewd common sense told her that it might well be used as an engine to ruin them all therefore she spoke as she did speak though in reality matters would have to be bad indeed before she sought the aid of a court of law where many things concerning herself might come to the light of day which she would prefer to leave in darkness  nor did she stop here she determined to attack geoffreys position in another way namely through beatrice herself for a long time honoria hesitated as to the method of this attack she had some knowledge of the world and of character and from what she knew of beatrice she came to the sound conclusion that she was not a woman to be threatened but rather one to be appealed to so after much thought she wrote to her thus  a story which i still hesitate to believe has come to me by means of anonymous letters as to your conduct with my husband i do not wish to repeat it now further than to say that if true it establishes circumstances which leave no doubt as to the existence of relations so intimate between you as to amount to guilt it may not be true or it may in which latter event i wish to say this with your morality i have nothing to do it is your affair nor do i wish to plead to you as an injured wife or to reproach you for there are things too wicked for mere reproach but i will say this if the story is true i must presume that you have some affection for the partner of your shame i put myself out of the question and in the name of that affection however guilty it may be i ask you to push matters no further to do so will be to bring its object to utter ruin if you care for him sever all connection with him utterly and for ever otherwise he will live to curse and hate you should you neglect this advice and should the facts that i have heard become public property i warn you as i have already warned him that in selfpreservation and for the sake of selfrespect i shall be forced to appeal to the law for my remedy remember that his career is at stake and that in losing it and me he will lose also his child remember that if this comes about it will be through you do not answer this it will do no good for i shall naturally put no faith in your protestations but if you are in any way or measure guilty of this offence appealing to you as one woman to another and for the sake of the man who is dear to both i say do your best to redeem the evil by making all further communication between yourself and him an impossibility hb  it was a clever letter lady honoria could not have devised one more powerful to work on a woman like beatrice the same post that took it to her took another from geoffrey himself it was long though guarded and need not be quoted in its entirety but it put the whole position before her in somewhat veiled language and ended by saying marriage i cannot give you only lifelong love in other circumstances to offer this would be an insult but if things should be as a i fear it is worth your consideration i do not say to you come i say come if you wish no beatrice i will not put this cruel burden of decision upon you i say come i do not command you to come because i promised to leave you uninfluenced but i pray you to do so let us put an end to this wretchedness and count the world well lost as our price of love come dearest beatriceto leave me no more till death i put my life in your hands if you take it up whatever trouble you may have to face you will never lose my affection or esteem do not think of me think of yourself you have given me your love as you once gave me my life i owe something in return i cannot see you shamed and make no offer of reparation indeed so far as i am concerned i shall think all i lose as nothing compared to what i gain in gaining you will you come if so we will leave this country and begin afresh elsewhere after all it matters little and will matter less when everything is said and done my life has for years been but as an unwholesome dream the one real thing the one happy thing that i have found in it has been our love do not let us throw it away beatrice  by return of post he received this answer written in pencil  no dear geoffrey things must take their courseb  that was all    chapter xxv  elizabeth shows her teeth  hard had been beatrices hours since that grey morning of separation she must bear all the inner wretchedness of her lot she must conceal her grief must suffer the slings and arrows of elizabeths sharp tongue and strive to keep owen davies at a distance indeed as the days went on this last task grew more and more portentous the man was quite unmanageable his passion which was humiliating and hateful to beatrice became the talk of the place everybody knew of it except her father and even his eyes began to be opened  one nightit was the same upon which geoffrey and honoria respectively had posted their letters to beatriceanybody looking into the little room at bryngelly castle which served its owner for all purposes except that of sleeping would have witnessed a very strange sight owen davies was walking to and frowalking rapidly with wild eyes and dishevelled hair at the turn of each length of the apartment he would halt and throwing his arms into the air ejaculate  oh god hear me and give me my desire oh god answer me  for two long hours thus he walked and thus cried aloud till at length he sank panting and exhausted into a chair suddenly he raised his head and appeared to listen intently  the voice he said aloud the voice again what does it say tomorrow tomorrow i must speak and i shall win her  he sprang up with a shout and once more began his wild march oh beatrice he said tomorrow you will promise to marry me the voice says so and soon soon perhaps in one short month you will be my ownmine only geoffrey bingham shall not come between us then for i will watch you day and night you shall be my very very ownmy own beautiful beatrice and he stretched out his arms and clasped at the empty aira crazy and unpleasant sight to see  and so he walked and spoke till the dawn was grey in the east this occurred on the friday night it was on the following morning that beatrice the unfortunate and innocent object of these amorous invocations received the two letters she had gone to the postoffice on her way to the school on the chance of there being a note from geoffrey poor woman his letters were the one bright thing in her life from motives of prudence they were written in the usual semiformal style but she was quick to read between the lines and moreover they came from his dear hand  there was the letter sure enough and another in a womans writing she recognised the hand as that of lady honoria which she had often seen on envelopes directed to geoffrey and a thrill of fear shot through her she took the letters and walking as quickly as she could to the school locked herself in her own little room for it was not yet nine oclock and looked at them with a gathering terror what was in them why did lady honoria write to her which should she read first in a moment beatrice had made up her mind she would face the worst at once with a set face she opened lady honorias letter unfolded it and read we already know its contents as her mind grasped them her lips grew ashy white and by the time that the horrible thing was done she was nigh to fainting  anonymous letters oh who could have done this cruel thing elizabeth it must be elizabeth who saw everything and thus stabbed her in the back was it possible that her own sister could treat her so she knew that elizabeth disliked her she could never fathom the cause still she knew the fact but if this were her doing then she must hate her and most bitterly and what had she done to earn such hate and now geoffrey was in danger on her account danger of ruin and how could she prevent it this was her first idea most people might have turned to their own position and been content to leave their lover to fight his own battle but beatrice thought little of herself he was in danger and how could she protect him why here in the letter was the answer if you care for him sever all connection with him utterly and for ever otherwise he will live to curse and hate you no no geoffrey would never do that but lady honoria was quite right in his interest for his sake she must sever all connection with himsever it utterly and for ever but howhow  she thrust the letter into her dressa viper would have been a more welcome guestand opened geoffreys  it told the same tale but offered a different solution the tears started to her eyes as she read his offer to take her to him for good and all and go away with her to begin life afresh it seemed a wonderful thing to beatrice that he should be willing to sacrifice so much upon such a worthless altar as her lovea wonderful and most generous thing she pressed the senseless paper to her heart then kissed it again and again but she never thought of yielding to this great temptation never for one second he prayed her to come but that she would not do while her will remained what she bring geoffrey to ruin no she had rather starve in the streets or perish by slow torture how could he ever think that she would consent to such a scheme indeed she never would she had brought enough trouble on him already but oh she blessed him for that letter how deeply must he love her when he could offer to do this for her sake  hark the children were waiting she must go and teach the letter geoffreys dear letter could be answered in the afternoon so she thrust it in her breast with the other but closer to her heart and went    that afternoon as mr granger in a happy frame of mindfor were not his debts paid and had he not found a most convenient way of providing against future embarrassmentwas engaged peaceably in contemplating his stock over the gate of his little farm buildings he was much astonished suddenly to discover owen davies at his elbow  how do you do mr davies he said how quietly you must have come  yes answered owen absently the fact is i have followed you because i want to speak to you alonequite alone  indeed mr davieswell i am at your service what is wrong you dont look very well  oh i am quite well thank you i never was better and theres nothing wrong nothing at all everything is going to be bright now i know that full surely  indeed said mr granger again looking at him with a puzzled air and what may you want to see me about not but what i am always at your service as you know he added apologetically  this he answered suddenly seizing the clergyman by the coat in a way that made him start  whatmy coat do you mean  dont be so foolish mr granger no about beatrice  oh indeed mr davies nothing wrong at the school i hope i think that she does her duties to the satisfaction of the committee though i admit that the arithmetic  no no no it is not about the school i dont wish her to go to the school any more i love her mr granger i love her dearly and i want to marry her  the old man flushed with pleasure was it possible did he hear aright owen davies the richest man in that part of wales wanted to marry his daughter who had nothing but her beauty it must be too good to be true  i am indeed flattered he said it is more than she could expectnot but what beatrice is very goodlooking and very clever he added hastily fearing lest he was detracting from his daughters market value  goodlookingclever she is an angel murmured owen  oh yes of course she is said her father that is if a womanyes of courseand what is more i think shes very fond of you i think she is pining for you ive though so for a long time  is she said owen anxiously then all i have to say is that she takes a very curious way of showing it she wont say a word to me she puts me off on every occasion but it will be all right nowall right now  oh there there mr davies maids will be maids until they are wives we know about all that said mr granger sententiously  his wouldbe soninlaw looked as though he knew very little about it indeed although the inference was sufficiently obvious  mr granger he said seizing his hand i want to make beatrice my wifei do indeed  well i did not suppose otherwise mr davies  if you help me in this i will do whatever you like as to money matters and that sort of thing you know she shall have as fine a settlement as any woman in wales i know that goes a long way with a father and i shall raise no difficulties  very right and proper i am sure said mr granger adopting a loftier tone as he discovered the advantages of his position but of course on such matters i shall take the advice of a lawyer i daresay that mr bingham would advise me he added as a friend of the family you know he is a very clever lawyer and besides he wouldnt charge anything  oh no not mr bingham answered owen anxiously i will do anything you like or if you wish to have a lawyer ill pay the bill myself but never mind about that now let us settle it with beatrice first come along at once  eh but hadnt you better arrange that part of the business privately  no no she always snubs me when i try to speak to her alone you had better be there and miss elizabeth too if she likes i wont speak to her again alone i will speak to her in the face of god and man as god directed me to do and then it will be all righti know it will  mr granger stared at him he was a clergyman of a very practical sort and did not quite see what the power above had to do with owen daviess matrimonial intentions  ah well he said i see what you mean marriages are made in heaven yes of course well if you want to get on with the matter i daresay that we shall find beatrice in  so they walked back to the vicarage mr granger exultant and yet perplexed for it struck him that there was something a little odd about the proceeding and owen davies in silence or muttering occasionally to himself  in the sittingroom they found elizabeth  where is beatrice asked her father  i dont know she answered and at that moment beatrice pale and troubled walked into the room like a lamb to the slaughter  ah beatrice said her father we were just asking for you  she glanced round and with the quick wit of a human animal instantly perceived that some new danger threatened her  indeed she said sinking into a chair in an access of feebleness born of fear what is it father  mr granger looked at owen davies and then took a step towards the door it struck him forcibly that this scene should be private to the two persons principally concerned  dont go said owen davies excitedly dont go either of you what i have to say had better be said before you both i should like to say it before the whole world to cry it from the mountain tops  elizabeth glared at him fiercelyglared first at him and then at the innocent beatrice could he be going to propose to her then ah why had she hesitated why had she not told him the whole truth before but the heart of beatrice who sat momentarily expecting to be publicly denounced grew ever fainter the waters of desolation were closing in over her soul  mr granger sat down firmly and worked himself into the seat of his chair as though to secure an additional fixedness of tenure elizabeth set her teeth and leaned her elbow on the table holding her hand so as to shade her face beatrice drooped upon her seat like a fading lily or a prisoner in the dock she was opposite to them and owen davies his face alight with wild enthusiasm stood up and addressed them all like the counsel for the prosecution  last autumn he began speaking to mr granger who might have been a judge uncertain as to the merits of the case i asked your daughter beatrice to marry me  beatrice gave a sigh and collected her scattered energies the storm had burst at last and she must face it  i asked her to marry me and she told me to wait a year i have waited as long as i could but i could not wait the whole year i have prayed a great deal and i am bidden to speak  elizabeth made a gesture of impatience she was a person of strong common sense and this mixture of religion and eroticism disgusted her she also know that the storm had burst and that she must face it  so i come to tell you that i love your daughter beatrice and want to make her my wife i have never loved anybody else but i have loved her for years and i ask your consent  very flattering very flattering i am sure especially in these hard times said mr granger apologetically shaking his thin hair down over his forehead and then rumpling it up again but you see mr davies you dont want to marry me here beatrice smiled faintlyyou want to marry my daughter so you had better ask her directat least i suppose so  elizabeth made a movement as though to speak then changed her mind and listened  beatrice said owen davies you hear i ask you to marry me  there was a pause beatrice who had sat quite silent was gathering up her strength to answer elizabeth watching her from beneath her hand thought that she read upon her face irresolution softening into consent what she really saw was but doubt as to the fittest and most certain manner of refusal like lightning it flashed into elizabeths mind that she must strike now or hold her hand for ever if once beatrice spoke that fatal yes her revelations might be of no avail and beatrice would speak it she was sure she would it was a golden road out of her troubles  stop said elizabeth in a shrill hard voice stop i must speak it is my duty as a christian i must tell the truth i cannot allow an honest man to be deceived  there was an awful pause beatrice broke it now she saw all the truth and knew what was at hand she placed her hand upon her heart to still its beating  oh elizabeth she said in our dead mothers name and she stopped  yes answered her sister in our dead mothers name which you have dishonoured i will do it listen owen davies and father beatrice who sits thereand she pointed at her with her thin handbeatrice is a scarlet woman  i really dont understand gasped mr granger while owen looked round wildly and beatrice sunk her head upon her breast  then i will explain said elizabeth still pointing at her sister she is geoffrey binghams mistress on the night of whitsunday last she rose from bed and went into his room at one in the morning i saw her with my own eyes afterwards she was brought back to her bed in his armsi saw it with my own eyes and i heard him kiss her this was a piece of embroidery on elizabeths part she is his lover and has been in love with him for months i tell you this owen davies because though i cannot bear to bring disgrace upon our name and to defile my lips with such a tale neither can i bear that you should marry a girl believing her to be good when she is what beatrice is  then i wish to god that you had held your wicked tongue said mr granger fiercely  no father i have a duty to perform and i will perform it at any cost and however much it pains me you know that what i say is true you heard the noise on the night of whitsunday and got up to see what it was you saw the white figure in the passageit was geoffrey bingham with beatrice in his arms ah well may she hang her head let her deny if it she can let her deny that she loves him to her shame and that she was alone in his room on that night  then beatrice rose and spoke she was pale as death and more beautiful in her shame and her despair than ever she had been before her glorious eyes shone and there were deep black lines beneath them  my heart is my own she said and i will make no answer to you about it think what you will for the rest it is not true i am not what elizabeth tells you that i am i am not geoffrey binghams mistress it is true that i was in his room that night and it is true that he carried me back to my own but it was in my sleep that i went there not of my own free will i awoke there and fainted when i woke and then at once he bore me back  elizabeth laughed shrill and loudit sounded like the cackle of a fiend  in her sleep she said oh she went there in her sleep  yes elizabeth in my sleep you do not believe me but it is true you do not wish to believe me you wish to bring the sister whom you should love who has never offended against you by act or word to utter disgrace and ruin in your cowardly spite you have written anonymous letters to lady honoria bingham to prevail upon her to strike the blow that should destroy her husband and myself and when you fear that this has failed you come forward and openly accuse us you do this in the name of christian duty in the name of love and charity you believe the worst and seek to ruin us shame on you elizabeth shame on you and may the same measure that you have meted out to me never be paid back to you we are no longer sisters whatever happens i have done with you go your ways  elizabeth shrank and quailed beneath her sisters scorn even her venomous hatred could not bear up against the flash of those royal eyes and the majesty of that outraged innocence she gasped and bit her lip till the blood started but she said nothing  then beatrice turned to her father and spoke in another and a pleading voice stretching out her arms towards him  oh father she said at least tell me that you believe me though you may think that i might love to all extremes surely having known me so many years you cannot think that i would lie even for my loves sake  the old man looked wildly round and shook his head  in his room and in his arms he said i saw it it seems you too who have never been known to walk in your sleep from a child and you will not say that you do not love himthe scoundrel it is wicked of elizabethjealousy bitter as the grave it is wicked of her to tell the tale but as it is told how can i say that i do not believe it  then beatrice her cup being full once more dropped her head and turned to go  stop said owen davies in a hoarse voice and speaking for the first time hear what i have to say  she lifted her eyes with you mr davies i have nothing to do i am not answerable to you go and help your accomplice and she pointed to elizabeth to cry this scandal over the whole world  stop he said again i will speak i believe that it is true i believe that you are geoffrey binghams mistress curse him but i do not care i am still willing to marry you  elizabeth gasped was this to be the end of her scheming would the blind passion of this madman prevail over her revelations and beatrice still become his rich and honoured wife while she was left poor and disgraced oh it was monstrous oh she had never dreamed of this  noble noble murmured mr granger noble god bless you  so the position was not altogether beyond recovery his erring daughter might still be splendidly married he might still look forward to peace and wealth in his old age  only beatrice smiled faintly  i thank you she said i am much honoured but i could never have married you because i do not love you you must understand me very little if you think that i should be the more ready to do so on account of the danger in which i stand and she ceased  listen beatrice owen went on an evil light shining on his heavy face while elizabeth sat astounded scarcely able to believe her ears i want you and i mean to marry you you are more to me than all the world i can give you everything and you had better yield to me and you shall hear no more of this but if you wont then this is what i will do i will be revenged upon youterribly revenged  beatrice shook her head and smiled again as though to bid him do his worst  and look beatrice he went on waxing almost eloquent in his jealous despair i have another argument to urge on you i will not only be revenged on you i will be revenged upon your loveron this geoffrey bingham  oh said beatrice sharply like one in pain he had found the way to move her now and with the cunning of semimadness he drove the point home  yes you may starti will i tell you that i will never rest till i have ruined him and i am rich and can do it i have a hundred thousand pounds that i will spend on doing it i have nothing to fear except an action for libel oh i am not a fool though you think i am i know well i can pay for a dozen actions there are papers in london that will be glad to publish all thisyes the whole storywith plans and pictures too just think beatrice what it will be when all englandyes and all the worldis gloating over your shame and halfadozen prints are using the thing for party purposes clamouring for the disgrace of the man who ruined you and whom you will ruin he has a fine career it shall be utterly destroyed by god i will hunt him to his grave unless you promise to marry me beatrice do that and not a word of this shall be said now answer  mr granger sank back in his chair this savage play of human passions was altogether beyond his experienceit overwhelmed him as for elizabeth she bit her thin fingers and glared from one to the other he reckons without me she thought he reckons without mei will marry him yet  but beatrice leant for a moment against the wall and shut her eyes to think oh she saw it allthe great posters with her name and geoffreys on them the shameless pictures of her in his arms the sickening details the letters of the outraged matrons the mothers of ten and the moralminded colonelsall all she heard the prurient scream of every male elizabeth in england the allusions in the housethe jeers the bitter attacks of enemies and rivals then lady honoria would begin her suit and it would all be dragged up afresh and geoffreys fault would be on every lip till he was ruined for herself she did not care but could she bring this on one whose only crime was that she had learned to love him no no but neither could she marry this hateful man and yet what escape was there she flung herself upon her womans wit and it did not fail her in a few seconds she had thought it all out and made up her mind  how can i answer you at a moments notice mr davies she said i must have time to think it over to threaten such revenge upon me is not manly but i know that you love me and therefore i excuse it still i must have time i am confused  what another year no no he said you must answer  i do not ask a year or a month i only ask for one week if you will not give me that then i will defy you and you may do your worst i cannot answer now  this was a bold stroke but it told mr davies hesitated  give the girl a week said her father to him she is not herself  very well one week no more said he  i have another stipulation to make said beatrice you are all to swear to me that for that week no word of this will pass your mouths that for that week i shall not be annoyed or interfered with or spoken to on the subject not by one of you if at the end of it i still refuse to accept your terms you can do your worst but till then you must hold your hand  owen davies hesitated he was suspicious  remember beatrice went on raising her voice i am a desperate woman i may turn at bay and do something which you do not expect and that will be very little to the advantage of any of you do you swear  yes said owen davies  then beatrice looked at elizabeth and elizabeth looked at her she saw that the matter had taken a new form she saw what her jealous folly had hitherto hidden from herthat beatrice did not mean to marry owen davies that she was merely gaining time to execute some purpose of her own what this might be elizabeth cared little so that it did not utterly extinguish chances that at the moment seemed faint enough she did not want to push matters against her sister or her lover geoffrey beyond the boundary of her own interests beatrice should have her week and be free from all interference so far as she was concerned she realised now that it was too late how great had been her error oh if only she had sought beatrices confidence at first but it had seemed to her impossible that she would really throw away such an opportunity in life  certainly i promise beatrice she said mildly i do not swear for swear not at all you know i only did what i thought my duty in warning mr davies if he chooses to go on with the matter it is no affair of mine i had no wish to hurt you or mr bingham i acted solely from my religious convictions  oh stop talking religion elizabeth and practise it a little more said her father for once in his life stirred out of his feeble selfishness we have all undertaken to keep our mouths sealed for this week  then beatrice left the room and after her went owen davies without another word  elizabeth said her father rising you are a wicked woman what did you do this for  do you want to know father she said coolly then i will tell you because i mean to marry owen davies myself we must all look after ourselves in this world you know and that is a maxim which you never forget for one i mean to marry him and though i seem to have failed marry him i will yet and now you know all about it and if you are not a fool you will hold your tongue and let me be and she went also leaving him alone  mr granger held up his hands in astonishment he was a selfish moneyseeking old man but he felt that he did not deserve to have such a daughter as this    chapter xxvi  what beatrice swore  beatrice went to her room but the atmosphere of the place seemed to stifle her her brain was reeling she must go out into the airaway from her tormentors she had not yet answered geoffreys letter and it must be answered by this post for there was none on sunday it was halfpast fourthe post went out at five if she was going to write she should do so at once but she could not do so here besides she must find time for thought ah she had it she would take her canoe and paddle across the bay to the little town of coed and write her letter there the post did not leave coed till halfpast six she put on her hat and jacket and taking a stamp a sheet of paper and an envelope with her slipped quietly from the house down to old edwards boathouse where the canoe was kept old edward was not there himself but his son was a boy of fourteen and by his help beatrice was soon safely launched the sea glittered like glass and turning southwards presently she was paddling round the shore of the island on which the castle stood towards the open bay  as she paddled her mind cleared and she was able to consider the position it was bad enough she saw no light darkness hemmed her in but at least she had a week before her and meanwhile what should she write to geoffrey  then as she thought a great temptation assailed beatrice and for the first time her resolution wavered why should she not accept geoffreys offer and go away with himfar away from all this misery gladly would she give her life to spend one short year at his dear side she had but to say the word and he would take her to him and in a month from now they would be together in some foreign land counting the world well lost as he had said doubtless in time lady honoria would get a divorce and they might be married a day might even come when all this would seem like a forgotten night of storm and fear when surrounded by the children of their love they would wend peaceably happily through the evening of their days towards a bourne robbed of half its terrors by the fact that they would cross it handinhand  oh that would be well for her but would it be well for him when the first months of passion had passed by would he not begin to think of all that he had thrown away for the sake of a womans love would not the burst of shame and obloquy which would follow him to the remotest corners of the earth wear away his affection till at last as lady honoria said he learned to curse and hate her and if it did notif he still loved her through it allas being what he was he well might docould she be the one to bring this ruin on him oh it would have been more kind to let him drown on that night of the storm when fate first brought them together to their undoing  no no once and for all once and for ever she would not do it cruel as was her strait heavy as was her burden not one feathers weight of it should he carry if by any means in her poor power she could hold it from his back she would not even tell him of what had happenedat any rate not now it would distress him he might take some desperate step it was almost certain that he would do so her answer must be very short  she was quite close to coed now and the water lay calm as a pond so calm was it that she drew the sheet of paper and the envelope from her pocket and leaning forward rested them on the arched covering of the canoe and pencilled those words which we have already read  no dear geoffrey things must take their courseb  thus she wrote then she paddled to the shore a fisherman standing on the beach caught her canoe and pulled it up leaving it in his charge she went into the quaint little town directed and posted her letter and bought some wool it was an excuse for having been there should any one ask questions after that she returned to her canoe the fisherman was standing by it she offered him sixpence for his trouble but he would not take it  no miss he said thanking you kindlybut we dont often get a peep at such sweet looks its worth sixpence to see you it is but miss if i may make so bold as to say so it isnt safe for you to cruise about in that craft any ways not alone  beatrice thanked him and blushed a little vaguely it occurred to her that she must have more than a common share of beauty when a rough man could be so impressed with it that was what men loved women for their beauty as owen davies loved and desired her for this same cause and this only  perhaps it was the same with geoffreyno she did not believe it he loved her for other things besides her looks only if she had not been beautiful perhaps he would not have begun to love her so she was thankful for her eyes and hair and form  could folly and infatuation go further this woman in the darkest hour of her bottomless and unhorizoned despair with conscience gnawing at her heart with present misery pressing on her breast and shame to come hanging over her like a thunder cloud could yet feel thankful that she had won this barren love the spring of all her woe or was her folly deep wisdom in disguiseis there something divine in a passion that can so override and defy the worst agonies of life  she was at sea again now and evening was falling on the waters softly as a dream well the letter was posted would it be the last she wondered it seemed as though she must write no more letters and what was to be done she would not marry owen daviesnever would she do it she could not so shamelessly violate her feelings for beatrice was a woman to whom death would be preferable to dishonour however legal no for her own sake she would not be soiled with that disgrace did she do this she would hold herself the vilest of the vile and still less would she do it for geoffreys sake her instinct told her what he would feel at such a thing though he might never say a word surely he would loathe and despise her no that idea was done withutterly done with  then what remained to her she would not fly with geoffrey since to do so would be to ruin him she would not marry owen and not to do so would still be to ruin geoffrey she was no fool she was innocent in act but she knew that her innocence would indeed be hard to proveeven her own father did not believe in it and her sister would openly accuse her to the world what then should she do should she hide herself in some remote halfcivilised place or in london it was impossible she had no money and no means of getting any besides they would hunt her out both owen davies and geoffrey would track her to the furthest limits of the earth and would not the former think that geoffrey had spirited her away and at once put his threats into execution obviously he would there was no hope in that direction some other plan must be found or her lover would still be ruined  so argued beatrice still thinking not of herself but of geoffrey of that beloved one who was more to her than all the world more a thousand times than her own safety or wellbeing perhaps she overrated the matter owen davies lady honoria and even elizabeth might have done all they threatened the first of them perhaps the first two of them certainly would have done so but still geoffrey might have escaped destruction public opinion or the sounder part of it is sensibly enough hard to move in such a matter especially when the person said to have been wronged is heart and soul on the side of him who is said to have wronged her  moreover there might have been ways out of it of which she knew nothing but surrounded as she was by threatening powersby lady honoria threatening actions in the courts on one side by owen davies threatening exposure on another by elizabeth ready and willing to give the most damning evidence on the third to beatrice the worst consequences seemed an absolutely necessary sequence then there was her own conscience arrayed against her this particular charge was a lie but it was not a lie that she loved geoffrey and to her the two things seemed very much the same thing hers was not a mind to draw fine distinctions in such matters se posuit ut culpabilem she placed herself as guilty as the old court rolls put it in miserable latin and this sense of guilt disarmed her she did not realise the enormous difference recognised by the whole civilised world between thought and act between disposing mind and inculpating deed beatrice looked at the question more from the scriptural point of view remembering that in the bible such fine divisions are expressly stated to be distinctions without a difference  had she gone to geoffrey and told him her whole story it is probable that he would have defied the conspiracy faced it out and possibly come off victorious but with that deadly reticence of which women alone are capable this she did not and would not do sweet loving woman that she was she would not burden him with her sorrows she would bear them alonelittle reckoning that thereby she was laying up a far far heavier load for him to carry through all his days  so beatrice accepted the statements of the plaintiffs attorney for gospel truth and from that false standpoint she drew her auguries    oh she was weary how lovely was the falling night see how it brooded on the seas and how clear were the watersthere a fish passed by her paddleand there the first start sprang into the sky if only geoffrey were here to see it with her geoffrey she had lost him she was alone in the world nowalone with the sea and the stars well they were better than menbetter than all men except one theirs was a divine companionship and it soothed her ah how hateful had been elizabeths face more hateful even than the halfcrazed cunning of owen davies when she stretched her hand towards her and called her a scarlet woman it was so like elizabeth this mixing up of bible terms with her accusation and after all perhaps it was truewhat was it though thy sins be as scarlet yet shall they be white as snow but that was only if one repented she did not repent not in the least conscience it is true reproached her with a breach of temporal and human law but her heart cried that such love as she had given was immortal and divine and therefore set beyond the little bounds of time and man at any rate she loved geoffrey and was proud and glad to love him the circumstances were unfortunate but she did not make the world or its social arrangements any more than she had made herself and she could not help that the fact remained right or wrongshe loved him loved him  how clear were the waters what was that wild dream which she had dreamt about herself sitting at the bottom of the sea and waiting for himtill at last he came sitting at the bottom of the seawhy did it strike her so strangelywhat unfamiliar thought did it waken in her mind well and why not it would be pleasant there better at any rate than on the earth but things cannot be ended so one is burdened with the flesh and one must wear it till it fails why must she wear it was not the sea large enough to hide her bones look now she had but to slip over the edge of the canoe slip without a struggle into those mighty arms and in a few short minutes it would all be done and gone  she gasped as the thought struck home here was the answer to her questionings the same answer that is given to every human troubling to all earthly hopes and fears and strivings one stroke of that black knife and everything would be lost or found would it be so great a thing to give her life for geoffreywhy she had well nigh done as much when she had known him but an hour and now that he was all in all oh would it be so great a thing if she dieddied secretly swiftly surelygeoffrey would be saved they would not trouble him then there would be no one to trouble about owen davies could not marry her then geoffrey could not ruin himself over her elizabeth could pursue her no further it would be well to do this thing for geoffrey and he would always love her and beyond that black curtain there might be something better  they said that it was sin yes it might be sin to act thus for oneself alone but to do it for anotherhow of that was not the saviour whom they preached a man of sacrifice would it be a sin in her to die for geoffrey to sacrifice herself that geoffrey might go free  oh it would be no great merit her life was not so easy that she should fear this pure embrace it would be better far better than to marry owen davies than to desecrate their love and teach geoffrey to despise her and how else could she ward this trouble from him except by her death or by a marriage that in her eyes was more dreadful than any death    she could not do it yet she could not die until she had once more seen his face even though he did not see hers no not tonight would she seek this swift solution she had words to sayor words to writebefore the end already they rushed in upon her mind  but if no better plan presented itself she would do it she was sure that she would it was a sinwell let it be a sin what did she care if she sinned for geoffrey he would not think the worse of her for it and she had hope yes geoffrey had taught her to hope if there was a hell why it was here and yet not all a hell for in it she had found her love    it grew dark she could hear the whisper of the waves upon bryngelly beach it grew dark the night was closing round she paddled to within a few fathoms of the shore and called in her clear voice  ay ay miss answered old edward from the beach come in on the next wave  she came in accordingly and her canoe was caught and dragged high and dry  what miss beatrice said the old man shaking his head and grumbling at it again out all alone in that thing and he gave the canoe a contemptuous kick and in the dark too you want a husband to look after you you do youll never rest till youre drowned  no edward she answered with a little laugh i dont suppose that i shall there is no peace for the wicked above seas you know now do not scold the canoe is as safe as church in this weather and in the bay  oh yes its safe enough in the calm and the bay he answered but supposing it should come on to blow and supposing you should drift beyond the shelter of rumball point there and get the rollers down on youwhy you would be drowned in five minutes its wicked miss thats what it is  beatrice laughed again and went  shes a funny one she is said the old man scratching his head as he looked after her of all the woman folk as ever i knowed she is the rummest i sometimes thinks she wants to get drowned dash me if i havent half a mind to stave a hole in the bottom of that there damned canoe and finish it  beatrice reached home a little before supper time her first act was to call betty the servant and with her assistance to shift her bed and things into the spare room with elizabeth she would have nothing more to do they had slept together since they were children now she had done with her then she went in to supper and sat through it like a statue speaking no word her father and elizabeth kept up a strained conversation but they did not speak to her nor she to them elizabeth did not even ask where she had been nor take any notice of her change of room  one thing however beatrice learnt her father was going on the monday to hereford by an early train to attend a meeting of clergymen collected to discuss the tithe question he was to return by the last train on the tuesday night that is about midnight beatrice now discovered that elizabeth proposed to accompany him evidently she wished to see as little as possible of her sister during this week of trucepossibly she was a little afraid of her even elizabeth might have a conscience  so she should be left alone from monday morning till tuesday night one can do a good deal in forty hours  after supper beatrice rose and left the room without a word and they were glad when she went she frightened them with her set face and great calm eyes but neither spoke to the other on the subject they had entered into a conspiracy of silence  beatrice locked her door and then sat at the window lost in thought when once the idea of suicide has entered the mind it is apt to grow with startling rapidity she reviewed the whole position she went over all the arguments and searched the moral horizon for some feasible avenue of escape but she could find none that would save geoffrey except this yes she would do it as many another wretched woman had done before her not from cowardice indeed for had she alone been concerned she would have faced the thing out fighting to the bitter endbut for this reason only it would cut off the dangers which threatened geoffrey at their very root and source of course there must be no scandal it must never be known that she had killed herself or she might defeat her own object for the story would be raked up but she well knew how to avoid such a possibility in her extremity beatrice grew cunning as a fox yes and there might be an inquest at which awkward questions would be asked but as she well knew also before an inquest can be held there must be something to hold it on and that something would not be there    and so in the utter silence of the night and in the loneliness of her chamber did beatrice dedicate herself to sacrifice upon the altar of her immeasurable love she would face the last agonies of death when the bloom of her youthful strength and beauty was but opening as a rose in june she would do more she would brave the threatened vengeance of the most high coming before him a self murderess and with but one plea for pitythat she loved so well quia multum amavit yes she would do all this would leave the warm world in the dawning summer of her days and alone go out into the darkalone would face those visions which might comethose shapes of terror and those things of fear that perchance may wait for sinful human kind alone she would gooh hand in hand with him it had been easy but this must not be the door of utter darkness would swing to behind her and who could say if in time to come it should open to geoffreys following feet or if he might ever find the path that she had trod it must be done it should be done beatrice rose from her seat with bright eyes and quickcoming breath and swore before god if god there were that she would do it trusting to him for pardon and for pity or failing thesefor sleep  yes but first she must once more look upon geoffreys dear faceand then farewell  pity her poor mistaken woman making of her will a providence rushing to doom pity her but do not blame her overmuch or if you do then blame judith and jephthas daughter and charlotte corday and all the glorious women who from time to time have risen on this sordid world of self and given themselves as an offering upon the altars of their love their religion their honour or their country    it was finished now let her rest while she could seeing what was to come with a sigh for all that was and all that might have been beatrice lay down and soon slept sweetly as a child    chapter xxvii  the house of commons  next day was sunday beatrice did not go to church for one thing she feared to see owen davies there but she took her sunday school class as usual and long did the children remember how kind and patient she was with them that day and how beautifully she told them the story of the jewish girl of long ago who went forth to die for the sake of her fathers oath  nearly all the rest of the day and evening she spent in writing that which we shall read in timeonly in the late afternoon she went out for a little while in her canoe another thing beatrice did also she called at the lodging of her assistant the head school teacher and told her it was possible that she would not be in her place on the tuesday monday was as it chanced a holiday if anybody inquired as to her absence perhaps she would kindly tell them that miss granger had an appointment to keep and had taken a mornings holiday in order to do so she should however be back that afternoon the teacher assented without suspicion remarking that if beatrice could not take a mornings holiday she was sure she did not know who could  next morning they breakfasted very early because mr granger and elizabeth had to catch the train beatrice sat through the meal in silence her calm eyes looking straight before her and the others gazing on them and at the lovely inscrutable face felt an indefinable fear creep into their hearts what did this woman mean to do that was the question they asked of themselves though not of each other that she meant to do something they were sure for there was purpose written on every line of her cold face  suddenly as they sat thinking and making pretence to eat a thought flashed like an arrow into beatrices heart and pierced it this was the last meal that they could ever take together this was the last time that she could ever see her fathers and her sisters faces for her sister well it might passfor there are some things which even a woman like beatrice can never quite forgivebut she loved her father she loved his very faults even his simple avarice and selfseeking had become endeared to her by long and wondering contemplation besides he was her father he gave her the life she was about to cast away and she should never see him more not on that account did she hesitate in her purpose which was now set in her mind like bryngelly castle on its rock but at the thought tears rushed unbidden to her eyes  just then breakfast came to an end and elizabeth hurried from the room to fetch her bonnet  father said beatrice if you can before you go i should like to hear you say that you do not believe that i told you what was falseabout that story  eh eh answered the old man nervously i thought that we had agreed to say nothing about the matter at present  yes but i should like to hear you say it father it cuts me that you should think that i would lie to you for in my life i have never wilfully told you what was not true and she clasped her hands about his arms and looked into his face  he gazed at her doubtfully was it possible after all she was speaking the truth no it was not possible  i cant beatrice he saidnot that i blame you overmuch for trying to defend yourself a cornered rat will show fight  may you never regret those words she said and now goodbye and she kissed him on the forehead  at this moment elizabeth entered saying that it was time to start and he did not return the kiss  goodbye elizabeth said beatrice stretching out her hand but elizabeth affected not to see it and in another moment they were gone she followed them to the gate and watched them till they vanished down the road then she returned her heart strained almost to bursting but she wept no tear  thus did beatrice bid a last farewell to her father and her sister  elizabeth said mr granger as they drew near to the station i am not easy in my thoughts about beatrice there was such a strange look in her eyes itin short it frightens me i have half a mind to give up hereford and go back and he stopped upon the road hesitating  as you like said elizabeth with a sneer but i should think that beatrice is big enough and bad enough to look after herself  before the god who made us said the old man furiously and striking the ground with his stick she may be bad but she is not so bad as you who betrayed her if beatrice is a magdalene you are a woman judas and i believe that you hate her and would be glad to see her dead  elizabeth made no answer they were nearing the station for her father had started on again and there were people about but she looked at him and he never forgot the look it was quite enough to chill him into silence nor did he allude to the matter any more    when they were gone beatrice set about her own preparations her wild purpose was to travel to london and catch a glimpse of geoffreys face in the house of commons if possible and then return she put on her bonnet and best dress the latter was very plainly made of simple grey cloth but on her it looked well enough and in the breast of it she thrust the letter which she had written on the previous day a small handbag with some sandwiches and a brush and comb in it and a cloak made up the total of her baggage  the train which did not stop at bryngelly left coed at ten and coed was an hour and a halfs walk she must be starting of course she would have to be absent for the night and she was sorely puzzled how to account for her absence to betty the servant girl the others being gone there was no need to do so to anybody else but here fortune befriended her while she was thinking the matter over who should come in but betty herself crying she had just heard she said that her little sister who lived with their mother at a village about ten miles away had been knocked down by a cart and badly hurt might she go home for the night she could come back on the morrow and miss beatrice could get somebody in to sleep if she was lonesome  beatrice sympathised demurred and consented and betty started at once as soon as she was gone beatrice locked up the house put the key in her pocket and started on her five miles tramp nobody saw her leave the house and she passed by a path at the back of the village so that nobody saw her on the road reaching coed station quite unobserved and just before the train was due she let down her veil and took a thirdclass ticket to london this she was obliged to do for her stock of money was very small it amounted altogether to thirtysix shillings of which the fare to london and back would cost her twentyeight and fourpence  in another minute she had entered an empty carriage and the train had steamed away  she reached paddington about eight that night and going to the refreshment room dined on some tea and bread and butter then she washed her hands brushed her hair and started  beatrice had never been in london before and as soon as she left the station the rush and roar of the huge city took hold of her and confused her her idea was to walk to the houses of parliament at westminster she would she thought be sure to see geoffrey there because she had bought a daily paper in which she had read that he was to be one of the speakers in a great debate on the irish question which was to be brought to a close that night she had been told by a friendly porter to follow praed street till she reached the edgware road then to walk on to the marble arch and ask again beatrice followed the first part of this programmethat is she walked as far as the edgware road then it was that confusion seized her and she stood hesitating at this juncture a coarse brute of a man came up and made some remark to her it was impossible for a woman like beatrice to walk alone in the streets of london at night without running the risk of such attentions she turned from him and as she did so heard him say something about her beauty to a fellow arcadian close to where she was stood two hansom cabs she went to the first and asked the driver for how much he would take her to the house of commons  two bob miss he answered  beatrice shook her head and turned to go again she was afraid to spend so much on cabs for she must get back to bryngelly  ill take yer for eighteenpence miss called out the other driver this offer she was about to accept when the first man interposed  you leave my fare alone will yer tell yer what miss im a gentleman i am and ill take yer for a bob  she smiled and entered the cab then came a whirl of great gaslit thoroughfares and in a quarter of an hour they pulled up at the entrance to the house beatrice paid the cabman his shilling thanked him and entered only once more to find herself confused with a vision of white statues marble floors high arching roofs and hurrying people an automatic policeman asked her what she wanted beatrice answered that she wished to get into the house  pass this way then misspass this way said the automatic officer in a voice of brass she passed and passed and finally found herself in a lobby among a crowd of people of all sortsseedy political touts irish priests and hurrying pressmen at one side of the lobby were more policemen and messengers who were continually taking cards into the house then returning and calling out names insensibly she drifted towards these policemen  ladies gallery miss said a voice your order please though i think its full  here was a fresh complication beatrice had no order she had no idea that one was necessary  i havent got an order she said faintly i did not know that i must have one can i not get in without  most certainly not miss answered the voice while its owner suspecting dynamite surveyed her with a cold official eye now make way make way please  beatrices grey eyes filled with tears as she turned to go in bitterness of heart so all her labour was in vain and that which would be done must be done without the mute farewell she sought well when sorrow was so much what mattered a little more she turned to go but not unobserved a certain rather youthful member of parliament with an eye for beauty in distress had been standing close to her talking to a constituent the constituent had departed to wherever constituents goand many representatives if asked would cheerfully point out a locality suitable to the genus at least in their judgmentand the member had overheard the conversation and seen beatrices eyes fill with tears what a lovely woman he had said to himself and then did what he should have done namely lifted his hat and inquired if as a member of the house he could be of any service to her beatrice listened and explained that she was particularly anxious to get into the ladies gallery  i think that i can help you then he said as it happens a lady for whom i got an order has telegraphed to say that she cannot come will you follow me might i ask you to give me your name  mrs everston answered beatrice taking the first that came into her head the member looked a little disappointed he had vaguely hoped that this lovely creature was unappropriated surely her marriage could not be satisfactory or she would not look so sad  then came more stairs and passages and formalities till presently beatrice found herself in a kind of birdcage crowded to suffocation with every sort of lady  im afraidi am very much afraid began her newfound friend surveying the mass with dismay  but at that moment a stout lady in front feeling faint with the heat was forced to leave the gallery and almost before she knew where she was beatrice was installed in her place her friend had bowed and vanished and she was left to all purposes alone for she never heeded those about her though some of them looked at her hard enough wondering at her form and beauty and who she might be  she cast her eye down over the crowded house and saw a vision of hats collars and legs and heard a tumult of sounds the sharp voice of a speaker who was rapidly losing his temper the plaudits of the government benches the interruptions from the oppositionyes even yells and hoots and noises that reminded her remotely of the crowing of cocks possibly had she thought of it beatrice would not have been greatly impressed with the dignity of an assembly at the doors of which so many of its members seemed to leave their manners with their overcoats and sticks it might even have suggested the idea of a bear garden to her mind but she simply did not think about it she searched the house keenly enough but it was to find one face and one onlyah there he was  and now the house of commons might vanish into the bottomless abyss and take with it the house of lords and what remained of the british constitution and she would never miss them for at the best of times beatricein common with most of her sexin all gratitude be it said was not an ardent politician  there geoffrey sat his arms foldedthe hat pushed slightly from his forehead so that she could see his face there was her own beloved whom she had come so far to see and whom tomorrow she would dare so much to save how sad he lookedhe did not seem to be paying much attention to what was going on she knew well enough that he was thinking of her she could feel it in her head as she had often felt it before but she dared not let her mind go out to him in answer for if once she did so she knew also that he would discover her so she sat and fed her eyes upon his face taking her farewell of it while round her and beneath her the hum of the house went on as ever present and as unnoticed as the hum of bees upon a summer noon  presently the gentleman who had been so kind to her sat down in the next seat to geoffrey and began to whisper to him as he did so glancing once or twice towards the grating behind which she was she guessed that he was telling him the story of the lady who was so unaccountably anxious to hear the debate and how pretty she was but it did not seem to interest geoffrey much and beatrice was feminine enough to notice it and to be glad of it in her gentle jealousy she did not like to think of geoffrey as being interested in accounts of mysterious ladies however pretty  at length a speaker roseshe understood from the murmur of those around her that he was one of the leaders of the opposition and commenced a powerful and bitter speech she noticed that geoffrey roused himself at this point and began to listen with attention  look said one of the ladies near her mr bingham is taking notes he is going to speak nexthe speaks wonderfully you know they say that he is as good as anybody in the house except gladstone and lord randolph  oh answered another lady lady honoria is not here is she i dont see her  no replied the first she is a dear creature and so handsome toojust the wife for a rising manbut i dont think that she takes much interest in politics are not her dinners charming  at this moment a volley of applause from the opposition benches drowned the murmured conversation  this speaker spoke for about threequarters of an hour and then at last geoffrey stood up one or two other members rose at the same time but ultimately they gave way  he began slowlyand somewhat tamely as it seemed to beatrice whose heart was in her mouthbut when he had been speaking for about five minutes he warmed up and then began one of the most remarkable oratorical displays of that parliament geoffrey had spoken well before and would speak well again but perhaps he never spoke so well as he did upon that night for nearly an hour and a half he held the house in chains even the hoots and interruptions died away towards the end of his oration his powerful presence seemed to tower in the place like that of a giant among pigmies and his dark handsome face lit with the fires of eloquence shone like a lamp he leaned forward with a slight stoop of his broad shoulders and addressed himself nominally to the speaker but really to the opposition he took their facts one by one and with convincing logic showed that they were no facts amid a hiss of anger he pulverised their arguments and demonstrated their motives then suddenly he dropped them altogether and addressing himself to the house at large and the country beyond the house he struck another note and broke out into that storm of patriotic eloquence which confirmed his growing reputation both in parliament and in the constituencies  beatrice shut her eyes and listened to the deep rich voice as it rose from height to height and power to power till the whole place seemed full of it and every contending sound was hushed  suddenly after an invocation that would have been passionate had it not been so restrained and strong he stopped she opened her eyes and looked geoffrey was seated as before with his hat on he had been speaking for an hour and a half and yet to her it seemed but a few minutes since he rose then broke out a volley of cheers in the midst of which a leader of the opposition rose to reply not in the very best of tempers for geoffreys speech had hit them hard  he began however by complimenting the honourable member on his speech as fine a speech as he had listened to for many years though unfortunately made from a mistaken standpoint and the wrong side of the house then he twitted the government with not having secured the services of a man so infinitely abler than the majority of their items and excited a good deal of amusement by stating with some sarcastic humour that should it ever be his lot to occupy the front treasury bench he should certainly make a certain proposal to the honourable member after this goodnatured badinage he drifted off into the consideration of the question under discussion and beatrice paid no further attention to him but occupied herself in watching geoffrey drop back into the same apparent state of cold indifference from which the necessity of action had aroused him  presently the gentleman who had found her the seat came up and spoke to her asking her how she was getting on very soon he began to speak of geoffreys speech saying that it was one of the most brilliant of the session if not the most brilliant  then mr bingham is a rising man i suppose beatrice said  rising i should think so he answered they will get him into the government on the first opportunity after this hes too good to neglect very few men can come to the fore like mr bingham we call him the comet and if only he does not make a mess of his chances by doing something foolish there is no reason why he should not be attorneygeneral in a few years  why should he do anything foolish she asked  oh for no reason on earth that i know of only as i daresay you have noticed men of this sort are very apt to do ridiculous things throw up their career get into a public scandal run away with somebody or something not that there should be any fear of such a thing where mr bingham is concerned for he has a charming wife and they say that she is a great help to him why there is the division bell goodbye mrs everston i will come back to see you out  goodbye beatrice answered and in case i should miss you i wish to say somethingto thank you for your kindness in helping me to get in here tonight you have done me a great service a very great service and i am most grateful to you  it is nothingnothing he answered it has been a pleasure to help you if he added with some confusion you would allow me to call some day the pleasure will be all the greater i will bring mr bingham with me if you would like to know himthat is if i can  beatrice shook her head i cannot she answered smiling sadly i am going on a long journey tomorrow and i shall not return here goodbye  in another second he was gone more piqued and interested about this fair unknown than he had been about any woman for years who could she be and why was she so anxious to hear the debate there was a mystery in it somewhere and he determined to solve it if he could  meanwhile the division took place and presently the members flocked back and amidst ringing ministerial cheers and counter opposition cheers the victory of the government was announced then came the usual formalities and the members began to melt away beatrice saw the leader of the house and several members of the government go up to geoffrey shake his hand and congratulate him then with one long look she turned and went leaving him in the moment of his triumph that seemed to interest him so little but which made beatrice more proud at heart than if she had been declared empress of the world  oh it was well to love a man like that a man born to tower over his fellow menand well to die for him could she let her miserable existence interfere with such a life as his should be never never there should be no public scandal on her account  she drew her veil over her face and inquired the way from the house presently she was outside by one of the gateways and in the shadow of its pillars she stopped watching the members of the house stream past her many of them were talking together and once or twice she caught the sound of geoffreys name coupled with such words as splendid speech and other terms of admiration  move on move on said a policeman to her lifting her veil beatrice turned and looked at him and muttering something he moved on himself leaving her in peace presently she saw geoffrey and the gentleman who had been so kind to her walking along together they came through the gateway the lappet of his coat brushed her arm and he never saw her closer she crouched against the pillar hiding herself in its shadow within six feet of her geoffrey stopped and lit a cigar the light of the match flared upon his face that dark strong face she loved so well how tired he looked a great longing took possession of her to step forward and speak to him but she restrained herself almost by force  her friend was speaking to him and about her  such a lovely woman he was saying with the clearest and most beautiful grey eyes that i ever saw but she has gone like a dream i cant find her anywhere it is a most mysterious business  you are falling in love tom answered geoffrey absently as he threw away the match and walked on dont do that it is an unhappy thing to do and he sighed  he was going oh heaven she would never never see him more a cold horror seized upon beatrice her blood seemed to stagnate she trembled so much that she could scarcely stand leaning forward she looked after him with such a face of woe that even the policeman who had repented him of his forbearance and was returning to send her away stood astonished the two men had gone about ten yards when something induced beatrices friend to look back his eye fell upon the white agonystricken face now in the full glare of the gas lamp  beatrice saw him turn and understood her danger oh goodbye geoffrey she murmured for a second allowing her heart to go forth towards him then realising what she had done she dropped her veil and went swiftly the gentleman called tomshe never learnt his namestood for a moment dumbfounded and at that instant geoffrey staggered as though he had been struck by a shot turned quite white and halted  why said his companion there is that lady again we must have passed quite close to her she was looking after us i saw her face in the gaslightand i never want to see such another  geoffrey seized him by the arm where is she he asked and what was she like  she was there a second ago he said pointing to the pillar but ive lost her nowi fancy she went towards the railway station but i could not see stop is that she and he pointed to a tall person walking towards the abbey  quickly they moved to intercept her but the result was not satisfactory and they retreated hastily from the object of their attentions  meanwhile beatrice found herself opposite the entrance to the westminster bridge station a hansom was standing there she got into it and told the man to drive to paddington  before the pair had retraced their steps she was gone she has vanished again said tom and went on to give a description of her to geoffrey of her dress he had unfortunately taken little note it might be one of beatrices or it might not it seemed almost inconceivable to geoffrey that she should be masquerading about london under the name of mrs everston and yetand yethe could have swornbut it was folly  suddenly he bade his friend goodnight and took a hansom the mystery thickens said the astonished tom as he watched him drive away i would give a hundred pounds to find out what it all means oh that womans faceit haunts me it looked like the face of an angel bidding farewell to heaven  but he never did find out any more about it though the despairing eyes of beatrice as she bade her mute farewell still sometimes haunt his sleep  geoffrey reflected rapidly the thing was ridiculous and yet it was possible beyond that brief line in answer to his letter he had heard nothing from beatrice indeed he was waiting to hear from her before taking any further step but even supposing she were in london where was he to look for her he knew that she had no money he could not stay there long it occurred to him there was a train leaving euston for wales about four in the morning it was just possible that she might be in town and returning by this train he told the cabman to drive to euston station and on arrival closely questioned a sleepy porter but without satisfactory results  then he searched the station there were no traces of beatrice he did more he sat down weary as he was and waited for an hour and a half till it was time for the train to start there were but three passengers and none of them in the least resembled beatrice  it is very strange geoffrey said to himself as he walked away i could have sworn that i felt her presence just for one second it must have been nonsense this is what comes of occult influences and that kind of thing the occult is a nuisance  if he had only gone to paddington    chapter xxviii  i will wait for you  beatrice drove back to paddington and as she drove though her face did not change from its marble cast of woe the great tears rolled down it one by one  they reached the desertedlooking station and she paid the man out of her few remaining shillingsseeing that she was a stranger he insisted upon receiving halfacrown then disregarding the astonished stare of a night porter she found her way to the waiting room and sat down first she took the letter from her breast and added some lines to it in pencil but she did not post it yet she knew that if she did so it would reach its destination too soon then she laid her head back against the wall and utterly outworn dropped to sleepher last sleep upon this earth before the longest sleep of all  and thus beatrice waited and slept at paddington while her lover waited and watched at euston  at five she woke and the heavy cloud of sorrow past present and to come rushed in upon her heart taking her bag she made herself as tidy as she could then she stepped outside the station into the deserted street and finding a space between the houses watched the sun rise over the waking world it was her last sunrise beatrice remembered  she came back filled with such thoughts as might well strike the heart of a woman about to do the thing she had decreed the refreshment bar was open now and she went to it and bought a cup of coffee and some bread and butter then she took her ticket not to bryngelly or to coed but to the station on this side of bryngelly and three miles from it she would run less risk of being noticed there the train was shunted up she took her seat in it just as it was starting an early newspaper boy came along yawning beatrice bought a copy of the standard out of the one and threepence that was left of her money and opened it at the sheet containing the leading articles the first one began the most powerful closely reasoned and eloquent speech made last night by mr bingham the member for pillham will we feel certain produce as great an effect on the country as it did in the house of commons we welcome it not only on account of its value as a contribution to the polemics of the irish question but as a positive proof of what has already been suspected that the unionist party has in mr bingham a young statesman of a very high order indeed and one whom remarkable and rapid success at the bar has not hampered as is too often the case in the larger and less technical field of politics  and so on beatrice put the paper down with a smile of triumph geoffreys success was splendid and unquestioned nothing could stop him now during all the long journey she pleased her imagination by conjuring up picture after picture of that great future of his in which she would have no share and yet he would not forget her she was sure of this her shadow would go with him from year to year even to the end and at times he might think how proud she would have been could she be present to record his triumphs alas she did not remember that when all is lost which can make life beautiful when the sun has set and the spirit gone out of the day the poor garish lights of our little victories can but ill atone for the glories that have been happiness and content are frail plants which can only flourish under fair conditions if at all certainly they will not thrive beneath the gloom and shadow of a pall and when the heart is dead no triumphs however splendid and no rewards however great can compensate for an utter and irredeemable loss she never guessed poor girl that time upon time in the decades to be geoffrey would gladly have laid his honours down in payment for one year of her dear and unforgotten presence she was too unselfish she did not think that a man could thus prize a womans love and took it for an axiom that to succeed in life was his one real objecta thing to which so divine a gift as she had given geoffrey is as nothing it was therefore this juggernaut of her lovers career that beatrice would cast down her life little knowing that thereby she must turn the worldly and temporal success which he already held so cheap to bitterness and ashes  at chester beatrice got out of the train and posted her letter to geoffrey she would not do so till then because it might have reached him too soonbefore all was finished now it would be delivered to him in the house after everything had been accomplished in its order she looked at the letter it was she thought the last token that could ever pass between them on this earth once she pressed it to her heart once she touched it with her lips and then put it from her beyond recall it was done there was no going back now and even as she stood the postman came up whistling and opening the box carelessly swept its contents into his canvas bag could he have known what lay among them he would have whistled no more that day  beatrice continued her journey and by three oclock arrived safely at the little station next to bryngelly there was a fair at coed that day and many people of the peasant class got in here amidst the confusion she gave up her ticket to a small boy who was looking the other way at the time and escaped without being noticed by a soul indeed things happened so that nobody in the neighbourhood of bryngelly ever knew that beatrice had been to london and back upon those dreadful days  beatrice walked along the cliff and in an hour was at the door of the vicarage from which she seemed to have been away for years she unlocked it and entered in the letterbox was a postcard from her father stating that he and elizabeth had changed their plans and would not be back till the train which arrived at halfpast eight on the following morning so much the better she thought then she disarranged the clothes upon her bed to make it seem as though it had been slept it lit the kitchen fire and put the kettle on to boil and as soon as it was ready she took some food she wanted all her nerve and that could not be kept up without food  shortly after this the girl betty returned and went about her duties in the house quite unconscious that beatrice had been away from it for the whole night her sister was much better she said in answer to beatrices inquiries  when she had eaten what she couldit was not muchbeatrice went to her room undressed herself bathed and put on clean fresh things then she unbound her lovely hair and did it up in a coronet upon her head it was a fashion that she did not often adopt because it took too much time but on this day of all days she had a strange fancy to look her best also her hair had been done like this on the afternoon when geoffrey first met her next she put on the grey dress once more which she had worn on her journey to london and taking the silver roman ring that geoffrey had given her from the string by which she wore it about her neck placed it on the third finger of her left hand  all this being done beatrice visited the kitchen and ordered the supper she went further in her innocent cunning betty asked her what she would like for breakfast on the following morning and she told her to cook some bacon and to be careful how she cut it as she did not like thick bacon then after one long last look at the vicarage she started for the lodging of the head teacher of the school and having found her inquired as to the days work  further beatrice told her assistant that she had determined to alter the course of certain lessons in the school the wednesday arithmetic class had hitherto been taken before the grammar class on the morrow she had determined to change this she would take the grammar class at ten and the arithmetic class at eleven and gave her reasons for so doing the teacher assented and beatrice shook hands with her and bade her goodnight she would have wished to say how much she felt indebted to her for her help in the school but did not like to do so fearing lest in the light of pending events the remark might be viewed with suspicion  poor beatrice these were the only lies she ever told  she left the teachers lodgings and was about to go down to the beach and sit there till it was time when she was met by the father of the crazed child jane llewellyn  oh miss beatrice he said i have been looking for you everywhere we are in sad trouble miss poor jane is in a raving fit and talking about hell and that and the doctor says shes dying can you come miss and see if you can do anything to quiet her its a matter of life and death the doctor says miss  beatrice smiled sadly matters of life and death were in the air i will come she said but i shall not be able to stay long  how could she better spend her last hour  she accompanied the man to his cottage the child dressed only in a nightshirt was raving furiously and evidently in the last stage of exhaustion nor could the doctor or her mother do anything to quiet her  dont you see she screamed pointing to the wall theres the devil waiting for me and oh theres the mouth of hell where the minister said i should go oh hold me hold me hold me  beatrice walked up to her took the thin little hands in hers and looked her fixedly in the eyes  jane she said jane dont you know me  yes miss granger she said i know the lesson i will say it presently  beatrice took her in her arms and sat down on the bed quieter and quieter grew the child till suddenly an awful change passed over her face  she is dying whispered the doctor  hold me close hold me close said the child whose senses returned before the last eclipse oh miss granger i shant go to hell shall i i am afraid of hell  no love no you will go to heaven  jane lay still awhile then seeing the pale lips move beatrice put her ear to the childs mouth  will you come with me she murmured i am afraid to go alone  and beatrice her great grey eyes fixed steadily on the closing eyes beneath whispered back so that no other soul could hear except the dying child  yes i will come presently but jane heard and understood  promise said the child  yes i promise answered beatrice in the same inaudible whisper sleep dear sleep i will join you very soon  and the child looked up shivered smiledand slept  beatrice gave it back to the weeping parents and went her way what a splendid creature said the doctor to himself as he looked after her she has eyes like fate and the face of motherhood incarnate a great woman if ever i saw one but different from other women  meanwhile beatrice made her way to old edwards boatshed as she expected there was nobody there and nobody on the beach old edward and his son were at tea with the rest of bryngelly they would come back after dark and lock up the boathouse  she looked at the sea there were no waves but the breeze freshened every minute and there was a long slow swell upon the water the rollers would be running beyond the shelter of rumball point five miles away  the tide was high it mounted to within ten yards of the end of the boathouse she opened the door and dragged out her canoe closing the door again after her the craft was light and she was strong for a woman close to the boathouse one of the timber breakwaters which are common at seaside places ran down into the water she dragged the canoe to its side and then pushed it down the beach till its bow was afloat next mounting on the breakwater she caught hold of the little chain in the bow and walking along the timber baulks pulled with all her force till the canoe was quite afloat on she went dragging it after her till the waves washing over the breakwater wetted her shoes  then she brought the canoe quite close and watching her opportunity stepped into it nearly falling into the water as she did so but she recovered her balance and sat down in another minute she was paddling out to sea with all her strength  for twenty minutes or more she paddled unceasingly then she rested awhile only keeping the canoe head on to the sea which without being rough was running more and more freshly there some miles away was the dark mass of rumball point she must be off it before the night closed in there would be sea enough there no such craft as hers could live in it for five minutes and the tide was on the turn anything sinking in those waters would be carried far away and never come back to the shore of wales  she turned her head and looked at bryngelly and the long familiar stretch of cliff how fair it seemed bathed in the quiet lights of summer afternoon oh was there any afternoon where the child had gone and where she was following fastor was it all night black eternal night unbroken by the dram of dear remembered things  there were the dog rocks where she had stood on that misty autumn day and seen the vision of her coffined mothers face surely it was a presage of her fate there beyond was the bell rock where in that same hour geoffrey and she had met and behind it was the amphitheatre where they had told their love hark what was that sound pealing faintly at intervals across the deep it was the great ships bell that stirred from time to time by the wash of the high tide solemnly tolled her passing soul  she paddled on the sound of that deathknell shook her nerves and made her feel faint and weak oh it would have been easier had she been as she was a year ago before she learned to love and hand in hand had seen faith and hope rearise from the depths of her stirred soul then being but a heathen she could have met her end with all a heathens strength knowing what she lost and believing too that she would find but sleep and now it was otherwise for in her heart she did not believe that she was about utterly to perish what could the body live on in a thousand forms changed indeed but indestructible and immortal while the spiritual part with all its hopes and loves and fears melted into nothingness it could not be surely on some new shore she should once again greet her love and if it was not how would they meet her in that under world coming selfmurdered her lifeblood on her hands would her mother turn away from her and the little brother whom she had loved would he reject her and what voice of doom might strike her into everlasting hopelessness  but be the sin what it might yet would she sin it for the sake of geoffrey ay even if she must reap a harvest of eternal woe she bent her head and prayed oh power that art above from whom i come to whom i go have mercy on me oh spirit if indeed thy name is love weigh my love in thy balance and let it lift the scale of sin oh god of sacrifice be not wroth at my deed of sacrifice and give me pardon give me life and peace that in a time to come i may win the sight of him for whom i die  a somewhat heathenish prayer indeed and far too full of human passion for one about to leave the human shores but thenwell it was beatrice who prayedbeatrice who could realise no heaven beyond the limits of her passion who still thought more of her love than of saving her own soul alive perhaps it found a homeperhaps like her who prayed it it was lost upon the pitiless deep  then beatrice prayed no more short was her time see there sank the sun in glory and there the great rollers swept along past the sullen headland where the undertow met wind and tide she would think no more of self it was it seemed to her so small this mendicant calling on the unseen not for others but for self aid for self wellbeing for self salvation for selfthis doing of good that good might come to self she had made her prayer and if she prayed again it should be for geoffrey that he might prosper and be happythat he might forgive the trouble her love had brought into his life that he might forget her she could not pray she had prayed her prayer and said her say and it was done with let her be judged as it seemed good to those who judge now she would fix her thoughts upon her love and by its strength would she triumph over the bitterness of death her eyes flashed and her breast heaved further out to sea further yetshe would meet those rollers a knot or more from the point of the headland that no record might remain  was it her wrong if she loved him she could not help it and she was proud to love him even now she would not undo the past what were the lines that geoffrey had read to her they haunted her mind with a strange persistencethey took time to the beat of her falling paddle and would not leave her       of once sown seed who knoweth what the crop is      alas my love loves eyes are very blind      what would they have us do sunflowers and poppies      stoop to the wind        oliver madox brown  yes yes loves eyes are very blind but in their blindness there was more light than in all other earthly things oh she could not live for him and with himit was denied to herbut she still could die for him her darling her darling    geoffrey hear mei die for you accept my sacrifice and forget me not soshe is in the rollershow solemn they are with their hoary heads of foam as one by one they move down upon her  the first it towers high but the canoe rides it like a cork look the day is dying on the distant land but still his glory shines across the sea presently all will be finished here the breeze is strong it tears the bonnet from her head it unwinds the coronet of braided locks and her bright hair streams out behind her feel how the spray stings striking like a whip no not this wave she rides that also she will die as she has livedfighting to the last and once more never faltering she sets her face towards the rollers and consigns her soul to doom  ah that struck her full oh see geoffreys ring has slipped from her wet hand falling into the bottom of the boat can she regain it she would die with that ring upon her fingerit is her marriagering wedding her through death to geoffrey upon the altar of the sea she stoops oh what a shock of water at her breast what was itwhat was itof once sown seed who knoweth what the crop is she must soon learn now  geoffrey hear me geoffreyi die i die for you i will wait for you at the foundations of the sea on the topmost heights of heaven in the lowest deeps of hellwherever i am i will always wait for you  it sinksit has sunkshe is alone with god and the cruel waters the sun goes out look on that great white wave seething through the deepening gloom hear it rushing towards her big with fate  geoffrey my darlingi will wait    farewell to beatrice the light went out of the sky and darkness gathered on the weltering sea farewell to beatrice and all her love and all her sin    chapter xxix  a womans last word  geoffrey came down to breakfast about eleven oclock on the morning of that day the first hours of which he had spent at euston station not seeing effie he asked lady honoria where she was and was informed that anne the french bonne said the child was not well and that she had kept her in bed to breakfast  do you mean to say that you have not been up to see what is the matter with her asked geoffrey  no not yet answered his wife i have had the dressmaker here with my new dress for the duchesss ball tomorrow its lovely but i think that there is a little too much of that creamy lace about it  with an exclamation of impatience geoffrey rose and went upstairs he found effie tossing about in bed her face flushed her eyes wide open and her little hands quite hot  send for the doctor at once he said  the doctor came and examined the child asking her if she had wet her feet lately  yes i did two days ago i wet my feet in a puddle in the street she answered but anne did say that they would soon get dry if i held them to the fire because my other boots was not clean oh my head does ache daddie  ah said the doctor and then covering the child up took geoffrey aside and told him that his daughter had a mild attack of inflammation of the lungs there was no cause for anxiety only she must be looked after and guarded from chills  geoffrey asked if he should send for a trained nurse  oh no said the doctor i do not think it is necessary at any rate at present i will tell the nurse what to do and doubtless your wife will keep an eye on her  so anne was called up and vowed that she would guard the cherished child like the apple of her eye indeed no the boots were not wetthere was a little a very little mud on them that was all  well dont talk so much but see that you attend to her properly said geoffrey feeling rather doubtful for he did not trust anne however he thought he would see himself that there was no neglect when she heard what was the matter lady honoria was much put out  really she said children are the most vexatious creatures in the world the idea of her getting inflammation of the lungs in this unprovoked fashion the end of it will be that i shall not be able to go to the duchesss ball tomorrow night and she was so kind about it she made quite a point of my coming besides i have bought that lovely new dress on purpose i should never have dreamed of going to so much expense for anything else  dont trouble yourself said geoffrey the house does not sit tomorrow i will look after her unless effie dies in the interval you will certainly be able to go to the ball  dieswhat nonsense the doctor says that it is a very slight attack why should she die  i am sure i hope that there is no fear of anything of the sort honoria only she must be properly looked after i do not trust this woman anne i have half a mind to get in a trained nurse after all  well if you do she will have to sleep out of the house thats all amelia lady garsington is coming up tonight and i must have somewhere to put her maid and there is no room for another bed in effies room  oh very well very well said geoffrey i daresay that it will be all right but if effie gets any worse you will please understand that room must be made  but effie did not get worse she remained much about the same geoffrey sat at home all day and employed himself in reading briefs fortunately he had not to go to court about six oclock he went down to the house and having dined very simply and quietly took his seat and listened to some dreary talk which was being carried on for the benefit of the reporters about the adoption of the welsh language in the law courts of wales  suddenly he became aware of a most extraordinary sense of oppression an indefinite dread took hold of him his very soul was filled with terrible apprehensions and alarm something dreadful seemed to knock at the portals of his sense a horror which he could not grasp his mind was confused but little by little it grew clearer and he began to understand that a danger threatened beatrice that she was in great peril he was sure of it her agonised dying cries reached him where he was though in no form which he could understand once more her thought beat on his thoughtonce more and for the last time her spirit spoke to his  then suddenly a cold wind seemed to breathe upon his face and lift his hair and everything was gone his mind was as it had been again he heard the dreary orator and saw the members slipping away to dinner the conditions that disturbed him had passed things were as they had been nor was this strange for the link was broken beatrice was dead she had passed into the domains of impenetrable silence    geoffrey sat up with a gasp and as he did so a letter was placed in his hand it was addressed in beatrices handwriting and bore the chester postmark a chill fear seized him what did it contain he hurried with it into a private room and opened it it was dated from bryngelly on the previous sunday and had several inclosures  my dearest geoffrey it began i have never before addressed you thus on paper nor should i do so now knowing to what risks such written words might put you were it not that occasions may arise as in this case which seem to justify the risk for when all things are ended between a man and a woman who are to each other what we have been then it is well that the one who goes should speak plainly before speech becomes impossible if only that the one who is left should not misunderstand that which has been done  geoffrey it is probableit is almost certainthat before your eyes read these words i shall be where in the body they can never see me more i write to you from the brink of the grave when you read it it will have closed over me  geoffrey i shall be dead  i received your dear letter it is destroyed now in which you expressed a wish that i should come away with you to some other country and i answered it in eight brief words i dared not trust myself to write more nor had i any time how could you think that i should ever accept such an offer for my own sake when to do so would have been to ruin you but first i will tell you all that has happened here here followed a long and exact description of those events with which we are already acquainted including the denunciation of beatrice by her sister the threats of owen davies as regards geoffrey himself and the measures which she had adopted to gain time  further the letter continued i inclose you your wifes letter to me and here i wish to state that i have not one word to say against lady honoria or her letter i think that she was perfectly justified in writing as she did for after all dear geoffrey you are her husband and in loving each other we have offended against her she tells me truly that it is my duty to make all further communications between us impossible there is only one way to do this and i take it  and now i have spoken enough about myself nor do i wish to enter into details that could only give you pain there will be no scandal dear and if any word should be raised against you after i am gone i have provided an answer in the second letter which i have inclosed you can print it if necessary it will be a sufficient reply to any talk nobody after reading it can believe that you were in any way connected with the accident which will happen dear one word morestill about myself you see do not blame yourself in this matter for you are not to blame of my own free will i do it because in the extremity of the circumstances i think it best that one should go and the other be saved rather than that both should be involved in a common ruin  dear do you remember how in that strange vision of mine i dreamed that you came and touched me on the breast and showed me light so it has come to pass for you have given me lovethat is light and now in death i shall seek for wisdom and this being fulfilled shall not the rest be fulfilled in its season shall i not sit in those cloudy halls till i see you come to seek me the word of wisdom on your lips and since i cannot have you to myself and be all in all to you why i am glad to go for here on the world is neither rest nor happiness as in my dream too often does hope seem to rend her starry robes  i am glad to go from such a world in which but one happy thing has found methe blessing of your love i am worn out with the weariness and struggle and now that i have lost you i long for rest i do not know if i sin in what i do if so may i be forgiven if forgiveness is impossible so be it you will forgive me geoffrey and you will always love me however wicked i may be even if at the last you go where i am not you will remember and love the erring woman to whom being so little you still were all in all we are not married geoffrey according to the customs of the world but two short days hence i shall celebrate a service that is greater and more solemn than any of the earth for death will be the priest and that oath which i shall take will be to all eternity who can prophesy of that whereof man has no sure knowledge yet i do believe that in a time to come we shall look again into each others eyes and kiss each others lips and be one for evermore if this is so it is worth while to have lived and died if not then geoffrey farewell  if i may i will always be near you listen to the night wind and you shall hear my voice look on the stars you will see my eyes and my love shall be as the air you breathe and when at last the end comes remember me for if i live at all i shall be about you then what have i more to say so much my dear that words cannot convey it let it be untold but whenever you hear or read that which is beautiful or tender think this is what beatrice would have said to me and could not  you will be a great man dear the foremost or one of the foremost of your age you have already promised me to persevere to this end i will not ask you to promise afresh do not be content to accept the world as women must great men do not accept the world they reform itand you are of their number and when you are great geoffrey you will use your power not for selfinterest but to large and worthy ends you will always strive to help the poor to break down oppression from those who have to bar it and to advance the honour of your country you will do all this from your own heart and not because i ask it of you but remember that your fame will be my best monumentthough none shall ever know the grave it covers  farewell farewell farewell oh geoffrey my darling to whom i have never been a wife to whom i am more than any wifedo not forget me in the long years which are to come remember me when others forsake you do not forget me when others flatter you and try to win your love for none can be to you what i have beennone can ever love you more than that lost beatrice who writes these heavy words tonight and who will pass away blessing you with her last breath to await you if she may in the land to which your feet also draw daily on  then came a tearstained postscript in pencil dated from paddington station on that very morning  i journeyed to london to see you geoffrey i could not die without looking on your face once more i was in the gallery of the house and heard your great speech your friend found me a place afterwards i touched your coat as you passed by the pillar of the gateway then i ran away because i saw your friend turn and look at me i shall kiss this letterjust here before i close itkiss it there tooit is our last cold embrace before the end i shall put on the ring you gave meon my hand i mean i have always worn it upon my breast when i touched you as you passed through the gateway i thought that i should have broken down and called to youbut i found strength not to do so my heart is breaking and my eyes are blind with tears i can write no more i have no more to say now once again goodbye ave atque valeoh my loveb  the second letter was a dummy that is to say it purported to be such an epistle as any young lady might have written to a gentleman friend it began dear mr bingham and ended yours sincerely beatrice granger was filled with chitchat and expressed hopes that he would be able to come down to bryngelly again later in the summer when they would go canoeing  it was obvious thought beatrice that if geoffrey was accused by owen davies or anybody else of being concerned with her mysterious end the production of such a frank epistle written two days previously would demonstrate the absurdity of the idea poor beatrice she was full of precautions    let him who may imagine the effect produced upon geoffrey by this heartrending and astounding epistle could beatrice have seen his face when he had finished reading it she would never have committed suicide in a minute it became like that of an old man as the whole truth sank into his mind such an agony of horror of remorse of unavailing woe and hopelessness swept across his soul that for a moment he thought his vital forces must give way beneath it and that he should die as indeed in this dark hour he would have rejoiced to do oh how pitiful it washow pitiful and how awful to think of this love so passionately pure wasted on his own unworthiness to think of this divine woman going down to lonely death for hima strong man to picture her crouching behind that gateway pillar and touching him as he passed while he the thrice accursed fool knew nothing till too late to know that he had gone to euston and not to paddington to remember the matchless strength and beauty of the love which he had lost and that face which he should never see again surely his heart would break no man could bear it  and of those cowards who hounded her to death if indeed she was already dead oh he would kill owen daviesyes and elizabeth too were it not that she was a woman and as for honoria he had done with her scandal what did he care for scandal if he had his will there should be a scandal indeed for he would beat this owen davies this reptile who did not hesitate to use a womans terrors to prosper the fulfilling of his lustyes and then drag him to the continent and kill him there only vengeance was left to him  stop he must not give wayperhaps she was not deadperhaps that horrible presage of evil which had struck him like a storm was but a dream could he telegraph no it was too late the office at bryngelly would be closedit was past eight now but he could go there was a train leaving a little after ninehe should be there by halfpast six tomorrow and effie was illwell surely they could look after her for twentyfour hours she was in no danger and he must gohe could not bear this torturing suspense great god how had she done the deed  geoffrey snatched a sheet of paper and tried to write he could not his hand shook so with a groan he rose and going to the refreshment room swallowed two glasses of brandy one after another the spirit took effect on him he could write now rapidly he scribbled on a sheet of paper  i have been called away upon important business and shall probably not be back till thursday morning see that effie is properly attended to if i am not back you must not go to the duchesss ballgeoffrey bingham  then he addressed the letter to lady honoria and dispatched a commissionaire with it this done he called a cab and bade the cabman drive to euston as fast as his horse could go    chapter xxx  ave atque vale  that frightful journeyno nightmare was ever half so awful but it came to an end at lastthere was the bryngelly station geoffrey sprang from the train and gave his ticket to the porter glancing in his face as he did so surely if there had been a tragedy the man would know of it and show signs of halfjoyous emotion as is the fashion of such people when something awful and mysterious has happened to somebody else but he showed no such symptoms and a glimmer of hope found its way into geoffreys tormented breast  he left the station and walked rapidly towards the vicarage those who know what a pitch of horror suspense can reach may imagine his feelings as he did so but it was soon to be put an end to now as he drew near the vicarage gate he met the fat welsh servant girl betty running towards him then hope left geoffrey  the girl recognised him and in her confusion did not seem in the least astonished to see him walking there at a quarter to seven on a summer morning indeed even she vaguely connected geoffrey with beatrice in her mind for she at once said in her thick english  oh sir do you know where miss beatrice is  no he answered catching at a railing for support why do you ask i have not seen her for weeks  then the girl plunged into a long story mr granger and miss granger were away from home and would not be back for another two hours miss beatrice had gone out yesterday afternoon and had not come back to tea she betty had not thought much of it believing that she had stopped to spend the evening somewhere and being very tired had gone to bed about eight leaving the door unlocked this morning when she woke it was to find that miss beatrice had not slept in the house that night and she came out to see if she could find her  where was she going when she went out geoffrey asked  she did not know but she thought that miss beatrice was going out in the canoe leastways she had put on her tennis shoes which she always wore when she went out boating  geoffrey understood it all now come to the boathouse he said  they went down to the beach where as yet none were about except a few working people near the boathouse geoffrey met old edward walking along with a key in his hand  lord sir he said you here sir and in that there queer hat too what is it sir  did miss beatrice go out in her canoe yesterday evening edward geoffrey asked hoarsely  no sir not as i know on my boy locked up the boathouse last night and i suppose he looked in it first what you dont mean to saystop well soon know oh goad the canoes gone  there was a silence an awful silence old edward broke it  shes drowned sirthats what she isdrowned at last and she the finest woman in wales i knewed she would be one day poor dear and she the beauty that she was and all along of that damned unlucky little craft goad help her shes drowned i say  betty burst out into loud weeping at his words  stop that noise girl said geoffrey turning his pale face towards her go back to the vicarage and if mr granger comes home before i get back tell him what we fear edward send some men to search the shore towards coed and some more in a sailing boat i will walk towards the bell rockyou can follow me  he started and swiftly tramped along the sands searching the sea with his eye on he walked sullenly desperately striving to hope against hope on past the dog rocks round the long curve of beach till he came to the amphitheatre the tide was high again he could barely pass the projecting point he was round it and his heart stood still for there bottom upwards and gently swaying to and fro as the spent waves rocked it was beatrices canoe  sadly hopelessly heavily geoffrey waded knee deep into the water and catching the bow of the canoe dragged it ashore there was or appeared to be nothing in it of course he could not expect anything else its occupant had sunk and been carried out to sea by the ebb whereas the canoe had drifted back to shore with the morning tide  he reared it upon its end to let the water drain out of it and from the hollow of the bow arch something came rolling down something bright and heavy followed by a brown object hastily he lowered the canoe again and picked up the bright trinket it was his own ring come back to himthe roman ring he had given beatrice and which she told him in the letter she would wear in her hour of death he touched it with his lips and placed it back upon his hand this token from the beloved dead vowing that it should never leave his hand in life and that after death it should be buried on him and so it will be perhaps to be dug up again thousands of years hence and once more to play a part in the romance of unborn ages  ave atque valethat was the inscription rudely cut within its round greeting and farewellher own last words to him oh beatrice beatrice to you also ave atque vale you could not have sent a fitter message greeting and farewell did it not sum it all within the circle of this little ring was writ the epitome of human life here were the beginning and the end of love and hate of hope and fear of joy and sorrow  beatrice hail beatrice farewell till perchance a spirit rushing earthward shall cry greeting in another tongue and death descending to his own place shaking from his wings the dew of tears shall answer farewell to me and night ye children of eternal day  and what was this other relic he lifted itit was beatrices tennis shoe washed from her footgeoffrey knew it for once he had tied it  then geoffrey broke downit was too much he threw himself upon the great rock and sobbedthat rock where he had sat with her and heaven had opened to their sight but men are not given to such exhibitions of emotion and fortunately for him the paroxysm did not last he could not have borne it for long  he rose and went again to the edge of the sea at this moment old edward and his son arrived geoffrey pointed to the boat then held up the little shoe  ah said the old man as i thought goad help her shes gone shell never come ashore no more she wont shes twenty miles away by now she is breast up with the gulls ascreaming over her its that there damned canoe thats what it is i wish to goad i had broke it up long ago id rather have built her a boat for nothing i would damn the unlucky craft screamed the old man at the top of his voice and turning his head to hide the tears that were streaming down his rugged face and her that i nursed and pulled out of the waters once all but dead damn it i say there take that you sea witch you and he picked up a great boulder and crashed it through the bottom of the canoe with all his strength you shant never drown no more but it has brought you good luck it has sir youll be a fortunit man all your life now it has brought you the drowned ones shoe  dont break it any more said geoffrey she used to value it you had better bring it along between youit may be wanted i am going to the vicarage  he walked back mr granger and elizabeth had not yet arrived but they were expected every minute he went into the sittingroom it was full of memories and tokens of beatrice there lay a novel which he had given her and there was yesterdays paper that she had brought from town the standard with his speech in it  geoffrey covered his eyes with his hand and thought none knew that she had committed suicide except himself if he revealed it things might be said of her he did not care what was said of him but he was jealous of her dead name it might be said for instance that the whole tale was true and that beatrice died because she could no longer face life without being put to an open shame yes he had better hold his tongue as to how and why she died she was deadnothing could bring her back but how then should he account for his presence there easily enough he would say frankly that he came because beatrice had written to him of the charges made against her and the threats against himselfcame to find her dead and on that point he would still have a word with owen davies and elizabeth  scarcely had he made up his mind when elizabeth and her father entered clearly from their faces they had as yet heard nothing  geoffrey rose and elizabeth caught sight of him standing with glowing eyes and a face like that of death himself she recoiled in alarm  what brings you here mr bingham she said in her hard voice  cannot you guess miss granger he said sternly a few days back you made certain charges against your sister and myself in the presence of your father and mr owen davies these charges have been communicated to me and i have come to answer them and to demand satisfaction for them  mr granger fidgeted nervously and looked as though he would like to escape but elizabeth with characteristic courage shut the door and faced the storm  yes i did make those charges mr bingham she said and they are true charges but stop we had better send for beatrice first  you may send but you will not find her  what do you meanwhat do you mean asked her father apprehensively  it means that he has hidden her away i suppose said elizabeth with a sneer  i mean mr granger that your daughter beatrice is dead  for once startled out of her selfcommand elizabeth gave a little cry while her father staggered back against the wall  dead dead what do you mean how did she die he asked  that is known to god and her alone answered geoffrey she went out last evening in her canoe when i arrived here this morning she was missed for the first time i walked along the beach and found the canoe and this inside of it and he placed the sodden shoe upon the table  there was a silence in the midst of it owen davies burst into the room with wild eyes and dishevelled hair  is it true he cried tell meit cannot be true that beatrice is drowned she cannot have been taken from me just when i was going to marry her say that it is not true  a great fury filled geoffreys heart he walked down the room and shut the door a red light swimming before his eyes then he turned and gripped owen daviess shoulder like a vice  you accursed blackguardyou unmanly cur he said you and that wicked woman and he shook his hand at elizabeth conspired together to bring a slur upon beatrice you did more you threatened to attack me to try and ruin me if she would not give herself up to you you loathsome hypocrite you tortured her and frightened her now i am here to frighten you you said that you would make the country ring with your tales i tell you thisare you listening to me if you dare to mention her name in such a sense or if that woman dares i will break every bone in your wretched bodyby heaven i will kill you and he cast davies from him and as he did so struck him heavily across the face with the back of his hand  the man took no notice either of his words or of the deadly insult of the blow  is it true he screamed is it true that she is dead  yes said geoffrey following him and bending his tall square frame over him for davies had fallen against the wall yes it is trueshe is deadand beyond your reach for ever pray to god that you may not one day be called her murderers all of youyou shameless cowards  owen davies gave one shrill cry and sank in a huddled heap upon the ground  there is no god he moaned god promised her to me to be my ownyou have killed her youyou seduced her first and then you killed her i believe you killed her oh i shall go mad  mad or sane said geoffrey say those words once more and i will stamp the life out of you where you are you say that god promised her to youpromised that woman to a hound like you ah be careful  owen davies made no answer crouched there upon the ground he rocked himself to and fro and moaned in the madness of his baulked desire  this man said geoffrey turning towards and pointing to elizabeth who was glaring at him like a wild cat from the corner of the room said that there is no god i say that there is a god and that one day soon or late vengeance will find you outyou murderess you writer of anonymous letters you who to advance your own wicked ends whatever they may be were not ashamed to try to drag your innocent sisters name into the dirt i never believed in a hell till now but there must be a hell for such as you elizabeth granger go your ways live out your time but live every hour of it in terror of the vengeance that shall come so surely as you shall die  now for you sir he went on addressing the trembling father i do not blame you so much because i believe that this viper poisoned your mind you might have thought that the tale was true it is not true it was a lie beatrice who now is dead came into my room in her sleep and was carried from it as she came and you her father allowed this villain and your daughter to use her distress against her you allowed him to make a lever of it with which to force her into a marriage that she loathed yes cover up your faceyou may well do so do your worst one and all of you but remember that this time you have to deal with a man who can and will strike back not a poor friendless girl  before heaven it was not my fault mr bingham gasped the old man i am innocent of it that judaswoman elizabeth betrayed her sister because she wanted to marry him herself and he pointed to the heap upon the floor she thought that it would prejudice him against beatrice and hehe believed that she was attached to you and tried to work upon her attachment  so said geoffrey now we have it all and you sir stood by and saw this done you stood by thinking that you would make a profit of her agony now i will tell you what i meant to hide from you i did love her i do love heras she loved me i believe that between you you drove her to her grave her blood be on your heads for ever and for ever  oh take me home groaned the heap upon the floortake me home elizabeth i darent go alone beatrice will haunt me my brain goes round and round take me away elizabeth and stop with me you are not afraid of her you are afraid of nothing  elizabeth sidled up to him keeping her fierce eyes on geoffrey all the time she was utterly cowed and terrified but she could still look fierce she took the heap by the hand and drew him thence still moaning and quite crazed she led him away to his castle and his wealth six months afterwards she came forth with him to marry him halfwitted as he was a year and eight months afterwards she came out again to bury him and found herself the richest widow in wales    they went forth leaving geoffrey and mr granger alone the old man rested his head upon the table and wept bitterly  be merciful he said do not say such words to me i loved her indeed i did but elizabeth was too much for me and i am so poor oh if you loved her also be merciful i do not reproach you because you loved her although you had no right to love her if you had not loved her and made her love you all this would never have happened why do you say such dreadful things to me mr bingham  i loved her sir answered geoffrey humbly enough now that his fury had passed because being what she was all who looked on her must love her there is no woman left like her in the world but who am i that i should blame you god forgive us all i only live henceforth in the hope that i may one day rejoin her where she has gone  there was a pause  mr granger said geoffrey presently never trouble yourself about money you were her father anything you want and what i have is yours let us shake hands and say goodbye and let us never meet again as i said god forgive us all  thank youthank you said the old man looking up through the white hair that fell about his eyes it is a strange world and we are all miserable sinners i hope there is a better somewhere im wellnigh tired of this especially now that beatrice has gone poor girl she was a good daughter and a fine woman goodbye goodbye  then geoffrey went    chapter xxxi  the duchesss ball  geoffrey reached town a little before eleven oclock that nighta haunted manhaunted for life by a vision of that face still lovely in death floating alone upon the deep and companioned only by the screaming mewsor perchance now sinking or sunk to an unfathomable grave well might such a vision haunt a man the man whom alone of all men those cold lips had kissed and for whose dear sake this dreadful thing was done  he took a cab directing the driver to go to bolton street and to stop at his club as he passed there might be letters for him there he thoughtsomething which would distract his mind a little as it chanced there was a letter marked private and a telegram both had been delivered that evening the porter said the former about an hour ago by hand  idly he opened the telegramit was from his lawyers your cousin the child george bingham is as we have just heard dead please call on us early tomorrow morning  he started a little for this meant a good deal to geoffrey it meant a baronetcy and eight thousand a year more or less how delighted honoria would be he thought with a sad smile the loss of that large income had always been a bitter pill to her and one which she had made him swallow again and again well there it was poor boy he had always been ailingan old mans child  he put the telegram in his pocket and got into the hansom again there was a lamp in it and by its light he read the letter it was from the prime minister and ran thus  my dear binghami have not seen you since monday to thank you for the magnificent speech you made on that night allow me to add my congratulations to those of everybody else as you know the under secretaryship of the home office is vacant on behalf of my colleagues and myself i write to ask if you will consent to fill it for a time for we do not in any way consider that the post is one commensurate with your abilities it will however serve to give you practical experience of administration and us the advantage of your great talents to an even larger extent than we now enjoy for the future it must of course take care of itself but as you know sir s health is not all that could be desired and the other day he told me that it was doubtful if he would be able to carry on the duties of the attorneygeneralship for very much longer in view of this contingency i venture to suggest that you would do well to apply for silk as soon as possible i have spoken to the lord chancellor about it and he says that there will be no difficulty as although you have only been in active practice for so short a while you have a good many years standing as a barrister or if this prospect does not please doubtless some other opening to the cabinet can be found in time the fact is that we cannot in our own interest overlook you for long  geoffrey smiled again as he finished this letter who could have believed a year ago that he would have been today in a position to receive such an epistle from the prime minister of england ah here was the luck of the drowned ones shoe with a vengeance and what was it all worth to him now  he put the letter in his pocket with the telegram and looked out they were turning into bolton street how was little effie he wondered the child seemed all that was left him to care for if anything happened to herbah he would not think of it  he was there now how is miss effie he asked of the servant who opened the door at that moment his attention was attracted by the dim forms of two people a man and a woman who were standing not far from the area gate the man with his arm round the womans waist suddenly the woman appeared to catch sight of the cab and retired swiftly down the area it crossed his mind that her figure was very like that of anne the french nurse  miss effie is doing nicely sir im told answered the man  geoffrey breathed more freely where is her ladyship he asked in effies room  no sir answered the man her ladyship has gone to a ball she left this note for you in case you should come in  he took the note from the hall table and opened it  dear geoffrey it ran effie is so much better that i have made up my mind to go to the duchesss ball after all she would be so disappointed if i did not come and my dress is quite lovely had your mysterious business anything to do with bryngelly  yours honoria  she would go on to a ball from her mothers funeral said geoffrey to himself as he walked up to effies room well it is her nature and theres an end of it  he knocked at the door of effies room there was no answer so he walked in the room was lit but emptyno not quite on the floor clothed only in her white nightshirt lay his little daughter to all appearance dead  with something like an oath he sprang to her and lifted her the face was pale and the small hands were cold but the breast was still hot and fevered and the heart beat a glance showed him what had happened the child being left alone and feeling thirsty had got out of bed and gone to the water bottlethere was the tumbler on the floor then weakness had overcome her and she had faintedfainted upon the cold floor with the inflammation still on her  at that moment anne entered the room sweetly murmuring √áa va bien ch√©rie  help me to put the child into bed said geoffrey sternly now ring the bellring it again  and now womango leave this house at once this very night do you hear me no dont stop to argue look here if that child dies i will prosecute you for manslaughter yes i saw you in the street and he took a step towards her then anne fled and her face was seen no more in bolton street or indeed in this country  james said geoffrey to the servant send the cook up hereshe is a sensible woman and do you take a hansom and drive to the doctor and tell him to come here at once and if you cannot find him go for another doctor then go to the nurses home near st james station and get a trained nursetell them one must be had from somewhere instantly  yes sir and shall i call for her ladyship at the duchesss sir  no he answered frowning heavily do not disturb her ladyship go now  that settles it said geoffrey as the man went whatever happens honoria and i must part i have done with her  he had indeed though not in the way he meant it would have been well for honoria if her husbands contempt had not prevented him from summoning her from her pleasure  the cook came up and between them they brought the child back to life  she opened her eyes and smiled is that you daddy she whispered or do i dreams  yes dear it is i  where has you been daddyto see auntie beatrice  yes love he said with a gasp  oh daddy my head do feel funny but i dont mind now you is come back you wont go away no more will you daddy  no dear no more  after that she began to wander a little and finally dropped into a troubled sleep  within half an hour both the doctor and the nurse arrived the former listened to geoffreys tale and examined the child  she may pull through it he said she has got a capital constitution but ill tell you what it isif she had lain another five minutes in that draught there would have been an end of her you came in the nick of time and now if i were you i should go to bed you can do no good here and you look dreadfully ill yourself  but geoffrey shook his head he said he would go downstairs and smoke a pipe he did not want to go to bed at present he was too tired    meanwhile the ball went merrily lady honoria never enjoyed herself more in her life she revelled in the luxurious gaiety around her like a butterfly in the sunshine how good it all wasthe flash of diamonds the odour of costly flowers the homage of wellbred men the envy of other women oh it was a delightful world after allthat is when one did not have to exist in a flat near the edgware road but heaven be praised thanks to geoffreys talents there was an end of flats and misery after all he was not a bad sort of husband though in many ways a perfect mystery to her as for his little weakness for the welsh girl really provided that there was no scandal she did not care twopence about it  yes i am so glad you admire it i think it is rather a nice dress but then i always say that nobody in london can make a dress like madame jules oh no geoffrey did not choose it he thinks of other things  well im sure you ought to be proud of him lady honoria said the handsome guardsman to whom she was talking they say at mess that he is one of the cleverest men in england i only wish i had a fiftieth part of his brains  oh please do not become clever lord atleigh please dont or i shall really give you up cleverness is all very well but it isnt everything you know yes i will dance if you like but you must go slowly to be quite honest i am afraid of tearing my lace in this crush why i declare there is garsington my brother you know and she pointed to a small redhaired man who was elbowing his way towards them i wonder what he wants it is not at all in his line to come to balls you know him dont you he is always racing horses like you  but the guardsman had vanished for reasons of his own he did not wish to meet garsington perhaps he too had been a member of a certain club  oh there you are honoria said her brother i thought that i should be sure to find you somewhere in this beastly squash look here i have something to tell you  good news or bad said lady honoria playing with her fan if it is bad keep it for i am enjoying myself very much and i dont want my evening spoilt  trust you for that honoria but look here its jolly good about as good as can be for that prig of a husband of yours what do you think that brat of a boy the son of old sir robert bingham and the cook or some one you know is  not dead not dead said honoria in deep agitation  dead as ditchwater replied his lordship i heard it at the club there was a lawyer fellow there dining with somebody there and they got talking about bingham when the lawyer said oh hes sir geoffrey bingham now old sir roberts heir is dead i saw the telegram myself  oh this is almost too good to be true said honoria why it means eight thousand a year to us  i told you it was pretty good said her brother you ought to stand me a commission out of the swag at any rate lets go and drink to the news come on it is time for supper and i am awfully done i must screw myself up  lady honoria took his arm as they walked down the wide flowerhung stair they met a very great person indeed coming up  ah lady honoria said the great person i have something to say that will please you i think and he bent towards her and spoke very low then with a little bow passed on  what is the old boy talking about asked her brother  why what do you think we are in lucks way tonight he says that they are offering geoffrey the under secretaryship of the home office  hell be a bigger prig than ever now growled lord garsington yes it is luck though let us hope it wont turn  they sat down to supper and lord garsington who had already been dining helped himself pretty freely to champagne before them was a silver candelabra and on each of the candles was fixed a little painted paper shade one of them got wrong and a footman tried to reach over lord garsingtons head to put it straight  ill do it said he  no no let the man said lady honoria look it is going to catch fire  nonsense he answered rising solemnly and reaching his arm towards the shade as he touched it it caught fire indeed by touching it he caused it to catch fire he seized hold of it and made an effort to put it out but it burnt his fingers  curse the thing he said aloud and threw it from him it fell flaming in his sisters dress among the thickest of the filmy laces they caught and instantly two wreathing snakes of fire shot up her she sprang from her seat and rushed screaming down the room an awful mass of flame    in ten more minutes lady honoria had left this world and its pleasures to those who still lived to taste them    an hour passed geoffrey still sat brooding heavily over his pipe in the study in bolton street and waiting for honoria when a knock came to his door the servants had all gone to bed all except the sick nurse he rose and opened it himself a little redhaired palefaced man staggered in  why garsington is it you what do you want at this hour  screw yourself up bingham ive something to tell you he answered in a thick voice  what is it another disaster i suppose is somebody else dead  yes somebody is honorias dead burnt to death at the ball  great god honoria burnt to death i had better go  i advise you not bingham i wouldnt go to the hospital if i were you screw yourself up and if you can give me something to drinkim about donei must screw myself up    and here we may leave this most fortunate and gifted man farewell to geoffrey bingham    envol  thus then did these human atoms work out their destinies these little grains of animated dust blown hither and thither by a breath which came they knew not whence  if there be any malicious principle among the powers around us that deigns to find amusement in the futile vagaries of man well might it laugh and laugh again at the great results of all this scheming of all these desires loves and hates and if there be any pitiful principle well might it sigh over the infinite pathos of human helplessness owen davies lost in his own passion geoffrey crowned with prosperity and haunted by undying sorrow honoria perishing wretchedly in her hour of satisfied ambition beatrice sacrificing herself in love and blindness and thereby casting out her joy  oh if she had been content to humbly trust in the providence above her if she had but left that deed undared for one short week  but geoffrey still lived and the child recovered after hanging for a while between life and death and was left to comfort him may she survive to be a happy wife and mother living under conditions more favourable to her wellbeing than those which trampled out the life of that mistaken woman the illstarred greatsouled beatrice and broke her fathers heart    saywhat are we we are but arrows winged with fears and shot from darkness into darkness we are blind leaders of the blind aimless beaters of this wintry air lost travellers by many stony paths ending in one end tell us you who have outworn the common tragedy and passed the narrow way what lies beyond its gate you are dumb or we cannot hear you speak    but beatrice knows today
