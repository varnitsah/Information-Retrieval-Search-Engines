               by                        nathaniel hawthorne    the greatest attraction in this vicinity is the famous old fortress of ticonderoga the remains of which are visible from the piazza of the tavern on a swell of land that shuts in the prospect of the lake  those celebrated heights mount defiance and mount independence familiar to all americans in history stand too prominent not to be recognized though neither of them precisely corresponds to the images excited by their names  in truth the whole scene except the interior of the fortress disappointed me  mount defiance which one pictures as a steep lofty and rugged hill of most formidable aspect frowning down with the grim visage of a precipice on old ticonderoga is merely a long and wooded ridge and bore at some former period the gentle name of sugar hill  the brow is certainly difficult to climb and high enough to look into every corner of the fortress  st clairs most probable reason however for neglecting to occupy it was the deficiency of troops to man the works already constructed rather than the supposed inaccessibility of mount defiance  it is singular that the french never fortified this height standing as it does in the quarter whence they must have looked for the advance of a british army  in my first view of the ruins i was favored with the scientific guidance of a young lieutenant of engineers recently from west point where he had gained credit for great military genius  i saw nothing but confusion in what chiefly interested him straight lines and zigzags defence within defence wall opposed to wall and ditch intersecting ditch oblong squares of masonry below the surface of the earth and huge mounds or turfcovered hills of stone above it  on one of these artificial hillocks a pinetree has rooted itself and grown tall and strong since the bannerstaff was levelled  but where my unmilitary glance could trace no regularity the young lieutenant was perfectly at home  he fathomed the meaning of every ditch and formed an entire plan of the fortress from its halfobliterated lines  his description of ticonderoga would be as accurate as a geometrical theorem and as barren of the poetry that has clustered round its decay  i viewed ticonderoga as a place of ancient strength in ruins for half a century where the flags of three nations had successively waved and none waved now where armies had struggled so long ago that the bones of the slain were mouldered where peace had found a heritage in the forsaken haunts of war  now the young westpointer with his lectures on ravelins counterscarps angles and covered ways made it an affair of brick and mortar and hewn stone arranged on certain regular principles having a good deal to do with mathematics but nothing at all with poetry  i should have been glad of a hoary veteran to totter by my side and tell me perhaps of the french garrisons and their indian alliesof abercrombie lord howe and amherstof ethan allens triumph and st clairs surrender  the old soldier and the old fortress would be emblems of each other  his reminiscences though vivid as the image of ticonderoga in the lake would harmonize with the gray influence of the scene  a survivor of the longdisbanded garrisons though but a private soldier might have mustered his dead chiefs and comradessome from westminster abbey and english churchyards and battlefields in europeothers from their graves here in americaothers not a few who lie sleeping round the fortress he might have mustered them all and bid them march through the ruined gateway turning their old historic faces on me as they passed  next to such a companion the best is ones own fancy  at another visit i was alone and after rambling all over the ramparts sat down to rest myself in one of the roofless barracks  these are old french structures and appear to have occupied three sides of a large area now overgrown with grass nettles and thistles  the one in which i sat was long and narrow as all the rest had been with peaked gables the exterior walls were nearly entire constructed of gray flat unpicked stones the aged strength of which promised long to resist the elements if no other violence should precipitate their fallthe roof floors partitions and the rest of the woodwork had probably been burnt except some bars of stanch old oak which were blackened with fire but still remained imbedded into the windowsills and over the doors  there were a few particles of plastering near the chimney scratched with rude figures perhaps by a soldiers hand  a most luxuriant crop of weeds had sprung up within the edifice and hid the scattered fragments of the wall  grass and weeds grew in the windows and in all the crevices of the stone climbing step by step till a tuft of yellow flowers was waving on the highest peak of the gable  some spicy herb diffused a pleasant odor through the ruin  a verdant heap of vegetation had covered the hearth of the second floor clustering on the very spot where the huge logs had mouldered to glowing coals and flourished beneath the broad flue which had so often puffed the smoke over a circle of french or english soldiers  i felt that there was no other token of decay so impressive as that bed of weeds in the place of the backlog  here i sat with those roofless walls about me the clear sky over my head and the afternoon sunshine falling gently bright through the windowframes and doorway  i heard the tinkling of a cowbell the twittering of birds and the pleasant hum of insects  once a gay butterfly with four goldspeckled wings came and fluttered about my head then flew up and lighted on the highest tuft of yellow flowers and at last took wing across the lake  next a bee buzzed through the sunshine and found much sweetness among the weeds  after watching him till he went off to his distant hive i closed my eyes on ticonderoga in ruins and cast a dreamlike glance over pictures of the past and scenes of which this spot had been the theatre  at first my fancy saw only the stern hills lonely lakes and venerable woods  not a tree since their seeds were first scattered over the infant soil had felt the axe but had grown up and flourished through its long generation had fallen beneath the weight of years been buried in green moss and nourished the roots of others as gigantic  hark  a light paddle dips into the lake a birch canoe glides round the point and an indian chief has passed painted and feathercrested armed with a bow of hickory a stone tomahawk and flintheaded arrows  but the ripple had hardly vanished from the water when a white flag caught the breeze over a castle in the wilderness with frowning ramparts and a hundred cannon  there stood a french chevalier commandant of the fortress paying court to a coppercolored lady the princess of the land and winning her wild love by the arts which had been successful with parisian dames  a warparty of french and indians were issuing from the gate to lay waste some village of new england  near the fortress there was a group of dancers  the merry soldiers footing it with the swart savage maids deeper in the wood some red men were growing frantic around a keg of the firewater and elsewhere a jesuit preached the faith of high cathedrals beneath a canopy of forest boughs and distributed crucifixes to be worn beside english scalps  i tried to make a series of pictures from the old french war when fleets were on the lake and armies in the woods and especially of abercrombies disastrous repulse where thousands of lives were utterly thrown away but being at a loss how to order the battle i chose an evening scene in the barracks after the fortress had surrendered to sir jeffrey amherst what an immense fire blazes on that hearth gleaming on swords bayonets and musketbarrels and blending with the hue of the scarlet coats till the whole barrackroom is quivering with ruddy light  one soldier has thrown himself down to rest after a deerhunt or perhaps a long run through the woods with indians on his trail  two stand up to wrestle and are on the point of coming to blows  a fifer plays a shrill accompaniment to a drummers songa strain of light love and bloody war with a chorus thundered forth by twenty voices  meantime a veteran in the corner is prosing about dettingen and fontenoy and relates camptraditions of marlboroughs battles till his pipe having been roguishly charged with gunpowder makes a terrible explosion under his nose  and now they all vanish in a puff of smoke from the chimney  i merely glanced at the ensuing twenty years which glided peacefully over the frontier fortress till ethan allens shout was heard summoning it to surrender in the name of the great jehovah and of the continental congress  strange allies thought the british captain  next came the hurried muster of the soldiers of liberty when the cannon of burgoyne pointing down upon their stronghold from the brow of mount defiance announced a new conqueror of ticonderoga  no virgin fortress this forth rushed the motley throng from the barracks one man wearing the blue and buff of the union another the red coat of britain a third a dragoons jacket and a fourth a cotton frock here was a pair of leather breeches and striped trousers there a grenadiers cap on one head and a broadbrimmed hat with a tall feather on the next this fellow shouldering a kings arm that might throw a bullet to crown point and his comrade a long fowlingpiece admirable to shoot ducks on the lake in the midst of the bustle when the fortress was all alive with its last warlike scene the ringing of a bell on the lake made me suddenly unclose my eyes and behold only the gray and weedgrown ruins  they were as peaceful in the sun as a warriors grave  hastening to the rampart i perceived that the signal had been given by the steamboat franklin which landed a passenger from whitehall at the tavern and resumed its progress northward to reach canada the next morning  a sloop was pursuing the same track a little skiff had just crossed the ferry while a scow laden with lumber spread its huge square sail and went up the lake  the whole country was a cultivated farm  within musketshot of the ramparts lay the neat villa of mr pell who since the revolution has become proprietor of a spot for which france england and america have so often struggled  how forcibly the lapse of time and change of circumstances came home to my apprehension banner would never wave again nor cannon roar nor blood be shed nor trumpet stir up a soldiers heart in this old fort of ticonderoga  tall trees have grown upon its ramparts since the last garrison marched out to return no more or only at some dreamers summons gliding from the twilight past to vanish among realities
