to his great baptism flocked   with awe the regions round and with them came   from nazareth the son of joseph deemed   to the flood jordancame as then obscure   unmarked unknown  but him the baptist soon   descried divinely warned and witness bore   as to his worthier and would have resigned   to him his heavenly office  nor was long   his witness unconfirmed on him baptized   heaven opened and in likeness of a dove                    30   the spirit descended while the fathers voice   from heaven pronounced him his beloved son   that heard the adversary who roving still   about the world at that assembly famed   would not be last and with the voice divine   nigh thunderstruck the exalted man to whom   such high attest was given a while surveyed   with wonder then with envy fraught and rage   flies to his place nor rests but in mid air   to council summons all his mighty peers                    40   within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved   a gloomy consistory and them amidst

them so   purified to receive him pure or rather   to do him honour as their king  all come   and he himself among them was baptized   not thence to be more pure but to receive   the testimony of heaven that who he is   thenceforth the nations may not doubt  i saw   the prophet do him reverence on him rising                80   out of the water heaven above the clouds   unfold her crystal doors thence on his head   a perfet dove descend whateer it meant   and out of heaven the sovraign voice i heard   this is my son belovedin him am pleased   his mother than is mortal but his sire   he

is we must learn for man he seems   in all his lineaments though in his face   the glimpses of his fathers glory shine   ye see our danger on the utmost edge   of hazard which admits no long debate   but must with something sudden be opposed   not force but wellcouched fraud wellwoven snares   ere in the head of nations he appear   their king their leader and supreme on earth   i when no other

prosperous once   induces best to hope of like success     he ended and his words impression left   of much amazement to the infernal crew   distracted and surprised with deep dismay   at these sad tidings  but no time was then   for long indulgence to their fears or grief                110   unanimous they all commit the care   and management of this man enterprise   to him their great dictator whose attempt   at first against mankind so well had thrived   in adams overthrow and led their march   from hells deepvaulted den to dwell in light   regents and potentates and kings yea gods   of many a pleasant realm and province wide   so to the coast of jordan he directs   his easy steps girded with snaky wiles                    120   where he might likeliest find this newdeclared   this man of men attested son of god   temptation and all guile on him to try   so to subvert whom he suspected raised   to end his reign on earth so long enjoyed   but contrary unweeting he fulfilled   the purposed counsel preordained and fixed   of the most high who in full frequence bright   of angels thus to gabriel smiling spake     gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold          130   thou and all angels conversant on earth   with man or mens affairs how i begin   to verify that solemn message late   on which i sent thee to the virgin pure   in galilee that she should bear a son   great in renown and called the son of god   then toldst her doubting how these things could be   to her a virgin that on her should come   the holy ghost and the power of the highest   oershadow her  this man born and now upgrown            140   to shew him worthy of his birth divine   and high prediction henceforth i expose   to satan let him tempt and now assay   his utmost subtlety because he boasts   and vaunts of his great cunning to the throng   of his apostasy  he might have learnt   less overweening since he failed in job   whose constant perseverance overcame   whateer his cruel malice could invent   he now shall know i can produce a man                      150   of female seed far abler to resist   all his solicitations and at length   all his vast force and drive him back to hell   winning by conquest what the first man lost   by fallacy surprised  but first i mean   to exercise him in the wilderness   there he shall first lay down the rudiments   of his great warfare ere i send him forth   to conquer sin and death the two grand foes   by humiliation and strong sufferance                        160   his weakness shall oercome satanic strength   and all the world and mass of sinful flesh   that all the angels and aethereal powers   they now and men hereaftermay discern   from what consummate virtue i have chose   this perfet man by merit called my son   to earn salvation for the sons of men     so spake the eternal father and all heaven   admiring stood a space then into hymns   burst forth and in celestial measures moved               170   circling the throne and singing while the hand   sung with the voice and this the argument     victory and triumph to the son of god   now entering his great duel not of arms   but to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles   the father knows the son therefore secure   ventures his filial virtue though untried   against whateer may tempt whateer seduce   allure or terrify or undermine   be frustrate all ye stratagems of hell                    180   and devilish machinations come to nought     so they in heaven their odes and vigils tuned   meanwhile the son of god who yet some days   lodged in bethabara where john baptized   musing and much revolving in his breast   how best the mighty work he might begin   of saviour to mankind and which way first   publish his godlike office now mature   one day forth walked alone the spirit leading   and his deep thoughts the better to converse               190   with solitude till far from track of men   thought following thought and step by step led on   he entered now the bordering desert wild   and with dark shades and rocks environed round   his holy meditations thus pursued     o what a multitude of thoughts at once   awakened in me swarm while i consider   what from within i feel myself and hear   what from without comes often to my ears   ill sorting with my present state compared                 200   when i was yet a child no childish play   to me was pleasing all my mind was set   serious to learn and know and thence to do   what might be public good myself i thought   born to that end born to promote all truth   all righteous things  therefore above my years   the law of god i read and found it sweet   made it my whole delight and in it grew   to such perfection that ere yet my age   had measured twice six years at our great feast            210   i went into the temple there to hear   the teachers of our law and to propose   what might improve my knowledge or their own   and was admired by all  yet this not all   to which my spirit aspired  victorious deeds   flamed in my heart heroic actsone while   to rescue israel from the roman yoke   then to subdue and quell oer all the earth   brute violence and proud tyrannic power   till truth were freed and equity restored                 220   yet held it more humane more heavenly first   by winning words to conquer willing hearts   and make persuasion do the work of fear   at least to try and teach the erring soul   not wilfully misdoing but unware   misled the stubborn only to subdue   these growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving   by words at times cast forth inly rejoiced   and said to me apart high are thy thoughts   o son but nourish them and let them soar                  230   to what highth sacred virtue and true worth   can raise them though above example high   by matchless deeds express thy matchless sire   for know thou art no son of mortal man   though men esteem thee low of parentage   thy father is the eternal king who rules   all heaven and earth angels and sons of men   a messenger from god foretold thy birth   conceived in me a virgin he foretold   thou shouldst be great and sit on davids throne          240   and of thy kingdom there should be no end   at thy nativity a glorious quire   of angels in the fields of bethlehem sung   to shepherds watching at their folds by night   and told them the messiah now was born   where they might see him and to thee they came   directed to the manger where thou layst   for in the inn was left no better room   a star not seen before in heaven appearing   guided the wise men thither from the east                  250   to honour thee with incense myrrh and gold   by whose bright course led on they found the place   affirming it thy star newgraven in heaven   by which they knew thee king of israel born   just simeon and prophetic anna warned   by vision found thee in the temple and spake   before the altar and the vested priest   like things of thee to all that present stood   this having heart straight i again revolved   the law and prophets searching what was writ               260   concerning the messiah to our scribes   known partly and soon found of whom they spake   i amthis chiefly that my way must lie   through many a hard assay even to the death   ere i the promised kingdom can attain   or work redemption for mankind whose sins   full weight must be transferred upon my head   yet neither thus disheartened or dismayed   the time prefixed i waited when behold   the baptist of whose birth i oft had heard                270   not knew by sight now come who was to come   before messiah and his way prepare   i as all others to his baptism came   which i believed was from above but he   straight knew me and with loudest voice proclaimed   me him for it was shewn him so from heaven   me him whose harbinger he was and first   refused on me his baptism to confer   as much his greater and was hardly won   but as i rose out of the laving stream                    280   heaven opened her eternal doors from whence   the spirit descended on me like a dove   and last the sum of all my fathers voice   audibly heard from heaven pronounced me his   me his beloved son in whom alone   he was well pleased by which i knew the time   now full that i no more should live obscure   but openly begin as best becomes   the authority which i derived from heaven   and now by some strong motion i am led                      290   into this wilderness to what intent   i learn not yet  perhaps i need not know   for what concerns my knowledge god reveals     so spake our morning star then in his rise   and looking round on every side beheld   a pathless desert dusk with horrid shades   the way he came not having marked return   was difficult by human steps untrod   and he still on was led but with such thoughts   accompanied of things past and to come                      300   lodged in his breast as well might recommend   such solitude before choicest society     full forty days he passedwhether on hill   sometimes anon in shady vale each night   under the covert of some ancient oak   or cedar to defend him from the dew   or harboured in one cave is not revealed   nor tasted human food nor hunger felt   till those days ended hungered then at last   among wild beasts  they at his sight grew mild            310   nor sleeping him nor waking harmed his walk   the fiery serpent fled and noxious worm   the lion and fierce tiger glared aloof   but now an aged man in rural weeds   following as seemed the quest of some stray eye   or withered sticks to gather which might serve   against a winters day when winds blow keen   to warm him wet returned from field at eve   he saw approach who first with curious eye   perused him then with words thus uttered spake          320     sir what ill chance hath brought thee to this place   so far from path or road of men who pass   in troop or caravan for single none   durst ever who returned and dropt not here   his carcass pined with hunger and with droughth   i ask the rather and the more admire   for that to me thou seemst the man whom late   our new baptizing prophet at the ford   of jordan honoured so and called thee son   of god  i saw and heard for we sometimes                  330   who dwell this wild constrained by want come forth   to town or village nigh nighest is far   where aught we hear and curious are to hear   what happens new fame also finds us out     to whom the son of godwho brought me hither   will bring me hence no other guide i seek     by miracle he may replied the swain   what other way i see not for we here   live on tough roots and stubs to thirst inured   more than the camel and to drink go far                  340   men to much misery and hardship born   but if thou be the son of god command   that out of these hard stones be made thee bread   so shalt thou save thyself and us relieve   with food whereof we wretched seldom taste     he ended and the son of god replied   thinkst thou such force in bread  is it not written   for i discern thee other than thou seemst   man lives not by bread only but each word   proceeding from the mouth of god who fed                   350   our fathers here with manna  in the mount   moses was forty days nor eat nor drank   and forty days eliah without food   wandered this barren waste the same i now   why dost thou then suggest to me distrust   knowing who i am as i know who thou art     whom thus answered the archfiend now undisguised   tis true i am that spirit unfortunate   who leagued with millions more in rash revolt   kept not my happy station but was driven                   360   with them from bliss to the bottomless deep   yet to that hideous place not so confined   by rigour unconniving but that oft   leaving my dolorous prison i enjoy   large liberty to round this globe of earth   or range in the air nor from the heaven of heavens   hath he excluded my resort sometimes   i came among the sons of god when he   gave up into my hands uzzean job   to prove him and illustrate his high worth                370   and when to all his angels he proposed   to draw the proud king ahab into fraud   that he might fall in ramoth they demurring   i undertook that office and the tongues   of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies   to his destruction as i had in charge   for what he bids i do  though i have lost   much lustre of my native brightness lost   to be beloved of god i have not lost   to love at least contemplate and admire                   380   what i see excellent in good or fair   or virtuous i should so have lost all sense   what can be then less in me than desire   to see thee and approach thee whom i know   declared the son of god to hear attent   thy wisdom and behold thy godlike deeds   men generally think me much a foe   to all mankind  why should i they to me   never did wrong or violence  by them   i lost not what i lost rather by them                      390   i gained what i have gained and with them dwell   copartner in these regions of the world   if not disposerlend them oft my aid   oft my advice by presages and signs   and answers oracles portents and dreams   whereby they may direct their future life   envy they say excites me thus to gain   companions of my misery and woe   at first it may be but long since with woe   nearer acquainted now i feel by proof                      400   that fellowship in pain divides not smart   nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load   small consolation then were man adjoined   this wounds me most what can it less that man   man fallen shall be restored i never more     to whom our saviour sternly thus replied   deservedly thou grievst composed of lies   from the beginning and in lies wilt end   who boastst release from hell and leave to come   into the heaven of heavens  thou comst indeed           410   as a poor miserable captive thrall   comes to the place where he before had sat   among the prime in splendour now deposed   ejected emptied gazed unpitied shunned   a spectacle of ruin or of scorn   to all the host of heaven  the happy place   imparts to thee no happiness no joy   rather inflames thy torment representing   lost bliss to thee no more communicable   so never more in hell than when in heaven                  420   but thou art serviceable to heavens king   wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear   extorts or pleasure to do ill excites   what but thy malice moved thee to misdeem   of righteous job then cruelly to afflict him   with all inflictions but his patience won   the other service was thy chosen task   to be a liar in four hundred mouths   for lying is thy sustenance thy food   yet thou pretendst to truth all oracles                   430   by thee are given and what confessed more true   among the nations  that hath been thy craft   by mixing somewhat true to vent more lies   but what have been thy answers what but dark   ambiguous and with double sense deluding   which they who asked have seldom understood   and not well understood as good not known   who ever by consulting at thy shrine   returned the wiser or the more instruct   to fly or follow what concerned him most                   440   and run not sooner to his fatal snare   for god hath justly given the nations up   to thy delusions justly since they fell   idolatrous  but when his purpose is   among them to declare his providence   to thee not known whence hast thou then thy truth   but from him or his angels president   in every province who themselves disdaining   to approach thy temples give thee in command   what to the smallest tittle thou shalt say                450   to thy adorers  thou with trembling fear   or like a fawning parasite obeyst   then to thyself ascribst the truth foretold   but this thy glory shall be soon retrenched   no more shalt thou by oracling abuse   the gentiles henceforth oracles are ceased   and thou no more with pomp and sacrifice   shalt be enquired at delphos or elsewhere   at least in vain for they shall find thee mute   god hath now sent his living oracle                         460   into the world to teach his final will   and sends his spirit of truth henceforth to dwell   in pious hearts an inward oracle   to all truth requisite for men to know     so spake our saviour but the subtle fiend   though inly stung with anger and disdain   dissembled and this answer smooth returned     sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke   and urged me hard with doings which not will   but misery hath wrested from me  where                    470   easily canst thou find one miserable   and not inforced ofttimes to part from truth   if it may stand him more in stead to lie   say and unsay feign flatter or abjure   but thou art placed above me thou art lord   from thee i can and must submiss endure   cheek or reproof and glad to scape so quit   hard are the ways of truth and rough to walk   smooth on the tongue discoursed pleasing to the ear   and tunable as sylvan pipe or song                         480   what wonder then if i delight to hear   her dictates from thy mouth most men admire   virtue who follow not her lore  permit me   to hear thee when i come since no man comes   and talk at least though i despair to attain   thy father who is holy wise and pure   suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest   to tread his sacred courts and minister   about his altar handling holy things   praying or vowing and voutsafed his voice                  490   to balaam reprobate a prophet yet   inspired disdain not such access to me     to whom our saviour with unaltered brow   thy coming hither though i know thy scope   i bid not or forbid  do as thou findst   permission from above thou canst not more     he added not and satan bowling low   his gray dissimulation disappeared   into thin air diffused for now began   night with her sullen wing to doubleshade                  500   the desert fowls in their clay nests were couched   and now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam     the second book    meanwhile the newbaptized who yet remained   at jordan with the baptist and had seen   him whom they heard so late expressly called   jesus messiah son of god declared   and on that high authority had believed   and with him talked and with him lodgedi mean   andrew and simon famous after known   with others though in holy writ not named   now missing him their joy so lately found   so lately found and so abruptly gone                       10   began to doubt and doubted many days   and as the days increased increased their doubt   sometimes they thought he might be only shewn   and for a time caught up to god as once   moses was in the mount and missing long   and the great thisbite who on fiery wheels   rode up to heaven yet once again to come   therefore as those young prophets then with care   sought lost eliah so in each place these   nigh to bethabarain jericho                               20   the city of palms aenon and salem old   machaerus and each town or city walled   on

call   close in a cottage low together got   their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed     alas from what high hope to what relapse                30   unlooked for are we fallen  our eyes beheld   messiah certainly now come so long   expected of our fathers we have heard   his words his wisdom full of grace and truth   now now for sure deliverance is at hand   the kingdom shall to israel be restored   thus we rejoiced but soon our joy is turned   into perplexity and new amaze   for whither is he gone what accident   hath rapt him from us will he now retire                   40   after appearance and again prolong   our expectation  god of israel   send thy messiah forth the time is come   behold the kings of the earth how they oppress   thy chosen to what highth their power unjust   they have exalted and behind them cast   all fear of thee arise and vindicate   thy glory free thy people from their yoke   but let us wait thus far he hath performed   sent his anointed and to us revealed him                   50   by his great prophet pointed at and shown   in public and with him we have conversed   let us be glad of this and all our fears   lay on his providence he will not fail   nor will withdraw him now nor will recall   mock us with his blest sight then snatch him hence   soon we shall see our hope our joy return     thus they out of their plaints new hope resume   to find whom at the first they found unsought   but to his mother mary when she saw                        60   others returned from baptism not her son   nor left at jordan tidings of him none   within her breast though calm her breast though pure   motherly cares and fears got head and raised   some troubled thoughts which she in sighs thus clad     oh what avails me now that honour high   to have conceived of god or that salute   hail highly favoured among women blest   while i to sorrows am no less advanced   and fears as eminent above the lot                          70   of other

public shewn   son owned from heaven by his fathers voice   i looked for some great change  to honour no   but trouble as old simeon plain foretold   that to the fall and rising he should be   of many in israel and to a sign   spoken againstthat through my very soul                   90   a sword shall pierce  this is my favoured lot   my exaltation to afflictions high   afflicted i may be it seems

not lose himself but went about   his fathers business  what he meant i mused   since understand much more his absence now                 100   thus long to some great purpose he obscures   but i to

 is to be found in the wide wilderness   the rest commit to me i shall let pass   no advantage and his strength as oft assay     he ceased and heard their grant in loud acclaim   then forthwith to him takes a chosen band   of spirits likest to himself in guile   to be at hand and at his beck appear   if cause were to unfold some active scene   of various persons each to know his part                  240   then to the desert takes with these his flight   where still from shade to shade the son of god   after forty days fasting had remained   now hungering first and to himself thus said     where will this end  four times ten days i have passed   wandering this woody maze and human food   nor tasted nor had appetite  that fast   to virtue i impute not or count part   of what i suffer here  if nature need not   or god support nature without repast                       250   though needing what praise is it to endure   but now i feel i hunger which declares   nature hath need of what she asks  yet god   can satisfy that need some other way   though hunger still remain  so it remain   without this bodys wasting i content me   and from the sting of famine fear no harm   nor mind it fed with better thoughts that feed   me hungering more to do my fathers will     it was the hour of night when thus the son               260   communed in silent walk then laid him down   under the hospitable covert nigh   of trees thick interwoven  there he slept   and dreamed as appetite is wont to dream   of meats and drinks natures refreshment sweet   him thought he by the brook of cherith stood   and saw the ravens with their horny beaks   food to elijah bringing even and morn   though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought   he saw the prophet also how he fled                        270   into the desert and how there he slept   under a juniperthen how awaked   he found his supper on the coals prepared   and by the angel was bid rise and eat   and eat the second time after repose   the strength whereof sufficed him forty days   sometimes that with elijah he partook   or as a guest with daniel at his pulse   thus wore out night and now the harald lark   left his groundnest high towering to descry               280   the morns approach and greet her with his song   as lightly from his grassy couch up rose   our saviour and found all was but a dream   fasting he went to sleep and fasting waked   up to a hill anon his steps he reared   from whose high top to ken the prospect round   if cottage were in view sheepcote or herd   but cottage herd or sheepcote none he saw   only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove   with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud               290   thither he bent his way determined there   to rest at noon and entered soon the shade   highroofed and walks beneath and alleys brown   that opened in the midst a woody scene   natures own work it seemed nature taught art   and to a superstitious eye the haunt   of woodgods and woodnymphs  he viewed it round   when suddenly a man before him stood   not rustic as before but seemlier clad   as one in city or court or palace bred                     300   and with fair speech these words to him addressed     with granted leave officious i return   but much more wonder that the son of god   in this wild solitude so long should bide   of all things destitute and well i know   not without hunger  others of some note   as story tells have trod this wilderness   the fugitive bondwoman with her son   outcast nebaioth yet found here relief   by a providing angel all the race                          310   of israel here had famished had not god   rained from heaven manna and that prophet bold   native of thebez wandering here was fed   twice by a voice inviting him to eat   of thee those forty days none hath regard   forty and more deserted here indeed     to whom thus jesuswhat concludst thou hence   they all had need i as thou seest have none     how hast thou hunger then satan replied   tell me if food were now before thee set                 320   wouldst thou not eat  thereafter as i like   the giver answered jesus  why should that   cause thy refusal said the subtle fiend   hast thou not right to all created things   owe not all creatures by just right to thee   duty and service nor to stay till bid   but tender all their power  nor mention i   meats by the law unclean or offered first   to idolsthose young daniel could refuse   nor proffered by an enemythough who                       330   would scruple that with want oppressed  behold   nature ashamed or better to express   troubled that thou shouldst hunger hath purveyed   from all the elements her choicest store   to treat thee as beseems and as her lord   with honour  only deign to sit and eat     he spake no dream for as his words had end   our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld   in ample space under the broadest shade   a table richly spread in regal mode                        340   with dishes piled and meats of noblest sort   and savourbeasts of chase or fowl of game   in pastry built or from the spit or boiled   grisambersteamed all fish from sea or shore   freshet or purling brook of shell or fin   and exquisitest name for which was drained   pontus and lucrine bay and afric coast   alas how simple to these cates compared   was that crude apple that diverted eve   and at a stately sideboard by the wine                    350   that fragrant smell diffused in order stood   tall stripling youths richclad of fairer hue   than ganymed or hylas distant more   under the trees now tripped now solemn stood   nymphs of dianas train and naiades   with fruits and flowers from amaltheas horn   and ladies of the hesperides that seemed   fairer than feigned of old or fabled since   of faery damsels met in forest wide   by knights of logres or of lyones                         360   lancelot or pelleas or pellenore   and all the while harmonious airs were heard   of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds   of gentlest gale arabian odours fanned   from their soft wings and floras earliest smells   such was the splendour and the tempter now   his invitation earnestly renewed     what doubts the son of god to sit and eat   these are not fruits forbidden no interdict   defends the touching of these viands pure                  370   their taste no knowledge works at least of evil   but life preserves destroys lifes enemy   hunger with sweet restorative delight   all these are spirits of air and woods and springs   thy gentle ministers who come to pay   thee homage and acknowledge thee their lord   what doubtst thou son of god  sit down and eat     to whom thus jesus temperately replied   saidst thou not that to all things i had right   and who withholds my power that right to use               380   shall i receive by gift what of my own   when and where likes me best i can command   i can at will doubt not as soon as thou   command a table in this wilderness   and call swift flights of angels ministrant   arrayed in glory on my cup to attend   why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence   in vain where no acceptance it can find   and with my hunger what hast thou to do   thy pompous delicacies i contemn                           390   and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles     to whom thus answered satan malecontent   that i have also power to give thou seest   if of that power i bring thee voluntary   what i might have bestowed on whom i pleased   and rather opportunely in this place   chose to impart to thy apparent need   why shouldst thou not accept it  but i see   what i can do or offer is suspect   of these things others quickly will dispose                400   whose pains have earned the farfet spoil  with that   both table and provision vanished quite   with sound of harpies wings and talons heard   only the importune tempter still remained   and with these words his temptation pursued     by hunger that each other creature tames   thou art not to be harmed therefore not moved   thy temperance invincible besides   for no allurement yields to appetite   and all thy heart is set on high designs                   410   high actions  but wherewith to be achieved   great acts require great means of enterprise   thou art unknown unfriended low of birth   a carpenter thy father known

kings   and what in me seems wanting but that i                     450   may also in this poverty as soon   accomplish what they did perhaps and more   extol not riches then the toil of fools   the wise mans cumbrance if not snare more apt   to slacken virtue and abate her edge   than prompt her to do aught may merit praise   what if with like aversion i reject   riches and realms  yet not for

glory but the blaze of fame   the peoples praise if always praise unmixed   and what the people but a herd confused   a miscellaneous rabble who extol                           50   things vulgar and

glory he exacts             120     to whom our saviour fervently replied   and reason since his word all things produced   though chiefly not for glory as prime end   but to shew forth his goodness and impart   his good communicable to every soul   freely of whom what could he less expect   than glory and benedictionthat is thanks   the slightest easiest readiest recompense   from them who could return him nothing else   and not returning that would likeliest render             130   contempt instead dishonour obloquy   hard recompense unsuitable return   for so much good so much beneficience   but why should man seek glory who of his own   hath nothing and to whom nothing belongs   but condemnation ignominy and shame   who for so many benefits received   turned recreant to god ingrate and false   and so of all true good himself despoiled   yet sacrilegious to himself would take                    140   that which to god alone of right belongs   yet so much bounty is in god such grace   that who advances his glory not their own   them he himself to glory will advance     so spake the son of god and here again   satan had not to answer but stood struck   with guilt of his own sinfor he himself   insatiable of glory had lost all   yet of another plea bethought him soon     of glory as thou wilt said he so deem              150   worth or not worth the seeking let it pass   but to

hither and shew            350   all this fair sight  thy kingdom though foretold   by prophet or by angel unless thou   endeavour as thy father david did   thou never shalt obtain prediction still   in all things and all men supposes means   without means used what it predicts revokes   but say thou wert possessed of davids throne   by free consent of all none opposite   samaritan or jew how couldst thou hope   long to enjoy it quiet and secure                           360   between two such enclosing enemies   roman and parthian  therefore one of these   thou must make sure thy own the

restore   to their inheritance then nor till then   thou on the throne of david in full glory   from egypt to euphrates and beyond   shalt reign and rome or caesar not need fear     to whom our saviour answered thus unmoved   much ostentation vain of fleshly arm   and fragile arms much instrument of war   long in preparing soon to nothing brought   before mine eyes thou hast set and in my ear               390   vented much policy and projects deep   of enemies of aids battles and leagues   plausible to the world to me worth naught   means i must use thou sayst prediction else   will unpredict and fail me of the throne   my time i told thee and that time for thee   were better farthest off is not yet come   when that comes think not thou to find me slack   on my part aught endeavouring or to need   thy politic maxims or that cumbersome                      400   luggage of war there shewn meargument   of human weakness rather than of strength   my brethren as thou callst them those ten tribes   i must deliver if i mean to reign   davids true heir and his full sceptre sway   to just extent over all israels sons   but whence to thee this zeal  where was it then   for israel or for david or his throne   when thou stoodst up his tempter to the pride   of numbering israelwhich cost the lives                   410   of threescore and ten thousand israelites   by three days pestilence  such was thy zeal   to israel then the same that now to me   as for those captive tribes themselves were they   who wrought their own captivity fell off   from god to worship calves the deities   of egypt baal next and ashtaroth   and all the idolatries of heathen round   besides their other worse than heathenish crimes   nor in the land of their captivity

all his wiles   so fares it when with truth falsehood contends     the fourth book    perplexed and troubled at his bad success   the tempter stood nor had what to reply   discovered in his fraud thrown from his hope   so oft and the persuasive rhetoric   that sleeked his tongue and won so much on eve   so little here nay lost  but eve was eve   this far his overmatch who selfdeceived   and rash beforehand had no better weighed   the strength he was to cope with or his own   butas a man who had been matchless held                   10   in cunning overreached where least he thought   to

           20   so satan whom repulse upon repulse   met ever and to shameful silence brought   yet gives not oer though desperate of success   and his vain importunity pursues   he brought our saviour to the western side   of that high mountain whence he might behold   another plain long but in breadth not wide   washed by the southern sea and on the north   to equal length backed with a ridge of hills   that screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men      30   from cold septentrion blasts thence in the midst   divided by a river off whose banks   on each side an imperial city stood   with towers and temples proudly elevate   on seven small hills with palaces adorned   porches and theatres baths aqueducts   statues and trophies and triumphal arcs   gardens and groves presented to his eyes   above the highth of mountains interposed   by what strange parallax or optic skill                    40   of vision multiplied through air or glass   of telescope were curious to enquire   and now the tempter thus his silence broke     the city which thou seest no other deem   than great and glorious rome queen of the earth   so far renowned and with the spoils enriched   of nations  there the capitol thou seest   above the rest lifting his stately head   on the tarpeian rock her citadel   impregnable and there mount palatine                      50   the imperial

shared among petty kings too far removed   these having shewn thee i have shewn thee all   the kingdoms of the world and all their glory   this emperor hath no son and now is old                   90   old and lascivious and from rome retired   to capreae an island small but strong   on the campanian shore with purpose there   his horrid lusts in private to enjoy   committing to a wicked favourite   all public cares and yet of him suspicious   hated of all and hating  with what ease   endued with regal virtues as thou art   appearing and beginning noble deeds   mightst thou expel this monster from his throne           100   now made a sty and in his place ascending   a victorpeople free from servile yoke   and with my help thou mayst to me the power   is given and by that right i give it thee   aim therefore at no less than all the world   aim at the highest without the highest attained   will be for thee no sitting or not long   on davids throne be prophesied what will     to whom the son of god unmoved replied   nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew                   110   of luxury though called magnificence   more than of arms before allure mine eye   much less my mind though thou shouldst add to tell   their sumptuous gluttonies and gorgeous feasts   on citron tables or atlantic stone   for i have also heard perhaps have read   their wines of setia cales and falerne   chios and crete and how they quaff in gold   crystal and myrrhine cups imbossed with gems   and studs of pearlto me shouldst tell who thirst        120   and hunger still  then embassies thou shewst   from nations far and nigh  what honour that   but tedious waste of time to sit and hear   so many hollow compliments and lies   outlandish flatteries  then proceedst to talk   of the emperor how easily subdued   how gloriously  i shall thou sayst expel   a brutish monster what if i withal   expel a devil who first made him such   let his tormentor conscience find him out                130   for him i was not sent nor yet to free   that people victor once now vile and base   deservedly made vassalwho once just   frugal and mild and temperate conquered well   but govern ill the nations under yoke   peeling their provinces exhausted all   by lust and rapine first ambitious grown   of triumph that insulting vanity   then cruel by their sports to blood inured   of fighting beasts and men to beasts exposed              140   luxurious by their wealth and greedier still   and from the daily scene effeminate   what wise and valiant man would seek to free   these thus degenerate by themselves enslaved   or could of inward slaves make outward free   know therefore when my season comes to sit   on davids throne it shall be like a tree   spreading and overshadowing all the earth   or as a stone that shall to pieces dash   all monarchies besides throughout the world                150   and of my kingdom there shall be no end   means there shall be to this but what the means   is not for thee to know nor me to tell     to whom the tempter impudent replied   i see all offers made by me how slight   thou valuest because offered and rejectst   nothing will please the difficult and nice   or nothing more than still to contradict   on the other side know also thou that i   on what i offer set as high esteem                         160   nor what i part with mean to give for naught   all these which in a moment thou beholdst   the kingdoms of the world to thee i give   for given to me i give to whom i please   no trifle yet with this reserve not else   on this condition if thou wilt fall down   and worship me as thy superior lord   easily done and hold them all of me   for what can less so great a gift deserve     whom thus our saviour answered with disdain            170   i never liked thy talk thy offers less   now both abhor since thou hast dared to utter   the abominable terms impious condition   but i endure the time till which expired   thou hast permission on me  it is written   the first of all commandments thou shalt worship   the lord thy god and only him shalt serve   and darst thou to the son of god propound   to worship thee accursed now more accursed   for this attempt bolder than that on eve                  180   and more blasphemous which expect to rue   the kingdoms of the world to thee were given   permitted rather and by thee usurped   other donation none thou canst produce   if given by whom but by the king of kings   god over all supreme  if given to thee   by thee how fairly is the giver now   repaid  but gratitude in thee is lost   long since  wert thou so void of fear or shame   as offer them to me the son of god                       190   to me my own on such abhorred pact   that i fall down and worship thee as god   get thee behind me  plain thou now appearst   that evil one satan for ever damned     to whom the fiend with fear abashed replied   be not so sore offended son of god   though sons of god both angels are and men   if i to try whether in higher sort   than these thou bearst that title have proposed   what both from men and angels i receive                    200   tetrarchs

night   her shadowy offspring unsubstantial both   privation mere of light and absent day                     400   our saviour meek and with untroubled mind   after hisaerie jaunt though hurried sore   hungry and cold betook him to his rest   wherever under some concourse of shades   whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield   from dews and damps of night his sheltered head   but sheltered slept in vain for at his head   the tempter watched and soon with ugly dreams   disturbed his sleep  and either tropic now   gan thunder and both ends of heaven the clouds           410   from many a horrid rift abortive poured   fierce rain with lightning mixed water with fire   in ruin reconciled nor slept the winds   within their stony caves but rushed abroad   from the four hinges of the world and fell   on the vexed wilderness whose tallest pines   though rooted deep as high and sturdiest oaks   bowed their stiff necks loaden with stormy blasts   or torn up sheer  ill wast thou shrouded then   o patient son of god yet only stoodst                     420   unshaken  nor yet staid the terror there   infernal ghosts and hellish furies round   environed thee some howled some yelled some shrieked   some bent at thee their fiery darts while thou   satst unappalled in calm and sinless peace   thus passed the night so foul till morning fair   came forth with pilgrim steps in amice grey   who with her radiant finger stilled the roar   of thunder chased the clouds and laid the winds   and griesly spectres which the fiend had raised            430   to tempt the son of god with terrors dire   and now the sun with more effectual beams   had cheered the face of earth and dried the wet   from drooping plant or dropping tree the birds   who all things now behold more fresh and green   after a night of storm so ruinous   cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray   to gratulate the sweet return of morn   nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn   was absent after all his mischief done                    440   the prince of darkness glad would also seem   of this fair change and to our saviour came   yet with no new device they all were spent   rather by this his last affront resolved   desperate of better course to vent his rage   and mad despite to be so oft repelled   him walking on a sunny hill he found   backed on the north and west by a thick wood   out of the wood he starts in wonted shape   and in a careless mood thus to him said                  450     fair morning yet betides thee son of god   after a dismal night  i heard the wrack   as earth and sky would mingle but myself   was distant and these flaws though mortals fear them   as dangerous to the pillared frame of heaven   or to the earths dark basis underneath   are to the main as inconsiderable   and harmless if not wholesome as a sneeze   to mans less universe and soon are gone   yet as being ofttimes noxious where they light             460   on man beast plant wasteful and turbulent   like turbulencies in the affairs of men   over whose heads they roar and seem to point   they oft foresignify and threaten ill   this tempest at this desert most was bent   of men at thee for only thou here dwellst   did i not tell thee if thou didst reject   the perfect season offered with my aid   to win thy destined seat but wilt prolong   all to the push of fate pursue thy way                     470   of gaining davids throne no man knows when   for both the when and how is nowhere told   thou shalt be what thou art ordained no doubt   for angels have proclaimed it but concealing   the time and means  each act is rightliest done   not when it must but when it may be best   if thou observe not this be sure to find   what i foretold theemany a hard assay   of dangers and adversities and pains   ere thou of israels sceptre get fast hold                 480   whereof this ominous night that closed thee round   so many terrors voices prodigies   may warn thee as a sure foregoing sign     so talked he while the son of god went on   and staid not but in brief him answered thus     me worse than wet thou findst not other harm   those terrors which thou speakst of did me none   i never feared they could though noising loud   and threatening nigh what they can do as signs   betokening or illboding i contemn                          490   as false portents not sent from god but thee   who knowing i shall reign past thy preventing   obtrudst thy offered aid that i accepting   at least might seem to hold all power of thee   ambitious spirit and wouldst be thought my god   and stormst refused thinking to terrify   me to thy will  desist thou art discerned   and toilst in vain nor me in vain molest     to whom the fiend now swoln with rage replied   then hear o son of david virginborn                    500   for son of god to me is yet in doubt   of the messiah i have heard foretold   by all the prophets of thy birth at length   announced by gabriel with the first i knew   and of the angelic song in bethlehem field   on thy birthnight that sung thee saviour born   from that time seldom have i ceased to eye   thy infancy thy childhood and thy youth   thy manhood last though yet in private bred   till at the ford of jordan whither all                    510   flocked to the baptist i among the rest   though not to be baptized by voice from heaven   heard thee pronounced the son of god beloved   thenceforth i thought thee worth my nearer view   and narrower scrutiny that i might learn   in what degree or meaning thou art called   the son of god which bears no single sense   the son of god i also am or was   and if i was i am relation stands   all men are sons of god yet thee i thought                 520   in some respect far higher so declared   therefore i watched thy footsteps from that hour   and followed thee still on to this waste wild   where by all best conjectures i collect   thou art to be my fatal enemy   good reason then if i beforehand seek   to understand my adversary who   and what he is his wisdom power intent   by parle or composition truce or league   to win him or win from him what i can                     530   and opportunity i here have had   to try thee sift thee and confess have found thee   proof against all temptation as a rock   of adamant and as a centre firm   to the utmost of mere man both wise and good   not more for honours riches kingdoms glory   have been before contemned and may again   therefore to know what more thou art than man   worth naming the son of god by voice from heaven   another method i must now begin                           540     so saying he caught him up and without wing   of hippogrif bore through the air sublime   over the wilderness and oer the plain   till underneath them fair jerusalem   the holy city lifted high her towers   and higher yet the glorious temple reared   her pile far off appearing like a mount   of alablaster topt with golden spires   there on the highest pinnacle he set   the son of god and added thus in scorn                  550     there stand if thou wilt stand to stand upright   will ask thee skill  i to thy fathers house   have brought thee and highest placed highest is best   now shew thy progeny if not to stand   cast thyself down  safely if son of god   for it is written he will give command   concerning thee to his angels in their hands   they shall uplift thee lest at any time   thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone     to whom thus jesus also it is written                  560   tempt not the lord thy god  he said and stood   but satan smitten with amazement fell   as when earths son antaeus to compare   small things with greatest in irassa strove   with joves alcides and oft foiled still rose   receiving from his mother earth new strength   fresh from his fall and fiercer grapple joined   throttled at length in the air expired and fell   so after many a foil the tempter proud   renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride                   570   fell whence he stood to see his victor fall   and as that theban monster that proposed   her riddle and him who solved it not devoured   that once found out and solved for grief and spite   cast herself headlong from the ismenian steep   so strook with dread and anguish fell the fiend   and to his crew that sat consulting brought   joyless triumphals of his hoped success   ruin and desperation and dismay   who durst so proudly tempt the son of god                  580   so satan fell and straight a fiery globe   of angels on full sail of wing flew nigh   who on their plumy vans received him soft   from his uneasy station and upbore   as on a floating couch through the blithe air   then in a flowery valley set him down   on a green bank and set before him spread   a table of celestial food divine   ambrosial fruits fetched from the tree of life   and from the fount of life ambrosial drink                 590   that soon refreshed him wearied and repaired   what hunger if aught hunger had impaired   or thirst and as he fed angelic quires   sung heavenly anthems of his victory   over temptation and the tempter proud     true image of the father whether throned   in the bosom of bliss and light of light   conceiving or remote from heaven enshrined   in fleshly tabernacle and human form

 a fairer paradise is founded now   for adam and his chosen sons whom thou   a saviour art come down to reinstall   where they shall dwell secure when time shall be   of tempter and temptation without fear   but thou infernal serpent shalt not long   rule in the clouds  like an autumnal star   or lightning thou shalt fall from heaven trod down        620   under his feet  for proof ere this thou feelst   thy wound yet not thy last and deadliest wound   by this repulse received and holdst in hell   no triumph in all her gates abaddon rues   thy bold attempt  hereafter learn with awe   to dread
