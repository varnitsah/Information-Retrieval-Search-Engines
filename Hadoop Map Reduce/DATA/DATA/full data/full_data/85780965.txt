racing for life   xiv  gore and dreams    xv  conquest and peace     prologue  several years had elapsed since i had found the opportunity to do any biggame hunting for at last i had my plans almost perfected for a return to my old stampinggrounds in northern africa where in other days i had had excellent sport in pursuit of the king of beasts  the date of my departure had been set i was to leave in two weeks  no schoolboy counting the lagging hours that must pass before the beginning of long vacation released him to the delirious joys of the summer camp could have been filled with greater impatience or keener anticipation  and then came a letter that started me for africa twelve days ahead of my schedule  often am i in receipt of letters from strangers who have found something in a story of mine to commend or to condemn  my interest in this department of my correspondence is ever fresh  i opened this particular letter with all the zest of pleasurable anticipation with which i had opened so many others  the postmark algiers had aroused my interest and curiosity especially at this time since it was algiers that was presently to witness the termination of my coming sea voyage in search of sport and adventure  before the reading of that letter was completed lions and lionhunting had fled my thoughts and i was in a state of excitement bordering upon frenzy  itwell read it yourself and see if you too do not find food for frantic conjecture for tantalizing doubts and for a great hope  here it is  dear sir i think that i have run across one of the most remarkable coincidences in modern literature  but let me start at the beginning  i am by profession a wanderer upon the face of the earth  i have no tradenor any other occupation  my father bequeathed me a competency some remoter ancestors lust to roam  i have combined the two and invested them carefully and without extravagance  i became interested in your story at the earths core not so much because of the probability of the tale as of a great and abiding wonder that people should be paid real money for writing such impossible trash  you will pardon my candor but it is necessary that you understand my mental attitude toward this particular storythat you may credit that which follows  shortly thereafter i started for the sahara in search of a rather rare species of antelope that is to be found only occasionally within a limited area at a certain season of the year  my chase led me far from the haunts of man  it was a fruitless search however in so far as antelope is concerned but one night as i lay courting sleep at the edge of a little cluster of datepalms that surround an ancient well in the midst of the arid shifting sands i suddenly became conscious of a strange sound coming apparently from the earth beneath my head  it was an intermittent ticking  no reptile or insect with which i am familiar reproduces any such notes  i lay for an hourlistening intently  at last my curiosity got the better of me  i arose lighted my lamp and commenced to investigate  my bedding lay upon a rug stretched directly upon the warm sand  the noise appeared to be coming from beneath the rug  i raised it but found nothingyet at intervals the sound continued  i dug into the sand with the point of my huntingknife  a few inches below the surface of the sand i encountered a solid substance that had the feel of wood beneath the sharp steel  excavating about it i unearthed a small wooden box  from this receptacle issued the strange sound that i had heard  how had it come here  what did it contain  in attempting to lift it from its burying place i discovered that it seemed to be held fast by means of a very small insulated cable running farther into the sand beneath it  my first impulse was to drag the thing loose by main strength but fortunately i thought better of this and fell to examining the box  i soon saw that it was covered by a hinged lid which was held closed by a simple screwhook and eye  it took but a moment to loosen this and raise the cover when to my utter astonishment i discovered an ordinary telegraph instrument clicking away within  what in the world thought i is this thing doing here  that it was a french military instrument was my first guess but really there didnt seem much likelihood that this was the correct explanation when one took into account the loneliness and remoteness of the spot  as i sat gazing at my remarkable find which was ticking and clicking away there in the silence of the desert night trying to convey some message which i was unable to interpret my eyes fell upon a bit of paper lying in the bottom of the box beside the instrument  i picked it up and examined it  upon it were written but two letters  d i  they meant nothing to me then  i was baffled  once in an interval of silence upon the part of the receiving instrument i moved the sendingkey up and down a few times  instantly the receiving mechanism commenced to work frantically  i tried to recall something of the morse code with which i had played as a little boybut time had obliterated it from my memory  i became almost frantic as i let my imagination run riot among the possibilities for which this clicking instrument might stand  some poor devil at the unknown other end might be in dire need of succor  the very franticness of the instruments wild clashing betokened something of the kind  and there sat i powerless to interpret and so powerless to help  it was then that the inspiration came to me  in a flash there leaped to my mind the closing paragraphs of the story i had read in the club at algiers  does the answer lie somewhere upon the bosom of the broad sahara at the ends of two tiny wires hidden beneath a lost cairn  the idea seemed preposterous  experience and intelligence combined to assure me that there could be no slightest grain of truth or possibility in your wild taleit was fiction pure and simple  and yet where were the other ends of those wires  what was this instrumentticking away here in the great saharabut a travesty upon the possible  would i have believed in it had i not seen it with my own eyes  and the initialsd iupon the slip of paper  davids initials were thesedavid innes  i smiled at my imaginings  i ridiculed the assumption that there was an inner world and that these wires led downward through the earths crust to the surface of pellucidar  and yet  well i sat there all night listening to that tantalizing clicking now and then moving the sendingkey just to let the other end know that the instrument had been discovered  in the morning after carefully returning the box to its hole and covering it over with sand i called my servants about me snatched a hurried breakfast mounted my horse and started upon a forced march for algiers  i arrived here today  in writing you this letter i feel that i am making a fool of myself  there is no david innes  there is no dian the beautiful  there is no world within a world  pellucidar is but a realm of your imaginationnothing more  but  the incident of the finding of that buried telegraph instrument upon the lonely sahara is little short of uncanny in view of your story of the adventures of david innes  i have called it one of the most remarkable coincidences in modern fiction  i called it literature before butagain pardon my candoryour story is not  and nowwhy am i writing you  heaven knows unless it is that the persistent clicking of that unfathomable enigma out there in the vast silences of the sahara has so wrought upon my nerves that reason refuses longer to function sanely  i cannot hear it now yet i know that far away to the south all alone beneath the sands it is still pounding out its vain frantic appeal  it is maddening  it is your faulti want you to release me from it  cable me at once at my expense that there was no basis of fact for your story at the earths core  very respectfully yours  cogdon nestor    and  club     algiers       june 1st     ten minutes after reading this letter i had cabled mr nestor as follows   story true  await me algiers   as fast as train and boat would carry me i sped toward my destination for all those dragging days my mind was a whirl of mad conjecture of frantic hope of numbing fear  the finding of the telegraphinstrument practically assured me that david innes had driven perrys iron mole back through the earths crust to the buried world of pellucidar but what adventures had befallen him since his return  had he found dian the beautiful his halfsavage mate safe among his friends or had hooja the sly one succeeded in his nefarious schemes to abduct her  did abner perry the lovable old inventor and paleontologist still live  had the federated tribes of pellucidar succeeded in overthrowing the mighty mahars the dominant race of reptilian monsters and their fierce gorillalike soldiery the savage sagoths  i must admit that i was in a state bordering upon nervous prostration when i entered the  and  club in algiers and inquired for mr nestor  a moment later i was ushered into his presence to find myself clasping hands with the sort of chap that the world holds only too few of  he was a tall smoothfaced man of about thirty cleancut straight and strong and weathertanned to the hue of a desert arab  i liked him immensely from the first and i hope that after our three months together in the desert countrythree months not entirely lacking in adventurehe found that a man may be a writer of impossible trash and yet have some redeeming qualities  the day following my arrival at algiers we left for the south nestor having made all arrangements in advance guessing as he naturally did that i could be coming to africa for but a single purposeto hasten at once to the buried telegraphinstrument and wrest its secret from it  in addition to our native servants we took along an english telegraphoperator named frank downes  nothing of interest enlivened our journey by rail and caravan till we came to the cluster of datepalms about the ancient well upon the rim of the sahara  it was the very spot at which i first had seen david innes  if he had ever raised a cairn above the telegraph instrument no sign of it remained now  had it not been for the chance that caused cogdon nestor to throw down his sleeping rug directly over the hidden instrument it might still be clicking there unheardand this story still unwritten  when we reached the spot and unearthed the little box the instrument was quiet nor did repeated attempts upon the part of our telegrapher succeed in winning a response from the other end of the line  after several days of futile endeavor to raise pellucidar we had begun to despair  i was as positive that the other end of that little cable protruded through the surface of the inner world as i am that i sit here today in my studywhen about midnight of the fourth day i was awakened by the sound of the instrument  leaping to my feet i grasped downes roughly by the neck and dragged him out of his blankets  he didnt need to be told what caused my excitement for the instant he was awake he too heard the longhoped for click and with a whoop of delight pounced upon the instrument  nestor was on his feet almost as soon as i the three of us huddled about that little box as if our lives depended upon the message it had for us  downes interrupted the clicking with his sendingkey  the noise of the receiver stopped instantly  ask who it is downes i directed  he did so and while we awaited the englishmans translation of the reply i doubt if either nestor or i breathed  he says hes david innes said downes  he wants to know who we are  tell him said i and that we want to know how he isand all that has befallen him since i last saw him  for two months i talked with david innes almost every day and as downes translated either nestor or i took notes  from these arranged in chronological order i have set down the following account of the further adventures of david innes at the earths core practically in his own words    chapter i  lost on pellucidar  the arabs of whom i wrote you at the end of my last letter innes began and whom i thought to be enemies intent only upon murdering me proved to be exceedingly friendlythey were searching for the very band of marauders that had threatened my existence  the huge rhamphorhynchuslike reptile that i had brought back with me from the inner worldthe ugly mahar that hooja the sly one had substituted for my dear dian at the moment of my departurefilled them with wonder and with awe  nor less so did the mighty subterranean prospector which had carried me to pellucidar and back again and which lay out in the desert about two miles from my camp  with their help i managed to get the unwieldy tons of its great bulk into a vertical positionthe nose deep in a hole we had dug in the sand and the rest of it supported by the trunks of datepalms cut for the purpose  it was a mighty engineering job with only wild arabs and their wilder mounts to do the work of an electric cranebut finally it was completed and i was ready for departure  for some time i hesitated to take the mahar back with me  she had been docile and quiet ever since she had discovered herself virtually a prisoner aboard the iron mole it had been of course impossible for me to communicate with her since she had no auditory organs and i no knowledge of her fourthdimension sixthsense method of communication  naturally i am kindhearted and so i found it beyond me to leave even this hateful and repulsive thing alone in a strange and hostile world the result was that when i entered the iron mole i took her with me  that she knew that we were about to return to pellucidar was evident for immediately her manner changed from that of habitual gloom that had pervaded her to an almost human expression of contentment and delight  our trip through the earths crust was but a repetition of my two former journeys between the inner and the outer worlds  this time however i imagine that we must have maintained a more nearly perpendicular course for we accomplished the journey in a few minutes less time than upon the occasion of my first journey through the fivehundredmile crust  just a trifle less than seventytwo hours after our departure into the sands of the sahara we broke through the surface of pellucidar  fortune once again favored me by the slightest of margins for when i opened the door in the prospectors outer jacket i saw that we had missed coming up through the bottom of an ocean by but a few hundred yards  the aspect of the surrounding country was entirely unfamiliar to mei had no conception of precisely where i was upon the one hundred and twentyfour million square miles of pellucidars vast land surface  the perpetual midday sun poured down its torrid rays from zenith as it had done since the beginning of pellucidarian timeas it would continue to do to the end of it  before me across the wide sea the weird horizonless seascape folded gently upward to meet the sky until it lost itself to view in the azure depths of distance far above the level of my eyes  how strange it looked how vastly different from the flat and puny area of the circumscribed vision of the dweller upon the outer crust  i was lost  though i wandered ceaselessly throughout a lifetime i might never discover the whereabouts of my former friends of this strange and savage world  never again might i see dear old perry nor ghak the hairy one nor dacor the strong one nor that other infinitely precious onemy sweet and noble mate dian the beautiful  but even so i was glad to tread once more the surface of pellucidar mysterious and terrible grotesque and savage though she is in many of her aspects i can not but love her  her very savagery appealed to me for it is the savagery of unspoiled nature  the magnificence of her tropic beauties enthralled me her mighty land areas breathed unfettered freedom  her untracked oceans whispering of virgin wonders unsullied by the eye of man beckoned me out upon their restless bosoms  not for an instant did i regret the world of my nativity  i was in pellucidar  i was home  and i was content  as i stood dreaming beside the giant thing that had brought me safely through the earths crust my traveling companion the hideous mahar emerged from the interior of the prospector and stood beside me  for a long time she remained motionless  what thoughts were passing through the convolutions of her reptilian brain  i do not know  she was a member of the dominant race of pellucidar  by a strange freak of evolution her kind had first developed the power of reason in that world of anomalies  to her creatures such as i were of a lower order  as perry had discovered among the writings of her kind in the buried city of phutra it was still an open question among the mahars as to whether man possessed means of intelligent communication or the power of reason  her kind believed that in the center of allpervading solidity there was a single vast spherical cavity which was pellucidar  this cavity had been left there for the sole purpose of providing a place for the creation and propagation of the mahar race  everything within it had been put there for the uses of the mahar  i wondered what this particular mahar might think now  i found pleasure in speculating upon just what the effect had been upon her of passing through the earths crust and coming out into a world that one of even less intelligence than the great mahars could easily see was a different world from her own pellucidar  what had she thought of the outer worlds tiny sun  what had been the effect upon her of the moon and myriad stars of the clear african nights  how had she explained them  with what sensations of awe must she first have watched the sun moving slowly across the heavens to disappear at last beneath the western horizon leaving in his wake that which the mahar had never before witnessedthe darkness of night for upon pellucidar there is no night  the stationary sun hangs forever in the center of the pellucidarian skydirectly overhead  then too she must have been impressed by the wondrous mechanism of the prospector which had bored its way from world to world and back again  and that it had been driven by a rational being must also have occurred to her  too she had seen me conversing with other men upon the earths surface  she had seen the arrival of the caravan of books and arms and ammunition and the balance of the heterogeneous collection which i had crammed into the cabin of the iron mole for transportation to pellucidar  she had seen all these evidences of a civilization and brainpower transcending in scientific achievement anything that her race had produced nor once had she seen a creature of her own kind  there could have been but a single deduction in the mind of the maharthere were other worlds than pellucidar and the gilak was a rational being  now the creature at my side was creeping slowly toward the nearby sea at my hip hung a longbarreled sixshootersomehow i had been unable to find the same sensation of security in the newfangled automatics that had been perfected since my first departure from the outer worldand in my hand was a heavy express rifle  i could have shot the mahar with ease for i knew intuitively that she was escapingbut i did not  i felt that if she could return to her own kind with the story of her adventures the position of the human race within pellucidar would be advanced immensely at a single stride for at once man would take his proper place in the considerations of the reptilia  at the edge of the sea the creature paused and looked back at me  then she slid sinuously into the surf  for several minutes i saw no more of her as she luxuriated in the cool depths  then a hundred yards from shore she rose and there for another short while she floated upon the surface  finally she spread her giant wings flapped them vigorously a score of times and rose above the blue sea  a single time she circled far aloftand then straight as an arrow she sped away  i watched her until the distant haze enveloped her and she had disappeared  i was alone  my first concern was to discover where within pellucidar i might beand in what direction lay the land of the sarians where ghak the hairy one ruled  but how was i to guess in which direction lay sari  and if i set out to searchwhat then  could i find my way back to the prospector with its priceless freight of books firearms ammunition scientific instruments and still more booksits great library of reference works upon every conceivable branch of applied sciences  and if i could not of what value was all this vast storehouse of potential civilization and progress to be to the world of my adoption  upon the other hand if i remained here alone with it what could i accomplish singlehanded  nothing  but where there was no east no west no north no south no stars no moon and only a stationary midday sun how was i to find my way back to this spot should ever i get out of sight of it  i didnt know  for a long time i stood buried in deep thought when it occurred to me to try out one of the compasses i had brought and ascertain if it remained steadily fixed upon an unvarying pole  i reentered the prospector and fetched a compass without  moving a considerable distance from the prospector that the needle might not be influenced by its great bulk of iron and steel i turned the delicate instrument about in every direction  always and steadily the needle remained rigidly fixed upon a point straight out to sea apparently pointing toward a large island some ten or twenty miles distant  this then should be north  i drew my notebook from my pocket and made a careful topographical sketch of the locality within the range of my vision  due north lay the island far out upon the shimmering sea  the spot i had chosen for my observations was the top of a large flat boulder which rose six or eight feet above the turf  this spot i called greenwich  the boulder was the royal observatory  i had made a start i cannot tell you what a sense of relief was imparted to me by the simple fact that there was at least one spot within pellucidar with a familiar name and a place upon a map  it was with almost childish joy that i made a little circle in my notebook and traced the word greenwich beside it  now i felt i might start out upon my search with some assurance of finding my way back again to the prospector  i decided that at first i would travel directly south in the hope that i might in that direction find some familiar landmark  it was as good a direction as any  this much at least might be said of it  among the many other things i had brought from the outer world were a number of pedometers  i slipped three of these into my pockets with the idea that i might arrive at a more or less accurate mean from the registrations of them all  on my map i would register so many paces south so many east so many west and so on  when i was ready to return i would then do so by any route that i might choose  i also strapped a considerable quantity of ammunition across my shoulders pocketed some matches and hooked an aluminum frypan and a small stewkettle of the same metal to my belt  i was readyready to go forth and explore a world  ready to search a land area of 124110000 square miles for my friends my incomparable mate and good old perry  and so after locking the door in the outer shell of the prospector i set out upon my quest  due south i traveled across lovely valleys thickdotted with grazing herds  through dense primeval forests i forced my way and up the slopes of mighty mountains searching for a pass to their farther sides  ibex and musksheep fell before my good old revolver so that i lacked not for food in the higher altitudes  the forests and the plains gave plentifully of fruits and wild birds antelope aurochsen and elk  occasionally for the larger game animals and the gigantic beasts of prey i used my express rifle but for the most part the revolver filled all my needs  there were times too when faced by a mighty cave bear a sabertoothed tiger or huge felis spelaea blackmaned and terrible even my powerful rifle seemed pitifully inadequatebut fortune favored me so that i passed unscathed through adventures that even the recollection of causes the short hairs to bristle at the nape of my neck  how long i wandered toward the south i do not know for shortly after i left the prospector something went wrong with my watch and i was again at the mercy of the baffling timelessness of pellucidar forging steadily ahead beneath the great motionless sun which hangs eternally at noon  i ate many times however so that days must have elapsed possibly months with no familiar landscape rewarding my eager eyes  i saw no men nor signs of men  nor is this strange for pellucidar in its land area is immense while the human race there is very young and consequently far from numerous  doubtless upon that long search mine was the first human foot to touch the soil in many placesmine the first human eye to rest upon the gorgeous wonders of the landscape  it was a staggering thought  i could not but dwell upon it often as i made my lonely way through this virgin world  then quite suddenly one day i stepped out of the peace of manless primality into the presence of manand peace was gone  it happened thus  i had been following a ravine downward out of a chain of lofty hills and had paused at its mouth to view the lovely little valley that lay before me  at one side was tangled wood while straight ahead a river wound peacefully along parallel to the cliffs in which the hills terminated at the valleys edge  presently as i stood enjoying the lovely scene as insatiate for natures wonders as if i had not looked upon similar landscapes countless times a sound of shouting broke from the direction of the woods  that the harsh discordant notes rose from the throats of men i could not doubt  i slipped behind a large boulder near the mouth of the ravine and waited  i could hear the crashing of underbrush in the forest and i guessed that whoever came came quicklypursued and pursuers doubtless  in a short time some hunted animal would break into view and a moment later a score of halfnaked savages would come leaping after with spears or club or great stoneknives  i had seen the thing so many times during my life within pellucidar that i felt that i could anticipate to a nicety precisely what i was about to witness  i hoped that the hunters would prove friendly and be able to direct me toward sari  even as i was thinking these thoughts the quarry emerged from the forest  but it was no terrified fourfooted beast  instead what i saw was an old mana terrified old man  staggering feebly and hopelessly from what must have been some very terrible fate if one could judge from the horrified expressions he continually cast behind him toward the wood he came stumbling on in my direction  he had covered but a short distance from the forest when i beheld the first of his pursuersa sagoth one of those grim and terrible gorillamen who guard the mighty mahars in their buried cities faring forth from time to time upon slaveraiding or punitive expeditions against the human race of pellucidar of whom the dominant race of the inner world think as we think of the bison or the wild sheep of our own world  close behind the foremost sagoth came others until a full dozen raced shouting after the terrorstricken old man  they would be upon him shortly that was plain  one of them was rapidly overhauling him his backthrown speararm testifying to his purpose  and then quite with the suddenness of an unexpected blow i realized a past familiarity with the gait and carriage of the fugitive  simultaneously there swept over me the staggering fact that the old man wasperry that he was about to die before my very eyes with no hope that i could reach him in time to avert the awful catastrophefor to me it meant a real catastrophe  perry was my best friend  dian of course i looked upon as more than friend  she was my matea part of me  i had entirely forgotten the rifle in my hand and the revolvers at my belt one does not readily synchronize his thoughts with the stone age and the twentieth century simultaneously  now from past habit i still thought in the stone age and in my thoughts of the stone age there were no thoughts of firearms  the fellow was almost upon perry when the feel of the gun in my hand awoke me from the lethargy of terror that had gripped me  from behind my boulder i threw up the heavy express riflea mighty engine of destruction that might bring down a cave bear or a mammoth at a single shotand let drive at the sagoths broad hairy breast  at the sound of the shot he stopped stockstill  his spear dropped from his hand  then he lunged forward upon his face  the effect upon the others was little less remarkable  perry alone could have possibly guessed the meaning of the loud report or explained its connection with the sudden collapse of the sagoth  the other gorillamen halted for but an instant  then with renewed shrieks of rage they sprang forward to finish perry  at the same time i stepped from behind my boulder drawing one of my revolvers that i might conserve the more precious ammunition of the express rifle  quickly i fired again with the lesser weapon  then it was that all eyes were directed toward me  another sagoth fell to the bullet from the revolver but it did not stop his companions they were out for revenge as well as blood now and they meant to have both  as i ran forward toward perry i fired four more shots dropping three of our antagonists  then at last the remaining seven wavered  it was too much for them this roaring death that leaped invisible upon them from a great distance  as they hesitated i reached perrys side  i have never seen such an expression upon any mans face as that upon perrys when he recognized me  i have no words wherewith to describe it  there was not time to talk thenscarce for a greeting  i thrust the full loaded revolver into his hand fired the last shot in my own and reloaded  there were but six sagoths left then  they started toward us once more though i could see that they were terrified probably as much by the noise of the guns as by their effects  they never reached us  halfway the three that remained turned and fled and we let them go  the last we saw of them they were disappearing into the tangled undergrowth of the forest  and then perry turned and threw his arms about my neck and burying his old face upon my shoulder wept like a child    chapter ii  traveling with terror  we made camp there beside the peaceful river  there perry told me all that had befallen him since i had departed for the outer crust  it seemed that hooja had made it appear that i had intentionally left dian behind and that i did not purpose ever returning to pellucidar he told them that i was of another world and that i had tired of this and of its inhabitants  to dian he had explained that i had a mate in the world to which i was returning that i had never intended taking dian the beautiful back with me and that she had seen the last of me  shortly afterward dian had disappeared from the camp nor had perry seen or heard aught of her since  he had no conception of the time that had elapsed since i had departed but guessed that many years had dragged their slow way into the past  hooja too had disappeared very soon after dian had left  the sarians under ghak the hairy one and the amozites under dacor the strong one dians brother had fallen out over my supposed defection for ghak would not believe that i had thus treacherously deceived and deserted them  the result had been that these two powerful tribes had fallen upon one another with the new weapons that perry and i had taught them to make and to use  other tribes of the new federation took sides with the original disputants or set up petty revolutions of their own  the result was the total demolition of the work we had so well started  taking advantage of the tribal war the mahars had gathered their sagoths in force and fallen upon one tribe after another in rapid succession wreaking awful havoc among them and reducing them for the most part to as pitiable a state of terror as that from which we had raised them  alone of all the oncemighty federation the sarians and the amozites with a few other tribes continued to maintain their defiance of the mahars but these tribes were still divided among themselves nor had it seemed at all probable to perry when he had last been among them that any attempt at reamalgamation would be made  and thus your majesty he concluded has faded back into the oblivion of the stone age our wondrous dream and with it has gone the first empire of pellucidar  we both had to smile at the use of my royal title yet i was indeed still emperor of pellucidar and some day i meant to rebuild what the vile act of the treacherous hooja had torn down  but first i would find my empress  to me she was worth forty empires  have you no clue as to the whereabouts of dian i asked  none whatever replied perry  it was in search of her that i came to the pretty pass in which you discovered me and from which david you saved me  i knew perfectly well that you had not intentionally deserted either dian or pellucidar  i guessed that in some way hooja the sly one was at the bottom of the matter and i determined to go to amoz where i guessed that dian might come to the protection of her brother and do my utmost to convince her and through her dacor the strong one that we had all been victims of a treacherous plot to which you were no party  i came to amoz after a most trying and terrible journey only to find that dian was not among her brothers people and that they knew naught of her whereabouts  dacor i am sure wanted to be fair and just but so great were his grief and anger over the disappearance of his sister that he could not listen to reason but kept repeating time and again that only your return to pellucidar could prove the honesty of your intentions  then came a stranger from another tribe sent i am sure at the instigation of hooja  he so turned the amozites against me that i was forced to flee their country to escape assassination  in attempting to return to sari i became lost and then the sagoths discovered me  for a long time i eluded them hiding in caves and wading in rivers to throw them off my trail  i lived on nuts and fruits and the edible roots that chance threw in my way  i traveled on and on in what directions i could not even guess and at last i could elude them no longer and the end came as i had long foreseen that it would come except that i had not foreseen that you would be there to save me  we rested in our camp until perry had regained sufficient strength to travel again  we planned much rebuilding all our shattered aircastles but above all we planned most to find dian  i could not believe that she was dead yet where she might be in this savage world and under what frightful conditions she might be living i could not guess  when perry was rested we returned to the prospector where he fitted himself out fully like a civilized human beingunderclothing socks shoes khaki jacket and breeches and good substantial puttees  when i had come upon him he was clothed in rough sadak sandals a geestring and a tunic fashioned from the shaggy hide of a thag  now he wore real clothing again for the first time since the apefolk had stripped us of our apparel that longgone day that had witnessed our advent within pellucidar  with a bandoleer of cartridges across his shoulder two sixshooters at his hips and a rifle in his hand he was a much rejuvenated perry  indeed he was quite a different person altogether from the rather shaky old man who had entered the prospector with me ten or eleven years before for the trial trip that had plunged us into such wondrous adventures and into such a strange and hitherto undreamedofworld  now he was straight and active  his muscles almost atrophied from disuse in his former life had filled out  he was still an old man of course but instead of appearing ten years older than he really was as he had when we left the outer world he now appeared about ten years younger  the wild free life of pellucidar had worked wonders for him  well it must need have done so or killed him for a man of perrys former physical condition could not long have survived the dangers and rigors of the primitive life of the inner world  perry had been greatly interested in my map and in the royal observatory at greenwich  by use of the pedometers we had retraced our way to the prospector with ease and accuracy  now that we were ready to set out again we decided to follow a different route on the chance that it might lead us into more familiar territory  i shall not weary you with a repetition of the countless adventures of our long search  encounters with wild beasts of gigantic size were of almost daily occurrence but with our deadly express rifles we ran comparatively little risk when one recalls that previously we had both traversed this world of frightful dangers inadequately armed with crude primitive weapons and all but naked  we ate and slept many timesso many that we lost countand so i do not know how long we roamed though our map shows the distances and directions quite accurately  we must have covered a great many thousand square miles of territory and yet we had seen nothing in the way of a familiar landmark when from the heights of a mountainrange we were crossing i descried far in the distance great masses of billowing clouds  now clouds are practically unknown in the skies of pellucidar  the moment that my eyes rested upon them my heart leaped  i seized perrys arm and pointing toward the horizonless distance shouted  the mountains of the clouds  they lie close to phutra and the country of our worst enemies the mahars perry remonstrated  i know it i replied but they give us a startingpoint from which to prosecute our search intelligently  they are at least a familiar landmark  they tell us that we are upon the right trail and not wandering far in the wrong direction  furthermore close to the mountains of the clouds dwells a good friend ja the mezop  you did not know him but you know all that he did for me and all that he will gladly do to aid me  at least he can direct us upon the right direction toward sari  the mountains of the clouds constitute a mighty range replied perry they must cover an enormous territory  how are you to find your friend in all the great country that is visible from their rugged flanks  easily i answered him for ja gave me minute directions  i recall almost his exact words  you need merely come to the foot of the highest peak of the mountains of the clouds  there you will find a river that flows into the lural az  directly opposite the mouth of the river you will see three large islands far outso far that they are barely discernible  the one to the extreme left as you face them from the mouth of the river is anoroc where i rule the tribe of anoroc  and so we hastened onward toward the great cloudmass that was to be our guide for several weary marches  at last we came close to the towering crags alplike in their grandeur  rising nobly among its noble fellows one stupendous peak reared its giant head thousands of feet above the others  it was he whom we sought but at its foot no river wound down toward any sea  it must rise from the opposite side suggested perry casting a rueful glance at the forbidding heights that barred our further progress  we cannot endure the arctic cold of those high flung passes and to traverse the endless miles about this interminable range might require a year or more  the land we seek must lie upon the opposite side of the mountains  then we must cross them i insisted  perry shrugged  we cant do it david he repeated we are dressed for the tropics we should freeze to death among the snows and glaciers long before we had discovered a pass to the opposite side  we must cross them i reiterated  we will cross them  i had a plan and that plan we carried out  it took some time  first we made a permanent camp part way up the slopes where there was good water  then we set out in search of the great shaggy cave bear of the higher altitudes  he is a mighty animala terrible animal  he is but little larger than his cousin of the lesser lower hills but he makes up for it in the awfulness of his ferocity and in the length and thickness of his shaggy coat  it was his coat that we were after  we came upon him quite unexpectedly  i was trudging in advance along a rocky trail worn smooth by the padded feet of countless ages of wild beasts  at a shoulder of the mountain around which the path ran i came face to face with the titan  i was going up for a fur coat  he was coming down for breakfast  each realized that here was the very thing he sought  with a horrid roar the beast charged me  at my right the cliff rose straight upward for thousands of feet  at my left it dropped into a dim abysmal canon  in front of me was the bear  behind me was perry  i shouted to him in warning and then i raised my rifle and fired into the broad breast of the creature  there was no time to take aim the thing was too close upon me  but that my bullet took effect was evident from the howl of rage and pain that broke from the frothing jowls  it didnt stop him though  i fired again and then he was upon me  down i went beneath his ton of maddened clawing flesh and bone and sinew  i thought my time had come  i remember feeling sorry for poor old perry left all alone in this inhospitable savage world  and then of a sudden i realized that the bear was gone and that i was quite unharmed  i leaped to my feet my rifle still clutched in my hand and looked about for my antagonist  i thought that i should find him farther down the trail probably finishing perry and so i leaped in the direction i supposed him to be to find perry perched upon a projecting rock several feet above the trail  my cry of warning had given him time to reach this point of safety  there he squatted his eyes wide and his mouth ajar the picture of abject terror and consternation  where is he he cried when he saw me  where is he  didnt he come this way i asked  nothing came this way replied the old man  but i heard his roarshe must have been as large as an elephant  he was i admitted but where in the world do you suppose he disappeared to  then came a possible explanation to my mind  i returned to the point at which the bear had hurled me down and peered over the edge of the cliff into the abyss below  far far down i saw a small brown blotch near the bottom of the canon it was the bear  my second shot must have killed him and so his dead body after hurling me to the path had toppled over into the abyss  i shivered at the thought of how close i too must have been to going over with him  it took us a long time to reach the carcass and arduous labor to remove the great pelt  but at last the thing was accomplished and we returned to camp dragging the heavy trophy behind us  here we devoted another considerable period to scraping and curing it when this was done to our satisfaction we made heavy boots trousers and coats of the shaggy skin turning the fur in  from the scraps we fashioned caps that came down around our ears with flaps that fell about our shoulders and breasts  we were now fairly well equipped for our search for a pass to the opposite side of the mountains of the clouds  our first step now was to move our camp upward to the very edge of the perpetual snows which cap this lofty range  here we built a snug secure little hut which we provisioned and stored with fuel for its diminutive fireplace  with our hut as a base we sallied forth in search of a pass across the range  our every move was carefully noted upon our maps which we now kept in duplicate  by this means we were saved tedious and unnecessary retracing of ways already explored  systematically we worked upward in both directions from our base and when we had at last discovered what seemed might prove a feasible pass we moved our belongings to a new hut farther up  it was hard workcold bitter cruel work  not a step did we take in advance but the grim reaper strode silently in our tracks  there were the great cave bears in the timber and gaunt lean wolveshuge creatures twice the size of our canadian timberwolves farther up we were assailed by enormous white bearshungry devilish fellows who came roaring across the rough glacier tops at the first glimpse of us or stalked us stealthily by scent when they had not yet seen us  it is one of the peculiarities of life within pellucidar that man is more often the hunted than the hunter  myriad are the hugebellied carnivora of this primitive world  never from birth to death are those great bellies sufficiently filled so always are their mighty owners prowling about in search of meat  terribly armed for battle as they are man presents to them in his primal state an easy prey slow of foot puny of strength illequipped by nature with natural weapons of defense  the bears looked upon us as easy meat  only our heavy rifles saved us from prompt extinction  poor perry never was a raging lion at heart and i am convinced that the terrors of that awful period must have caused him poignant mental anguish  when we were abroad pushing our trail farther and farther toward the distant break which we assumed marked a feasible way across the range we never knew at what second some great engine of clawed and fanged destruction might rush upon us from behind or lie in wait for us beyond an icehummock or a jutting shoulder of the craggy steeps  the roar of our rifles was constantly shattering the worldold silence of stupendous canons upon which the eye of man had never before gazed and when in the comparative safety of our hut we lay down to sleep the great beasts roared and fought without the walls clawed and battered at the door or rushed their colossal frames headlong against the huts sides until it rocked and trembled to the impact  yes it was a gay life  perry had got to taking stock of our ammunition each time we returned to the hut  it became something of an obsession with him  hed count our cartridges one by one and then try to figure how long it would be before the last was expended and we must either remain in the hut until we starved to death or venture forth empty to fill the belly of some hungry bear  i must admit that i too felt worried for our progress was indeed snaillike and our ammunition could not last forever  in discussing the problem finally we came to the decision to burn our bridges behind us and make one last supreme effort to cross the divide  it would mean that we must go without sleep for a long period and with the further chance that when the time came that sleep could no longer be denied we might still be high in the frozen regions of perpetual snow and ice where sleep would mean certain death exposed as we would be to the attacks of wild beasts and without shelter from the hideous cold  but we decided that we must take these chances and so at last we set forth from our hut for the last time carrying such necessities as we felt we could least afford to do without  the bears seemed unusually troublesome and determined that time and as we clambered slowly upward beyond the highest point to which we had previously attained the cold became infinitely more intense  presently with two great bears dogging our footsteps we entered a dense fog  we had reached the heights that are so often cloudwrapped for long periods  we could see nothing a few paces beyond our noses  we dared not turn back into the teeth of the bears which we could hear grunting behind us  to meet them in this bewildering fog would have been to court instant death  perry was almost overcome by the hopelessness of our situation  he flopped down on his knees and began to pray  it was the first time i had heard him at his old habit since my return to pellucidar and i had thought that he had given up his little idiosyncrasy but he hadnt  far from it  i let him pray for a short time undisturbed and then as i was about to suggest that we had better be pushing along one of the bears in our rear let out a roar that made the earth fairly tremble beneath our feet  it brought perry to his feet as if he had been stung by a wasp and sent him racing ahead through the blinding fog at a gait that i knew must soon end in disaster were it not checked  crevasses in the glacierice were far too frequent to permit of reckless speed even in a clear atmosphere and then there were hideous precipices along the edges of which our way often led us  i shivered as i thought of the poor old fellows peril  at the top of my lungs i called to him to stop but he did not answer me  and then i hurried on in the direction he had gone faster by far than safety dictated  for a while i thought i heard him ahead of me but at last though i paused often to listen and to call to him i heard nothing more not even the grunting of the bears that had been behind us  all was deathly silencethe silence of the tomb  about me lay the thick impenetrable fog  i was alone  perry was gonegone forever i had not the slightest doubt  somewhere near by lay the mouth of a treacherous fissure and far down at its icy bottom lay all that was mortal of my old friend abner perry  there would his body be preserved in its icy sepulcher for countless ages until on some far distant day the slowmoving river of ice had wound its snaillike way down to the warmer level there to disgorge its grisly evidence of grim tragedy and what in that far future age might mean baffling mystery    chapter iii  shooting the chutesand after  through the fog i felt my way along by means of my compass  i no longer heard the bears nor did i encounter one within the fog  experience has since taught me that these great beasts are as terrorstricken by this phenomenon as a landsman by a fog at sea and that no sooner does a fog envelop them than they make the best of their way to lower levels and a clear atmosphere  it was well for me that this was true  i felt very sad and lonely as i crawled along the difficult footing my own predicament weighed less heavily upon me than the loss of perry for i loved the old fellow  that i should ever win the opposite slopes of the range i began to doubt for though i am naturally sanguine i imagine that the bereavement which had befallen me had cast such a gloom over my spirits that i could see no slightest ray of hope for the future  then too the blighting gray oblivion of the cold damp clouds through which i wandered was distressing  hope thrives best in sunlight and i am sure that it does not thrive at all in a fog  but the instinct of selfpreservation is stronger than hope  it thrives fortunately upon nothing  it takes root upon the brink of the grave and blossoms in the jaws of death  now it flourished bravely upon the breast of dead hope and urged me onward and upward in a stern endeavor to justify its existence  as i advanced the fog became denser  i could see nothing beyond my nose  even the snow and ice i trod were invisible  i could not see below the breast of my bearskin coat  i seemed to be floating in a sea of vapor  to go forward over a dangerous glacier under such conditions was little short of madness but i could not have stopped going had i known positively that death lay two paces before my nose  in the first place it was too cold to stop and in the second i should have gone mad but for the excitement of the perils that beset each forward step  for some time the ground had been rougher and steeper until i had been forced to scale a considerable height that had carried me from the glacier entirely  i was sure from my compass that i was following the right general direction and so i kept on  once more the ground was level  from the wind that blew about me i guessed that i must be upon some exposed peak of ridge  and then quite suddenly i stepped out into space  wildly i turned and clutched at the ground that had slipped from beneath my feet  only a smooth icy surface was there  i found nothing to clutch or stay my fall and a moment later so great was my speed that nothing could have stayed me  as suddenly as i had pitched into space with equal suddenness did i emerge from the fog out of which i shot like a projectile from a cannon into clear daylight  my speed was so great that i could see nothing about me but a blurred and indistinct sheet of smooth and frozen snow that rushed past me with expresstrain velocity  i must have slid downward thousands of feet before the steep incline curved gently on to a broad smooth snowcovered plateau  across this i hurtled with slowly diminishing velocity until at last objects about me began to take definite shape  far ahead miles and miles away i saw a great valley and mighty woods and beyond these a broad expanse of water  in the nearer foreground i discerned a small dark blob of color upon the shimmering whiteness of the snow  a bear thought i and thanked the instinct that had impelled me to cling tenaciously to my rifle during the moments of my awful tumble  at the rate i was going it would be but a moment before i should be quite abreast the thing nor was it long before i came to a sudden stop in soft snow upon which the sun was shining not twenty paces from the object of my most immediate apprehension  it was standing upon its hind legs waiting for me  as i scrambled to my feet to meet it i dropped my gun in the snow and doubled up with laughter  it was perry  the expression upon his face combined with the relief i felt at seeing him again safe and sound was too much for my overwrought nerves  david he cried  david my boy god has been good to an old man he has answered my prayer  it seems that perry in his mad flight had plunged over the brink at about the same point as that at which i had stepped over it a short time later  chance had done for us what long periods of rational labor had failed to accomplish  we had crossed the divide  we were upon the side of the mountains of the clouds that we had for so long been attempting to reach  we looked about  below us were green trees and warm jungles  in the distance was a great sea  the lural az i said pointing toward its bluegreen surface  somehowthe gods alone can explain itperry too had clung to his rifle during his mad descent of the icy slope  for that there was cause for great rejoicing  neither of us was worse for his experience so after shaking the snow from our clothing we set off at a great rate down toward the warmth and comfort of the forest and the jungle  the going was easy by comparison with the awful obstacles we had had to encounter upon the opposite side of the divide  there were beasts of course but we came through safely  before we halted to eat or rest we stood beside a little mountain brook beneath the wondrous trees of the primeval forest in an atmosphere of warmth and comfort  it reminded me of an early june day in the maine woods  we fell to work with our short axes and cut enough small trees to build a rude protection from the fiercer beasts  then we lay down to sleep  how long we slept i do not know  perry says that inasmuch as there is no means of measuring time within pellucidar there can be no such thing as time here and that we may have slept an outer earthly year or we may have slept but a second  but this i know  we had stuck the ends of some of the saplings into the ground in the building of our shelter first stripping the leaves and branches from them and when we awoke we found that many of them had thrust forth sprouts  personally i think that we slept at least a month but who may say the sun marked midday when we closed our eyes it was still in the same position when we opened them nor had it varied a hairs breadth in the interim  it is most baffling this question of elapsed time within pellucidar  anyhow i was famished when we awoke  i think that it was the pangs of hunger that awoke me  ptarmigan and wild boar fell before my revolver within a dozen moments of my awakening  perry soon had a roaring fire blazing by the brink of the little stream  it was a good and delicious meal we made  though we did not eat the entire boar we made a very large hole in him while the ptarmigan was but a mouthful  having satisfied our hunger we determined to set forth at once in search of anoroc and my old friend ja the mezop  we each thought that by following the little stream downward we should come upon the large river which ja had told me emptied into the lural az opposite his island  we did so nor were we disappointed for at last after a pleasant journeyand what journey would not be pleasant after the hardships we had endured among the peaks of the mountains of the cloudswe came upon a broad flood that rushed majestically onward in the direction of the great sea we had seen from the snowy slopes of the mountains  for three long marches we followed the left bank of the growing river until at last we saw it roll its mighty volume into the vast waters of the sea  far out across the rippling ocean we described three islands the one to the left must be anoroc  at last we had come close to a solution of our problemthe road to sari  but how to reach the islands was now the foremost question in our minds  we must build a canoe  perry is a most resourceful man  he has an axiom which carries the thoughtkernel that what man has done man can do and it doesnt cut any figure with perry whether a fellow knows how to do it or not  he set out to make gunpowder once shortly after our escape from phutra and at the beginning of the confederation of the wild tribes of pellucidar  he said that some one without any knowledge of the fact that such a thing might be concocted had once stumbled upon it by accident and so he couldnt see why a fellow who knew all about powder except how to make it couldnt do as well  he worked mighty hard mixing all sorts of things together until finally he evolved a substance that looked like powder  he had been very proud of the stuff and had gone about the village of the sarians exhibiting it to every one who would listen to him and explaining what its purpose was and what terrific havoc it would work until finally the natives became so terrified at the stuff that they wouldnt come within a rod of perry and his invention  finally i suggested that we experiment with it and see what it would do so perry built a fire after placing the powder at a safe distance and then touched a glowing ember to a minute particle of the deadly explosive  it extinguished the ember  repeated experiments with it determined me that in searching for a high explosive perry had stumbled upon a fireextinguisher that would have made his fortune for him back in our own world  so now he set himself to work to build a scientific canoe  i had suggested that we construct a dugout but perry convinced me that we must build something more in keeping with our positions of supermen in this world of the stone age  we must impress these natives with our superiority he explained you must not forget david that you are emperor of pellucidar  as such you may not with dignity approach the shores of a foreign power in so crude a vessel as a dugout  i pointed out to perry that it wasnt much more incongruous for the emperor to cruise in a canoe than it was for the prime minister to attempt to build one with his own hands  he had to smile at that but in extenuation of his act he assured me that it was quite customary for prime ministers to give their personal attention to the building of imperial navies and this he said is the imperial navy of his serene highness david i emperor of the federated kingdoms of pellucidar  i grinned but perry was quite serious about it  it had always seemed rather more or less of a joke to me that i should be addressed as majesty and all the rest of it  yet my imperial power and dignity had been a very real thing during my brief reign  twenty tribes had joined the federation and their chiefs had sworn eternal fealty to one another and to me  among them were many powerful though savage nations  their chiefs we had made kings their tribal lands kingdoms  we had armed them with bows and arrows and swords in addition to their own more primitive weapons  i had trained them in military discipline and in so much of the art of war as i had gleaned from extensive reading of the campaigns of napoleon von moltke grant and the ancients  we had marked out as best we could natural boundaries dividing the various kingdoms  we had warned tribes beyond these boundaries that they must not trespass and we had marched against and severely punished those who had  we had met and defeated the mahars and the sagoths  in short we had demonstrated our rights to empire and very rapidly were we being recognized and heralded abroad when my departure for the outer world and hoojas treachery had set us back  but now i had returned  the work that fate had undone must be done again and though i must need smile at my imperial honors i none the less felt the weight of duty and obligation that rested upon my shoulders  slowly the imperial navy progressed toward completion  she was a wondrous craft but i had my doubts about her  when i voiced them to perry he reminded me gently that my people for many generations had been mineowners not shipbuilders and consequently i couldnt be expected to know much about the matter  i was minded to inquire into his hereditary fitness to design battleships but inasmuch as i already knew that his father had been a minister in a backwoods village far from the coast i hesitated lest i offend the dear old fellow  he was immensely serious about his work and i must admit that in so far as appearances went he did extremely well with the meager tools and assistance at his command  we had only two short axes and our huntingknives yet with these we hewed trees split them into planks surfaced and fitted them  the navy was some forty feet in length by ten feet beam  her sides were quite straight and fully ten feet highfor the purpose explained perry of adding dignity to her appearance and rendering it less easy for an enemy to board her  as a matter of fact i knew that he had had in mind the safety of her crew under javelinfirethe lofty sides made an admirable shelter inside she reminded me of nothing so much as a floating trench  there was also some slight analogy to a huge coffin  her prow sloped sharply backward from the waterlinequite like a line of battleship  perry had designed her more for moral effect upon an enemy i think than for any real harm she might inflict and so those parts which were to show were the most imposing  below the waterline she was practically nonexistent  she should have had considerable draft but as the enemy couldnt have seen it perry decided to do away with it and so made her flatbottomed  it was this that caused my doubts about her  there was another little idiosyncrasy of design that escaped us both until she was about ready to launchthere was no method of propulsion her sides were far too high to permit the use of sweeps and when perry suggested that we pole her i remonstrated on the grounds that it would be a most undignified and awkward manner of sweeping down upon the foe even if we could find or wield poles that would reach to the bottom of the ocean  finally i suggested that we convert her into a sailing vessel  when once the idea took hold perry was most enthusiastic about it and nothing would do but a fourmasted fullrigged ship  again i tried to dissuade him but he was simply crazy over the psychological effect which the appearance of this strange and mighty craft would have upon the natives of pellucidar  so we rigged her with thin hides for sails and dried gut for rope  neither of us knew much about sailing a fullrigged ship but that didnt worry me a great deal for i was confident that we should never be called upon to do so and as the day of launching approached i was positive of it  we had built her upon a low bank of the river close to where it emptied into the sea and just above high tide  her keel we had laid upon several rollers cut from small trees the ends of the rollers in turn resting upon parallel tracks of long saplings  her stern was toward the water  a few hours before we were ready to launch her she made quite an imposing picture for perry had insisted upon setting every shred of canvas  i told him that i didnt know much about it but i was sure that at launching the hull only should have been completed everything else being completed after she had floated safely  at the last minute there was some delay while we sought a name for her i wanted her christened the perry in honor both of her designer and that other great naval genius of another world captain oliver hazard perry of the united states navy  but perry was too modest he wouldnt hear of it  we finally decided to establish a system in the naming of the fleet battleships of the firstclass should bear the names of kingdoms of the federation armored cruisers the names of kings cruisers the names of cities and so on down the line  therefore we decided to name the first battleship sari after the first of the federated kingdoms  the launching of the sari proved easier than i contemplated  perry wanted me to get in and break something over the bow as she floated out upon the bosom of the river but i told him that i should feel safer on dry land until i saw which side up the sari would float  i could see by the expression of the old mans face that my words had hurt him but i noticed that he didnt offer to get in himself and so i felt less contrition than i might otherwise  when we cut the ropes and removed the blocks that held the sari in place she started for the water with a lunge  before she hit it she was going at a reckless speed for we had laid our tracks quite down to the water greased them and at intervals placed rollers all ready to receive the ship as she moved forward with stately dignity  but there was no dignity in the sari  when she touched the surface of the river she must have been going twenty or thirty miles an hour  her momentum carried her well out into the stream until she came to a sudden halt at the end of the long line which we had had the foresight to attach to her bow and fasten to a large tree upon the bank  the moment her progress was checked she promptly capsized  perry was overwhelmed  i didnt upbraid him nor remind him that i had told him so  his grief was so genuine and so apparent that i didnt have the heart to reproach him even were i inclined to that particular sort of meanness  come come old man i cried  its not as bad as it looks  give me a hand with this rope and well drag her up as far as we can and then when the tide goes out well try another scheme  i think we can make a go of her yet  well we managed to get her up into shallow water  when the tide receded she lay there on her side in the mud quite a pitiable object for the premier battleship of a worldthe terror of the seas was the way perry had occasionally described her  we had to work fast but before the tide came in again we had stripped her of her sails and masts righted her and filled her about a quarter full of rock ballast  if she didnt stick too fast in the mud i was sure that she would float this time right side up  i can tell you that it was with palpitating hearts that we sat upon the riverbank and watched that tide come slowly in  the tides of pellucidar dont amount to much by comparison with our higher tides of the outer world but i knew that it ought to prove ample to float the sari  nor was i mistaken  finally we had the satisfaction of seeing the vessel rise out of the mud and float slowly upstream with the tide  as the water rose we pulled her in quite close to the bank and clambered aboard  she rested safely now upon an even keel nor did she leak for she was well calked with fiber and tarry pitch  we rigged up a single short mast and light sail fastened planking down over the ballast to form a deck worked her out into midstream with a couple of sweeps and dropped our primitive stone anchor to await the turn of the tide that would bear us out to sea  while we waited we devoted the time to the construction of an upper deck since the one immediately above the ballast was some seven feet from the gunwale  the second deck was four feet above this  in it was a large commodious hatch leading to the lower deck  the sides of the ship rose three feet above the upper deck forming an excellent breastwork which we loopholed at intervals that we might lie prone and fire upon an enemy  though we were sailing out upon a peaceful mission in search of my friend ja we knew that we might meet with people of some other island who would prove unfriendly  at last the tide turned  we weighed anchor  slowly we drifted down the great river toward the sea  about us swarmed the mighty denizens of the primeval deepplesiosauri and ichthyosauria with all their horrid slimy cousins whose names were as the names of aunts and uncles to perry but which i have never been able to recall an hour after having heard them  at last we were safely launched upon the journey to which we had looked forward for so long and the results of which meant so much to me    chapter iv  friendship and treachery  the sari proved a most erratic craft  she might have done well enough upon a park lagoon if safely anchored but upon the bosom of a mighty ocean she left much to be desired  sailing with the wind she did her best but in quartering or when closehauled she drifted terribly as a nautical man might have guessed she would  we couldnt keep within miles of our course and our progress was pitifully slow  instead of making for the island of anoroc we bore far to the right until it became evident that we should have to pass between the two righthand islands and attempt to return toward anoroc from the opposite side  as we neared the islands perry was quite overcome by their beauty when we were directly between two of them he fairly went into raptures nor could i blame him  the tropical luxuriance of the foliage that dripped almost to the waters edge and the vivid colors of the blooms that shot the green made a most gorgeous spectacle  perry was right in the midst of a flowery panegyric on the wonders of the peaceful beauty of the scene when a canoe shot out from the nearest island  there were a dozen warriors in it it was quickly followed by a second and third  of course we couldnt know the intentions of the strangers but we could pretty well guess them  perry wanted to man the sweeps and try to get away from them but i soon convinced him that any speed of which the sari was capable would be far too slow to outdistance the swift though awkward dugouts of the mezops  i waited until they were quite close enough to hear me and then i hailed them  i told them that we were friends of the mezops and that we were upon a visit to ja of anoroc to which they replied that they were at war with ja and that if we would wait a minute theyd board us and throw our corpses to the azdyryths  i warned them that they would get the worst of it if they didnt leave us alone but they only shouted in derision and paddled swiftly toward us  it was evident that they were considerably impressed by the appearance and dimensions of our craft but as these fellows know no fear they were not at all awed  seeing that they were determined to give battle i leaned over the rail of the sari and brought the imperial battlesquadron of the emperor of pellucidar into action for the first time in the history of a world in other and simpler words i fired my revolver at the nearest canoe  the effect was magical  a warrior rose from his knees threw his paddle aloft stiffened into rigidity for an instant and then toppled overboard  the others ceased paddling and with wide eyes looked first at me and then at the battling seathings which fought for the corpse of their comrade  to them it must have seemed a miracle that i should be able to stand at thrice the range of the most powerful javelinthrower and with a loud noise and a smudge of smoke slay one of their number with an invisible missile  but only for an instant were they paralyzed with wonder  then with savage shouts they fell once more to their paddles and forged rapidly toward us  again and again i fired  at each shot a warrior sank to the bottom of the canoe or tumbled overboard  when the prow of the first craft touched the side of the sari it contained only dead and dying men  the other two dugouts were approaching rapidly so i turned my attention toward them  i think that they must have been commencing to have some doubtsthose wild naked red warriorsfor when the first man fell in the second boat the others stopped paddling and commenced to jabber among themselves  the third boat pulled up alongside the second and its crews joined in the conference  taking advantage of the lull in the battle i called out to the survivors to return to their shore  i have no fight with you i cried and then i told them who i was and added that if they would live in peace they must sooner or later join forces with me  go back now to your people i counseled them and tell them that you have seen david i emperor of the federated kingdoms of pellucidar and that singlehanded he has overcome you just as he intends overcoming the mahars and the sagoths and any other peoples of pellucidar who threaten the peace and welfare of his empire  slowly they turned the noses of their canoes toward land  it was evident that they were impressed yet that they were loath to give up without further contesting my claim to naval supremacy was also apparent for some of their number seemed to be exhorting the others to a renewal of the conflict  however at last they drew slowly away and the sari which had not decreased her snaillike speed during this her first engagement continued upon her slow uneven way  presently perry stuck his head up through the hatch and hailed me  have the scoundrels departed he asked  have you killed them all  those whom i failed to kill have departed perry i replied  he came out on deck and peering over the side descried the lone canoe floating a short distance astern with its grim and grisly freight farther his eyes wandered to the retreating boats  david said he at last this is a notable occasion  it is a great day in the annals of pellucidar  we have won a glorious victory  your majestys navy has routed a fleet of the enemy thrice its own size manned by ten times as many men  let us give thanks  i could scarce restrain a smile at perrys use of the pronoun we yet i was glad to share the rejoicing with him as i shall always be glad to share everything with the dear old fellow  perry is the only male coward i have ever known whom i could respect and love  he was not created for fighting but i think that if the occasion should ever arise where it became necessary he would give his life cheerfully for meyes i know it  it took us a long time to work around the islands and draw in close to anoroc  in the leisure afforded we took turns working on our map and by means of the compass and a little guesswork we set down the shoreline we had left and the three islands with fair accuracy  crossed sabers marked the spot where the first great naval engagement of a world had taken place  in a notebook we jotted down as had been our custom details that would be of historical value later  opposite anoroc we came to anchor quite close to shore  i knew from my previous experience with the tortuous trails of the island that i could never find my way inland to the hidden treevillage of the mezop chieftain ja so we remained aboard the sari firing our express rifles at intervals to attract the attention of the natives  after some ten shots had been fired at considerable intervals a body of coppercolored warriors appeared upon the shore  they watched us for a moment and then i hailed them asking the whereabouts of my old friend ja  they did not reply at once but stood with their heads together in serious and animated discussion  continually they turned their eyes toward our strange craft  it was evident that they were greatly puzzled by our appearance as well as unable to explain the source of the loud noises that had attracted their attention to us  at last one of the warriors addressed us  who are you who seek ja he asked  what would you of our chief  we are friends i replied  i am david  tell ja that david whose life be once saved from a sithic has come again to visit him  if you will send out a canoe we will come ashore  we cannot bring our great warship closer in  again they talked for a considerable time  then two of them entered a canoe that several dragged from its hidingplace in the jungle and paddled swiftly toward us  they were magnificent specimens of manhood  perry had never seen a member of this red race close to before  in fact the dead men in the canoe we had left astern after the battle and the survivors who were paddling rapidly toward their shore were the first he ever had seen he had been greatly impressed by their physical beauty and the promise of superior intelligence which their wellshaped skulls gave  the two who now paddled out received us into their canoe with dignified courtesy  to my inquiries relative to ja they explained that he had not been in the village when our signals were heard but that runners had been sent out after him and that doubtless he was already upon his way to the coast  one of the men remembered me from the occasion of my former visit to the island he was extremely agreeable the moment that he came close enough to recognize me he said that ja would be delighted to welcome me and that all the tribe of anoroc knew of me by repute and had received explicit instructions from their chieftain that if any of them should ever come upon me to show me every kindness and attention  upon shore we were received with equal honor  while we stood conversing with our bronze friends a tall warrior leaped suddenly from the jungle  it was ja  as his eyes fell upon me his face lighted with pleasure he came quickly forward to greet me after the manner of his tribe  toward perry he was equally hospitable  the old man fell in love with the savage giant as completely as had i ja conducted us along the mazelike trail to his strange village where he gave over one of the treehouses for our exclusive use  perry was much interested in the unique habitation which resembled nothing so much as a huge wasps nest built around the bole of a tree well above the ground  after we had eaten and rested ja came to see us with a number of his head men  they listened attentively to my story which included a narrative of the events leading to the formation of the federated kingdoms the battle with the mahars my journey to the outer world and my return to pellucidar and search for sari and my mate  ja told me that the mezops had heard something of the federation and had been much interested in it  he had even gone so far as to send a party of warriors toward sari to investigate the reports and to arrange for the entrance of anoroc into the empire in case it appeared that there was any truth in the rumors that one of the aims of the federation was the overthrow of the mahars  the delegation had met with a party of sagoths  as there had been a truce between the mahars and the mezops for many generations they camped with these warriors of the reptiles from whom they learned that the federation had gone to pieces  so the party returned to anoroc  when i showed ja our map and explained its purpose to him he was much interested  the location of anoroc the mountains of the clouds the river and the strip of seacoast were all familiar to him  he quickly indicated the position of the inland sea and close beside it the city of phutra where one of the powerful mahar nations had its seat  he likewise showed us where sari should be and carried his own coastline as far north and south as it was known to him  his additions to the map convinced us that greenwich lay upon the verge of this same sea and that it might be reached by water more easily than by the arduous crossing of the mountains or the dangerous approach through phutra which lay almost directly in line between anoroc and greenwich to the northwest  if sari lay upon the same water then the shoreline must bend far back toward the southwest of greenwichan assumption which by the way we found later to be true  also sari was upon a lofty plateau at the southern end of a mighty gulf of the great ocean  the location which ja gave to distant amoz puzzled us for it placed it due north of greenwich apparently in midocean  as ja had never been so far and knew only of amoz through hearsay we thought that he must be mistaken but he was not  amoz lies directly north of greenwich across the mouth of the same gulf as that upon which sari is  the sense of direction and location of these primitive pellucidarians is little short of uncanny as i have had occasion to remark in the past  you may take one of them to the uttermost ends of his world to places of which he has never even heard yet without sun or moon or stars to guide him without map or compass he will travel straight for home in the shortest direction  mountains rivers and seas may have to be gone around but never once does his sense of direction fail himthe homing instinct is supreme  in the same remarkable way they never forget the location of any place to which they have ever been and know that of many of which they have only heard from others who have visited them  in short each pellucidarian is a walking geography of his own district and of much of the country contiguous thereto  it always proved of the greatest aid to perry and me nevertheless we were anxious to enlarge our map for we at least were not endowed with the homing instinct  after several long councils it was decided that in order to expedite matters perry should return to the prospector with a strong party of mezops and fetch the freight i had brought from the outer world  ja and his warriors were much impressed by our firearms and were also anxious to build boats with sails  as we had arms at the prospector and also books on boatbuilding we thought that it might prove an excellent idea to start these naturally maritime people upon the construction of a well built navy of staunch sailingvessels  i was sure that with definite plans to go by perry could oversee the construction of an adequate flotilla  i warned him however not to be too ambitious and to forget about dreadnoughts and armored cruisers for a while and build instead a few small sailingboats that could be manned by four or five men  i was to proceed to sari and while prosecuting my search for dian attempt at the same time the rehabilitation of the federation  perry was going as far as possible by water with the chances that the entire trip might be made in that manner which proved to be the fact  with a couple of mezops as companions i started for sari  in order to avoid crossing the principal range of the mountains of the clouds we took a route that passed a little way south of phutra  we had eaten four times and slept once and were as my companions told me not far from the great mahar city when we were suddenly confronted by a considerable band of sagoths  they did not attack us owing to the peace which exists between the mahars and the mezops but i could see that they looked upon me with considerable suspicion  my friends told them that i was a stranger from a remote country and as we had previously planned against such a contingency i pretended ignorance of the language which the human beings of pellucidar employ in conversing with the gorillalike soldiery of the mahars  i noticed and not without misgivings that the leader of the sagoths eyed me with an expression that betokened partial recognition  i was sure that he had seen me before during the period of my incarceration in phutra and that he was trying to recall my identity  it worried me not a little  i was extremely thankful when we bade them adieu and continued upon our journey  several times during the next few marches i became acutely conscious of the sensation of being watched by unseen eyes but i did not speak of my suspicions to my companions  later i had reason to regret my reticence for  well this is how it happened  we had killed an antelope and after eating our fill i had lain down to sleep  the pellucidarians who seem seldom if ever to require sleep joined me in this instance for we had had a very trying march along the northern foothills of the mountains of the clouds and now with their bellies filled with meat they seemed ready for slumber  when i awoke it was with a start to find a couple of huge sagoths astride me  they pinioned my arms and legs and later chained my wrists behind my back  then they let me up  i saw my companions the brave fellows lay dead where they had slept javelined to death without a chance at selfdefense  i was furious  i threatened the sagoth leader with all sorts of dire reprisals but when he heard me speak the hybrid language that is the medium of communication between his kind and the human race of the inner world he only grinned as much as to say i thought so  they had not taken my revolvers or ammunition away from me because they did not know what they were but my heavy rifle i had lost  they simply left it where it had lain beside me  so low in the scale of intelligence are they that they had not sufficient interest in this strange object even to fetch it along with them  i knew from the direction of our march that they were taking me to phutra  once there i did not need much of an imagination to picture what my fate would be it was the arena and a wild thag or fierce tarag for meunless the mahars elected to take me to the pits  in that case my end would be no more certain though infinitely more horrible and painful for in the pits i should be subjected to cruel vivisection  from what i had once seen of their methods in the pits of phutra i knew them to be the opposite of merciful whereas in the arena i should be quickly despatched by some savage beast  arrived at the underground city i was taken immediately before a slimy mahar  when the creature had received the report of the sagoth its cold eyes glistened with malice and hatred as they were turned balefully upon me  i knew then that my identity had been guessed  with a show of excitement that i had never before seen evinced by a member of the dominant race of pellucidar the mahar hustled me away heavily guarded through the main avenue of the city to one of the principal buildings  here we were ushered into a great hall where presently many mahars gathered  in utter silence they conversed for they have no oral speech since they are without auditory nerves  their method of communication perry has likened to the projection of a sixth sense into a fourth dimension where it becomes cognizable to the sixth sense of their audience  be that as it may however it was evident that i was the subject of discussion and from the hateful looks bestowed upon me not a particularly pleasant subject  how long i waited for their decision i do not know but it must have been a very long time  finally one of the sagoths addressed me  he was acting as interpreter for his masters  the mahars will spare your life he said and release you on one condition  and what is that condition i asked though i could guess its terms  that you return to them that which you stole from the pits of phutra when you killed the four mahars and escaped he replied  i had thought that that would be it  the great secret upon which depended the continuance of the mahar race was safely hid where only dian and i knew  i ventured to imagine that they would have given me much more than my liberty to have it safely in their keeping again but after thatwhat  would they keep their promises  i doubted it  with the secret of artificial propagation once more in their hands their numbers would soon be made so to overrun the world of pellucidar that there could be no hope for the eventual supremacy of the human race the cause for which i so devoutly hoped for which i had consecrated my life and for which i was not willing to give my life  yes in that moment as i stood before the heartless tribunal i felt that my life would be a very little thing to give could it save to the human race of pellucidar the chance to come into its own by insuring the eventual extinction of the hated powerful mahars  come exclaimed the sagoths  the mighty mahars await your reply  you may say to them i answered that i shall not tell them where the great secret is hid  when this had been translated to them there was a great beating of reptilian wings gaping of sharpfanged jaws and hideous hissing  i thought that they were about to fall upon me on the spot and so i laid my hands upon my revolvers but at length they became more quiet and presently transmitted some command to my sagoth guard the chief of which laid a heavy hand upon my arm and pushed me roughly before him from the audiencechamber  they took me to the pits where i lay carefully guarded  i was sure that i was to be taken to the vivisection laboratory and it required all my courage to fortify myself against the terrors of so fearful a death  in pellucidar where there is no time deathagonies may endure for eternities  accordingly i had to steel myself against an endless doom which now stared me in the face    chapter v  surprises  but at last the allotted moment arrivedthe moment for which i had been trying to prepare myself for how long i could not even guess  a great sagoth came and spoke some words of command to those who watched over me  i was jerked roughly to my feet and with little consideration hustled upward toward the higher levels  out into the broad avenue they conducted me where amid huge throngs of mahars sagoths and heavily guarded slaves i was led or rather pushed and shoved roughly along in the same direction that the mob moved  i had seen such a concourse of people once before in the buried city of phutra i guessed and rightly that we were bound for the great arena where slaves who are condemned to death meet their end  into the vast amphitheater they took me stationing me at the extreme end of the arena  the queen came with her slimy sickening retinue the seats were filled  the show was about to commence  then from a little doorway in the opposite end of the structure a girl was led into the arena  she was at a considerable distance from me  i could not see her features  i wondered what fate awaited this other poor victim and myself and why they had chosen to have us die together  my own fate or rather my thought of it was submerged in the natural pity i felt for this lone girl doomed to die horribly beneath the cold cruel eyes of her awful captors  of what crime could she be guilty that she must expiate it in the dreaded arena  as i stood thus thinking another door this time at one of the long sides of the arena was thrown open and into the theater of death slunk a mighty tarag the huge cave tiger of the stone age  at my sides were my revolvers  my captors had not taken them from me because they did not yet realize their nature  doubtless they thought them some strange manner of warclub and as those who are condemned to the arena are permitted weapons of defense they let me keep them  the girl they had armed with a javelin  a brass pin would have been almost as effective against the ferocious monster they had loosed upon her  the tarag stood for a moment looking about himfirst up at the vast audience and then about the arena  he did not seem to see me at all but his eyes fell presently upon the girl  a hideous roar broke from his titanic lungsa roar which ended in a longdrawn scream that is more human than the deathcry of a tortured womanmore human but more awesome  i could scarce restrain a shudder  slowly the beast turned and moved toward the girl  then it was that i came to myself and to a realization of my duty  quickly and as noiselessly as possible i ran down the arena in pursuit of the grim creature  as i ran i drew one of my pitifully futile weapons  ah could i but have had my lost expressgun in my hands at that moment a single wellplaced shot would have crumbled even this great monster the best i could hope to accomplish was to divert the thing from the girl to myself and then to place as many bullets as possible in it before it reached and mauled me into insensibility and death  there is a certain unwritten law of the arena that vouchsafes freedom and immunity to the victor be he beast or human beingboth of whom by the way are all the same to the mahar  that is they were accustomed to look upon man as a lower animal before perry and i broke through the pellucidarian crust but i imagine that they were beginning to alter their views a trifle and to realize that in the gilaktheir word for human beingthey had a highly organized reasoning being to contend with  be that as it may the chances were that the tarag alone would profit by the law of the arena  a few more of his long strides a prodigious leap and he would be upon the girl  i raised a revolver and fired the bullet struck him in the left hind leg  it couldnt have damaged him much but the report of the shot brought him around facing me  i think the snarling visage of a huge enraged sabertoothed tiger is one of the most terrible sights in the world  especially if he be snarling at you and there be nothing between the two of you but bare sand  even as he faced me a little cry from the girl carried my eyes beyond the brute to her face  hers was fastened upon me with an expression of incredulity that baffles description  there was both hope and horror in them too  dian i cried  my heavens dian  i saw her lips form the name david as with raised javelin she rushed forward upon the tarag  she was a tigress thena primitive savage female defending her loved one  before she could reach the beast with her puny weapon i fired again at the point where the tarags neck met his left shoulder  if i could get a bullet through there it might reach his heart  the bullet didnt reach his heart but it stopped him for an instant  it was then that a strange thing happened  i heard a great hissing from the stands occupied by the mahars and as i glanced toward them i saw three mighty thipdarsthe winged dragons that guard the queen or as perry calls them pterodactylsrise swiftly from their rocks and dart lightninglike toward the center of the arena  they are huge powerful reptiles  one of them with the advantage which his wings might give him would easily be a match for a cave bear or a tarag  these three to my consternation swooped down upon the tarag as he was gathering himself for a final charge upon me  they buried their talons in his back and lifted him bodily from the arena as if he had been a chicken in the clutches of a hawk  what could it mean  i was baffled for an explanation but with the tarag gone i lost no time in hastening to dians side  with a little cry of delight she threw herself into my arms  so lost were we in the ecstasy of reunion that neither of usto this daycan tell what became of the tarag  the first thing we were aware of was the presence of a body of sagoths about us  gruffly they commanded us to follow them  they led us from the arena and back through the streets of phutra to the audience chamber in which i had been tried and sentenced  here we found ourselves facing the same cold cruel tribunal  again a sagoth acted as interpreter  he explained that our lives bad been spared because at the last moment tualsa had returned to phutra and seeing me in the arena had prevailed upon the queen to spare my life  who is tualsa i asked  a mahar whose last male ancestor wasages agothe last of the male rulers among the mahars he replied  why should she wish to have my life spared  he shrugged his shoulders and then repeated my question to the mahar spokesman  when the latter had explained in the strange signlanguage that passes for speech between the mahars and their fighting men the sagoth turned again to me  for a long time you had tualsa in your power he explained  you might easily have killed her or abandoned her in a strange worldbut you did neither  you did not harm her and you brought her back with you to pellucidar and set her free to return to phutra  this is your reward  now i understood  the mahar who had been my involuntary companion upon my return to the outer world was tualsa  this was the first time that i had learned the ladys name  i thanked fate that i had not left her upon the sands of the saharaor put a bullet in her as i had been tempted to do  i was surprised to discover that gratitude was a characteristic of the dominant race of pellucidar  i could never think of them as aught but coldblooded brainless reptiles though perry had devoted much time in explaining to me that owing to a strange freak of evolution among all the genera of the inner world this species of the reptilia had advanced to a position quite analogous to that which man holds upon the outer crust  he had often told me that there was every reason to believe from their writings which he had learned to read while we were incarcerated in phutra that they were a just race and that in certain branches of science and arts they were quite well advanced especially in genetics and metaphysics engineering and architecture  while it had always been difficult for me to look upon these things as other than slimy winged crocodileswhich by the way they do not at all resemblei was now forced to a realization of the fact that i was in the hands of enlightened creaturesfor justice and gratitude are certain hallmarks of rationality and culture  but what they purposed for us further was of most imminent interest to me  they might save us from the tarag and yet not free us  they looked upon us yet to some extent i knew as creatures of a lower order and so as we are unable to place ourselves in the position of the brutes we enslavethinking that they are happier in bondage than in the free fulfilment of the purposes for which nature intended themthe mahars too might consider our welfare better conserved in captivity than among the dangers of the savage freedom we craved naturally i was next impelled to inquire their further intent  to my question put through the sagoth interpreter i received the reply that having spared my life they considered that tualsas debt of gratitude was canceled  they still had against me however the crime of which i had been guiltythe unforgivable crime of stealing the great secret  they therefore intended holding dian and me prisoners until the manuscript was returned to them  they would they said send an escort of sagoths with me to fetch the precious document from its hidingplace keeping dian at phutra as a hostage and releasing us both the moment that the document was safely restored to their queen  there was no doubt but that they had the upper hand  however there was so much more at stake than the liberty or even the lives of dian and myself that i did not deem it expedient to accept their offer without giving the matter careful thought  without the great secret this maleless race must eventually become extinct  for ages they had fertilized their eggs by an artificial process the secret of which lay hidden in the little cave of a faroff valley where dian and i had spent our honeymoon  i was none too sure that i could find the valley again nor that i cared to  so long as the powerful reptilian race of pellucidar continued to propagate just so long would the position of man within the inner world be jeopardized  there could not be two dominant races  i said as much to dian  you used to tell me she replied of the wonderful things you could accomplish with the inventions of your own world  now you have returned with all that is necessary to place this great power in the hands of the men of pellucidar  you told me of great engines of destruction which would cast a bursting ball of metal among our enemies killing hundreds of them at one time  you told me of mighty fortresses of stone which a thousand men armed with big and little engines such as these could hold forever against a million sagoths  you told me of great canoes which moved across the water without paddles and which spat death from holes in their sides  all these may now belong to the men of pellucidar  why should we fear the mahars  let them breed let their numbers increase by thousands  they will be helpless before the power of the emperor of pellucidar  but if you remain a prisoner in phutra what may we accomplish  what could the men of pellucidar do without you to lead them  they would fight among themselves and while they fought the mahars would fall upon them and even though the mahar race should die out of what value would the emancipation of the human race be to them without the knowledge which you alone may wield to guide them toward the wonderful civilization of which you have told me so much that i long for its comforts and luxuries as i never before longed for anything  no david the mahars cannot harm us if you are at liberty  let them have their secret that you and i may return to our people and lead them to the conquest of all pellucidar  it was plain that dian was ambitious and that her ambition had not dulled her reasoning faculties  she was right  nothing could be gained by remaining bottled up in phutra for the rest of our lives  it was true that perry might do much with the contents of the prospector or iron mole in which i had brought down the implements of outerworld civilization but perry was a man of peace  he could never weld the warring factions of the disrupted federation  he could never win new tribes to the empire  he would fiddle around manufacturing gunpowder and trying to improve upon it until some one blew him up with his own invention  he wasnt practical  he never would get anywhere without a balancewheelwithout some one to direct his energies  perry needed me and i needed him  if we were going to do anything for pellucidar we must be free to do it together  the outcome of it all was that i agreed to the mahars proposition they promised that dian would be well treated and protected from every indignity during my absence  so i set out with a hundred sagoths in search of the little valley which i had stumbled upon by accident and which i might and might not find again  we traveled directly toward sari  stopping at the camp where i had been captured i recovered my express rifle for which i was very thankful  i found it lying where i had left it when i had been overpowered in my sleep by the sagoths who bad captured me and slain my mezop companions  on the way i added materially to my map an occupation which did not elicit from the sagoths even a shadow of interest  i felt that the human race of pellucidar had little to fear from these gorillamen they were fightersthat was all  we might even use them later ourselves in this same capacity  they had not sufficient brain power to constitute a menace to the advancement of the human race  as we neared the spot where i hoped to find the little valley i became more and more confident of success  every landmark was familiar to me and i was sure now that i knew the exact location of the cave  it was at about this time that i sighted a number of the halfnaked warriors of the human race of pellucidar  they were marching across our front  at sight of us they halted that there would be a fight i could not doubt  these sagoths would never permit an opportunity for the capture of slaves for their mahar masters to escape them  i saw that the men were armed with bows and arrows long lances and swords so i guessed that they must have been members of the federation for only my people had been thus equipped  before perry and i came the men of pellucidar had only the crudest weapons wherewith to slay one another  the sagoths too were evidently expecting battle  with savage shouts they rushed forward toward the human warriors  then a strange thing happened  the leader of the human beings stepped forward with upraised hands  the sagoths ceased their warcries and advanced slowly to meet him  there was a long parley during which i could see that i was often the subject of their discourse  the sagoths leader pointed in the direction in which i had told him the valley lay  evidently he was explaining the nature of our expedition to the leader of the warriors  it was all a puzzle to me  what human being could be upon such excellent terms with the gorillamen  i couldnt imagine  i tried to get a good look at the fellow but the sagoths had left me in the rear with a guard when they had advanced to battle and the distance was too great for me to recognize the features of any of the human beings  finally the parley was concluded and the men continued on their way while the sagoths returned to where i stood with my guard  it was time for eating so we stopped where we were and made our meal  the sagoths didnt tell me who it was they had met and i did not ask though i must confess that i was quite curious  they permitted me to sleep at this halt  afterward we took up the last leg of our journey  i found the valley without difficulty and led my guard directly to the cave  at its mouth the sagoths halted and i entered alone  i noticed as i felt about the floor in the dim light that there was a pile of freshturned rubble there  presently my hands came to the spot where the great secret had been buried  there was a cavity where i had carefully smoothed the earth over the hidingplace of the documentthe manuscript was gone  frantically i searched the whole interior of the cave several times over but without other result than a complete confirmation of my worst fears  someone had been here ahead of me and stolen the great secret  the one thing within pellucidar which might free dian and me was gone nor was it likely that i should ever learn its whereabouts  if a mahar had found it which was quite improbable the chances were that the dominant race would never divulge the fact that they had recovered the precious document  if a cave man had happened upon it he would have no conception of its meaning or value and as a consequence it would be lost or destroyed in short order  with bowed head and broken hopes i came out of the cave and told the sagoth chieftain what i had discovered  it didnt mean much to the fellow who doubtless had but little better idea of the contents of the document i had been sent to fetch to his masters than would the cave man who in all probability had discovered it  the sagoth knew only that i had failed in my mission so he took advantage of the fact to make the return journey to phutra as disagreeable as possible  i did not rebel though i had with me the means to destroy them all  i did not dare rebel because of the consequences to dian  i intended demanding her release on the grounds that she was in no way guilty of the theft and that my failure to recover the document had not lessened the value of the good faith i had had in offering to do so  the mahars might keep me in slavery if they chose but dian should be returned safely to her people  i was full of my scheme when we entered phutra and i was conducted directly to the great audiencechamber  the mahars listened to the report of the sagoth chieftain and so difficult is it to judge their emotions from their almost expressionless countenance that i was at a loss to know how terrible might be their wrath as they learned that their great secret upon which rested the fate of their race might now be irretrievably lost  presently i could see that she who presided was communicating something to the sagoth interpreterdoubtless something to be transmitted to me which might give me a forewarning of the fate which lay in store for me one thing i had decided definitely if they would not free dian i should turn loose upon phutra with my little arsenal  alone i might even win to freedom and if i could learn where dian was imprisoned it would be worth the attempt to free her  my thoughts were interrupted by the interpreter  the mighty mahars he said are unable to reconcile your statement that the document is lost with your action in sending it to them by a special messenger  they wish to know if you have so soon forgotten the truth or if you are merely ignoring it  i sent them no document i cried  ask them what they mean  they say he went on after conversing with the mahar for a moment that just before your return to phutra hooja the sly one came bringing the great secret with him  he said that you had sent him ahead with it asking him to deliver it and return to sari where you would await him bringing the girl with him  dian i gasped  the mahars have given over dian into the keeping of hooja  surely he replied  what of it she is only a gilak as you or i would say she is only a cow    chapter vi  a pendent world  the mahars set me free as they had promised but with strict injunctions never to approach phutra or any other mahar city  they also made it perfectly plain that they considered me a dangerous creature and that having wiped the slate clean in so far as they were under obligations to me they now considered me fair prey  should i again fall into their hands they intimated it would go ill with me  they would not tell me in which direction hooja had set forth with dian so i departed from phutra filled with bitterness against the mahars and rage toward the sly one who had once again robbed me of my greatest treasure  at first i was minded to go directly back to anoroc but upon second thought turned my face toward sari as i felt that somewhere in that direction hooja would travel his own country lying in that general direction  of my journey to sari it is only necessary to say that it was fraught with the usual excitement and adventure incident to all travel across the face of savage pellucidar  the dangers however were greatly reduced through the medium of my armament  i often wondered how it had happened that i had ever survived the first ten years of my life within the inner world when naked and primitively armed i had traversed great areas of her beastridden surface  with the aid of my map which i had kept with great care during my march with the sagoths in search of the great secret i arrived at sari at last  as i topped the lofty plateau in whose rocky cliffs the principal tribe of sarians find their cavehomes a great hue and cry arose from those who first discovered me  like wasps from their nests the hairy warriors poured from their caves the bows with their poisontipped arrows which i had taught them to fashion and to use were raised against me  swords of hammered ironanother of my innovationsmenaced me as with lusty shouts the horde charged down  it was a critical moment  before i should be recognized i might be dead  it was evident that all semblance of intertribal relationship had ceased with my going and that my people had reverted to their former savage suspicious hatred of all strangers  my garb must have puzzled them too for never before of course had they seen a man clothed in khaki and puttees  leaning my express rifle against my body i raised both hands aloft  it was the peacesign that is recognized everywhere upon the surface of pellucidar  the charging warriors paused and surveyed me  i looked for my friend ghak the hairy one king of sari and presently i saw him coming from a distance  ah but it was good to see his mighty hairy form once more a friend was ghaka friend well worth the having and it had been some time since i had seen a friend  shouldering his way through the throng of warriors the mighty chieftain advanced toward me  there was an expression of puzzlement upon his fine features  he crossed the space between the warriors and myself halting before me  i did not speak  i did not even smile  i wanted to see if ghak my principal lieutenant would recognize me  for some time he stood there looking me over carefully  his eyes took in my large pith helmet my khaki jacket and bandoleers of cartridges the two revolvers swinging at my hips the large rifle resting against my body  still i stood with my hands above my head  he examined my puttees and my strong tan shoesa little the worse for wear now  then he glanced up once more to my face  as his gaze rested there quite steadily for some moments i saw recognition tinged with awe creep across his countenance  presently without a word he took one of my hands in his and dropping to one knee raised my fingers to his lips  perry had taught them this trick nor ever did the most polished courtier of all the grand courts of europe perform the little act of homage with greater grace and dignity  quickly i raised ghak to his feet clasping both his hands in mine  i think there must have been tears in my eyes theni know i felt too full for words  the king of sari turned toward his warriors  our emperor has come back he announced  come hither and  but he got no further for the shouts that broke from those savage throats would have drowned the voice of heaven itself  i had never guessed how much they thought of me  as they clustered around almost fighting for the chance to kiss my hand i saw again the vision of empire which i had thought faded forever  with such as these i could conquer a world  with such as these i would conquer one if the sarians had remained loyal so too would the amozites be loyal still and the kalians and the suvians and all the great tribes who had formed the federation that was to emancipate the human race of pellucidar  perry was safe with the mezops i was safe with the sarians now if dian were but safe with me the future would look bright indeed  it did not take long to outline to ghak all that had befallen me since i had departed from pellucidar and to get down to the business of finding dian which to me at that moment was of even greater importance than the very empire itself  when i told him that hooja had stolen her he stamped his foot in rage  it is always the sly one he cried  it was hooja who caused the first trouble between you and the beautiful one  it was hooja who betrayed our trust and all but caused our recapture by the sagoths that time we escaped from phutra  it was hooja who tricked you and substituted a mahar for dian when you started upon your return journey to your own world  it was hooja who schemed and lied until he had turned the kingdoms one against another and destroyed the federation  when we had him in our power we were foolish to let him live  next time  ghak did not need to finish his sentence  he has become a very powerful enemy now i replied  that he is allied in some way with the mahars is evidenced by the familiarity of his relations with the sagoths who were accompanying me in search of the great secret for it must have been hooja whom i saw conversing with them just before we reached the valley  doubtless they told him of our quest and he hastened on ahead of us discovered the cave and stole the document  well does he deserve his appellation of the sly one  with ghak and his head men i held a number of consultations  the upshot of them was a decision to combine our search for dian with an attempt to rebuild the crumbled federation  to this end twenty warriors were despatched in pairs to ten of the leading kingdoms with instructions to make every effort to discover the whereabouts of hooja and dian while prosecuting their missions to the chieftains to whom they were sent  ghak was to remain at home to receive the various delegations which we invited to come to sari on the business of the federation  four hundred warriors were started for anoroc to fetch perry and the contents of the prospector to the capitol of the empire which was also the principal settlements of the sarians  at first it was intended that i remain at sari that i might be in readiness to hasten forth at the first report of the discovery of dian but i found the inaction in the face of my deep solicitude for the welfare of my mate so galling that scarce had the several units departed upon their missions before i too chafed to be actively engaged upon the search  it was after my second sleep subsequent to the departure of the warriors as i recall that i at last went to ghak with the admission that i could no longer support the intolerable longing to be personally upon the trail of my lost love  ghak tried to dissuade me though i could tell that his heart was with me in my wish to be away and really doing something  it was while we were arguing upon the subject that a stranger with hands above his head entered the village  he was immediately surrounded by warriors and conducted to ghaks presence  the fellow was a typical cave mansquat muscular and hairy and of a type i had not seen before  his features like those of all the primeval men of pellucidar were regular and fine  his weapons consisted of a stone ax and knife and a heavy knobbed bludgeon of wood his skin was very white  who are you asked ghak  and whence come you  i am kolk son of goork who is chief of the thurians replied the stranger  from thuria i have come in search of the land of amoz where dwells dacor the strong one who stole my sister canda the graceful one to be his mate  we of thuria had heard of a great chieftain who has bound together many tribes and my father has sent me to dacor to learn if there be truth in these stories and if so to offer the services of thuria to him whom we have heard called emperor  the stories are true replied ghak and here is the emperor of whom you have heard  you need travel no farther  kolk was delighted  he told us much of the wonderful resources of thuria the land of awful shadow and of his long journey in search of amoz  and why i asked does goork your father desire to join his kingdom to the empire  there are two reasons replied the young man  forever have the mahars who dwell beyond the lidi plains which lie at the farther rim of the land of awful shadow taken heavy toll of our people whom they either force into lifelong slavery or fatten for their feasts  we have heard that the great emperor makes successful war upon the mahars against whom we should be glad to fight  recently has another reason come  upon a great island which lies in the sojar az but a short distance from our shores a wicked man has collected a great band of outcast warriors of all tribes  even are there many sagoths among them sent by the mahars to aid the wicked one  this band makes raids upon our villages and it is constantly growing in size and strength for the mahars give liberty to any of their male prisoners who will promise to fight with this band against the enemies of the mahars  it is the purpose of the mahars thus to raise a force of our own kind to combat the growth and menace of the new empire of which i have come to seek information  all this we learned from one of our own warriors who had pretended to sympathize with this band and had then escaped at the first opportunity  who could this man be i asked ghak who leads so vile a movement against his own kind  his name is hooja spoke up kolk answering my question  ghak and i looked at each other  relief was written upon his countenance and i know that it was beating strongly in my heart  at last we had discovered a tangible clue to the whereabouts of hoojaand with the clue a guide  but when i broached the subject to kolk he demurred  he had come a long way he explained to see his sister and to confer with dacor moreover he had instructions from his father which he could not ignore lightly  but even so he would return with me and show me the way to the island of the thurian shore if by doing so we might accomplish anything  but we cannot he urged  hooja is powerful  he has thousands of warriors  he has only to call upon his mahar allies to receive a countless horde of sagoths to do his bidding against his human enemies  let us wait until you may gather an equal horde from the kingdoms of your empire  then we may march against hooja with some show of success  but first must you lure him to the mainland for who among you knows how to construct the strange things that carry hooja and his band back and forth across the water  we are not island people  we do not go upon the water  we know nothing of such things  i couldnt persuade him to do more than direct me upon the way  i showed him my map which now included a great area of country extending from anoroc upon the east to sari upon the west and from the river south of the mountains of the clouds north to amoz  as soon as i had explained it to him he drew a line with his finger showing a seacoast far to the west and south of sari and a great circle which he said marked the extent of the land of awful shadow in which lay thuria  the shadow extended southeast of the coast out into the sea halfway to a large island which he said was the seat of hoojas traitorous government  the island itself lay in the light of the noonday sun northwest of the coast and embracing a part of thuria lay the lidi plains upon the northwestern verge of which was situated the mahar city which took such heavy toll of the thurians  thus were the unhappy people now between two fires with hooja upon one side and the mahars upon the other  i did not wonder that they sent out an appeal for succor  though ghak and kolk both attempted to dissuade me i was determined to set out at once nor did i delay longer than to make a copy of my map to be given to perry that he might add to his that which i had set down since we parted  i left a letter for him as well in which among other things i advanced the theory that the sojar az or great sea which kolk mentioned as stretching eastward from thuria might indeed be the same mighty ocean as that which swinging around the southern end of a continent ran northward along the shore opposite phutra mingling its waters with the huge gulf upon which lay sari amoz and greenwich  against this possibility i urged him to hasten the building of a fleet of small sailingvessels which we might utilize should i find it impossible to entice hoojas horde to the mainland  i told ghak what i had written and suggested that as soon as he could he should make new treaties with the various kingdoms of the empire collect an army and march toward thuriathis of course against the possibility of my detention through some cause or other  kolk gave me a sign to his fathera lidi or beast of burden crudely scratched upon a bit of bone and beneath the lidi a man and a flower all very rudely done perhaps but none the less effective as i well knew from my long years among the primitive men of pellucidar  the lidi is the tribal beast of the thurians the man and the flower in the combination in which they appeared bore a double significance as they constituted not only a message to the effect that the bearer came in peace but were also kolks signature  and so armed with my credentials and my small arsenal i set out alone upon my quest for the dearest girl in this world or yours  kolk gave me explicit directions though with my map i do not believe that i could have gone wrong  as a matter of fact i did not need the map at all since the principal landmark of the first half of my journey a gigantic mountainpeak was plainly visible from sari though a good hundred miles away  at the southern base of this mountain a river rose and ran in a westerly direction finally turning south and emptying into the sojar az some forty miles northeast of thuria  all that i had to do was follow this river to the sea and then follow the coast to thuria  two hundred and forty miles of wild mountain and primeval jungle of untracked plain of nameless rivers of deadly swamps and savage forests lay ahead of me yet never had i been more eager for an adventure than now for never had more depended upon haste and success  i do not know how long a time that journey required and only half did i appreciate the varied wonders that each new march unfolded before me for my mind and heart were filled with but a single imagethat of a perfect girl whose great dark eyes looked bravely forth from a frame of raven hair  it was not until i had passed the high peak and found the river that my eyes first discovered the pendent world the tiny satellite which hangs low over the surface of pellucidar casting its perpetual shadow always upon the same spotthe area that is known here as the land of awful shadow in which dwells the tribe of thuria  from the distance and the elevation of the highlands where i stood the pellucidarian noonday moon showed half in sunshine and half in shadow while directly beneath it was plainly visible the round dark spot upon the surface of pellucidar where the sun has never shone  from where i stood the moon appeared to hang so low above the ground as almost to touch it but later i was to learn that it floats a mile above the surfacewhich seems indeed quite close for a moon  following the river downward i soon lost sight of the tiny planet as i entered the mazes of a lofty forest  nor did i catch another glimpse of it for some timeseveral marches at least  however when the river led me to the sea or rather just before it reached the sea of a sudden the sky became overcast and the size and luxuriance of the vegetation diminished as by magicas if an omnipotent hand had drawn a line upon the earth and said  upon this side shall the trees and the shrubs the grasses and the flowers riot in profusion of rich colors gigantic size and bewildering abundance and upon that side shall they be dwarfed and pale and scant  instantly i looked above for clouds are so uncommon in the skies of pellucidarthey are practically unknown except above the mightiest mountain rangesthat it had given me something of a start to discover the sun obliterated  but i was not long in coming to a realization of the cause of the shadow  above me hung another world  i could see its mountains and valleys oceans lakes and rivers its broad grassy plains and dense forests but too great was the distance and too deep the shadow of its under side for me to distinguish any movement as of animal life  instantly a great curiosity was awakened within me  the questions which the sight of this planet so tantalizingly close raised in my mind were numerous and unanswerable  was it inhabited  if so by what manner and form of creature  were its people as relatively diminutive as their little world or were they as disproportionately huge as the lesser attraction of gravity upon the surface of their globe would permit of their being  as i watched it i saw that it was revolving upon an axis that lay parallel to the surface of pellucidar so that during each revolution its entire surface was once exposed to the world below and once bathed in the heat of the great sun above  the little world had that which pellucidar could not havea day and night andgreatest of boons to one outerearthly borntime  here i saw a chance to give time to pellucidar using this mighty clock revolving perpetually in the heavens to record the passage of the hours for the earth below  here should be located an observatory from which might be flashed by wireless to every corner of the empire the correct time once each day  that this time would be easily measured i had no doubt since so plain were the landmarks upon the under surface of the satellite that it would be but necessary to erect a simple instrument and mark the instant of passage of a given landmark across the instrument  but then was not the time for dreaming i must devote my mind to the purpose of my journey  so i hastened onward beneath the great shadow as i advanced i could not but note the changing nature of the vegetation and the paling of its hues  the river led me a short distance within the shadow before it emptied into the sojar az  then i continued in a southerly direction along the coast toward the village of thuria where i hoped to find goork and deliver to him my credentials  i had progressed no great distance from the mouth of the river when i discerned lying some distance at sea a great island  this i assumed to be the stronghold of hooja nor did i doubt that upon it even now was dian  the way was most difficult since shortly after leaving the river i encountered lofty cliffs split by numerous long narrow fiords each of which necessitated a considerable detour  as the crow flies it is about twenty miles from the mouth of the river to thuria but before i had covered half of it i was fagged  there was no familiar fruit or vegetable growing upon the rocky soil of the clifftops and i would have fared ill for food had not a hare broken cover almost beneath my nose  i carried bow and arrows to conserve my ammunitionsupply but so quick was the little animal that i had no time to draw and fit a shaft  in fact my dinner was a hundred yards away and going like the proverbial bat when i dropped my sixshooter on it  it was a pretty shot and when coupled with a good dinner made me quite contented with myself  after eating i lay down and slept  when i awoke i was scarcely so selfsatisfied for i had not more than opened my eyes before i became aware of the presence barely a hundred yards from me of a pack of some twenty huge wolfdogsthe things which perry insisted upon calling hyaenodonsand almost simultaneously i discovered that while i slept my revolvers rifle bow arrows and knife had been stolen from me  and the wolfdog pack was preparing to rush me    chapter vii  from plight to plight  i have never been much of a runner i hate running  but if ever a sprinter broke into smithereens all worlds records it was i that day when i fled before those hideous beasts along the narrow spit of rocky cliff between two narrow fiords toward the sojar az  just as i reached the verge of the cliff the foremost of the brutes was upon me he leaped and closed his massive jaws upon my shoulder  the momentum of his flying body added to that of my own carried the two of us over the cliff  it was a hideous fall  the cliff was almost perpendicular  at its foot broke the sea against a solid wall of rock  we struck the cliffface once in our descent and then plunged into the salt sea  with the impact with the water the hyaenodon released his hold upon my shoulder  as i came sputtering to the surface i looked about for some tiny foot or handhold where i might cling for a moment of rest and recuperation the cliff itself offered me nothing so i swam toward the mouth of the fiord  at the far end i could see that erosion from above had washed down sufficient rubble to form a narrow ribbon of beach  toward this i swam with all my strength  not once did i look behind me since every unnecessary movement in swimming detracts so much from ones endurance speed  not until i had drawn myself safely out upon the beach did i turn my eyes back toward the sea for the hyaenodon  he was swimming slowly and apparently painfully toward the beach upon where i stood  i watched him for a long time wondering why it was that such a doglike animal was not a better swimmer  as he neared me i realized that he was weakening rapidly  i had gathered a handful of stones to be ready for his assault when he landed but in a moment i let them fall from my hands  it was evident that the brute either was no swimmer or else was severely injured for by now he was making practically no headway  indeed it was with quite apparent difficulty that he kept his nose above the surface of the sea  he was not more than fifty yards from shore when he went under  i watched the spot where he had disappeared and in a moment i saw his head reappear  the look of dumb misery in his eyes struck a chord in my breast for i love dogs  i forgot that he was a vicious primordial wolfthinga maneater a scourge and a terror  i saw only the sad eyes that looked like the eyes of raja my dead collie of the outer world  i did not stop to weigh and consider  in other words i did not stop to think which i believe must be the way of men who do thingsin contradistinction to those who think much and do nothing  instead i leaped back into the water and swam out toward the drowning beast  at first he showed his teeth at my approach but just before i reached him he went under for the second time so that i had to dive to get him  i grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and though he weighed as much as a shetland pony i managed to drag him to shore and well up upon the beach  here i found that one of his forelegs was brokenthe crash against the cliffface must have done it  by this time all the fight was out of him so that when i had gathered a few tiny branches from some of the stunted trees that grew in the crevices of the cliff and returned to him he permitted me to set his broken leg and bind it in splints  i had to tear part of my shirt into bits to obtain a bandage but at last the job was done  then i sat stroking the savage head and talking to the beast in the mandog talk with which you are familiar if you ever owned and loved a dog  when he is well i thought he probably will turn upon me and attempt to devour me and against that eventuality i gathered together a pile of rocks and set to work to fashion a stoneknife  we were bottled up at the head of the fiord as completely as if we had been behind prison bars  before us spread the sojar az and elsewhere about us rose unscalable cliffs  fortunately a little rivulet trickled down the side of the rocky wall giving us ample supply of fresh watersome of which i kept constantly beside the hyaenodon in a huge bowlshaped shell of which there were countless numbers among the rubble of the beach  for food we subsisted upon shellfish and an occasional bird that i succeeded in knocking over with a rock for long practice as a pitcher on prepschool and varsity nines had made me an excellent shot with a handthrown missile  it was not long before the hyaenodons leg was sufficiently mended to permit him to rise and hobble about on three legs  i shall never forget with what intent interest i watched his first attempt  close at my hand lay my pile of rocks  slowly the beast came to his three good feet  he stretched himself lowered his head and lapped water from the drinkingshell at his side turned and looked at me and then hobbled off toward the cliffs  thrice he traversed the entire extent of our prison seeking i imagine a loophole for escape but finding none he returned in my direction  slowly he came quite close to me sniffed at my shoes my puttees my hands and then limped off a few feet and lay down again  now that he was able to get around i was a little uncertain as to the wisdom of my impulsive mercy  how could i sleep with that ferocious thing prowling about the narrow confines of our prison  should i close my eyes it might be to open them again to the feel of those mighty jaws at my throat  to say the least i was uncomfortable  i have had too much experience with dumb animals to bank very strongly on any sense of gratitude which may be attributed to them by inexperienced sentimentalists  i believe that some animals love their masters but i doubt very much if their affection is the outcome of gratitudea characteristic that is so rare as to be only occasionally traceable in the seemingly unselfish acts of man himself  but finally i  was forced to sleep  tired nature would be put off no longer  i simply fell asleep willy nilly as i sat looking out to sea  i had been very uncomfortable since my ducking in the ocean for though i could see the sunlight on the water halfway toward the island and upon the island itself no ray of it fell upon us  we were well within the land of awful shadow  a perpetual halfwarmth pervaded the atmosphere but clothing was slow in drying and so from loss of sleep and great physical discomfort i at last gave way to natures demands and sank into profound slumber  when i awoke it was with a start for a heavy body was upon me  my first thought was that the hyaenodon had at last attacked me but as my eyes opened and i struggled to rise i saw that a man was astride me and three others bending close above him  i am no weaklingand never have been  my experience in the hard life of the inner world has turned my thews to steel  even such giants as ghak the hairy one have praised my strength but to it is added another quality which they lackscience  the man upon me held me down awkwardly leaving me many openingsone of which i was not slow in taking advantage of so that almost before the fellow knew that i was awake i was upon my feet with my arms over his shoulders and about his waist and had hurled him heavily over my head to the hard rubble of the beach where he lay quite still  in the instant that i arose i had seen the hyaenodon lying asleep beside a boulder a few yards away  so nearly was he the color of the rock that he was scarcely discernible  evidently the newcomers had not seen him  i had not more than freed myself from one of my antagonists before the other three were upon me  they did not work silently now but charged me with savage criesa mistake upon their part  the fact that they did not draw their weapons against me convinced me that they desired to take me alive but i fought as desperately as if death loomed immediate and sure  the battle was short for scarce had their first wild whoop reverberated through the rocky fiord and they had closed upon me than a hairy mass of demoniacal rage hurtled among us  it was the hyaenodon  in an instant he had pulled down one of the men and with a single shake terrierlike had broken his neck  then he was upon another in their efforts to vanquish the wolfdog the savages forgot all about me thus giving me an instant in which to snatch a knife from the loinstring of him who had first fallen and account for another of them  almost simultaneously the hyaenodon pulled down the remaining enemy crushing his skull with a single bite of those fearsome jaws  the battle was overunless the beast considered me fair prey too  i waited ready for him with knife and bludgeonalso filched from a dead foeman but he paid no attention to me falling to work instead to devour one of the corpses  the beast bad been handicapped but little by his splinted leg but having eaten he lay down and commenced to gnaw at the bandage  i was sitting some little distance away devouring shellfish of which by the way i was becoming exceedingly tired  presently the hyaenodon arose and came toward me i did not move  he stopped in front of me and deliberately raised his bandaged leg and pawed my knee  his act was as intelligible as wordshe wished the bandage removed  i took the great paw in one hand and with the other hand untied and unwound the bandage removed the splints and felt of the injured member  as far as i could judge the bone was completely knit  the joint was stiff when i bent it a little the brute wincedbut he neither growled nor tried to pull away  very slowly and gently i rubbed the joint and applied pressure to it for a few moments  then i set it down upon the ground  the hyaenodon walked around me a few times and then lay down at my side his body touching mine  i laid my hand upon his head  he did not move  slowly i scratched about his ears and neck and down beneath the fierce jaws  the only sign he gave was to raise his chin a trifle that i might better caress him  that was enough from that moment i have never again felt suspicion of raja as i immediately named him  somehow all sense of loneliness vanished tooi had a dog i had never guessed precisely what it was that was lacking to life in pellucidar but now i knew it was the total absence of domestic animals  man here had not yet reached the point where he might take the time from slaughter and escaping slaughter to make friends with any of the brute creation  i must qualify this statement a trifle and say that this was true of those tribes with which i was most familiar  the thurians do domesticate the colossal lidi traversing the great lidi plains upon the backs of these grotesque and stupendous monsters and possibly there may also be other fardistant peoples within the great world who have tamed others of the wild things of jungle plain or mountain  the thurians practice agriculture in a crude sort of way  it is my opinion that this is one of the earliest steps from savagery to civilization  the taming of wild beasts and their domestication follows  perry argues that wild dogs were first domesticated for hunting purposes but i do not agree with him  i believe that if their domestication were not purely the result of an accident as for example my taming of the hyaenodon it came about through the desire of tribes who had previously domesticated flocks and herds to have some strong ferocious beast to guard their roaming property  however i lean rather more strongly to the theory of accident  as i sat there upon the beach of the little fiord eating my unpalatable shellfish i commenced to wonder how it had been that the four savages had been able to reach me though i had been unable to escape from my natural prison  i glanced about in all directions searching for an explanation  at last my eyes fell upon the bow of a small dugout protruding scarce a foot from behind a large boulder lying half in the water at the edge of the beach  at my discovery i leaped to my feet so suddenly that it brought raja growling and bristling upon all fours in an instant  for the moment i had forgotten him  but his savage rumbling did not cause me any uneasiness  he glanced quickly about in all directions as if searching for the cause of my excitement  then as i walked rapidly down toward the dugout he slunk silently after me  the dugout was similar in many respects to those which i had seen in use by the mezops  in it were four paddles  i was much delighted as it promptly offered me the escape i had been craving  i pushed it out into water that would float it stepped in and called to raja to enter  at first he did not seem to understand what i wished of him but after i had paddled out a few yards he plunged through the surf and swam after me  when he had come alongside i grasped the scruff of his neck and after a considerable struggle in which i several times came near to overturning the canoe i managed to drag him aboard where he shook himself vigorously and squatted down before me  after emerging from the fiord i paddled southward along the coast where presently the lofty cliffs gave way to lower and more level country  it was here somewhere that i should come upon the principal village of the thurians  when after a time i saw in the distance what i took to be huts in a clearing near the shore i drew quickly into land for though i had been furnished credentials by kolk i was not sufficiently familiar with the tribal characteristics of these people to know whether i should receive a friendly welcome or not and in case i should not i wanted to be sure of having a canoe hidden safely away so that i might undertake the trip to the island in any eventprovided of course that i escaped the thurians should they prove belligerent  at the point where i landed the shore was quite low  a forest of pale scrubby ferns ran down almost to the beach  here i dragged up the dugout hiding it well within the vegetation and with some loose rocks built a cairn upon the beach to mark my cache  then i turned my steps toward the thurian village  as i proceeded i began to speculate upon the possible actions of raja when we should enter the presence of other men than myself  the brute was padding softly at my side his sensitive nose constantly atwitch and his fierce eyes moving restlessly from side to sidenothing would ever take raja unawares  the more i thought upon the matter the greater became my perturbation i did not want raja to attack any of the people upon whose friendship i so greatly depended nor did i want him injured or slain by them  i wondered if raja would stand for a leash  his head as he paced beside me was level with my hip  i laid my hand upon it caressingly as i did so he turned and looked up into my face his jaws parting and his red tongue lolling as you have seen your own dogs beneath a love pat  just been waiting all your life to be tamed and loved havent you old man i asked  youre nothing but a good pup and the man who put the hyaeno in your name ought to be sued for libel  raja bared his mighty fangs with upcurled snarling lips and licked my hand  youre grinning you old fraud you i cried  if youre not ill eat you  ill bet a doughnut youre nothing but some kids poor old fido masquerading around as a real live maneater  raja whined  and so we walked on together toward thuriai talking to the beast at my side and he seeming to enjoy my company no less than i enjoyed his  if you dont think its lonesome wandering all by yourself through savage unknown pellucidar why just try it and you will not wonder that i was glad of the company of this first dogthis living replica of the fierce and now extinct hyaenodon of the outer crust that hunted in savage packs the great elk across the snows of southern france in the days when the mastodon roamed at will over the broad continent of which the british isles were then a part and perchance left his footprints and his bones in the sands of atlantis as well  thus i dreamed as we moved on toward thuria  my dreaming was rudely shattered by a savage growl from raja  i looked down at him  he had stopped in his tracks as one turned to stone  a thin ridge of stiff hair bristled along the entire length of his spine  his yellow green eyes were fastened upon the scrubby jungle at our right  i fastened my fingers in the bristles at his neck and turned my eyes in the direction that his pointed  at first i saw nothing  then a slight movement of the bushes riveted my attention  i thought it must be some wild beast and was glad of the primitive weapons i had taken from the bodies of the warriors who had attacked me  presently i distinguished two eyes peering at us from the vegetation i took a step in their direction and as i did so a youth arose and fled precipitately in the direction we had been going  raja struggled to be after him but i held tightly to his neck an act which he did not seem to relish for he turned on me with bared fangs  i determined that now was as good a time as any to discover just how deep was rajas affection for me  one of us could be master and logically i was the one  he growled at me  i cuffed him sharply across the nose  he looked it me for a moment in surprised bewilderment and then he growled again  i made another feint at him expecting that it would bring him at my throat but instead he winced and crouched down  raja was subdued  i stooped and patted him  then i took a piece of the rope that constituted a part of my equipment and made a leash for him  thus we resumed our journey toward thuria  the youth who had seen us was evidently of the thurians  that he had lost no time in racing homeward and spreading the word of my coming was evidenced when we had come within sight of the clearing and the villagethe first real village by the way that i had ever seen constructed by human pellucidarians  there was a rude rectangle walled with logs and boulders in which were a hundred or more thatched huts of similar construction  there was no gate  ladders that could be removed by night led over the palisade  before the village were assembled a great concourse of warriors inside i could see the heads of women and children peering over the top of the wall and also farther back the long necks of lidi topped by their tiny heads  lidi by the way is both the singular and plural form of the noun that describes the huge beasts of burden of the thurians  they are enormous quadrupeds eighty or a hundred feet long with very small heads perched at the top of very long slender necks their heads are quite forty feet from the ground  their gait is slow and deliberate but so enormous are their strides that as a matter of fact they cover the ground quite rapidly  perry has told me that they are almost identical with the fossilized remains of the diplodocus of the outer crusts jurassic age  i have to take his word for itand i guess you will unless you know more of such matters than i  as we came in sight of the warriors the men set up a great jabbering their eyes were wide in astonishmentonly i presume because of my strange garmenture but as well from the fact that i came in company with a jalok which is the pellucidarian name of the hyaenodon  raja tugged at his leash growling and showing his long white fangs he would have liked nothing better than to be at the throats of the whole aggregation but i held him in with the leash though it took all my strength to do it  my free hand i held above my head palm out in token of the peacefulness of my mission  in the foreground i saw the youth who had discovered us and i could tell from the way he carried himself that he was quite overcome by his own importance  the warriors about him were all fine looking fellows though shorter and squatter than the sarians or the amozites  their color too was a bit lighter owing no doubt to the fact that much of their lives is spent within the shadow of the world that hangs forever above their country  a little in advance of the others was a bearded fellow tricked out in many ornaments  i didnt need to ask to know that he was the chieftaindoubtless goork father of kolk  now to him i addressed myself  i am david i said emperor of the federated kingdoms of pellucidar doubtless you have heard of me  he nodded his head affirmatively  i come from sari i continued where i just met kolk the son of goork  i bear a token from kolk to his father which will prove that i am a friend  again the warrior nodded  i am goork he said  where is the token  here i replied and fished into the gamebag where i had placed it  goork and his people waited in silence  my hand searched the inside of the bag  it was empty  the token had been stolen with my arms    chapter viii  captive  when goork and his people saw that i had no token they commenced to taunt me  you do not come from kolk but from the sly one they cried  he has sent you from the island to spy upon us go away or we will set upon you and kill you  i explained that all my belongings had been stolen from me and that the robber must have taken the token too but they didnt believe me as proof that i was one of hoojas people they pointed to my weapons which they said were ornamented like those of the island clan further they said that no good man went in company with a jalokand that by this line of reasoning i certainly was a bad man  i saw that they were not naturally a warlike tribe for they preferred that i leave in peace rather than force them to attack me whereas the sarians would have killed a suspicious stranger first and inquired into his purposes later  i think raja sensed their antagonism for he kept tugging at his leash and growling ominously  they were a bit in awe of him and kept at a safe distance  it was evident that they could not comprehend why it was that this savage brute did not turn upon me and rend me  i wasted a long time there trying to persuade goork to accept me at my own valuation but he was too canny  the best he would do was to give us food which he did and direct me as to the safest portion of the island upon which to attempt a landing though even as he told me i am sure that he thought my request for information but a blind to deceive him as to my true knowledge of the insular stronghold  at last i turned away from themrather disheartened for i had hoped to be able to enlist a considerable force of them in an attempt to rush hoojas horde and rescue dian  back along the beach toward the hidden canoe we made our way  by the time we came to the cairn i was dogtired  throwing myself upon the sand i soon slept and with raja stretched out beside me i felt a far greater security than i had enjoyed for a long time  i awoke much refreshed to find rajas eyes glued upon me  the moment i opened mine he rose stretched himself and without a backward glance plunged into the jungle  for several minutes i could hear him crashing through the brush  then all was silent  i wondered if he had left me to return to his fierce pack  a feeling of loneliness overwhelmed me  with a sigh i turned to the work of dragging the canoe down to the sea  as i entered the jungle where the dugout lay a hare darted from beneath the boats side and a wellaimed cast of my javelin brought it down  i was hungryi had not realized it beforeso i sat upon the edge of the canoe and devoured my repast the last remnants gone i again busied myself with preparations for my expedition to the island  i did not know for certain that dian was there but i surmised as much nor could i guess what obstacles might confront me in an effort to rescue her  for a time i loitered about after i had the canoe at the waters edge hoping against hope that raja would return but he did not so i shoved the awkward craft through the surf and leaped into it  i was still a little downcast by the desertion of my newfound friend though i tried to assure myself that it was nothing but what i might have expected  the savage brute had served me well in the short time that we had been together and had repaid his debt of gratitude to me since he had saved my life or at least my liberty no less certainly than i had saved his life when he was injured and drowning  the trip across the water to the island was uneventful  i was mighty glad to be in the sunshine again when i passed out of the shadow of the dead world about halfway between the mainland and the island  the hot rays of the noonday sun did a great deal toward raising my spirits and dispelling the mental gloom in which i had been shrouded almost continually since entering the land of awful shadow  there is nothing more dispiriting to me than absence of sunshine  i had paddled to the southwestern point which goork said he believed to be the least frequented portion of the island as he had never seen boats put off from there  i found a shallow reef running far out into the sea and rather precipitous cliffs running almost to the surf  it was a nasty place to land and i realized now why it was not used by the natives but at last i managed after a good wetting to beach my canoe and scale the cliffs  the country beyond them appeared more open and parklike than i had anticipated since from the mainland the entire coast that is visible seems densely clothed with tropical jungle  this jungle as i could see from the vantagepoint of the clifftop formed but a relatively narrow strip between the sea and the more open forest and meadow of the interior  farther back there was a range of low but apparently very rocky hills and here and there all about were visible flattopped masses of rocksmall mountains in factwhich reminded me of pictures i had seen of landscapes in new mexico  altogether the country was very much broken and very beautiful  from where i stood i counted no less than a dozen streams winding down from among the tablebuttes and emptying into a pretty river which flowed away in a northeasterly direction toward the opposite end of the island  as i let my eyes roam over the scene i suddenly became aware of figures moving upon the flat top of a fardistant butte  whether they were beast or human though i could not make out but at least they were alive so i determined to prosecute my search for hoojas stronghold in the general direction of this butte  to descend to the valley required no great effort  as i swung along through the lush grass and the fragrant flowers my cudgel swinging in my hand and my javelin looped across my shoulders with its aurochshide strap i felt equal to any emergency ready for any danger  i had covered quite a little distance and i was passing through a strip of wood which lay at the foot of one of the flattopped hills when i became conscious of the sensation of being watched  my life within pellucidar has rather quickened my senses of sight hearing and smell and too certain primitive intuitive or instinctive qualities that seem blunted in civilized man  but though i was positive that eyes were upon me i could see no sign of any living thing within the wood other than the many gayplumaged birds and little monkeys which filled the trees with life color and action  to you it may seem that my conviction was the result of an overwrought imagination or to the actual reality of the prying eyes of the little monkeys or the curious ones of the birds but there is a difference which i cannot explain between the sensation of casual observation and studied espionage  a sheep might gaze at you without transmitting a warning through your subjective mind because you are in no danger from a sheep  but let a tiger gaze fixedly at you from ambush and unless your primitive instincts are completely calloused you will presently commence to glance furtively about and be filled with vague unreasoning terror  thus was it with me then  i grasped my cudgel more firmly and unslung my javelin carrying it in my left hand  i peered to left and right but i saw nothing  then all quite suddenly there fell about my neck and shoulders around my arms and body a number of pliant fiber ropes  in a jiffy i was trussed up as neatly as you might wish  one of the nooses dropped to my ankles and was jerked up with a suddenness that brought me to my face upon the ground  then something heavy and hairy sprang upon my back  i fought to draw my knife but hairy hands grasped my wrists and dragging them behind my back bound them securely  next my feet were bound  then i was turned over upon my back to look up into the faces of my captors  and what faces imagine if you can a cross between a sheep and a gorilla and you will have some conception of the physiognomy of the creature that bent close above me and of those of the halfdozen others that clustered about  there was the facial length and great eyes of the sheep and the bullneck and hideous fangs of the gorilla the bodies and limbs were both man and gorillalike  as they bent over me they conversed in a monosyllabic tongue that was perfectly intelligible to me  it was something of a simplified language that had no need for aught but nouns and verbs but such words as it included were the same as those of the human beings of pellucidar  it was amplified by many gestures which filled in the speechgaps  i asked them what they intended doing with me but like our own north american indians when questioned by a white man they pretended not to understand me  one of them swung me to his shoulder as lightly as if i had been a shoat  he was a huge creature as were his fellows standing fully seven feet upon his short legs and weighing considerably more than a quarter of a ton  two went ahead of my bearer and three behind  in this order we cut to the right through the forest to the foot of the hill where precipitous cliffs appeared to bar our farther progress in this direction  but my escort never paused  like ants upon a wall they scaled that seemingly unscalable barrier clinging heaven knows how to its ragged perpendicular face  during most of the short journey to the summit i must admit that my hair stood on end  presently however we topped the thing and stood upon the level mesa which crowned it  immediately from all about out of burrows and rough rocky lairs poured a perfect torrent of beasts similar to my captors  they clustered about jabbering at my guards and attempting to get their hands upon me whether from curiosity or a desire to do me bodily harm i did not know since my escort with bared fangs and heavy blows kept them off  across the mesa we went to stop at last before a large pile of rocks in which an opening appeared  here my guards set me upon my feet and called out a word which sounded like grgrgr and which i later learned was the name of their king  presently there emerged from the cavernous depths of the lair a monstrous creature scarred from a hundred battles almost hairless and with an empty socket where one eye had been  the other eye sheeplike in its mildness gave the most startling appearance to the beast which but for that single timid orb was the most fearsome thing that one could imagine  i had encountered the black hairless longtailed apethings of the mainlandthe creatures which perry thought might constitute the link between the higher orders of apes and manbut these brutemen of grgrgr seemed to set that theory back to zero for there was less similarity between the black apemen and these creatures than there was between the latter and man while both had many human attributes some of which were better developed in one species and some in the other  the black apes were hairless and built thatched huts in their arboreal retreats they kept domesticated dogs and ruminants in which respect they were farther advanced than the human beings of pellucidar but they appeared to have only a meager language and sported long apelike tails  on the other hand grgrgrs people were for the most part quite hairy but they were tailless and had a language similar to that of the human race of pellucidar nor were they arboreal  their skins where skin showed were white  from the foregoing facts and others that i have noted during my long life within pellucidar which is now passing through an age analogous to some preglacial age of the outer crust i am constrained to the belief that evolution is not so much a gradual transition from one form to another as it is an accident of breeding either by crossing or the hazards of birth  in other words it is my belief that the first man was a freak of naturenor would one have to draw overstrongly upon his credulity to be convinced that grgrgr and his tribe were also freaks  the great manbrute seated himself upon a flat rockhis throne i imaginejust before the entrance to his lair  with elbows on knees and chin in palms he regarded me intently through his lone sheepeye while one of my captors told of my taking  when all had been related grgrgr questioned me  i shall not attempt to quote these people in their own abbreviated tongueyou would have even greater difficulty in interpreting them than did i instead i shall put the words into their mouths which will carry to you the ideas which they intended to convey  you are an enemy was grgrgrs initial declaration  you belong to the tribe of hooja  ah  so they knew hooja and he was their enemy  good  i am an enemy of hooja i replied  he has stolen my mate and i have come here to take her away from him and punish hooja  how could you do that alone  i do not know i answered but i should have tried had you not captured me  what do you intend to do with me  you shall work for us  you will not kill me i asked  we do not kill except in selfdefense he replied selfdefense and punishment  those who would kill us and those who do wrong we kill if we knew you were one of hoojas people we might kill you for all hoojas people are bad people but you say you are an enemy of hooja you may not speak the truth but until we learn that you have lied we shall not kill you  you shall work  if you hate hooja i suggested why not let me who hate him too go and punish him  for some time grgrgr sat in thought  then he raised his head and addressed my guard  take him to his work he ordered  his tone was final  as if to emphasize it he turned and entered his burrow  my guard conducted me farther into the mesa where we came presently to a tiny depression or valley at one end of which gushed a warm spring  the view that opened before me was the most surprising that i have ever seen  in the hollow which must have covered several hundred acres were numerous fields of growing things and working all about with crude implements or with no implements at all other than their bare hands were many of the brutemen engaged in the first agriculture that i had seen within pellucidar  they put me to work cultivating in a patch of melons  i never was a farmer nor particularly keen for this sort of work and i am free to confess that time never had dragged so heavily as it did during the hour or the year i spent there at that work  how long it really was i do not know of course but it was all too long  the creatures that worked about me were quite simple and friendly  one of them proved to be a son of grgrgr  he had broken some minor tribal law and was working out his sentence in the fields  he told me that his tribe had lived upon this hilltop always and that there were other tribes like them dwelling upon other hilltops  they had no wars and had always lived in peace and harmony menaced only by the larger carnivora of the island until my kind had come under a creature called hooja and attacked and killed them when they chanced to descend from their natural fortresses to visit their fellows upon other lofty mesas  now they were afraid but some day they would go in a body and fall upon hooja and his people and slay them all  i explained to him that i was hoojas enemy and asked when they were ready to go that i be allowed to go with them or better still that they let me go ahead and learn all that i could about the village where hooja dwelt so that they might attack it with the best chance of success  grgrgrs son seemed much impressed by my suggestion  he said that when he was through in the fields he would speak to his father about the matter  some time after this grgrgr came through the fields where we were and his son spoke to him upon the subject but the old gentleman was evidently in anything but a good humor for he cuffed the youngster and turning upon me informed me that he was convinced that i had lied to him and that i was one of hoojas people  wherefore he concluded we shall slay you as soon as the melons are cultivated  hasten therefore  and hasten i did  i hastened to cultivate the weeds which grew among the melonvines  where there had been one sickly weed before i nourished two healthy ones  when i found a particularly promising variety of weed growing elsewhere than among my melons i forthwith dug it up and transplanted it among my charges  my masters did not seem to realize my perfidy  they saw me always laboring diligently in the melonpatch and as time enters not into the reckoning of pellucidarianseven of human beings and much less of brutes and half brutesi might have lived on indefinitely through this subterfuge had not that occurred which took me out of the melonpatch for good and all    chapter ix  hoojas cutthroats appear  i had built a little shelter of rocks and brush where i might crawl in and sleep out of the perpetual light and heat of the noonday sun  when i was tired or hungry i retired to my humble cot  my masters never interposed the slightest objection  as a matter of fact they were very good to me nor did i see aught while i was among them to indicate that they are ever else than a simple kindly folk when left to themselves  their aweinspiring size terrific strength mighty fightingfangs and hideous appearance are but the attributes necessary to the successful waging of their constant battle for survival and well do they employ them when the need arises  the only flesh they eat is that of herbivorous animals and birds  when they hunt the mighty thag the prehistoric bos of the outer crust a single male with his fiber rope will catch and kill the greatest of the bulls  well as i was about to say i had this little shelter at the edge of my melonpatch  here i was resting from my labors on a certain occasion when i heard a great hubbub in the village which lay about a quarter of a mile away  presently a male came racing toward the field shouting excitedly  as he approached i came from my shelter to learn what all the commotion might be about for the monotony of my existence in the melonpatch must have fostered that trait of my curiosity from which it had always been my secret boast i am peculiarly free  the other workers also ran forward to meet the messenger who quickly unburdened himself of his information and as quickly turned and scampered back toward the village  when running these beastmen often go upon all fours  thus they leap over obstacles that would slow up a human being and upon the level attain a speed that would make a thoroughbred look to his laurels  the result in this instance was that before i had more than assimilated the gist of the word which had been brought to the fields i was alone watching my coworkers speeding villageward  i was alone it was the first time since my capture that no beastman had been within sight of me  i was alone and all my captors were in the village at the opposite edge of the mesa repelling an attack of hoojas horde  it seemed from the messengers tale that two of grgrgrs great males had been set upon by a halfdozen of hoojas cutthroats while the former were peaceably returning from the thag hunt  the two had returned to the village unscratched while but a single one of hoojas halfdozen had escaped to report the outcome of the battle to their leader  now hooja was coming to punish grgrgrs people  with his large force armed with the bows and arrows that hooja had learned from me to make with long lances and sharp knives i feared that even the mighty strength of the beastmen could avail them but little  at last had come the opportunity for which i waited  i was free to make for the far end of the mesa find my way to the valley below and while the two forces were engaged in their struggle continue my search for hoojas village which i had learned from the beastmen lay farther on down the river that i had been following when taken prisoner  as i turned to make for the mesas rim the sounds of battle came plainly to my earsthe hoarse shouts of men mingled with the halfbeastly roars and growls of the brutefolk  did i take advantage of my opportunity  i did not  instead lured by the din of strife and by the desire to deliver a stroke however feeble against hated hooja i wheeled and ran directly toward the village  when i reached the edge of the plateau such a scene met my astonished gaze as never before had startled it for the unique battlemethods of the halfbrutes were rather the most remarkable i had ever witnessed along the very edge of the clifftop stood a thin line of mighty malesthe best ropethrowers of the tribe  a few feet behind these the rest of the males with the exception of about twenty formed a second line  still farther in the rear all the women and young children were clustered into a single group under the protection of the remaining twenty fighting males and all the old males  but it was the work of the first two lines that interested me  the forces of hoojaa great horde of savage sagoths and primeval cave menwere working their way up the steep cliffface their agility but slightly less than that of my captors who had clambered so nimbly alofteven he who was burdened by my weight  as the attackers came on they paused occasionally wherever a projection gave them sufficient foothold and launched arrows and spears at the defenders above them  during the entire battle both sides hurled taunts and insults at one anotherthe human beings naturally excelling the brutes in the coarseness and vileness of their vilification and invective  the firingline of the brutemen wielded no weapon other than their long fiber nooses  when a foeman came within range of them a noose would settle unerringly about him and he would be dragged fighting and yelling to the clifftop unless as occasionally occurred he was quick enough to draw his knife and cut the rope above him in which event he usually plunged downward to a no less certain death than that which awaited him above  those who were hauled up within reach of the powerful clutches of the defenders had the nooses snatched from them and were catapulted back through the first line to the second where they were seized and killed by the simple expedient of a single powerful closing of mighty fangs upon the backs of their necks  but the arrows of the invaders were taking a much heavier toll than the nooses of the defenders and i foresaw that it was but a matter of time before hoojas forces must conquer unless the brutemen changed their tactics or the cave men tired of the battle  grgrgr was standing in the center of the first line  all about him were boulders and large fragments of broken rock  i approached him and without a word toppled a large mass of rock over the edge of the cliff it fell directly upon the head of an archer crushing him to instant death and carrying his mangled corpse with it to the bottom of the declivity and on its way brushing three more of the attackers into the hereafter  grgrgr turned toward me in surprise  for an instant he appeared to doubt the sincerity of my motives  i felt that perhaps my time had come when he reached for me with one of his giant paws but i dodged him and running a few paces to the right hurled down another missile it too did its allotted work of destruction  then i picked up smaller fragments and with all the control and accuracy for which i had earned justly deserved fame in my collegiate days i rained down a hail of death upon those beneath me  grgrgr was coming toward me again  i pointed to the litter of rubble upon the clifftop  hurl these down upon the enemy i cried to him  tell your warriors to throw rocks down upon them  at my words the others of the first line who had been interested spectators of my tactics seized upon great boulders or bits of rock whichever came first to their hands and without waiting for a command from grgrgr deluged the terrified cave men with a perfect avalanche of stone  in less than no time the cliffface was stripped of enemies and the village of grgrgr was saved  grgrgr was standing beside me when the last of the cave men disappeared in rapid flight down the valley  he was looking at me intently  those were your people he said  why did you kill them  they were not my people i returned  i have told you that before but you would not believe me  will you believe me now when i tell you that i hate hooja and his tribe as much as you do will you believe me when i tell you that i wish to be the friend of grgrgr  for some time he stood there beside me scratching his head  evidently it was no less difficult for him to readjust his preconceived conclusions than it is for most human beings but finally the idea percolatedwhich it might never have done had he been a man or i might qualify that statement by saying had he been some men  finally he spoke  gilak he said you have made grgrgr ashamed  he would have killed you  how can he reward you  set me free i replied quickly  you are free he said  you may go down when you wish or you may stay with us  if you go you may always return  we are your friends  naturally i elected to go  i explained all over again to grgrgr the nature of my mission  he listened attentively after i had done he offered to send some of his people with me to guide me to hoojas village  i was not slow in accepting his offer  first however we must eat  the hunters upon whom hoojas men had fallen had brought back the meat of a great thag  there would be a feast to commemorate the victorya feast and dancing  i had never witnessed a tribal function of the brutefolk though i had often heard strange sounds coming from the village where i had not been allowed since my capture  now i took part in one of their orgies  it will live forever in my memory  the combination of bestiality and humanity was oftentimes pathetic and again grotesque or horrible beneath the glaring noonday sun in the sweltering heat of the mesatop the huge hairy creatures leaped in a great circle  they coiled and threw their fiberropes they hurled taunts and insults at an imaginary foe they fell upon the carcass of the thag and literally tore it to pieces and they ceased only when gorged they could no longer move  i had to wait until the processes of digestion had released my escort from its torpor  some had eaten until their abdomens were so distended that i thought they must burst for beside the thag there had been fully a hundred antelopes of various sizes and varied degrees of decomposition which they had unearthed from burial beneath the floors of their lairs to grace the banquetboard  but at last we were startedsix great males and myself  grgrgr had returned my weapons to me and at last i was once more upon my oftinterrupted way toward my goal  whether i should find dian at the end of my journey or no i could not even surmise but i was none the less impatient to be off for if only the worst lay in store for me i wished to know even the worst at once  i could scarce believe that my proud mate would still be alive in the power of hooja but time upon pellucidar is so strange a thing that i realized that to her or to him only a few minutes might have elapsed since his subtle trickery had enabled him to steal her away from phutra  or she might have found the means either to repel his advances or escape him  as we descended the cliff we disturbed a great pack of large hyenalike beastshyaena spelaeus perry calls themwho were busy among the corpses of the cave men fallen in battle  the ugly creatures were far from the cowardly things that our own hyenas are reputed to be they stood their ground with bared fangs as we approached them  but as i was later to learn so formidable are the brutefolk that there are few even of the larger carnivora that will not make way for them when they go abroad  so the hyenas moved a little from our line of march closing in again upon their feasts when we had passed  we made our way steadily down the rim of the beautiful river which flows the length of the island coming at last to a wood rather denser than any that i had before encountered in this country  well within this forest my escort halted  there they said and pointed ahead  we are to go no farther  thus having guided me to my destination they left me ahead of me through the trees i could see what appeared to be the foot of a steep hill  toward this i made my way  the forest ran to the very base of a cliff in the face of which were the mouths of many caves  they appeared untenanted but i decided to watch for a while before venturing farther  a large tree densely foliaged offered a splendid vantagepoint from which to spy upon the cliff so i clambered among its branches where securely hidden i could watch what transpired about the caves  it seemed that i had scarcely settled myself in a comfortable position before a party of cave men emerged from one of the smaller apertures in the cliffface about fifty feet from the base  they descended into the forest and disappeared  soon after came several others from the same cave and after them at a short interval a score of women and children who came into the wood to gather fruit  there were several warriors with thema guard i presume  after this came other parties and two or three groups who passed out of the forest and up the cliffface to enter the same cave  i could not understand it  all who came out had emerged from the same cave all who returned reentered it  no other cave gave evidence of habitation and no cave but one of extraordinary size could have accommodated all the people whom i had seen pass in and out of its mouth  for a long time i sat and watched the coming and going of great numbers of the cavefolk  not once did one leave the cliff by any other opening save that from which i had seen the first party come nor did any reenter the cliff through another aperture  what a cave it must be i thought that houses an entire tribe  but dissatisfied of the truth of my surmise i climbed higher among the branches of the tree that i might get a better view of other portions of the cliff  high above the ground i reached a point whence i could see the summit of the hill  evidently it was a flattopped butte similar to that on which dwelt the tribe of grgrgr  as i sat gazing at it a figure appeared at the very edge  it was that of a young girl in whose hair was a gorgeous bloom plucked from some flowering tree of the forest  i had seen her pass beneath me but a short while before and enter the small cave that had swallowed all of the returning tribesmen  the mystery was solved  the cave was but the mouth of a passage that led upward through the cliff to the summit of the hill  it served merely as an avenue from their lofty citadel to the valley below  no sooner had the truth flashed upon me than the realization came that i must seek some other means of reaching the village for to pass unobserved through this welltraveled thoroughfare would be impossible at the moment there was no one in sight below me so i slid quickly from my arboreal watchtower to the ground and moved rapidly away to the right with the intention of circling the hill if necessary until i had found an unwatched spot where i might have some slight chance of scaling the heights and reaching the top unseen  i kept close to the edge of the forest in the very midst of which the hill seemed to rise  though i carefully scanned the cliff as i traversed its base i saw no sign of any other entrance than that to which my guides had led me  after some little time the roar of the sea broke upon my ears  shortly after i came upon the broad ocean which breaks at this point at the very foot of the great hill where hooja had found safe refuge for himself and his villains  i was just about to clamber along the jagged rocks which lie at the base of the cliff next to the sea in search of some foothold to the top when i chanced to see a canoe rounding the end of the island  i threw myself down behind a large boulder where i could watch the dugout and its occupants without myself being seen  they paddled toward me for a while and then about a hundred yards from me they turned straight in toward the foot of the frowning cliffs from where i was it seemed that they were bent upon selfdestruction since the roar of the breakers beating upon the perpendicular rockface appeared to offer only death to any one who might venture within their relentless clutch  a mass of rock would soon hide them from my view but so keen was the excitement of the instant that i could not refrain from crawling forward to a point whence i could watch the dashing of the small craft to pieces on the jagged rocks that loomed before her although i risked discovery from above to accomplish my design  when i had reached a point where i could again see the dugout i was just in time to see it glide unharmed between two needlepointed sentinels of granite and float quietly upon the unruffled bosom of a tiny cove  again i crouched behind a boulder to observe what would next transpire nor did i have long to wait  the dugout which contained but two men was drawn close to the rocky wall  a fiber rope one end of which was tied to the boat was made fast about a projection of the cliff face  then the two men commenced the ascent of the almost perpendicular wall toward the summit several hundred feet above  i looked on in amazement for splendid climbers though the cave men of pellucidar are i never before had seen so remarkable a feat performed  upwardly they moved without a pause to disappear at last over the summit  when i felt reasonably sure that they had gone for a while at least i crawled from my hidingplace and at the risk of a broken neck leaped and scrambled to the spot where their canoe was moored  if they had scaled that cliff i could and if i couldnt i should die in the attempt  but when i turned to the accomplishment of the task i found it easier than i had imagined it would be since i immediately discovered that shallow hand and footholds had been scooped in the cliffs rocky face forming a crude ladder from the base to the summit  at last i reached the top and very glad i was too  cautiously i raised my head until my eyes were above the cliffcrest  before me spread a rough mesa liberally sprinkled with large boulders  there was no village in sight nor any living creature  i drew myself to level ground and stood erect  a few trees grew among the boulders  very carefully i advanced from tree to tree and boulder to boulder toward the inland end of the mesa  i stopped often to listen and look cautiously about me in every direction  how i wished that i had my revolvers and rifle i would not have to worm my way like a scared cat toward hoojas village nor did i relish doing so now but dians life might hinge upon the success of my venture and so i could not afford to take chances  to have met suddenly with discovery and had a score or more of armed warriors upon me might have been very grand and heroic but it would have immediately put an end to all my earthly activities nor have accomplished aught in the service of dian  well i must have traveled nearly a mile across that mesa without seeing a sign of anyone when all of a sudden as i crept around the edge of a boulder i ran plump into a man down on all fours like myself crawling toward me    chapter x  the raid on the caveprison  his head was turned over his shoulder as i first saw himhe was looking back toward the village  as i leaped for him his eyes fell upon me  never in my life have i seen a more surprised mortal than this poor cave man  before he could utter a single scream of warning or alarm i had my fingers on his throat and had dragged him behind the boulder where i proceeded to sit upon him while i figured out what i had best do with him  he struggled a little at first but finally lay still and so i released the pressure of my fingers at his  windpipe for which i imagine he was quite thankfuli know that i should have been  i hated to kill him in cold blood but what else i was to do with him i could not see for to turn him loose would have been merely to have the entire village aroused and down upon me in a moment  the fellow lay looking up at me with the surprise still deeply written on his countenance  at last all of a sudden a look of recognition entered his eyes  i have seen you before he said  i saw you in the arena at the mahars city of phutra when the thipdars dragged the tarag from you and your mate  i never understood that  afterward they put me in the arena with two warriors from gombul  he smiled in recollection  it would have been the same had there been ten warriors from gombul i slew them winning my freedom  look  he half turned his left shoulder toward me exhibiting the newly healed scar of the mahars branded mark  then he continued as i was returning to my people i met some of them fleeing  they told me that one called hooja the sly one had come and seized our village putting our people into slavery  so i hurried hither to learn the truth and sure enough here i found hooja and his wicked men living in my village and my fathers people but slaves among them  i was discovered and captured but hooja did not kill me  i am the chiefs son and through me he hoped to win my fathers warriors back to the village to help him in a great war he says that he will soon commence  among his prisoners is dian the beautiful one whose brother dacor the strong one chief of amoz once saved my life when he came to thuria to steal a mate  i helped him capture her and we are good friends  so when i learned that dian the beautiful one was hoojas prisoner i told him that i would not aid him if he harmed her  recently one of hoojas warriors overheard me talking with another prisoner  we were planning to combine all the prisoners seize weapons and when most of hoojas warriors were away slay the rest and retake our hilltop  had we done so we could have held it for there are only two entrancesthe narrow tunnel at one end and the steep path up the cliffs at the other  but when hooja heard what we had planned he was very angry and ordered that i die  they bound me hand and foot and placed me in a cave until all the warriors should return to witness my death but while they were away i heard someone calling me in a muffled voice which seemed to come from the wall of the cave  when i replied the voice which was a womans told me that she had overheard all that had passed between me and those who had brought me thither and that she was dacors sister and would find a way to help me  presently a little hole appeared in the wall at the point from which the voice had come  after a time i saw a womans hand digging with a bit of stone  dacors sister made a hole in the wall between the cave where i lay bound and that in which she had been confined and soon she was by my side and had cut my bonds  we talked then and i offered to make the attempt to take her away and back to the land of sari where she told me she would be able to learn the whereabouts of her mate  just now i was going to the other end of the island to see if a boat lay there and if the way was clear for our escape  most of the boats are always away now for a great many of hoojas men and nearly all the slaves are upon the island of trees where hooja is having many boats built to carry his warriors across the water to the mouth of a great river which he discovered while he was returning from phutraa vast river that empties into the sea there  the speaker pointed toward the northeast  it is wide  and  smooth and slowrunning  almost  to  the land of sari he added  and where is dian the beautiful one now i asked  i had released my prisoner as soon as i found that he was hoojas enemy and now the pair of us were squatting beside the boulder while he told his story  she returned to the cave where she had been imprisoned he replied and is awaiting me there  there is no danger that hooja will come while you are away  hooja is upon the island of trees he replied  can you direct me to the cave so that i can find it alone i asked  he said he could and in the strange yet explicit fashion of the pellucidarians he explained minutely how i might reach the cave where he had been imprisoned and through the hole in its wall reach dian  i thought it best for but one of us to return since two could accomplish but little more than one and would double the risk of discovery  in the meantime he could make his way to the sea and guard the boat which i told him lay there at the foot of the cliff  i told him to await us at the clifftop and if dian came alone to do his best to get away with her and take her to sari as i thought it quite possible that in case of detection and pursuit it might be necessary for me to hold off hoojas people while dian made her way alone to where my new friend was to await her  i impressed upon him the fact that he might have to resort to trickery or even to force to get dian to leave me but i made him promise that he would sacrifice everything even his life in an attempt to rescue dacors sister  then we partedhe to take up his position where he could watch the boat and await dian i to crawl cautiously on toward the caves  i had no difficulty in following the directions given me by juag the name by which dacors friend said he was called  there was the leaning tree my first point he told me to look for after rounding the boulder where we had met  after that i crawled to the balanced rock a huge boulder resting upon a tiny base no larger than the palm of your hand  from here i had my first view of the village of caves  a low bluff ran diagonally across one end of the mesa and in the face of this bluff were the mouths of many caves  zigzag trails led up to them and narrow ledges scooped from the face of the soft rock connected those upon the same level  the cave in which juag had been confined was at the extreme end of the cliff nearest me  by taking advantage of the bluff itself i could approach within a few feet of the aperture without being visible from any other cave  there were few people about at the time most of these were congregated at the foot of the far end of the bluff where they were so engrossed in excited conversation that i felt but little fear of detection  however i exercised the greatest care in approaching the cliff  after watching for a while until i caught an instant when every head was turned away from me i darted rabbitlike into the cave  like many of the manmade caves of pellucidar this one consisted of three chambers one behind another and all unlit except for what sunlight filtered in through the external opening  the result was gradually increasing darkness as one passed into each succeeding chamber  in the last of the three i could just distinguish objects and that was all  as i was groping around the walls for the hole that should lead into the cave where dian was imprisoned i heard a mans voice quite close to me  the speaker had evidently but just entered for he spoke in a loud tone demanding the whereabouts of one whom he had come in search of  where are you woman he cried  hooja has sent for you  and then a womans voice answered him  and what does hooja want of me  the voice was dians  i groped in the direction of the sounds feeling for the hole  he wishes you brought to the island of trees replied the man for he is ready to take you as his mate  i will not go said dian  i will die first  i am sent to bring you and bring you i shall  i could hear him crossing the cave toward her  frantically i clawed the wall of the cave in which i was in an effort to find the elusive aperture that would lead me to dians side  i heard the sound of a scuffle in the next cave  then my fingers sank into loose rock and earth in the side of the cave  in an instant i realized why i had been unable to find the opening while i had been lightly feeling the surface of the wallsdian had blocked up the hole she had made lest it arouse suspicion and lead to an early discovery of juags escape  plunging my weight against the crumbling mass i sent it crashing into the adjoining cavern  with it came i david emperor of pellucidar  i doubt if any other potentate in a worlds history ever made a more undignified entrance  i landed head first on all fours but i came quickly and was on my feet before the man in the dark guessed what had happened  he saw me though when i arose and sensing that no friend came thus precipitately turned to meet me even as i charged him  i had my stone knife in my hand and he had his  in the darkness of the cave there was little opportunity for a display of science though even at that i venture to say that we fought a very pretty duel  before i came to pellucidar i do not recall that i ever had seen a stone knife and i am sure that i never fought with a knife of any description but now i do not have to take my hat off to any of them when it comes to wielding that primitive yet wicked weapon  i could just see dian in the darkness but i knew that she could not see my features or recognize me and i enjoyed in anticipation even while i was fighting for her life and mine her dear joy when she should discover that it was i who was her deliverer  my opponent was large but he also was active and no mean knifeman he caught me once fairly in the shoulderi carry the scar yet and shall carry it to the grave  and then he did a  foolish thing for as i leaped back to gain a second  in which to calm the shock of the wound he rushed after me and tried to clinch  he rather neglected his knife for the moment in his greater desire to get his hands on me  seeing the opening i swung my left fist fairly to the point of his jaw  down he went  before ever he could scramble up again i was on him and had buried my knife in his heart  then i stood upand there was dian facing me and peering at me through the dense gloom  you are not juag she exclaimed  who are you  i took a step toward her my arms outstretched  it is i dian i said  it is david  at the sound of my voice she gave a little cry in which tears were mingleda pathetic little cry that told me all without words how far hope had gone from herand then she ran forward and threw herself in my arms  i covered her perfect lips and her beautiful face with kisses and stroked her thick black hair and told her again and again what she already knewwhat she had known for yearsthat i loved her better than all else which two worlds had to offer  we couldnt devote much time though to the happiness of lovemaking for we were in the midst of enemies who might discover us at any moment  i drew her into the adjoining cave  thence we made our way to the mouth of the cave that had given me entrance to the cliff  here i reconnoitered for a moment and seeing the coast clear ran swiftly forth with dian at my side  we dodged around the cliffend then paused for an instant listening  no sound reached our ears to indicate that any had seen us and we moved cautiously onward along the way by which i had come  as we went dian told me that her captors had informed her how close i had come in search of hereven to the land of awful shadowand how one of hoojas men who knew me had discovered me asleep and robbed me of all my possessions  and then how hooja had sent four others to find me and take me prisoner  but these men she said had not yet returned or at least she had not heard of their return  nor will you ever i responded for they have gone to that place whence none ever returns i then related my adventure with these four  we had come almost to the cliffedge where juag should be awaiting us when we saw two men walking rapidly toward the same spot from another direction  they did not see us nor did they see juag whom i now discovered hiding behind a low bush close to the verge of the precipice which drops into the sea at this point  as quickly as possible without exposing ourselves too much to the enemy we hastened forward that we might reach juag as quickly as they  but they noticed him first and immediately charged him for one of them had been his guard and they had both been sent to search for him his escape having been discovered between the time he left the cave and the time when i reached it  evidently they had wasted precious moments looking for him in other portions of the mesa  when i saw that the two of them were rushing him i called out to attract their attention to the fact that they had more than a single man to cope with  they paused at the sound of my voice and looked about  when they discovered dian and me they exchanged a few words and one of them continued toward juag while the other turned upon us  as he came nearer i saw that he carried in his hand one of my sixshooters but he was holding it by the barrel evidently mistaking it for some sort of warclub or tomahawk  i could scarce refrain a grin when i thought of the wasted possibilities of that deadly revolver in the hands of an untutored warrior of the stone age  had he but reversed it and pulled the trigger he might still be alive maybe he is for all i know since i did not kill him then  when he was about twenty feet from me i flung my javelin with a quick movement that i had learned from ghak  he ducked to avoid it and instead of receiving it in his heart for which it was intended he got it on the side of the head  down he went all in a heap  then i glanced toward juag  he was having a most exciting time  the fellow pitted against juag was a veritable giant he was hacking and hewing away at the poor slave with a villainouslooking knife that might have been designed for butchering mastodons  step by step he was forcing juag back toward the edge of the cliff with a fiendish cunning that permitted his adversary no chance to sidestep the terrible consequences of retreat in this direction  i saw quickly that in another moment juag must deliberately hurl himself to death over the precipice or be pushed over by his foeman  and as i saw juags predicament i saw too in the same instant a way to relieve him  leaping quickly to the side of the fellow i had just felled i snatched up my fallen revolver  it was a desperate chance to take and i realized it in the instant that i threw the gun up from my hip and pulled the trigger  there was no time to aim  juag was upon the very brink of the chasm  his relentless foe was pushing him hard beating at him furiously with the heavy knife  and then the revolver spokeloud and sharp  the giant threw his hands above his head whirled about like a huge top and lunged forward over the precipice  and juag  he cast a single affrighted glance in my directionnever before of course had he heard the report of a firearmand with a howl of dismay he too turned and plunged headforemost from sight  horrorstruck i hastened to the brink of the abyss just in time to see two splashes upon the surface of the little cove below  for an instant i stood there watching with dian at my side  then to my utter amazement i saw juag rise to the surface and swim strongly toward the boat  the fellow had dived that incredible distance and come up unharmed  i called to him to await us below assuring him that he need have no fear of my weapon since it would harm only my enemies  he shook his head and muttered something which i could not hear at so great a distance but when i pushed him he promised to wait for us  at the same instant dian caught my arm and pointed toward the village  my shot had brought a crowd of natives on the run toward us  the fellow whom i had stunned with my javelin had regained consciousness and scrambled to his feet  he was now racing as fast as he could go back toward his people  it looked mighty dark for dian and me with that ghastly descent between us and even the beginnings of liberty and a horde of savage enemies advancing at a rapid run  there was but one hope  that was to get dian started for the bottom without delay  i took her in my arms just for an instanti felt somehow that it might be for the last time  for the life of me i couldnt see how both of us could escape  i asked her if she could make the descent aloneif she were not afraid  she smiled up at me bravely and shrugged her shoulders  she afraid so beautiful is she that i am always having difficulty in remembering that she is a primitive halfsavage cave girl of the stone age and often find myself mentally limiting her capacities to those of the effete and overcivilized beauties of the outer crust  and you she asked as she swung over the edge of the cliff  i shall follow you after i take a shot or two at our friends i replied  i just want to give them a taste of this new medicine which is going to cure pellucidar of all its ills  that will stop them long enough for me to join you  now hurry and tell juag to be ready to shove off the moment i reach the boat or the instant that it becomes apparent that i cannot reach it  you dian must return to sari if anything happens to me that you may devote your life to carrying out with perry the hopes and plans for pellucidar that are so dear to my heart  promise me dear  she hated to promise to desert me nor would she only shaking her head and making no move to descend  the tribesmen were nearing us  juag was shouting up to us from below  it was evident that he realized from my actions that i was attempting to persuade dian to descend and that grave danger threatened us from above  dive he cried  dive  i looked at dian and then down at the abyss below us the cove appeared no larger than a saucer  how juag ever had hit it i could not guess  dive cried juag  it is the only waythere is no time to climb down    chapter xi  escape  dian glanced downward and shuddered  her tribe were hill peoplethey were not accustomed to swimming other than in quiet rivers and placid lakelets  it was not the steep that appalled her  it was the oceanvast mysterious terrible  to dive into it from this great height was beyond her  i couldnt wonder either  to have attempted it myself seemed too preposterous even for thought  only one consideration could have prompted me to leap headforemost from that giddy heightsuicide or at least so i thought at the moment  quick i urged dian  you cannot dive but i can hold them until you reach safety  and you she asked once more  can you dive when they come too close otherwise you could not escape if you waited here until i reached the bottom  i saw that she would not leave me unless she thought that i could make that frightful dive as we had seen juag make it  i glanced once downward then with a mental shrug i assured her that i would dive the moment that she reached the boat  satisfied she began the descent carefully yet swiftly  i watched her for a moment my heart in my mouth lest some slight misstep or the slipping of a fingerhold should pitch her to a frightful death upon the rocks below  then i turned toward the advancing hoojanshoosiers perry dubbed themeven going so far as to christen this island where hooja held sway indiana it is so marked now upon our maps  they were coming on at a great rate  i raised my revolver took deliberate aim at the foremost warrior and pulled the trigger  with the bark of the gun the fellow lunged forward  his head doubled beneath him  he rolled over and over two or three times before he came to a stop to lie very quietly in the thick grass among the brilliant wild flowers  those behind him halted  one of them hurled a javelin toward me but it fell shortthey were just beyond javelinrange  there were two armed with bows and arrows these i kept my eyes on  all of them appeared awestruck and frightened by the sound and effect of the firearm  they kept looking from the corpse to me and jabbering among themselves  i took advantage of the lull in hostilities to throw a quick glance over the edge toward dian  she was halfway down the cliff and progressing finely  then i turned back toward the enemy  one of the bowmen was fitting an arrow to his bow  i raised my hand  stop i cried  whoever shoots at me or advances toward me i shall kill as i killed him  i pointed at the dead man  the fellow lowered his bow  again there was animated discussion  i could see that those who were not armed with bows were urging something upon the two who were  at last the majority appeared to prevail for simultaneously the two archers raised their weapons  at the same instant i fired at one of them dropping him in his tracks  the other however launched his missile but the report of my gun had given him such a start that the arrow flew wild above my head  a second after and he too was sprawled upon the sward with a round hole between his eyes  it had been a rather good shot  i glanced over the edge again  dian was almost at the bottom  i could see juag standing just beneath her with his hands upstretched to assist her  a sullen roar from the warriors recalled my attention toward them they stood shaking their fists at me and yelling insults  from the direction of the village i saw a single warrior coming to join them he was a huge fellow and when he strode among them i could tell by his bearing and their deference toward him that he was a chieftain  he listened to all they had to tell of the happenings of the last few minutes then with a command and a roar he started for me with the whole pack at his heels  all they had needed had arrivednamely a brave leader  i had two unfired cartridges in the chambers of my gun  i let the big warrior have one of them thinking that his death would stop them all but i guess they were worked up to such a frenzy of rage by this time that nothing would have stopped them  at any rate they only yelled the louder as he fell and increased their speed toward me  i dropped another with my remaining cartridge  then they were upon meor almost  i thought of my promise to dianthe awful abyss was behind mea big devil with a huge bludgeon in front of me  i grasped my sixshooter by the barrel and hurled it squarely in his face with all my strength  then without waiting to learn the effect of my throw i wheeled ran the few steps to the edge and leaped as far out over that frightful chasm as i could  i know something of diving and all that i know i put into that dive which i was positive would be my last  for a couple of hundred feet i fell in horizontal position the momentum i gained was terrific  i could feel the air almost as a solid body so swiftly i hurtled through it  then my position gradually changed to the vertical and with hands outstretched i slipped through the air cleaving it like a flying arrow  just before i struck the water a perfect shower of javelins fell all about  my enemies bad rushed to the brink and hurled their weapons after me  by a miracle i was untouched  in the final instant i saw that i had cleared the rocks and was going to strike the water fairly  then i was in and plumbing the depths  i suppose i didnt really go very far down but it seemed to me that i should never stop  when at last i dared curve my hands upward and divert my progress toward the surface i thought that i should explode for air before i ever saw the sun again except through a swirl of water  but at last my bead popped above the waves and i filled my lungs with air  before me was the boat from which juag and dian were clambering  i couldnt understand why they were deserting it now when we were about to set out for the mainland in it but when i reached its side i understood  two heavy javelins missing dian and juag by but a hairs breadth had sunk deep into the bottom of the dugout in a straight line with the grain of the wood and split her almost in two from stem to stern  she was useless  juag was leaning over a nearby rock his hand outstretched to aid me in clambering to his side nor did i lose any time in availing myself of his proffered assistance  an occasional javelin was still dropping perilously close to us so we hastened to draw as close as possible to the cliffside where we were comparatively safe from the missiles  here we held a brief conference in which it was decided that our only hope now lay in making for the opposite end of the island as quickly as we could and utilizing the boat that i had hidden there to continue our journey to the mainland  gathering up three of the least damaged javelins that had fallen about us we set out upon our journey keeping well toward the south side of the island which juag said was less frequented by the hoojans than the central portion where the river ran  i think that this ruse must have thrown our pursuers off our track since we saw nothing of them nor heard any sound of pursuit during the greater portion of our march the length of the island  but the way juag had chosen was rough and roundabout so that we consumed one or two more marches in covering the distance than if we had followed the river  this it was which proved our undoing  those who sought us must have sent a party up the river immediately after we escaped for when we came at last onto the rivertrail not far from our destination there can be no doubt but that we were seen by hoojans who were just ahead of us on the stream  the result was that as we were passing through a clump of bush a score of warriors leaped out upon us and before we could scarce strike a blow in defense had disarmed and bound us  for a time thereafter i seemed to be entirely bereft of hope  i could see no ray of promise in the futureonly immediate death for juag and me which didnt concern me much in the face of what lay in store for dian  poor child what an awful life she had led from the moment that i had first seen her chained in the slave caravan of the mahars until now a prisoner of a no less cruel creature i could recall but a few brief intervals of peace and quiet in her tempestuous existence  before i had known her jubal the ugly one had pursued her across a savage world to make her his mate  she had eluded him and finally i had slain him but terror and privations and exposure to fierce beasts had haunted her footsteps during all her lonely flight from him  and when i had returned to the outer world the old trials had recommenced with hooja in jubals role  i could almost have wished for death to vouchsafe her that peace which fate seemed to deny her in this life  i spoke to her on the subject suggesting that we expire together  do not fear david she replied  i shall end my life before ever hooja can harm me but first i shall see that hooja dies  she drew from her breast a little leathern thong to the end of which was fastened a tiny pouch  what have you there i asked  do you recall that time you stepped upon the thing you call viper in your world she asked  i nodded  the accident gave you the idea for the poisoned arrows with which we fitted the warriors of the empire she continued  and too it gave me an idea  for a long time i have carried a vipers fang in my bosom it has given me strength to endure many dangers for it has always assured me immunity from the ultimate insult  i am not ready to die yet  first let hooja embrace the vipers fang  so we did not die together and i am glad now that we did not  it is always a foolish thing to contemplate suicide for no matter how dark the future may appear today tomorrow may hold for us that which will alter our whole life in an instant revealing to us nothing but sunshine and happiness  so for my part i shall always wait for tomorrow  in pellucidar where it is always today the wait may not be so long and so it proved for us  as we were passing a lofty flattopped hill through a parklike wood a perfect network of fiber ropes fell suddenly about our guard enmeshing them  a moment later a horde of our friends the hairy gorillamen with the mild eyes and long faces of sheep leaped among them  it was a very interesting fight  i was sorry that my bonds prevented me from taking part in it but i urged on the brutemen with my voice and cheered old grgrgr their chief each time that his mighty jaws crunched out the life of a hoojan  when the battle was over we found that a few of our captors had escaped but the majority of them lay dead about us  the gorillamen paid no further attention to them grgrgr turned to me  grgrgr and all his people are your friends he said  one saw the warriors of the sly one and followed them  he saw them capture you and then he flew to the village as fast as he could go and told me all that he had seen  the rest you know  you did much for grgrgr and grgrgrs people  we shall always do much for you  i thanked him and when i had told him of our escape and our destination he insisted on accompanying us to the sea with a great number of his fierce males  nor were we at all loath to accept his escort  we found the canoe where i had hidden it and bidding grgrgr and his warriors farewell the three of us embarked for the mainland  i questioned juag upon the feasibility of attempting to cross to the mouth of the great river of which he had told me and up which he said we might paddle almost to sari but he urged me not to attempt it since we had but a single paddle and no water or food  i had to admit the wisdom of his advice but the desire to explore this great waterway was strong upon me arousing in me at last a determination to make the attempt after first gaining the mainland and rectifying our deficiencies  we landed several miles north of thuria in a little cove that seemed to offer protection from the heavier seas which sometimes run even upon these usually pacific oceans of pellucidar  here i outlined to dian and juag the plans i had in mind  they were to fit the canoe with a small sail the purposes of which i had to explain to them bothsince neither had ever seen or heard of such a contrivance before  then they were to hunt for food which we could transport with us and prepare a receptacle for water  these two latter items were more in juags line but he kept muttering about the sail and the wind for a long time  i could see that he was not even half convinced that any such ridiculous contraption could make a canoe move through the water  we hunted near the coast for a while but were pot rewarded with any particular luck  finally we decided to hide the canoe and strike inland in search of game  at juags suggestion we dug a hole in the sand at the upper edge of the beach and buried the craft smoothing the surface over nicely and throwing aside the excess material we had excavated  then we set out away from the sea  traveling in thuria is less arduous than under the midday sun which perpetually glares down on the rest of pellucidars surface but it has its drawbacks one of which is the depressing influence exerted by the everlasting shade of the land of awful shadow  the farther inland we went the darker it became until we were moving at last through an endless twilight  the vegetation here was sparse and of a weird colorless nature though what did grow was wondrous in shape and form  often we saw huge lidi or beasts of burden striding across the dim landscape browsing upon the grotesque vegetation or drinking from the slow and sullen rivers that run down from the lidi plains to empty into the sea in thuria  what we sought was either a thaga sort of gigantic elkor one of the larger species of antelope the flesh of either of which dries nicely in the sun  the bladder of the thag would make a fine waterbottle and its skin i figured would be a good sail  we traveled a considerable distance inland entirely crossing the land of awful shadow and emerging at last upon that portion of the lidi plains which lies in the pleasant sunlight  above us the pendent world revolved upon its axis filling me especiallyand dian to an almost equal statewith wonder and insatiable curiosity as to what strange forms of life existed among the hills and valleys and along the seas and rivers which we could plainly see  before us stretched the horizonless expanses of vast pellucidar the lidi plains rolling up about us while hanging high in the heavens to the northwest of us i thought i discerned the many towers which marked the entrances to the distant mahar city whose inhabitants preyed upon the thurians  juag suggested that we travel to the northeast where he said upon the verge of the plain we would find a wooded country in which game should be plentiful  acting upon his advice we came at last to a forestjungle through which wound innumerable gamepaths  in the depths of this forbidding wood we came upon the fresh spoor of thag  shortly after by careful stalking we came within javelinrange of a small herd  selecting a great bull juag and i hurled our weapons simultaneously dian reserving hers for an emergency  the beast staggered to his feet bellowing  the rest of the herd was up and away in an instant only the wounded bull remaining with lowered head and roving eyes searching for the foe  then juag exposed himself to the view of the bullit is a part of the tactics of the huntwhile i stepped to one side behind a bush  the moment that the savage beast saw juag he charged him  juag ran straight away that the bull might be lured past my hidingplace  on he cametons of mighty bestial strength and rage  dian had slipped behind me  she too could fight a thag should emergency require  ah such a girl a rightful empress of a stone age by every standard which two worlds might bring to measure her  crashing down toward us came the bull thag bellowing and snorting with the power of a hundred outerearthly bulls  when he was opposite me i sprang for the heavy mane that covered his huge neck  to tangle my fingers in it was the work of but an instant  then i was running along at the beasts shoulder  now the theory upon which this hunting custom is based is one long ago discovered by experience and that is that a thag cannot be turned from his charge once he has started toward the object of his wrath so long as he can still see the thing he charges  he evidently believes that the man clinging to his mane is attempting to restrain him from overtaking his prey and so he pays no attention to this enemy who of course does not retard the mighty charge in the least  once in the gait of the plunging bull it was but a slight matter to vault to his back as cavalrymen mount their chargers upon the run juag was still running in plain sight ahead of the bull  his speed was but a trifle less than that of the monster that pursued him  these pellucidarians are almost as fleet as deer because i am not is one reason that i am always chosen for the closein work of the thaghunt i could not keep in front of a charging thag long enough to give the killer time to do his work  i learned that the firstand lasttime i tried it  once astride the bulls neck i drew my long stone knife and setting the point carefully over the brutes spine drove it home with both hands  at the same instant i leaped clear of the stumbling animal now no vertebrate can progress far with a knife through his spine and the thag is no exception to the rule  the fellow was down instantly  as he wallowed juag returned and the two of us leaped in when an opening afforded the opportunity and snatched our javelins from his side  then we danced about him more like two savages than anything else until we got the opening we were looking for when simultaneously our javelins pierced his wild heart stilling it forever  the thag had covered considerable ground from the point at which i had leaped upon him  when after despatching him i looked back for dian i could see nothing of her  i called aloud but receiving no reply set out at a brisk trot to where i had left her  i had no difficulty in finding the selfsame bush behind which we had hidden but dian was not there  again and again i called to be rewarded only by silence where could she be what could have become of her in the brief interval since i had seen her standing just behind me    chapter xii  kidnaped  i searched about the spot carefully  at last i was rewarded by the discovery of her javelin a few yards from the bush that had concealed us from the charging thagher javelin and the indications of a struggle revealed by the trampled vegetation and the overlapping footprints of a woman and a man  filled with consternation and dismay i followed these latter to where they suddenly disappeared a hundred yards from where the struggle had occurred  there i saw the huge imprints of a lidis feet  the story of the tragedy was all too plain  a thurian had either been following us or had accidentally espied dian and taken a fancy to her while juag and i had been engaged with the thag he had abducted her i ran swiftly back to where juag was working over the kill  as i approached him i saw that something was wrong in this quarter as well for the islander was standing upon the carcass of the thag his javelin poised for a throw  when i had come nearer i saw the cause of his belligerent attitude just beyond him stood two large jaloks or wolfdogs regarding him intentlya male and a female  their behavior was rather peculiar for they did not seem preparing to charge him  rather they were contemplating him in an attitude of questioning  juag heard me coming and turned toward me with a grin  these fellows love excitement  i could see by his expression that he was enjoying in anticipation the battle that seemed imminent  but he never hurled his javelin  a shout of warning from me stopped him for i had seen the remnants of a rope dangling from the neck of the male jalok  juag again turned toward me but this time in surprise  i was abreast him in a moment and passing him walked straight toward the two beasts  as i did so the female crouched with bared fangs  the male however leaped forward to meet me not in deadly charge but with every expression of delight and joy which the poor animal could exhibit  it was rajathe jalok whose life i had saved and whom i then had tamed there was no doubt that he was glad to see me  i now think that his seeming desertion of me had been but due to a desire to search out his ferocious mate and bring her too to live with me  when juag saw me fondling the great beast he was filled with consternation but i did not have much time to spare to raja while my mind was filled with the grief of my new loss  i was glad to see the brute and i lost no time in taking him to juag and making him understand that juag too was to be rajas friend  with the female the matter was more difficult but raja helped us out by growling savagely at her whenever she bared her fangs against us  i told juag of the disappearance of dian and of my suspicions as to the explanation of the catastrophe  he wanted to start right out after her but i suggested that with raja to help me it might be as well were he to remain and skin the thag remove its bladder and then return to where we had hidden the canoe on the beach  and so it was arranged that he was to do this and await me there for a reasonable time  i pointed to a great lake upon the surface of the pendent world above us telling him that if after this lake had appeared four times i had not returned to go either by water or land to sari and fetch ghak with an army  then calling raja after me i set out after dian and her abductor  first i took the wolf dog to the spot where the man had fought with dian  a few paces behind us followed rajas fierce mate i pointed to the ground where the evidences of the struggle were plainest and where the scent must have been strong to rajas nostrils  then i grasped the remnant of leash that hung about his neck and urged him forward upon the trail  he seemed to understand  with nose to ground he set out upon his task  dragging me after him he trotted straight out upon the lidi plains turning his steps in the direction of the thurian village  i could have guessed as much  behind us trailed the female  after a while she closed upon us until she ran quite close to me and at rajas side  it was not long before she seemed as easy in my company as did her lord and master  we must have covered considerable distance at a very rapid pace for we had reentered the great shadow when we saw a huge lidi ahead of us moving leisurely across the level plain  upon its back were two human figures  if i could have known that the jaloks would not harm dian i might have turned them loose upon the lidi and its master but i could not know and so dared take no chances  however the matter was taken out of my hands presently when raja raised his head and caught sight of his quarry  with a lunge that hurled me flat and jerked the leash from my hand he was gone with the speed of the wind after the giant lidi and its riders  at his side raced his shaggy mate only a trifle smaller than he and no whit less savage  they did not give tongue until the lidi itself discovered them and broke into a lumbering awkward but none the less rapid gallop  then the two houndbeasts commenced to bay starting with a low plaintive note that rose weird and hideous to terminate in a series of short sharp yelps  i feared that it might be the huntingcall of the pack and if this were true there would be slight chance for either dian or her abductoror myself either as far as that was concerned  so i redoubled my efforts to keep pace with the hunt but i might as well have attempted to distance the bird upon the wing as i have often reminded you i am no runner  in that instance it was just as well that i am not for my very slowness of foot played into my hands while had i been fleeter i might have lost dian that time forever  the lidi with the hounds running close on either side had almost disappeared in the darkness that enveloped the surrounding landscape when i noted that it was bearing toward the right  this was accounted for by the fact that raja ran upon his left side and unlike his mate kept leaping for the great beasts shoulder  the man on the lidis back was prodding at the hyaenodon with his long spear but still raja kept springing up and snapping  the effect of this was to turn the lidi toward the right and the longer i watched the procedure the more convinced i became that raja and his mate were working together with some end in view for the shedog merely galloped steadily at the lidis right about opposite his rump  i had seen jaloks hunting in packs and i recalled now what for the time i had not thought ofthe several that ran ahead and turned the quarry back toward the main body  this was precisely what raja and his mate were doingthey were turning the lidi back toward me or at least raja was  just why the female was keeping out of it i did not understand unless it was that she was not entirely clear in her own mind as to precisely what her mate was attempting  at any rate i was sufficiently convinced to stop where i was and await developments for i could readily realize two things  one was that i could never overhaul them before the damage was done if they should pull the lidi down now  the other thing was that if they did not pull it down for a few minutes it would have completed its circle and returned close to where i stood  and this is just what happened  the lot of them were almost swallowed up in the twilight for a moment  then they reappeared again but this time far to the right and circling back in my general direction  i waited until i could get some clear idea of the right spot to gain that i might intercept the lidi but even as i waited i saw the beast attempt to turn still more to the righta move that would have carried him far to my left in a much more circumscribed circle than the hyaenodons had mapped out for him  then i saw the female leap forward and head him and when he would have gone too far to the left raja sprang snapping at his shoulder and held him straight  straight for me the two savage beasts were driving their quarry  it was wonderful  it was something else too as i realized while the monstrous beast neared me  it was like standing in the middle of the tracks in front of an approaching expresstrain  but i didnt dare waver too much depended upon my meeting that hurtling mass of terrified flesh with a wellplaced javelin  so i stood there waiting to be run down and crushed by those gigantic feet but determined to drive home my weapon in the broad breast before i fell  the lidi was only about a hundred yards from me when raja gave a few barks in a tone that differed materially from his huntingcry instantly both he and his mate leaped for the long neck of the ruminant  neither missed  swinging in midair they hung tenaciously their weight dragging down the creatures head and so retarding its speed that before it had reached me it was almost stopped and devoting all its energies to attempting to scrape off its attackers with its forefeet  dian had seen and recognized me and was trying to extricate herself from the grasp of her captor who handicapped by his strong and agile prisoner was unable to wield his lance effectively upon the two jaloks  at the same time i was running swiftly toward them  when the man discovered me he released his hold upon dian and sprang to the ground ready with his lance to meet me  my javelin was no match for his longer weapon which was used more for stabbing than as a missile  should i miss him at my first cast as was quite probable since he was prepared for me i would have to face his formidable lance with nothing more than a stone knife  the outlook was scarcely entrancing  evidently i was soon to be absolutely at his mercy  seeing my predicament he ran toward me to get rid of one antagonist before he had to deal with the other two  he could not guess of course that the two jaloks were hunting with me but he doubtless thought that after they had finished the lidi they would make after the human preythe beasts are notorious killers often slaying wantonly  but as the thurian came raja loosened his hold upon the lidi and dashed for him with the female close after  when the man saw them he yelled to me to help him protesting that we should both be killed if we did not fight together  but i only laughed at him and ran toward dian  both the fierce beasts were upon the thurian simultaneouslyhe must have died almost before his body tumbled to the ground  then the female wheeled toward dian  i was standing by her side as the thing charged her my javelin ready to receive her  but again raja was too quick for me  i imagined he thought she was making for me for he couldnt have known anything of my relations toward dian  at any rate he leaped full upon her back and dragged her down  there ensued forthwith as terrible a battle as one would wish to see if battles were gaged by volume of noise and riotousness of action i thought that both the beasts would be torn to shreds  when finally the female ceased to struggle and rolled over on her back her forepaws limply folded i was sure that she was dead  raja stood over her growling his jaws close to her throat  then i saw that neither of them bore a scratch  the male had simply administered a severe drubbing to his mate  it was his way of teaching her that i was sacred  after a moment he moved away and let her rise when she set about smoothing down her rumpled coat while he came stalking toward dian and me  i had an arm about dian now  as raja came close i caught him by the neck and pulled him up to me  there i stroked him and talked to him bidding dian  do the same until i think he pretty well understood that if i was his friend so was dian  for a long time he was inclined to be shy of her often baring his teeth at her approach and it was a much longer time before the female made friends with us but by careful kindness by never eating without sharing our meat with them and by feeding them from our hands we finally won the confidence of both animals  however that was a long time after  with the two beasts trotting after us we returned to where we had left juag  here i had the dickens own time keeping the female from juags throat  of all the venomous wicked cruelhearted beasts on two worlds i think a female hyaenodon takes the palm  but eventually she tolerated juag as she had dian and me and the five of us set out toward the coast for juag had just completed his labors on the thag when we arrived  we ate some of the meat before starting and gave the hounds some  all that we could we carried upon our backs  on the way to the canoe we met with no mishaps  dian told me that the fellow who had stolen her had come upon her from behind while the roaring of the thag had drowned all other noises and that the first she had known he had disarmed her and thrown her to the back of his lidi which had been lying down close by waiting for him  by the time the thag had ceased bellowing the fellow had got well away upon his swift mount  by holding one palm over her mouth he had prevented her calling for help  i thought she concluded that i should have to use the vipers tooth after all  we reached the beach at last and unearthed the canoe  then we busied ourselves stepping a mast and rigging a small sailjuag and i that iswhile dian cut the thag meat into long strips for drying when we should be out in the sunlight once more  at last all was done  we were ready to embark  i had no difficulty in getting raja aboard the dugout but raneeas we christened her after i had explained to dian the meaning of raja and its feminine equivalentpositively refused for a time to follow her mate aboard in fact we had to shove off without her  after a moment however she plunged into the water and swam after us  i let her come alongside and then juag and i pulled her in she snapping and snarling at us as we did so but strange to relate she didnt offer to attack us after we had ensconced her safely in the bottom alongside raja  the canoe behaved much better under sail than i had hopedinfinitely better than the battleship sari hadand we made good progress almost due west across the gulf upon the opposite side of which i hoped to find the mouth of the river of which juag had told me  the islander was much interested and impressed by the sail and its results  he had not been able to understand exactly what i hoped to accomplish with it while we were fitting up the boat but when he saw the clumsy dugout move steadily through the water without paddles he was as delighted as a child  we made splendid headway on the trip coming into sight of land at last  juag had been terrorstricken when he had learned that i intended crossing the ocean and when we passed out of sight of land he was in a blue funk  he said that he had never heard of such a thing before in his life and that always he had understood that those who ventured far from land never returned for how could they find their way when they could see no land to steer for  i tried to explain the compass to him and though he never really grasped the scientific explanation of it yet he did learn to steer by it quite as well as i we passed several islands on the journeyislands which juag told me were entirely unknown to his own island folk  indeed our eyes may have been the first ever to rest upon them  i should have liked to stop off and explore them but the business of empire would brook no unnecessary delays  i asked juag how hooja expected to reach the mouth of the river which we were in search of if he didnt cross the gulf and the islander explained that hooja would undoubtedly follow the coast around  for some time we sailed up the coast searching for the river and at last we found it  so great was it that i thought it must be a mighty gulf until the mass of driftwood that came out upon the first ebb tide convinced me that it was the mouth of a river  there were the trunks of trees uprooted by the undermining of the river banks giant creepers flowers grasses and now and then the body of some land animal or bird  i was all excitement to commence our upward journey when there occurred that which i had never before seen within pellucidara really terrific windstorm  it blew down the river upon us with a ferocity and suddenness that took our breaths away and before we could get a chance to make the shore it became too late  the best that we could do was to hold the scudding craft before the wind and race along in a smother of white spume  juag was terrified  if dian was she hid it for was she not the daughter of a once great chief the sister of a king and the mate of an emperor  raja and ranee were frightened  the former crawled close to my side and buried his nose against me  finally even fierce ranee was moved to seek sympathy from a human being  she slunk to dian pressing close against her and whimpering while dian stroked her shaggy neck and talked to her as i talked to raja  there was nothing for us to do but try to keep the canoe right side up and straight before the wind  for what seemed an eternity the tempest neither increased nor abated  i judged that we must have blown a hundred miles before the wind and straight out into an unknown sea  as suddenly as the wind rose it died again and when it died it veered to blow at right angles to its former course in a gentle breeze  i asked juag then what our course was for he had had the compass last it had been on a leather thong about his neck  when he felt for it the expression that came into his eyes told me as plainly as words what had happenedthe compass was lost  the compass was lost  and we were out of sight of land without a single celestial body to guide us even the pendent world was not visible from our position  our plight seemed hopeless to me but i dared not let dian and juag guess how utterly dismayed i was though as i soon discovered there was nothing to be gained by trying to keep the worst from juaghe knew it quite as well as i he had always known from the legends of his people the dangers of the open sea beyond the sight of land  the compass since he had learned its uses from me had been all that he had to buoy his hope of eventual salvation from the watery deep  he had seen how it had guided me across the water to the very coast that i desired to reach and so he had implicit confidence in it  now that it was gone his confidence had departed also  there seemed but one thing to do that was to keep on sailing straight before the windsince we could travel most rapidly along that courseuntil we sighted land of some description  if it chanced to be the mainland well and good if an islandwell we might live upon an island  we certainly could not live long in this little boat with only a few strips of dried thag and a few quarts of water left  quite suddenly a thought occurred to me  i was surprised that it had not come before as a solution to our problem  i turned toward juag  you pellucidarians are endowed with a wonderful instinct i reminded him an instinct that points the way straight to your homes no matter in what strange land you may find yourself  now all we have to do is let dian guide us toward amoz and we shall come in a short time to the same coast whence we just were blown  as i spoke i looked at them with a smile of renewed hope but there was no answering smile in their eyes  it was dian who enlightened me  we could do all this upon land she said  but upon the water that power is denied us  i do not know why but i have always heard that this is truethat only upon the water may a pellucidarian be lost this is i think why we all fear the great ocean soeven those who go upon its surface in canoes  juag has told us that they never go beyond the sight of land  we had lowered the sail after the blow while we were discussing the best course to pursue  our little craft had been drifting idly rising and falling with the great waves that were now diminishing  sometimes we were upon the crestagain in the hollow  as dian ceased speaking she let her eyes range across the limitless expanse of billowing waters  we rose to a great height upon the crest of a mighty wave  as we topped it dian gave an exclamation and pointed astern  boats she cried  boats many many boats  juag and i leaped to our feet but our little craft had now dropped to the trough and we could see nothing but walls of water close upon either hand  we waited for the next wave to lift us and when it did we strained our eyes in the direction that dian had indicated  sure enough scarce half a mile away were several boats and scattered far and wide behind us as far as we could see were many others we could not make them out in the distance or in the brief glimpse that we caught of them before we were plunged again into the next wave canon but they were boats  and in them must be human beings like ourselves    chapter xiii  racing for life  at last the sea subsided and we were able to get a better view of the armada of small boats in our wake  there must have been two hundred of them  juag said that he had never seen so many boats before in all his life  where had they come from juag was first to hazard a guess  hooja he said was building many boats to carry his warriors to the great river and up it toward sari  he was building them with almost all his warriors and many slaves upon the island of trees  no one else in all the history of pellucidar has ever built so many boats as they told me hooja was building  these must be hoojas boats  and they were blown out to sea by the great storm just as we were suggested dian  there can be no better explanation of them i agreed  what shall we do asked juag  suppose we make sure that they are really hoojas people suggested dian  it may be that they are not and that if we run away from them before we learn definitely who they are we shall be running away from a chance to live and find the mainland  they may be a people of whom we have never even heard and if so we can ask them to help usif they know the way to the mainland  which they will not interposed juag  well i said it cant make our predicament any more trying to wait until we find out who they are  they are heading for us now evidently they have spied our sail and guess that we do not belong to their fleet  they probably want to ask the way to the mainland themselves said juag who was nothing if not a pessimist  if they want to catch us they can do it if they can paddle faster than we can sail i said  if we let them come close enough to discover their identity and can then sail faster than they can paddle we can get away from them anyway so we might as well wait  and wait we did  the sea calmed rapidly so that by the time the foremost canoe had come within five hundred yards of us we could see them all plainly  every one was headed for us  the dugouts which were of unusual length were manned by twenty paddlers ten to a side  besides the paddlers there were twentyfive or more warriors in each boat  when the leader was a hundred yards from us dian called our attention to the fact that several of her crew were sagoths  that convinced us that the flotilla was indeed hoojas  i told juag to hail them and get what information he could while i remained in the bottom of our canoe as much out of sight as possible  dian lay down at full length in the bottom i did not want them to see and recognize her if they were in truth hoojas people  who are you shouted juag standing up in the boat and making a megaphone of his palms  a figure arose in the bow of the leading canoea figure that i was sure i recognized even before he spoke  i am hooja cried the man in answer to juag  for some reason he did not recognize his former prisoner and slavepossibly because he had so many of them  i come from the island of trees he continued  a hundred of my boats were lost in the great storm and all their crews drowned  where is the land what are you and what strange thing is that which flutters from the little tree in the front of your canoe  he referred to our sail flapping idly in the wind  we too are lost replied juag  we know not where the land is  we are going back to look for it now  so saying he commenced to scull the canoes nose before the wind while i made fast the primitive sheets that held our crude sail  we thought it time to be going  there wasnt much wind at the time and the heavy lumbering dugout was slow in getting under way  i thought it never would gain any momentum and all the while hoojas canoe was drawing rapidly nearer propelled by the strong arms of his twenty paddlers  of course their dugout was much larger than ours and consequently infinitely heavier and more cumbersome nevertheless it was coming along at quite a clip and ours was yet but barely moving  dian and i remained out of sight as much as possible for the two craft were now well within bowshot of one another and i knew that hooja had archers  hooja called to juag to stop when he saw that our craft was moving  he was much interested in the sail and not a little awed as i could tell by his shouted remarks and questions  raising my head i saw him plainly  he would have made an excellent target for one of my guns and i had never been sorrier that i had lost them  we were now picking up speed a trifle and he was not gaining upon us so fast as at first  in consequence his requests that we stop suddenly changed to commands as he became aware that we were trying to escape him  come back he shouted  come back or ill fire  i use the word fire because it more nearly translates into english the pellucidarian word trag which covers the launching of any deadly missile  but juag only seized his paddle more tightlythe paddle that answered the purpose of rudder and commenced to assist the wind by vigorous strokes  then hooja gave the command to some of his archers to fire upon us  i couldnt lie hidden in the bottom of the boat leaving juag alone exposed to the deadly shafts so i arose and seizing another paddle set to work to help him  dian joined me though i did my best to persuade her to remain sheltered but being a woman she must have her own way  the instant that hooja saw us he recognized us  the whoop of triumph he raised indicated how certain he was that we were about to fall into his hands  a shower of arrows fell about us  then hooja caused his men to cease firinghe wanted us alive  none of the missiles struck us for hoojas archers were not nearly the marksmen that are my sarians and amozites  we had now gained sufficient headway to hold our own on about even terms with hoojas paddlers  we did not seem to be gaining though and neither did they  how long this nerveracking experience lasted i cannot guess though we had pretty nearly finished our meager supply of provisions when the wind picked up a bit and we commenced to draw away  not once yet had we sighted land nor could i understand it since so many of the seas i had seen before were thickly dotted with islands our plight was anything but pleasant yet i think that hooja and his forces were even worse off than we for they had no food nor water at all  far out behind us in a long line that curved upward in the distance to be lost in the haze strung hoojas two hundred boats  but one would have been enough to have taken us could it have come alongside  we had drawn some fifty yards ahead of hoojathere had been times when we were scarce ten yards in advanceand were feeling considerably safer from capture  hoojas men working in relays were commencing to show the effects of the strain under which they had been forced to work without food or water and i think their weakening aided us almost as much as the slight freshening of the wind  hooja must have commenced to realize that he was going to lose us for he again gave orders that we be fired upon  volley after volley of arrows struck about us the distance was so great by this time that most of the arrows fell short while those that reached us were sufficiently spent to allow us to ward them off with our paddles however it was a most exciting ordeal  hooja stood in the bow of his boat alternately urging his men to greater speed and shouting epithets at me  but we continued to draw away from him  at last the wind rose to a fair gale and we simply raced away from our pursuers as if they were standing still  juag was so tickled that he forgot all about his hunger and thirst  i think that he had never been entirely reconciled to the heathenish invention which i called a sail and that down in the bottom of his heart he believed that the paddlers would eventually overhaul us but now he couldnt praise it enough  we had a strong gale for a considerable time and eventually dropped hoojas fleet so far astern that we could no longer discern them  and thenah i shall never forget that momentdian sprang to her feet with a cry of land  sure enough dead ahead a long low coast stretched across our bow it was still a long way off and we couldnt make out whether it was island or mainland but at least it was land  if ever shipwrecked mariners were grateful we were then  raja and ranee were commencing to suffer for lack of food and i could swear that the latter often cast hungry glances upon us though i am equally sure that no such hideous thoughts ever entered the head of her mate  we watched them both most closely however  once while stroking ranee i managed to get a rope around her neck and make her fast to the side of the boat  then i felt a bit safer for dian  it was pretty close quarters in that little dugout for three human beings and two practically wild maneating dogs but we had to make the best of it since i would not listen to juags suggestion that we kill and eat raja and ranee  we made good time to within a few miles of the shore  then the wind died suddenly out  we were all of us keyed up to such a pitch of anticipation that the blow was doubly hard to bear  and it was a blow too since we could not tell in what quarter the wind might rise again but juag and i set to work to paddle the remaining distance  almost immediately the wind rose again from precisely the opposite direction from which it had formerly blown so that it was mighty hard work making progress against it  next it veered again so that we had to turn and run with it parallel to the coast to keep from being swamped in the trough of the seas  and while we were suffering all these disappointments hoojas fleet appeared in the distance  they evidently had gone far to the left of our course for they were now almost behind us as we ran parallel to the coast but we were not much afraid of being overtaken in the wind that was blowing  the gale kept on increasing but it was fitful swooping down upon us in great gusts and then going almost calm for an instant  it was after one of these momentary calms that the catastrophe occurred  our sail hung limp and our momentum decreased when of a sudden a particularly vicious squall caught us  before i could cut the sheets the mast had snapped at the thwart in which it was stepped  the worst had happened juag and i seized paddles and kept the canoe with the wind but that squall was the parting shot of the gale which died out immediately after leaving us free to make for the shore which we lost no time in attempting  but hooja had drawn closer in toward shore than we so it looked as if he might head us off before we could land  however we did our best to distance him dian taking a paddle with us  we were in a fair way to succeed when there appeared pouring from among the trees beyond the beach a horde of yelling painted savages brandishing all sorts of devilishlooking primitive weapons  so menacing was their attitude that we realized at once the folly of attempting to land among them  hooja was drawing closer to us  there was no wind  we could not hope to outpaddle him  and with our sail gone no wind would help us though as if in derision at our plight a steady breeze was now blowing  but we had no intention of sitting idle while our fate overtook us so we bent to our paddles and keeping parallel with the coast did our best to pull away from our pursuers  it was a grueling experience  we were weakened by lack of food  we were suffering the pangs of thirst  capture and death were close at hand  yet i think that we gave a good account of ourselves in our final effort to escape  our boat was so much smaller and lighter than any of hoojas that the three of us forced it ahead almost as rapidly as his larger craft could go under their twenty paddles  as we raced along the coast for one of those seemingly interminable periods that may draw hours into eternities where the labor is soulsearing and there is no way to measure time i saw what i took for the opening to a bay or the mouth of a great river a short distance ahead of us  i wished that we might make for it but with the menace of hooja close behind and the screaming natives who raced along the shore parallel to us i dared not attempt it  we were not far from shore in that mad flight from death  even as i paddled i found opportunity to glance occasionally toward the natives they were white but hideously painted  from their gestures and weapons i took them to be a most ferocious race  i was rather glad that we had not succeeded in landing among them  hoojas fleet had been in much more compact formation when we sighted them this time than on the occasion following the tempest  now they were moving rapidly in pursuit of us all well within the radius of a mile  five of them were leading all abreast and were scarce two hundred yards from us  when i glanced over my shoulder i could see that the archers had already fitted arrows to their bows in readiness to fire upon us the moment that they should draw within range  hope was low in my breast  i could not see the slightest chance of escaping them for they were overhauling us rapidly now since they were able to work their paddles in relays while we three were rapidly wearying beneath the constant strain that had been put upon us  it was then that juag called my attention to the rift in the shoreline which i had thought either a bay or the mouth of a great river  there i saw moving slowly out into the sea that which filled my soul with wonder    chapter xiv  gore and dreams  it was a twomasted felucca with lateen sails the craft was long and low  in it were more than fifty men twenty or thirty of whom were at oars with which the craft was being propelled from the lee of the land i was dumbfounded  could it be that the savage painted natives i had seen on shore had so perfected the art of navigation that they were masters of such advanced building and rigging as this craft proclaimed it seemed impossible and as i looked i saw another of the same type swing into view and follow its sister through the narrow strait out into the ocean  nor were these all  one after another following closely upon one anothers heels came fifty of the trim graceful vessels  they were cutting in between hoojas fleet and our little dugout  when they came a bit closer my eyes fairly popped from my head at what i saw for in the eye of the leading felucca stood a man with a seaglass leveled upon us  who could they be was there a civilization within pellucidar of such wondrous advancement as this were there fardistant lands of which none of my people had ever heard where a race had so greatly outstripped all other races of this inner world  the man with the glass had lowered it and was shouting to us  i could not make out his words but presently i saw that he was pointing aloft when i looked i saw a pennant fluttering from the peak of the forward lateen yarda red white and blue pennant with a single great white star in a field of blue  then i knew  my eyes went even wider than they had before  it was the navy it was the navy of the empire of pellucidar which i had instructed perry to build in my absence  it was my navy  i dropped my paddle and stood up and shouted and waved my hand  juag and dian looked at me as if i had gone suddenly mad  when i could stop shouting i told them and they shared my joy and shouted with me  but still hooja was coming nearer nor could the leading felucca overhaul him before he would be alongside or at least within bowshot  hooja must have been as much mystified as we were as to the identity of the strange fleet but when he saw me waving to them he evidently guessed that they were friendly to us so he urged his men to redouble their efforts to reach us before the felucca cut him off  he shouted word back to others of his fleetword that was passed back until it had reached them alldirecting them to run alongside the strangers and board them for with his two hundred craft and his eight or ten thousand warriors he evidently felt equal to overcoming the fifty vessels of the enemy which did not seem to carry over three thousand men all told  his own personal energies he bent to reaching dian and me first leaving the rest of the work to his other boats  i thought that there could be little doubt that he would be successful in so far as we were concerned and i feared for the revenge that he might take upon us should the battle go against his force as i was sure it would for i knew that perry and his mezops must have brought with them all the arms and ammunition that had been contained in the prospector  but i was not prepared for what happened next  as hoojas canoe reached a point some twenty yards from us a great puff of smoke broke from the bow of the leading felucca followed almost simultaneously by a terrific explosion and a solid shot screamed close over the heads of the men in hoojas craft raising a great splash where it clove the water just beyond them  perry had perfected gunpowder and built cannon  it was marvelous dian and juag as much surprised as hooja turned wondering eyes toward me  again the cannon spoke  i suppose that by comparison with the great guns of modern naval vessels of the outer world it was a pitifully small and inadequate thing but here in pellucidar where it was the first of its kind it was about as aweinspiring as anything you might imagine  with the report an iron cannonball about five inches in diameter struck hoojas dugout just above the waterline tore a great splintering hole in its side turned it over and dumped its occupants into the sea  the four dugouts that had been abreast of hooja had turned to intercept the leading felucca  even now in the face of what must have been a withering catastrophe to them they kept bravely on toward the strange and terrible craft  in them were fully two hundred men while but fifty lined the gunwale of the felucca to repel them  the commander of the felucca who proved to be ja let them come quite close and then turned loose upon them a volley of shots from smallarms  the cave men and sagoths in the dugouts seemed to wither before that blast of death like dry grass before a prairie fire  those who were not hit dropped their bows and javelins and seizing upon paddles attempted to escape  but the felucca pursued them relentlessly her crew firing at will  at last i heard ja shouting to the survivors in the dugoutsthey were all quite close to us nowoffering them their lives if they would surrender  perry was standing close behind ja and i knew that this merciful action was prompted perhaps commanded by the old man for no pellucidarian would have thought of showing leniency to a defeated foe  as there was no alternative save death the survivors surrendered and a moment later were taken aboard the amoz the name that i could now see printed in large letters upon the feluccas bow and which no one in that whole world could read except perry and i  when the prisoners were aboard ja brought the felucca alongside our dugout  many were the willing hands that reached down to lift us to her decks  the bronze faces of the mezops were broad with smiles and perry was fairly beside himself with joy  dian went aboard first and then juag as i wished to help raja and ranee aboard myself well knowing that it would fare ill with any mezop who touched them  we got them aboard at last and a great commotion they caused among the crew who had never seen a wild beast thus handled by man before  perry and dian and i were so full of questions that we fairly burst but we had to contain ourselves for a while since the battle with the rest of hoojas fleet had scarce commenced  from the small forward decks of the feluccas perrys crude cannon were belching smoke flame thunder and death  the air trembled to the roar of them  hoojas horde intrepid savage fighters that they were were closing in to grapple in a last deathstruggle with the mezops who manned our vessels  the handling of our fleet by the red island warriors of jas clan was far from perfect  i could see that perry had lost no time after the completion of the boats in setting out upon this cruise  what little the captains and crews had learned of handling feluccas they must have learned principally since they embarked upon this voyage and while experience is an excellent teacher and had done much for them they still had a great deal to learn  in maneuvering for position they were continually fouling one another and on two occasions shots from our batteries came near to striking our own ships  no sooner however was i aboard the flagship than i attempted to rectify this trouble to some extent  by passing commands by word of mouth from one ship to another i managed to get the fifty feluccas into some sort of line with the flagship in the lead  in this formation we commenced slowly to circle the position of the enemy  the dugouts came for us right along in an attempt to board us but by keeping on the move in one direction and circling we managed to avoid getting in each others way and were enabled to fire our cannon and our small arms with less danger to our own comrades  when i had a moment to look about me i took in the felucca on which i was  i am free to confess that i marveled at the excellent construction and stanch yet speedy lines of the little craft  that perry had chosen this type of vessel seemed rather remarkable for though i had warned him against turreted battleships armor and like useless show i had fully expected that when i beheld his navy i should find considerable attempt at grim and terrible magnificence for it was always perrys idea to overawe these ignorant cave men when we had to contend with them in battle  but i had soon learned that while one might easily astonish them with some new engine of war it was an utter impossibility to frighten them into surrender  i learned later that ja had gone carefully over the plans of various craft with perry  the old man had explained in detail all that the text told him of them  the two had measured out dimensions upon the ground that ja might see the sizes of different boats  perry had built models and ja had had him read carefully and explain all that they could find relative to the handling of sailing vessels  the result of this was that ja was the one who had chosen the felucca  it was well that perry had had so excellent a balance wheel for he had been wild to build a huge frigate of the nelsonian erahe told me so himself  one thing that had inclined ja particularly to the felucca was the fact that it included oars in its equipment  he realized the limitations of his people in the matter of sails and while they had never used oars the implement was so similar to a paddle that he was sure they quickly could master the artand they did  as soon as one hull was completed ja kept it on the water constantly first with one crew and then with another until two thousand red warriors had learned to row then they stepped their masts and a crew was told off for the first ship  while the others were building they learned to handle theirs  as each succeeding boat was launched its crew took it out and practiced with it under the tutorage of those who had graduated from the first ship and so on until a full complement of men had been trained for every boat  well to get back to the battle the hoojans kept on coming at us and as fast as they came we mowed them down  it was little else than slaughter  time and time again i cried to them to surrender promising them their lives if they would do so  at last there were but ten boatloads left  these turned in flight  they thought they could paddle away from usit was pitiful i passed the word from boat to boat to cease firingnot to kill another hoojan unless they fired on us  then we set out after them  there was a nice little breeze blowing and we bowled along after our quarry as gracefully and as lightly as swans upon a park lagoon  as we approached them i could see not only wonder but admiration in their eyes  i hailed the nearest dugout  throw down your arms and come aboard us i cried and you shall not be harmed  we will feed you and return you to the mainland  then you shall go free upon your promise never to bear arms against the emperor of pellucidar again  i think it was the promise of food that interested them most  they could scarce believe that we would not kill them  but when i exhibited the prisoners we already had taken and showed them that they were alive and unharmed a great sagoth in one of the boats asked me what guarantee i could give that i would keep my word  none other than my word i replied  that i do not break  the pellucidarians themselves are rather punctilious about this same matter so the sagoth could understand that i might possibly be speaking the truth  but he could not understand why we should not kill them unless we meant to enslave them which i had as much as denied already when i had promised to set them free  ja couldnt exactly see the wisdom of my plan either  he thought that we ought to follow up the ten remaining dugouts and sink them all but i insisted that we must free as many as possible of our enemies upon the mainland  you see i explained these men will return at once to hoojas island to the mahar cities from which they come or to the countries from which they were stolen by the mahars  they are men of two races and of many countries  they will spread the story of our victory far and wide and while they are with us we will let them see and hear many other wonderful things which they may carry back to their friends and their chiefs  its the finest chance for free publicity perry i added to the old man that you or i have seen in many a day  perry agreed with me  as a matter of fact he would have agreed to anything that would have restrained us from killing the poor devils who fell into our hands  he was a great fellow to invent gunpowder and firearms and cannon but when it came to using these things to kill people he was as tenderhearted as a chicken  the sagoth who had spoken was talking to other sagoths in his boat evidently they were holding a council over the question of the wisdom of surrendering  what will become of you if you dont surrender to us i asked  if we do not open up our batteries on you again and kill you all you will simply drift about the sea helplessly until you die of thirst and starvation  you cannot return to the islands for you have seen as well as we that the natives there are very numerous and warlike  they would kill you the moment you landed  the upshot of it was that the boat of which the sagoth speaker was in charge surrendered  the sagoths threw down their weapons and we took them aboard the ship next in line behind the amoz  first ja had to impress upon the captain and crew of the ship that the prisoners were not to be abused or killed  after that the remaining dugouts paddled up and surrendered  we distributed them among the entire fleet lest there be too many upon any one vessel  thus ended the first real naval engagement that the pellucidarian seas had ever witnessedthough perry still insists that the action in which the sari took part was a battle of the first magnitude  the battle over and the prisoners disposed of and fedand do not imagine that dian juag and i as well as the two hounds were not fed alsoi turned my attention to the fleet  we had the feluccas close in about the flagship and with all the ceremony of a medieval potentate on parade i received the commanders of the fortynine feluccas that accompanied the flagshipdian and i togetherthe empress and the emperor of pellucidar  it was a great occasion  the savage bronze warriors entered into the spirit of it for as i learned later dear old perry had left no opportunity neglected for impressing upon them that david was emperor of pellucidar and that all that they were accomplishing and all that he was accomplishing was due to the power and redounded to the glory of david  the old man must have rubbed it in pretty strong for those fierce warriors nearly came to blows in their efforts to be among the first of those to kneel before me and kiss my hand  when it came to kissing dians i think they enjoyed it more i know i should have  a happy thought occurred to me as i stood upon the little deck of the amoz with the first of perrys primitive cannon behind me  when ja kneeled at my feet and first to do me homage i drew from its scabbard at his side the sword of hammered iron that perry had taught him to fashion  striking him lightly on the shoulder i created him king of anoroc  each captain of the fortynine other feluccas i made a  duke i left it to perry to enlighten them as to the value of the honors i had bestowed upon them  during these ceremonies raja and ranee had stood beside dian and me their bellies had been well filled but still they had difficulty in permitting so much edible humanity to pass unchallenged  it was a good education for them though and never after did they find it difficult to associate with the human race without arousing their appetites  after the ceremonies were over we had a chance to talk with perry and ja  the former told me that ghak king of sari had sent my letter and map to him by a runner and that he and ja had at once decided to set out on the completion of the fleet to ascertain the correctness of my theory that the lural az in which the anoroc islands lay was in reality the same ocean as that which lapped the shores of thuria under the name of sojar az or great sea  their destination had been the island retreat of hooja and they had sent word to ghak of their plans that we might work in harmony with them  the tempest that had blown us off the coast of the continent had blown them far to the south also  shortly before discovering us they had come into a great group of islands from between the largest two of which they were sailing when they saw hoojas fleet pursuing our dugout  i asked perry if he had any idea as to where we were or in what direction lay hoojas island or the continent  he replied by producing his map on which he had carefully marked the newly discovered islandsthere described as the unfriendly isleswhich showed hoojas island northwest of us about two points west  he then explained that with compass chronometer log and reel they had kept a fairly accurate record of their course from the time they had set out  four of the feluccas were equipped with these instruments and all of the captains had been instructed in their use  i was very greatly surprised at the ease with which these savages had mastered the rather intricate detail of this unusual work but perry assured me that they were a wonderfully intelligent race and had been quick to grasp all that he had tried to teach them  another thing that surprised me was the fact that so much had been accomplished in so short a time for i could not believe that i had been gone from anoroc for a sufficient period to permit of building a fleet of fifty feluccas and mining iron ore for the cannon and balls to say nothing of manufacturing these guns and the crude muzzleloading rifles with which every mezop was armed as well as the gunpowder and ammunition they had in such ample quantities  time exclaimed perry  well how long were you gone from anoroc before we picked you up in the sojar az  that was a puzzler and i had to admit it  i didnt know how much time had elapsed and neither did perry for time is nonexistent in pellucidar  then you see david he continued i had almost unbelievable resources at my disposal  the mezops inhabiting the anoroc islands which stretch far out to sea beyond the three principal isles with which you are familiar number well into the millions and by far the greater part of them are friendly to ja  men women and children turned to and worked the moment ja explained the nature of our enterprise  and not only were they anxious to do all in their power to hasten the day when the mahars should be overthrown butand this counted for most of allthey are simply ravenous for greater knowledge and for better ways of doing things  the contents of the prospector set their imaginations to working overtime so that they craved to own themselves the knowledge which had made it possible for other men to create and build the things which you brought back from the outer world  and then continued the old man the element of time or rather lack of time operated to my advantage  there being no nights there was no laying off from workthey labored incessantly stopping only to eat and on rare occasions to sleep  once we had discovered iron ore we had enough mined in an incredibly short time to build a thousand cannon  i had only to show them once how a thing should be done and they would fall to work by thousands to do it  why no sooner had we fashioned the first muzzleloader and they had seen it work successfully than fully three thousand mezops fell to work to make rifles  of course there was much confusion and lost motion at first but eventually ja got them in hand detailing squads of them under competent chiefs to certain work  we now have a hundred expert gunmakers  on a little isolated isle we have a great powderfactory  near the ironmine which is on the mainland is a smelter and on the eastern shore of anoroc a well equipped shipyard  all these industries are guarded by forts in which several cannon are mounted and where warriors are always on guard  you would be surprised now david at the aspect of anoroc  i am surprised myself it seems always to me as i compare it with the day that i first set foot upon it from the deck of the sari that only a miracle could have worked the change that has taken place  it is a miracle i said it is nothing short of a miracle to transplant all the wondrous possibilities of the twentieth century back to the stone age  it is a miracle to think that only five hundred miles of earth separate two epochs that are really ages and ages apart  it is stupendous perry but still more stupendous is the power that you and i wield in this great world  these people look upon us as little less than supermen  we must show them that we are all of that  we must give them the best that we have perry  yes he agreed we must  i have been thinking a great deal lately that some kind of shrapnel shell or explosive bomb would be a most splendid innovation in their warfare  then there are breechloading rifles and those with magazines that i must hasten to study out and learn to reproduce as soon as we get settled down again and  hold on perry i cried  i didnt mean these sorts of things at all  i said that we must give them the best we have  what we have given them so far has been the worst  we have given them war and the munitions of war  in a single day we have made their wars infinitely more terrible and bloody than in all their past ages they have been able to make them with their crude primitive weapons  in a period that could scarcely have exceeded two outer earthly hours our fleet practically annihilated the largest armada of native canoes that the pellucidarians ever before had gathered together  we butchered some eight thousand warriors with the twentiethcentury gifts we brought  why they wouldnt have killed that many warriors in the entire duration of a dozen of their wars with their own weapons  no perry weve got to give them something better than scientific methods of killing one another  the old man looked at me in amazement  there was reproach in his eyes too  why david he said sorrowfully  i thought that you would be pleased with what i had done  we planned these things together and i am sure that it was you who suggested practically all of it  i have done only what i thought you wished done and i have done it the best that i know how  i laid my hand on the old mans shoulder  bless your heart perry i cried  youve accomplished miracles you have done precisely what i should have done only youve done it better  im not finding fault but i dont wish to lose sight myself or let you lose sight of the greater work which must grow out of this preliminary and necessary carnage  first we must place the empire upon a secure footing and we can do so only by putting the fear of us in the hearts of our enemies but after that  ah perry that is the day i look forward to when you and i can build sewingmachines instead of battleships harvesters of crops instead of harvesters of men plowshares and telephones schools and colleges printingpresses and paper when our merchant marine shall ply the great pellucidarian seas and cargoes of silks and typewriters and books shall forge their ways where only hideous saurians have held sway since time began  amen said perry  and dian who was standing at my side pressed my hand    chapter xv  conquest and peace  the fleet sailed directly for hoojas island coming to anchor at its northeastern extremity before the flattopped hill that had been hoojas stronghold  i sent one of the prisoners ashore to demand an immediate surrender but as he told me afterward they wouldnt believe all that he told them so they congregated on the clifftop and shot futile arrows at us  in reply i had five of the feluccas cannonade them  when they scampered away at the sound of the terrific explosions and at sight of the smoke and the iron balls i landed a couple of hundred red warriors and led them to the opposite end of the hill into the tunnel that ran to its summit  here we met a little resistance but a volley from the muzzleloaders turned back those who disputed our right of way and presently we gained the mesa  here again we met resistance but at last the remnant of hoojas horde surrendered  juag was with me and i lost no time in returning to him and his tribe the hilltop that had been their ancestral home for ages until they were robbed of it by hooja  i created a kingdom of the island making juag king there  before we sailed i went to grgrgr chief of the beastmen taking juag with me  there the three of us arranged a code of laws that would permit the brutefolk and the human beings of the island to live in peace and harmony  grgrgr sent his son with me back to sari capital of my empire that he might learn the ways of the human beings  i have hopes of turning this race into the greatest agriculturists of pellucidar  when i returned to the fleet i found that one of the islanders of juags tribe who had been absent when we arrived had just returned from the mainland with the news that a great army was encamped in the land of awful shadow and that they were threatening thuria  i lost no time in weighing anchors and setting out for the continent which we reached after a short and easy voyage  from the deck of the amoz i scanned the shore through the glasses that perry had brought with him  when we were close enough for the glasses to be of value i saw that there was indeed a vast concourse of warriors entirely encircling the walledvillage of goork chief of the thurians as we approached smaller objects became distinguishable  it was then that i discovered numerous flags and pennants floating above the army of the besiegers  i called perry and passed the glasses to him  ghak of sari i said  perry looked through the lenses of a moment and then turned to me with a smile  the red white and blue of the empire he said  it is indeed your majestys army  it soon became apparent that we had been sighted by those on shore for a great multitude of warriors had congregated along the beach watching us  we came to anchor as close in as we dared which with our light feluccas was within easy speakingdistance of the shore  ghak was there and his eyes were mighty wide too for as he told us later though he knew this must be perrys fleet it was so wonderful to him that he could not believe the testimony of his own eyes even while he was watching it approach  to give the proper effect to our meeting i commanded that each felucca fire twentyone guns as a salute to his majesty ghak king of sari some of the gunners in the exuberance of their enthusiasm fired solid shot but fortunately they had sufficient good judgment to train their pieces on the open sea so no harm was done  after this we landedan arduous task since each felucca carried but a single light dugout  i learned from ghak that the thurian chieftain goork had been inclined to haughtiness and had told ghak the hairy one that he knew nothing of me and cared less but i imagine that the sight of the fleet and the sound of the guns brought him to his senses for it was not long before he sent a deputation to me inviting me to visit him in his village  here he apologized for the treatment he had accorded me very gladly swore allegiance to the empire and received in return the title of king  we remained in thuria only long enough to arrange the treaty with goork among the other details of which was his promise to furnish the imperial army with a thousand lidi or thurian beasts of burden and drivers for them  these were to accompany ghaks army back to sari by land while the fleet sailed to the mouth of the great river from which dian juag and i had been blown  the voyage was uneventful  we found the river easily and sailed up it for many miles through as rich and wonderful a plain as i have ever seen  at the head of navigation we disembarked leaving a sufficient guard for the feluccas and marched the remaining distance to sari  ghaks army which was composed of warriors of all the original tribes of the federation showing how successful had been his efforts to rehabilitate the empire marched into sari some time after we arrived with them were the thousand lidi from thuria  at a council of the kings it was decided that we should at once commence the great war against the mahars for these haughty reptiles presented the greatest obstacle to human progress within pellucidar  i laid out a plan of campaign which met with the enthusiastic indorsement of the kings  pursuant to it i at once despatched fifty lidi to the fleet with orders to fetch fifty cannon to sari  i also ordered the fleet to proceed at once to anoroc where they were to take aboard all the rifles and ammunition that had been completed since their departure and with a full complement of men to sail along the coast in an attempt to find a passage to the inland sea near which lay the mahars buried city of phutra  ja was sure that a large and navigable river connected the sea of phutra with the lural az and that barring accident the fleet would be before phutra as soon as the land forces were  at last the great army started upon its march  there were warriors from every one of the federated kingdoms  all were armed either with bow and arrows or muzzleloaders for nearly the entire mezop contingent had been enlisted for this march only sufficient having been left aboard the feluccas to man them properly  i divided the forces into divisions regiments battalions companies and even to platoons and sections appointing the full complement of officers and noncommissioned officers  on the long march i schooled them in their duties and as fast as one learned i sent him among the others as a teacher  each regiment was made up of about a thousand bowmen and to each was temporarily attached a company of mezop musketeers and a battery of artillerythe latter our naval guns mounted upon the broad backs of the mighty lidi  there was also one full regiment of mezop musketeers and a regiment of primitive spearmen  the rest of the lidi that we brought with us were used for baggage animals and to transport our women and children for we had brought them with us as it was our intention to march from one mahar city to another until we had subdued every mahar nation that menaced the safety of any kingdom of the empire  before we reached the plain of phutra we were discovered by a company of sagoths who at first stood to give battle but upon seeing the vast numbers of our army they turned and fled toward phutra  the result of this was that when we came in sight of the hundred towers which mark the entrances to the buried city we found a great army of sagoths and mahars lined up to give us battle  at a thousand yards we halted and placing our artillery upon a slight eminence at either flank we commenced to drop solid shot among them ja who was chief artillery officer was in command of this branch of the service and he did some excellent work for his mezop gunners had become rather proficient by this time  the sagoths couldnt stand much of this sort of warfare so they charged us yelling like fiends  we let them come quite close and then the musketeers who formed the first line opened up on them  the slaughter was something frightful but still the remnants of them kept on coming until it was a matter of handtohand fighting  here our spearmen were of value as were also the crude iron swords with which most of the imperial warriors were armed  we lost heavily in the encounter after the sagoths reached us but they were absolutely exterminatednot one remained even as a prisoner  the mahars seeing how the battle was going had hastened to the safety of their buried city  when we had overcome their gorillamen we followed after them  but here we were doomed to defeat at least temporarily for no sooner had the first of our troops descended into the subterranean avenues than many of them came stumbling and fighting their way back to the surface halfchoked by the fumes of some deadly gas that the reptiles had liberated upon them  we lost a number of men here  then i sent for perry who had remained discreetly in the rear and had him construct a little affair that i had had in my mind against the possibility of our meeting with a check at the entrances to the underground city  under my direction he stuffed one of his cannon full of powder small bullets and pieces of stone almost to the muzzle  then he plugged the muzzle tight with a coneshaped block of wood hammered and jammed in as tight as it could be  next he inserted a long fuse  a dozen men rolled the cannon to the top of the stairs leading down into the city first removing it from its carriage  one of them then lit the fuse and the whole thing was given a shove down the stairway while the detachment turned and scampered to a safe distance  for what seemed a very long time nothing happened  we had commenced to think that the fuse had been put out while the piece was rolling down the stairway or that the mahars had guessed its purpose and extinguished it themselves when the ground about the entrance rose suddenly into the air to be followed by a terrific explosion and a burst of smoke and flame that shot high in company with dirt stone and fragments of cannon  perry had been working on two more of these giant bombs as soon as the first was completed  presently we launched these into two of the other entrances  they were all that were required for almost immediately after the third explosion a stream of mahars broke from the exits furthest from us rose upon their wings and soared northward  a hundred men on lidi were despatched in pursuit each lidi carrying two riflemen in addition to its driver  guessing that the inland sea which lay not far north of phutra was their destination i took a couple of regiments and followed  a low ridge intervenes between the phutra plain where the city lies and the inland sea where the mahars were wont to disport themselves in the cool waters  not until we had topped this ridge did we get a view of the sea  then we beheld a scene that i shall never forget so long as i may live  along the beach were lined up the troop of lidi while a hundred yards from shore the surface of the water was black with the long snouts and cold reptilian eyes of the mahars  our savage mezop riflemen and the shorter squatter whiteskinned thurian drivers shading their eyes with their hands were gazing seaward beyond the mahars whose eyes were fastened upon the same spot  my heart leaped when i discovered that which was chaining the attention of them all  twenty graceful feluccas were moving smoothly across the waters of the sea toward the reptilian horde  the sight must have filled the mahars with awe and consternation for never had they seen the like of these craft before  for a time they seemed unable to do aught but gaze at the approaching fleet but when the mezops opened on them with their muskets the reptiles swam rapidly in the direction of the feluccas evidently thinking that these would prove the easier to overcome  the commander of the fleet permitted them to approach within a hundred yards  then he opened on them with all the cannon that could be brought to bear as well as with the small arms of the sailors  a great many of the reptiles were killed at the first volley  they wavered for a moment then dived nor did we see them again for a long time  but finally they rose far out beyond the fleet and when the feluccas came about and pursued them they left the water and flew away toward the north  following the fall of phutra i visited anoroc where i found the people busy in the shipyards and the factories that perry had established  i discovered something too that he had not told me ofsomething that seemed infinitely more promising than the powderfactory or the arsenal  it was a young man poring over one of the books i had brought back from the outer world he was sitting in the log cabin that perry had had built to serve as his sleeping quarters and office  so absorbed was he that he did not notice our entrance  perry saw the look of astonishment in my eyes and smiled  i started teaching him the alphabet when we first reached the prospector and were taking out its contents he explained  he was much mystified by the books and anxious to know of what use they were when i explained he asked me to teach him to read and so i worked with him whenever i could  he is very intelligent and learns quickly before i left he had made great progress and as soon as he is qualified he is going to teach others to read  it was mighty hard work getting started though for everything had to be translated into pellucidarian  it will take a long time to solve this problem but i think that by teaching a number of them to read and write english we shall then be able more quickly to give them a written language of their own  and this was the nucleus about which we were to build our great system of schools and collegesthis almost naked red warrior sitting in perrys little cabin upon the island of anoroc picking out words letter by letter from a work on intensive farming  now we have  but ill get to all that before i finish  while we were at anoroc i accompanied ja in an expedition to south island the southernmost of the three largest which form the anoroc groupperry had given it its namewhere we made peace with the tribe there that had for long been hostile toward ja  they were now glad enough to make friends with him and come into the federation  from there we sailed with sixtyfive feluccas for distant luana the main island of the group where dwell the hereditary enemies of anoroc  twentyfive of the feluccas were of a new and larger type than those with which ja and perry had sailed on the occasion when they chanced to find and rescue dian and me  they were longer carried much larger sails and were considerably swifter  each carried four guns instead of two and these were so arranged that one or more of them could be brought into action no matter where the enemy lay  the luana group lies just beyond the range of vision from the mainland the largest island of it alone is visible from anoroc but when we neared it we found that it comprised many beautiful islands and that they were thickly populated  the luanians had not of course been ignorant of all that had been going on in the domains of their nearest and dearest enemies  they knew of our feluccas and our guns for several of their ridingparties had had a taste of both  but their principal chief an old man had never seen either  so when he sighted us he put out to overwhelm us bringing with him a fleet of about a hundred large warcanoes loaded to capacity with javelinarmed warriors  it was pitiful and i told ja as much  it seemed a shame to massacre these poor fellows if there was any way out of it  to my surprise ja felt much as i did  he said he had always hated to war with other mezops when there were so many alien races to fight against  i suggested that we hail the chief and request a parley but when ja did so the old fool thought that we were afraid and with loud cries of exultation urged his warriors upon us  so we opened up on them but at my suggestion centered our fire upon the chiefs canoe  the result was that in about thirty seconds there was nothing left of that war dugout but a handful of splinters while its crewthose who were not killedwere struggling in the water battling with the myriad terrible creatures that had risen to devour them  we saved some of them but the majority died just as had hooja and the crew of his canoe that time our second shot capsized them  again we called to the remaining warriors to enter into a parley with us but the chiefs son was there and he would not now that he had seen his father killed  he was all for revenge  so we had to open up on the brave fellows with all our guns but it didnt last long at that for there chanced to be wiser heads among the luanians than their chief or his son had possessed  presently an old warrior who commanded one of the dugouts surrendered  after that they came in one by one until all had laid their weapons upon our decks  then we called together upon the flagship all our captains to give the affair greater weight and dignity and all the principal men of luana  we had conquered them and they expected either death or slavery but they deserved neither and i told them so  it is always my habit here in pellucidar to impress upon these savage people that mercy is as noble a quality as physical bravery and that next to the men who fight shoulder to shoulder with one we should honor the brave men who fight against us and if we are victorious award them both the mercy and honor that are their due  by adhering to this policy i have won to the federation many great and noble peoples who under the ancient traditions of the inner world would have been massacred or enslaved after we had conquered them and thus i won the luanians  i gave them their freedom and returned their weapons to them after they had sworn loyalty to me and friendship and peace with ja and i made the old fellow who had had the good sense to surrender king of luana for both the old chief and his only son had died in the battle  when i sailed away from luana she was included among the kingdoms of the empire whose boundaries were thus pushed eastward several hundred miles  we now returned to anoroc and thence to the mainland where i again took up the campaign against the mahars marching from one great buried city to another until we had passed far north of amoz into a country where i had never been  at each city we were victorious killing or capturing the sagoths and driving the mahars further away  i noticed that they always fled toward the north  the sagoth prisoners we usually found quite ready to transfer their allegiance to us for they are little more than brutes and when they found that we could fill their stomachs and give them plenty of fighting they were nothing loath to march with us against the next mahar city and battle with men of their own race  thus we proceeded swinging in a great halfcircle north and west and south again until we had come back to the edge of the lidi plains north of thuria  here we overcame the mahar city that had ravaged the land of awful shadow for so many ages  when we marched on to thuria goork and his people went mad with joy at the tidings we brought them  during this long march of conquest we had passed through seven countries peopled by primitive human tribes who had not yet heard of the federation and succeeded in joining them all to the empire  it was noticeable that each of these peoples had a mahar city situated near by which had drawn upon them for slaves and human food for so many ages that not even in legend had the population any folktale which did not in some degree reflect an inherent terror of the reptilians  in each of these countries i left an officer and warriors to train them in military discipline and prepare them to receive the arms that i intended furnishing them as rapidly as perrys arsenal could turn them out for we felt that it would be a long long time before we should see the last of the mahars  that they had flown north but temporarily until we should be gone with our great army and terrifying guns i was positive and equally sure was i that they would presently return  the task of ridding pellucidar of these hideous creatures is one which in all probability will never be entirely completed for their great cities must abound by the hundreds and thousands of the fardistant lands that no subject of the empire has ever laid eyes upon  but within the present boundaries of my domain there are now none left that i know of for i am sure we should have heard indirectly of any great mahar city that had escaped us although of course the imperial army has by no means covered the vast area which i now rule  after leaving thuria we returned to sari where the seat of government is located  here upon a vast fertile plateau overlooking the great gulf that runs into the continent from the lural az we are building the great city of sari  here we are erecting mills and factories here we are teaching men and women the rudiments of agriculture  here perry has built the first printingpress and a dozen young sarians are teaching their fellows to read and write the language of pellucidar  we have just laws and only a few of them  our people are happy because they are always working at something which they enjoy  there is no money nor is any money value placed upon any commodity  perry and i were as one in resolving that the root of all evil should not be introduced into pellucidar while we lived  a man may exchange that which he produces for something which he desires that another has produced but he cannot dispose of the thing he thus acquires  in other words a commodity ceases to have pecuniary value the instant that it passes out of the hands of its producer  all excess reverts to government and as this represents the production of the people as a government government may dispose of it to other peoples in exchange for that which they produce  thus we are establishing a trade between kingdoms the profits from which go to the betterment of the peopleto building factories for the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery for the various trades we are gradually teaching the people  already anoroc and luana are vying with one another in the excellence of the ships they build  each has several large shipyards  anoroc makes gunpowder and mines iron ore and by means of their ships they carry on a very lucrative trade with thuria sari and amoz  the thurians breed lidi which having the strength and intelligence of an elephant make excellent draft animals  around sari and amoz the men are domesticating the great striped antelope the meat of which is most delicious  i am sure that it will not be long before they will have them broken to harness and saddle the horses of pellucidar are far too diminutive for such uses some species of them being little larger than foxterriers  dian and i live in a great palace overlooking the gulf  there is no glass in our windows for we have no windows the walls rising but a few feet above the floorline the rest of the space being open to the ceilings but we have a roof to shade us from the perpetual noonday sun  perry and i decided to set a style in architecture that would not curse future generations with the white plague so we have plenty of ventilation  those of the people who prefer still inhabit their caves but many are building houses similar to ours  at greenwich we have located a town and an observatorythough there is nothing to observe but the stationary sun directly overhead  upon the edge of the land of awful shadow is another observatory from which the time is flashed by wireless to every corner of the empire twentyfour times a day  in addition to the wireless we have a small telephone system in sari  everything is yet in the early stages of development but with the science of the outerworld twentieth century to draw upon we are making rapid progress and with all the faults and errors of the outer world to guide us clear of dangers i think that it will not be long before pellucidar will become as nearly a utopia as one may expect to find this side of heaven  perry is away just now laying out a railwayline from sari to amoz there are immense anthracite coalfields at the head of the gulf not far from sari and the railway will tap these  some of his students are working on a locomotive now  it will be a strange sight to see an iron horse puffing through the primeval jungles of the stone age while cave bears sabertoothed tigers mastodons and the countless other terrible creatures of the past look on from their tangled lairs in wideeyed astonishment  we are very happy dian and i and i would not return to the outer world for all the riches of all its princes  i am content here  even without my imperial powers and honors i should be content for have i not that greatest of all treasures the love of a good womanmy wondrous empress dian the beautiful
