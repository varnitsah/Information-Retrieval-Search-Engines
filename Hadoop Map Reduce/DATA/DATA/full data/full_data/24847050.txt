24847050	the oconors of castle conor county mayo from tales from all countries  by anthony trollope     i shall never forget my first introduction to country life in ireland my first days hunting there or the manner in which i passed the evening afterwards  nor shall i ever cease to be grateful for the hospitality which i received from the oconors of castle conor  my acquaintance with the family was first made in the following manner  but before i begin my story let me inform my reader that my name is archibald green  i had been for a fortnight in dublin and was about to proceed into county mayo on business which would occupy me there for some weeks my headquarters would i found be at the town of ballyglass and i soon learned that ballyglass was not a place in which i should find hotel accommodation of a luxurious kind or much congenial society indigenous to the place itself  but you are a hunting man you say said old sir p c and in that case you will soon know tom oconor  tom wont let you be dull id write you a letter to tom only hell certainly make you out without my taking the trouble  i did think at the time that the old baronet might have written the letter for me as he had been a friend of my fathers in former days but he did not and i started for ballyglass with no other introduction to any one in the county than that contained in sir ps promise that i should soon know mr thomas oconor  i had already provided myself with a horse groom saddle and bridle and these i sent down en avant that the ballyglassians might know that i was somebody  perhaps before i arrived tom oconor might learn that a hunting man was coming into the neighbourhood and i might find at the inn a polite note intimating that a bed was at my service at castle conor  i had heard so much of the free hospitality of the irish gentry as to imagine that such a thing might be possible  but i found nothing of the kind  hunting gentlemen in those days were very common in county mayo and one horse was no great evidence of a mans standing in the world  men there as i learnt afterwards are sought for themselves quite as much as they are elsewhere and though my grooms topboots were neat and my horse a very tidy animal my entry into ballyglass created no sensation whatever  in about four days after my arrival when i was already infinitely disgusted with the little pothouse in which i was forced to stay and had made up my mind that the people in county mayo were a churlish set i sent my horse on to a meet of the foxhounds and followed after myself on an open car  no one but an erratic foxhunter such as i ama foxhunter i mean whose lot it has been to wander about from one pack of hounds to anothercan understand the melancholy feeling which a man has when he first intrudes himself unknown by any one among an entirely new set of sportsmen  when a stranger falls thus as it were out of the moon into a hunt it is impossible that men should not stare at him and ask who he is  and it is so disagreeable to be stared at and to have such questions asked  this feeling does not come upon a man in leicestershire or gloucestershire where the numbers are large and a stranger or two will always be overlooked but in small hunting fields it is so painful that a man has to pluck up much courage before he encounters it  we met on the morning in question at binghams grove  there were not above twelve or fifteen men out all of whom or nearly all were cousins to each other  they seemed to be all toms and pats and larrys and micks  i was done up very knowingly in pink and thought that i looked quite the thing but for two or three hours nobody noticed me  i had my eyes about me however and soon found out which of them was tom oconor  he was a finelooking fellow thin and tall but not largely made with a piercing gray eye and a beautiful voice for speaking to a hound  he had two sons there also short slight fellows but exquisite horsemen  i already felt that i had a kind of acquaintance with the father but i hardly knew on what ground to put in my claim  we had no sport early in the morning  it was a cold bleak february day with occasional storms of sleet  we rode from cover to cover but all in vain  i am sorry sir that we are to have such a bad day as you are a stranger here said one gentleman to me  this was jack oconor toms eldest son my bosom friend for many a year after  poor jack  i fear that the encumbered estates court sent him altogether adrift upon the world  we may still have a run from poulnaroe if the gentleman chooses to come on said a voice coming from behind with a sharp trot  it was tom oconor  wherever the hounds go ill follow said i  then come on to poulnaroe said mr oconor  i trotted on quickly by his side and before we reached the cover had managed to slip in something about sir p c  what the deuce said he  what a friend of sir ps  why the deuce didnt you tell me so  what are you doing down here  where are you staying c c c  at poulnaroe we found a fox but before we did so mr o conor had asked me over to castle conor  and this he did in such a way that there was no possibility of refusing himor i should rather say of disobeying him  for his invitation came quite in the tone of a command  youll come to us of course when the day is overand let me see were near ballyglass now but the run will be right away in our direction  just send word for them to send your things to castle conor  but theyre all about and unpacked said i  never mind  write a note and say what you want now and go and get the rest tomorrow yourself  here patseypatsey run into ballyglass for this gentleman at once  now dont be long for the chances are we shall find here  and then after giving some further hurried instructions he left me to write a line in pencil to the innkeepers wife on the back of a ditch  this i accordingly did  send my small portmanteau i said and all my black dress clothes and shirts and socks and all that and above all my dressing things which are on the little table and the satin neckhandkerchief and whatever you do mind you send my pumps and i underscored the latter word for jack oconor when his father left me went on pressing the invitation  my sisters are going to get up a dance said he and if you are fond of that kind of things perhaps we can amuse you  now in those days i was very fond of dancingand very fond of young ladies too and therefore glad enough to learn that tom oconor had daughters as well as sons on this account i was very particular in underscoring the word pumps  and hurry you young divil jack oconor said to patsey  i have told him to take the portmanteau over on a car said i  all right then youll find it there on our arrival  we had an excellent run in which i may make bold to say that i did not acquit myself badly  i stuck very close to the hounds as did the whole of the oconor brood and when the fellow contrived to earth himself as he did i received those compliments on my horse which is the most approved praise which one foxhunter ever gives to another  well buy that fellow of you before we let you go said peter the youngest son  i advise you to look sharp after your money if you sell him to my brother said jack  and then we trotted slowly off to castle conor which however was by no means near to us  we have ten miles to gogood irish miles said the father  i dont know that i ever remember a fox from poulnaroe taking that line before  he wasnt a poulnaroe fox said peter  i dont know that said jack and then they debated that question hotly  our horses were very tired and it was late before we reached mr oconors house  that getting home from hunting with a thoroughly weary animal who has no longer sympathy or example to carry him on is very tedious work  in the present instance i had company with me but when a man is alone when his horse toes at every ten steps when the night is dark and the rain pouring and there are yet eight miles of road to be conqueredat such time a man is almost apt to swear that he will give up hunting  at last we were in the castle conor stable yardfor we had approached the house by some back way and as we entered the house by a door leading through a wilderness of back passages mr oconor said out loud now boys remember i sit down to dinner in twenty minutes  and then turning expressly to me he laid his hand kindly upon my shoulder and said i hope you will make yourself quite at home at castle conor and whatever you do dont keep us waiting for dinner  you can dress in twenty minutes i suppose  in ten said i glibly  thats well  jack and peter will show you your room and so he turned away and left us  my two young friends made their way into the great hall and thence into the drawingroom and i followed them  we were all dressed in pink and had waded deep through bog and mud  i did not exactly know whither i was being led in this guise but i soon found myself in the presence of two young ladies and of a girl about thirteen years of age  my sisters said jack introducing me very laconically miss oconor miss kate oconor miss tizzy oconor  my name is not tizzy said the younger its eliza  how do you do sir  i hope you had a fine hunt  was papa well up jack  jack did not condescend to answer this question but asked one of the elder girls whether anything had come and whether a room had been made ready for me  oh yes said miss oconor they came i know for i saw them brought into the house and i hope mr green will find everything comfortable  as she said this i thought i saw a slight smile steal across her remarkably pretty mouth  they were both exceedingly pretty girls  fanny the elder wore long glossy curlsfor i write oh reader of bygone days as long ago as that when ladies wore curls if it pleased them so to do and gentlemen danced in pumps with black handkerchiefs round their necksyes long black or nearly black silken curls and then she had such eyesi never knew whether they were most wicked or most bright and her face was all dimples and each dimple was laden with laughter and laden with love  kate was probably the prettier girl of the two but on the whole not so attractive  she was fairer than her sister and wore her hair in braids and was also somewhat more demure in her manner  in spite of the special injunctions of mr oconor senior it was impossible not to loiter for five minutes over the drawingroom fire talking to these hourismore especially as i seemed to know them intimately by intuition before half of the five minutes was over they were so easy so pretty so graceful so kind they seemed to take it so much as a matter of course that i should stand there talking in my red coat and muddy boots  well do go and dress yourselves at last said fanny pretending to speak to her brothers but looking more especially a me  you know how mad papa will be  and remember mr green we expect great things from your dancing tonight  your coming just at this time is such a godsend  and again that soupcon of a smile passed over her face  i hurried up to my room peter and jack coming with me to the door is everything right said peter looking among the towels and waterjugs  theyve given you a decent fire for a wonder said jack stirring up the red hot turf which blazed in the grate  all right as a trivet said i  and look alive like a good fellow said jack  we had scowled at each other in the morning as very young men do when they are strangers and now after a few hours we were intimate friends  i immediately turned to my work and was gratified to find that all my things were laid out ready for dressing my portmanteau had of course come open as my keys were in my pocket and therefore some of the excellent servants of the house had been able to save me all the trouble of unpacking  there was my shirt hanging before the fire my black clothes were spread upon the bed my socks and collar and handkerchief beside them my brushes were on the toilet table and everything prepared exactly as though my own man had been there  how nice  i immediately went to work at getting off my spurs and boots and then proceeded to loosen the buttons at my knees  in doing this i sat down in the armchair which had been drawn up for me opposite the fire  but what was the object on which my eyes then fellthe objects i should rather say  immediately in front of my chair was placed just ready for may feet an enormous pair of shootingbootshalfboots made to lace up round the ankles with thick double leather soles and each bearing half a stone of iron in the shape of nails and heelpieces  i had superintended the making of these shoes in burlington arcade with the greatest diligence  i was never a good shot and like some other sportsmen intended to make up for my deficiency in performance by the excellence of my shooting apparel  those nails are not large enough i had said nor nearly large enough  but when the boots came home they struck even me as being too heavy too metalsome he he he laughed the boot boy as he turned them up for me to look at  it may therefore be imagined of what nature were the articles which were thus set out for the evenings dancing  and then the way in which they were placed  when i saw this the conviction flew across my mind like a flash of lightning that the preparation had been made under other eyes than those of the servant the heavy big boots were placed so prettily before the chair and the strings of each were made to dangle down at the sides as though just ready for tying  they seemed to say the boots did now make haste  we at any rate are readyyou cannot say that you were kept waiting for us  no mere servants hand had ever enabled a pair of boots to laugh at one so completely  but what was i to do  i rushed at the small portmanteau thinking that my pumps also might be there  the woman surely could not have been such a fool as to send me those tons of iron for my evening wear  but alas alas no pumps were there  there was nothing else in the way of covering for my feet not even a pair of slippers  and now what was i to do  the absolute magnitude of my misfortune only loomed upon me by degrees  the twenty minutes allowed by that stern old paterfamilias were already gone and i had done nothing towards dressing  and indeed it was impossible that i should do anything that would be of avail  i could not go down to dinner in my stocking feet nor could i put on my black dress trousers over a pair of mudpainted topboots  as for those ironsoled horrors and then i gave one of them a kick with the side of my bare foot which sent it half way under the bed  but what was i to do  i began washing myself and brushing my hair with this horrid weight upon my mind  my first plan was to go to bed and send down word that i had been taken suddenly ill in the stomach then to rise early in the morning and get away unobserved but by such a course of action i should lose all chance of any further acquaintance with those pretty girls  that they were already aware of the extent of my predicament and were now enjoying itof that i was quite sure  what if i boldly put on the shootingboots and clattered down to dinner in them  what if i took the bull by the horns and made myself the most of the joke  this might be very well for the dinner but it would be a bad joke for me when the hour for dancing came  and alas  i felt that i lacked the courage  it is not every man that can walk down to dinner in a strange house full of ladies wearing such boots as those i have described  should i not attempt to borrow a pair  this all the world will say should have been my first idea  but i have not yet mentioned that i am myself a largeboned man and that my feet are especially well developed  i had never for a moment entertained a hope that i should find any one in that house whose boot i could wear  but at last i rang the bell  i would send for jack and if everything failed i would communicate my grief to him  i had to ring twice before anybody came  the servants i well knew were putting the dinner on the table  at last a man entered the room dressed in rather shabby black whom i afterwards learned to be the butler  what is your name my friend said i determined to make an ally of the man  my name  why larry sure yer honer  and the masther is out of his sinses in a hurry becase yer honer dont come down  is he though  well now larry tell me this which of all the gentlemen in the house has got the largest foot  is it the largest foot yer honer said larry altogether surprised by my question  yes the largest foot and then i proceeded to explain to him my misfortune  he took up first my topboot and then the shooting bootin looking at which he gazed with wonder at the nailsand then he glanced at my feet measuring them with his eye and after this he pronounced his opinion  yer honer couldnt wear a morsel of leather belonging to ere a one of em young or ould  there niver was a foot like that yet among the oconors  but are there no strangers staying here  theres three or four on em come in to dinner but theyll be wanting their own boots im thinking  and theres young misther dillon hes come to stay  but lord love you and he again looked at the enormous extent which lay between the heel and the toe of the shooting apparatus which he still held in his hand  i niver see such a foot as that in the whole barony he said barring my own  now larry was a large man much larger altogether than myself and as he said this i looked down involuntarily at his feet or rather at his foot for as he stood i could only see one  and then a sudden hope filled my heart  on that foot there glittered a shoenot indeed such as were my own which were now resting ingloriously at ballyglass while they were so sorely needed at castle conor but one which i could wear before ladies without shameand in my present frame of mind with infinite contentment  let me look at that one of your own said i to the man as though it were merely a subject for experimental inquiry  larry accustomed to obedience took off the shoe and handed it to me  my own foot was immediately in it and i found that it fitted me like a glove  and now the other said inot smiling for a smile would have put him on his guard but somewhat sternly so that that habit of obedience should not desert him at this perilous moment  and then i stretched out my hand  but yer honer cant keep em you know said he  i havent the ghost of another shoe to my feet  but i only looked more sternly than before and still held out my hand  custom prevailed  larry stooped down slowly looking at me the while and pulling off the other slipper handed it to me with much hesitation  alas as i put it to my foot i found that it was old and worn and irredeemably down at heelthat it was in fact no counterpart at all to that other one which was to do duty as its fellow  but nevertheless i put my foot into it and felt that a descent to the drawingroom was now possible  but yer honer will give em back to a poor man said larry almost crying  the masthers mad this minute becase the dinners not up glory to god only listhen to that  and as he spoke a tremendous peal rang out from some bell down stairs that had evidently been shaken by an angry hand  larry said iand i endeavoured to assume a look of very grave importance as i spokei look to you to assist me in this matter  ochwirra sthrue then and will you let me go just listhen to that and another angry peal rang out loud and repeated  if you do as i ask you i continued you shall be well rewarded look here look at these boots and i held up the shootingshoes new from burlington arcade  they cost thirty shillingsthirty shillings and i will give them to you for the loan of this pair of slippers  theyd be no use at all to me yer honer not the laist use in life  you could do with them very well for tonight and then you could sell them  and here are ten shillings besides and i held out half a sovereign which the poor fellow took into his hand  i waited no further parley but immediately walked out of the room with one foot i was sufficiently pleased  as regarded that i felt that i had overcome my difficulty  but the other was not so satisfactory  whenever i attempted to lift it from the ground the horrid slipper would fall off or only just hang by the toe  as for dancing that would be out of the question  och murther murther sang out larry as he heard me going down stairs  what will i do at all  tare and ounds there hes at it agin as mad as blazes  this last exclamation had reference to another peal which was evidently the work of the masters hand  i confess i was not quite comfortable as i walked down stairs  in the first place i was nearly half an hour late and i knew from the vigour of the peals that had sounded that my slowness had already been made the subject of strong remarks  and then my left shoe went flop flop on every alternate step of the stairs  by no exertion of my foot in the drawing up of my toe could i induce it to remain permanently fixed upon my foot  but over and above and worse than all this was the conviction strong upon my mind that i should become a subject of merriment to the girls as soon as i entered the room they would understand the cause of my distress and probably at this moment were expecting to hear me clatter through the stone hall with those odious metal boots  however i hurried down and entered the drawingroom determined to keep my position near the door so that i might have as little as possible to do on entering and as little as possible in going out but i had other difficulties in store for me  i had not as yet been introduced to mrs oconor nor to miss oconor the squires unmarried sister  upon my word i thought you were never coming said mr oconor as soon as he saw me  it is just one hour since we entered the house jack i wish you would find out what has come to that fellow larry and again he rang the bell  he was too angry or it might be too impatient to go through the ceremony of introducing me to anybody  i saw that the two girls looked at me very sharply but i stood at the back of an armchair so that no one could see my feet  but that little imp tizzy walked round deliberately looked at my heels and then walked back again  it was clear that she was in the secret  there were eight or ten people in the room but i was too much fluttered to notice well who they were  mamma said miss oconor let me introduce mr green to you  it luckily happened that mrs oconor was on the same side of the fire as myself and i was able to take the hand which she offered me without coming round into the middle of the circle  mrs oconor was a little woman apparently not of much importance in the world but if one might judge from first appearance very goodnatured  and my aunt die mr green said kate pointing to a very straight backed grimlooking lady who occupied a corner of a sofa on the opposite side of the hearth  i knew that politeness required that i should walk across the room and make acquaintance with her  but under the existing circumstances how was i to obey the dictates of politeness  i was determined therefore to stand my ground and merely bowed across the room at miss oconor  in so doing i made an enemy who never deserted me during the whole of my intercourse with the family  but for her who knows who might have been sitting opposite to me as i now write  upon my word mr green the ladies will expect much from an adonis who takes so long over his toilet said tom oconor in that cruel tone of banter which he knew so well how to use  you forget father that men in london cant jump in and out of their clothes as quick as we wild irishmen said jack  mr green knows that we expect a great deal from him this evening i hope you polk well mr green said kate  i muttered something about never dancing but i knew that that which i said was inaudible  i dont think mr green will dance said tizzy at least not much  the impudence of that child was i think unparalleled by any that i have ever witnessed  but in the name of all thats holy why dont we have dinner  and mr oconor thundered at the door  larry larry larry he screamed  yes yer honer itll be all right in two seconds answered larry from some bottomless abyss  tare an ages whatll i do at all i heard him continuing as he made his way into the hall  oh what a clatter he made upon the pavementfor it was all stone  and how the drops of perspiration stood upon my brow as i listened to him  and then there was a pause for the man had gone into the dining room  i could see now that mr oconor was becoming very angry and jack the eldest sonoh how often he and i have laughed over all this sinceleft the drawingroom for the second time  immediately afterwards larrys footsteps were again heard hurrying across the hall and then there was a great slither and an exclamation and the noise of a falland i could plainly hear poor larrys head strike against the stone floor  ochone ochone he cried at the top of his voiceim murthered with em now intirely and d em for bootsst peter be good to me  there was a general rush into the hall and i was carried with the stream  the poor fellow who had broken his head would be sure to tell how i had robbed him of his shoes  the coachman was already helping him up and peter goodnaturedly lent a hand  what on earth is the matter said mr oconor  he must be tipsy whispered miss oconor the maiden sister  i aint tipsy at all thin said larry getting up and rubbing the back of his head and sundry other parts of his body  tipsy indeed  and then he added when he was quite upright the dinner is sarvedat last  and he bore it all without telling  ill give that fellow a guinea tomorrow morning said i to myselfif its the last that i have in the world  i shall never forget the countenance of the miss oconors as larry scrambled up cursing the unfortunate bootswhat on earth has he got on said mr oconor  sorrow take em for shoes ejaculated larry  but his spirit was good and he said not a word to betray me  we all then went in to dinner how we best could  it was useless for us to go back into the drawingroom that each might seek his own partner  mr oconor the masther not caring much for the girls who were around him and being already half beside himself with the confusion and delay led the way by himself  i as a stranger should have given my arm to mrs oconor but as it was i took her eldest daughter instead and contrived to shuffle along into the diningroom without exciting much attention and when there i found myself happily placed between kate and fanny  i never knew anything so awkward said fanny i declare i cant conceive what has come to our old servant larry  hes generally the most precise person in the world and now he is nearly an hour late and then he tumbles down in the hall  i am afraid i am responsible for the delay said i  but not for the tumble i suppose said kate from the other side  i felt that i blushed up to the eyes but i did not dare to enter into explanations  tom said tizzy addressing her father across the table i hope you had a good run today  it did seem odd to me that young lady should call her father tom but such was the fact  well pretty well said mr oconor  and i hope you were up with the hounds  you may ask mr green that  he at any rate was with them and therefore he can tell you  oh he wasnt before you i know  no englishman could get before youi am quite sure of that  dont you be impertinent miss said kate  you can easily see mr green that papa spoils my sister eliza  do you hunt in topboots mr green said tizzy  to this i made no answer  she would have drawn me into a conversation about my feet in half a minute and the slightest allusion to the subject threw me into a fit of perspiration  are you fond of hunting miss oconor asked i blindly hurrying into any other subject of conversation  miss oconor owned that she was fond of huntingjust a little only papa would not allow it  when the hounds met anywhere within reach of castle conor she and kate would ride out to look at them and if papa was not there that dayan omission of rare occurrencethey would ride a few fields with the hounds  but he lets tizzy keep with them the whole day said she whispering  and has tizzy a pony of her own  oh yes tizzy has everything  shes papas pet you know  and whose pet are you i asked  ohi am nobodys pet unless sometimes jack makes a pet of me when hes in a good humour  do you make pets of your sisters mr green  i have none  but if i had i should not make pets of them  not of your own sisters  no  as for myself id sooner make a pet of my friends sister a great deal  how very unnatural said miss oconor with the prettiest look of surprise imaginable  not at all unnatural i think said i looking tenderly and lovingly into her face  where does one find girls so pretty so easy so sweet so talkative as the irish girls  and then with all their talking and all their ease who ever hears of their misbehaving  they certainly love flirting as they also love dancing  but they flirt without mischief and without malice  i had now quite forgotten my misfortune and was beginning to think how well i should like to have fanny oconor for my wife  in this frame of mind i was bending over towards her as a servant took away a plate from the other side when a sepulchral note sounded in my ear it was like the memento mori of the old romanas though some one pointed in the midst of my bliss to the sword hung over my head by a thread  it was the voice of larry whispering in his agony just above my head   theys disthroying my poor feet intirely intirely so they is  i cant bear it much longer yer honer  i had committed murder like macbeth and now my banquo had come to disturb me at my feast  what is it he says to you asked fanny  oh nothing i answered once more in my misery  there seems to be some point of confidence between you and our larry she remarked  oh no said i quite confused not at all  you need not be ashamed of it  half the gentlemen in the county have their confidences with larryand some of the ladies too i can tell you  he was born in this house and never lived anywhere else and i am sure he has a larger circle of acquaintance than any one else in it  i could not recover my selfpossession for the next ten minutes whenever larry was on our side of the table i was afraid he was coming to me with another agonised whisper  when he was opposite i could not but watch him as he hobbled in his misery  it was evident that the boots were too tight for him and had they been made throughout of iron they could not have been less capable of yielding to the feet  i pitied him from the bottom of my heart  and i pitied myself also wishing that i was well in bed upstairs with some feigned malady so that larry might have had his own again  and then for a moment i missed him from the room  he had doubtless gone to relieve his tortured feet in the servants hall and as he did so was cursing my cruelty  but what mattered it  let him curse if he would only stay away and do that i would appease his wrath when we were alone together with pecuniary satisfaction  but there was no such rest in store for me  larry larry shouted mr oconor where on earth has the fellow gone to  they were all cousins at the table except myself and mr oconor was not therefore restrained by any feeling of ceremony  there is something wrong with that fellow today what is it jack  upon my word sir i dont know said jack  i think he must be tipsy whispered miss oconor the maiden sister who always sat at her brothers left hand  but a whisper though it was it was audible all down the table  no maam it aint dhrink at all said the coachman  it is his feet as does it  his feet shouted tom oconor  yes i know its his feet said that horrid tizzy  hes got on great thick nailed shoes  it was that that made him tumble down in the hall  i glanced at each side of me and could see that there was a certain consciousness expressed in the face of each of my two neighbourson kates mouth there was decidedly a smile or rather perhaps the slightest possible inclination that way whereas on fannys part i thought i saw something like a rising sorrow at my distress  so at least i flattered myself  send him back into the room immediately said tom who looked at me as though he had some consciousness that i had introduced all this confusion into his household  what should i do  would it not be best for me to make clean breast of it before them all  but alas  i lacked the courage  the coachman went out and we were left for five minutes without any servant and mr oconor the while became more and more savage  i attempted to say a word to fanny but failed  vox faucibus haesit  i dont think he has got any others said tizzyat least none others left  on the whole i am glad i did not marry into the family as i could not have endured that girl to stay in my house as a sisterinlaw  where the d has that other fellow gone to said tom  jack do go out and see what is the matter  if anybody is drunk send for me  oh there is nobody drunk said tizzy  jack went out and the coachman returned but what was done and said i hardly remember  the whole room seemed to swim round and round and as far as i can recollect the company sat mute neither eating nor drinking  presently jack returned  its all right said he  i always liked jack  at the present moment he just looked towards me and laughed slightly  all right said tom  but is the fellow coming  we can do with richard i suppose said jack  noi cant do with richard said the father  and will know what it all means  where is that fellow larry  larry had been standing just outside the door and now he entered gently as a mouse  no sound came from his footfall nor was there in his face that look of pain which it had worn for the last fifteen minutes  but he was not the less abashed frightened and unhappy  what is all this about larry said his master turning to him  i insist upon knowing  och thin mr green yer honer i wouldnt be afther telling agin yer honer indeed i wouldnt thin av the masther would only let me hould my tongue  and he looked across at me deprecating my anger  mr green said mr oconor  yes yer honer  its all along of his honers thick shoes and larry stepping backwards towards the door lifted them up from some corner and coming well forward exposed them with the soles uppermost to the whole table  and thats not all yer honer but theyve squoze the very toes of me into a jelly  there was now a loud laugh in which jack and peter and fanny and kate and tizzy all joined as too did mr oconorand i also myself after a while  whose boots are they demanded miss oconor senior with her severest tone and grimmest accent  deed then and the divil may have them for me miss answered larry  they war mr greens but the likes of him wont wear them agin afther the likes of mebarring he wanted them very particular added he remembering his own pumps  i began muttering something feeling that the time had come when i must tell the tale  but jack with great good nature took up the story and told it so well that i hardly suffered in the telling  and thats it said tom oconor laughing till i thought he would have fallen from his chair  so youve got larrys shoes on  and very well he fills them said jack  and its his honer thats welcome to em said larry grinning from ear to ear now that he saw that the masther was once more in a good humour  i hope theyll be nice shoes for dancing said kate  only theres one down at the heel i know said tizzy  the servants shoes  this was an exclamation made by the maiden lady and intended apparently only for her brothers ear  but it was clearly audible by all the party  better that than no dinner said peter  but what are you to do about the dancing said fanny with an air of dismay on her face which flattered me with an idea that she did care whether i danced or no  in the mean time larry now as happy as an emperor was tripping round the room without any shoes to encumber him as he withdrew the plates from the table  and its his honer thats welcome to em said he again as he pulled off the tablecloth with a flourish  and why wouldnt he and he able to folly the hounds betther nor any englishman that iver war in these parts beforeanyways so mick says  now mick was the huntsman and this little tale of eulogy from larry went far towards easing my grief  i had ridden well to the hounds that day and i knew it  there was nothing more said about the shoes and i was soon again at my ease although miss oconor did say something about the impropriety of larry walking about in his stocking feet  the ladies however soon withdrewto my sorrow for i was getting on swimmingly with fanny and then we gentlemen gathered round the fire and filled our glasses  in about ten minutes a very light tap was heard the door was opened to the extent of three inches and a female voice which i readily recognised called to jack  jack went out and in a second or two put his head back into the room and called to megreen he said just step here moment theres a good fellow  i went out and there i found fanny standing with her brother  here are the girls at their wits ends said he about your dancing  so fanny has put a boy upon one of the horse and proposes that you should send another line to mrs meehan at ballyglass  its only ten miles and hell be back in two hours  i need hardly say that i acted in conformity with this advice i went into mr oconors book room with jack and his sister and there scribbled a note  i was delightful to feel how intimate i was with them and how anxious they were to make me happy  and we wont begin till they come said fanny  oh miss oconor pray dont wait said i  oh but we will she answered  you have your wine to drink and then theres the tea and then well have a song two  ill spin it out see if i dont  and so we went to the front door where the boy was already on his horseher own nag as i afterwards found  and patsey said she ride for your life and patsey whatever you do dont come back without mr greens pumpshis dancingshoes you know  and in about two hours the pumps did arrive and i dont think i ever spent a pleasanter evening or got more satisfaction out of a pair of shoes  they had not been two minutes on my feet before larry was carrying a tray of negus across the room in those which i had worn at dinner  the dillon girls are going to stay here said fanny as i wished her good night at two oclock  and well have dancing every evening as long as you remain  but i shall leave tomorrow said i  indeed you wont  papa will take care of that  and so he did  you had better go over to ballyglass yourself to morrow said he and collect your own things  theres no knowing else what you may have to borrow of larry  i stayed there three weeks and in the middle of the third i thought that everything would be arranged between me and fanny  but the aunt interfered and in about a twelvemonth after my adventures she consented to make a more fortunate man happy for his life
