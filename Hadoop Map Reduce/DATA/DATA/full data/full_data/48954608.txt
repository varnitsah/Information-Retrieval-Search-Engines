chapter i  an advertisement   a small boy with a tiny white dog in his arms stood near the new york approach to the brooklyn bridge on a certain june morning not many years since gazing doubtfully at the living tide which flowed past him as if questioning whether it might be safe to venture across the street  seth barrows otherwise known by his acquaintances as limpy seth because of what they were pleased to speak of as a pair of legs that werent mates was by no means dismayed by the bustle and apparent confusion everywhere around him such scenes were familiar he having lived in the city so far as he knew from the day of his birth but owing to his slight lameness it was not always a simple matter for him to cross the crowded streets  hi limpy a shrill voice cried from amid the pedestrians in the distance and as seth looked quickly toward the direction from which had come the hail he noted that a boy with hair of such a vivid hue of red as would attract particular attention from any person within whose range of vision he might come was frantically trying to force a passage  seth stepped back to a partially sheltered position beneath the stairway of the overhead bridge and awaited the coming of his friend  out swellin are you the boy with the red hair asked as he finally approached panting so heavily that it was with difficulty he could speak goin to give up business  i got rid of my stock quite a while ago an counted on givin snip a chance to run in the park the poor little duffer dont have much fun down at mother hydes while im workin  you might sell him for a pile of money limpy an hes a heap of bother for you the newcomer said reflectively as he stroked the dogs long silken hair teddy dixon says hes got good blood in him  look here tim do you think id sell snip no matter how much money i might get for him why hes the only relation ive got in all this world and the boy buried his face in the dogs white hair  it costs more to keep him than you put out for yourself  what of that he thinks a heap of me snip does an hed be as sorry as i would if anything happened to one of us  yes i reckon you are kinder stuck on him its a pity limpy cause you cant hustle sames the rest of us do an so dont earn as much money  snip has what milk he needs  an half the time you feed him by goin hungry yourself  what of that seth cried sharply dont i tell you we two are the only friends each others got id a good deal rather get along without things than let him go hungry cause he wouldnt know why i couldnt feed him  a dog is only a dog an thats all you can make out of it i aint countin but that snip is bettern the general run cause as teddy dixon says hes blooded but just the same it dont stand to reason you should treat him like he was as good as you  hes a heap bettern i am tim chandler snip never did a mean thing in his life an hes the same as a whole family to me  as if understanding that he was the subject of the conversation the dog pressed his cold nose against the boys neck and the latter cried triumphantly  there look at that if you didnt have any folks tim chandler an couldnt get round same as other fellers do dont you reckon his snugglin up like this would make you love him  he aint really yours tim said after a brief pause whereat the lame boy cried fiercely  whats the reason he aint didnt i find him most froze to death moren a year ago an havent i kept him in good shape ever since of course he wasnt mine at first but id like to see the chump whod dare to say he belonged to anybody else if you didnt own any more of a home than you could earn sellin papers an if nobody cared the least little bit whether you was cold or hungry youd think it was mighty fine to have a chum like snip you oughter see him when i come in after hes been shut up in the room all the forenoon it seems like hed jump out of his skin hes so glad to see me i tell you tim snip loves me just like i was his mother  master chandler shook his head doubtfully and appeared to be on the point of indulging some disparaging remark when his attention was diverted by a lad on the opposite side of the street who was making the most frantic gestures and as might be guessed by the movement of his lips shouting at the full strength of his lungs but the words were drowned by the rattle of vehicles and other noises of the street  theres pip smith an what do you spose hes got in his ear now tim said speculatively but with little apparent interest in the subject hes allers botherin his head bout somethin that aint any of his business he allows hell be a detective when he gets big enough  seth gave more attention to the caresses snip was bestowing upon him than to his acquaintance opposite until tim exclaimed with a sudden show of excitement  hes yellin for you seth whats he swingin that newspaper round his head for  perhaps tim might have become interested enough to venture across the street had master smith remained on the opposite side very long but just at that moment the tide of travel slackened sufficiently to admit of a passage and the excited pip came toward his acquaintances at full speed  what kind of a game have you been up to limpy he demanded waving the newspaper meanwhile  seth looked at the speaker in astonishment but without making any reply  anything gone wrong tim asked gazing inquiringly from one to the other  i dont know what he means seth replied and pip shouted wildly  listen to him youd think butter wouldnt melt in his mouth an yet hes been ridin a mighty high hoss cordin to all i can find out  who seth demanded grown restive under pips accusing gaze  you of course  but i havent been up to any game  you cant stuff me with that kind of talk cause ive got it down here in black an white  got what down tim asked impatiently if theres anything wrong why dont you come out with it like a man an not stand there like a dummy  seth barrows will find theres somethin wrong when the whole perlice force of this city gets after him pip replied in what was very like a threatening tone listen to this tim chandler an try to figger out the kind of a game limpys been playin  then with a tragical air master smith read slowly from the newspaper he had been brandishing the following advertisement      information wanted of a boy calling himself seth barrows said     boy is about eleven years old his left leg an inch shorter than     the right and is known to have been living in jersey city three     years ago he then sold newspapers for a livelihood and resided     with one richard genet a liberal reward will be paid for any     information concerning him address symonds  symonds     attorneysatlaw  as he ceased reading master smith looked at his companions with a certain gleam of triumph in his eyes but this expression quickly changed to one of severe reproof as he met seths bewildered gaze  sellin papers is good enough for me though it aint a business that brings in any too much money he said sharply but i dont keep a fancy dog so the cost of livin aint so high  what does it mean seth asked in a low tone as he gazed alternately at tim and pip  mean the latter replied scornfully i reckon you can answer that bettern we could when the bank on broadway was broke into there was the same kind of notice in the papers for i saw it with my own eyes  but i havent been breakin into any bank seth wailed hugging snip yet more tightly to his bosom  then whats that advertisement there for and master smith looked upon his acquaintance with an air of judicial severity  how do i know  now it was tims turn to gaze at seth reproachfully and as the three stood there one and another of their acquaintances having heard the startling news came up eagerly curious and positive that snips master had committed some terrible crime  the lame boy gave ample token of mental distress as well he might after hearing that two attorneysatlaw were desirous of finding him and more than one of the throng set down the expression of trouble on his face as strong proof of guilt  although conscious that he had committed no crime the boy was thoroughly alarmed at being thus advertised for he knew that rewards were offered for information which would lead to the apprehension of criminals and never so much as dreamed that similar methods might be employed in a search for those who were innocent  there was no reason so he might have said to himself why any lawyer in the city of new york would care to see him unless he had been accused of some crime but as he revolved the matter in his mind terror took possession of him until all power of reflection had departed  the number of alleged friends or acquaintances had increased until seth and snip were literally surrounded and every member of the throng knew full well that the gathering would be rudely dispersed by the first policeman who chanced to come that way therefore it was that each fellow hastened to give his opinion as to the reason why the advertisement had been inserted in the columns of the paper and with five or six boys speaking at the same moment it can well be understood that no one of them succeeded in making any very great impression upon the minds of his neighbors  seth understood however that every boy present was agreed upon the supposed fact that a great crime had been committed although these young merchants might upon due reflection come to realize how improbable was such a supposition  when little snip seeming to understand that his master was in sore distress licked the boys cheek it was to seth almost as if the dog shared in the belief of those who were so ready to accuse him and he could restrain his feelings no longer  leaning against the iron column which supported the staircase with his face buried in snips silky hair the crippled lad gave way to tears while his companions gazed at him severely for to their minds this show of grief was much the same as a confession of guilt  a bluecoated guardian of the peace dispersed the throng before those composing it had had time to make audible comment upon this last evidence of an accusing conscience but seth was so bowed down by bewilderment sorrow and fear as not to know that he stood alone with snip while a throng of acquaintances gazed at him from the opposite side of the street  once the officer had passed on and was at a respectful distance seths friends returned and it could be understood from their manner that some definite plan of action had been decided upon during the enforced absence  see here seth we aint such chumps as to jump on a feller when hes down if you dont want to tell us what youve been doin  i havent done a thing an you know it tim chandler the lad moaned speaking with difficulty because of his sobs  then whats the notice about tim asked in a severe yet friendly tone  i dont know any moren you do  wheres the lead nickel mickey dowd says somebody shoved on you the other day teddy dixon asked sharply  seth raised his head looked about him for a moment as a shadow of fear passed over his face and dropping snip for an instant plunged both hands deep in his trousers pockets  withdrawing them he displayed a small collection of silver and copper coins which he turned over eagerly his companions crowding yet more closely to assure themselves that the examination was thorough  its gone seth cried shrilly its gone but ill cross my throat if i knew i was passin it  snip hearing his young masters cry of fear stood on his hind feet scratching and clawing to attract attention and hardly conscious of what he did seth took the little fellow in his arms once more  that settles the whole business teddy dixon cried in the tone of one who has made an important discovery you shoved it on somebody whod been lookin for counterfeit money an now the detectives are after you  seth glanced quickly and apprehensively around as if fearing the officers of the law were already close upon him and the seeming mystery was unravelled  from that moment there was not even the shadow of a doubt in the minds of seths acquaintances and believing that he had not intended to commit such a grave crime the sympathies of all were aroused  youve got to skip mighty quick tim said after a brief pause during which each lad had looked at his neighbor as if asking what could be done to rescue the threatened boy  wherell i go seth cried tearfully they know what my name is an there aint much use for me to hide  you can bet i wouldnt hang round here many seconds one of the group said in a low tone glancing around to make certain his words were not overheard by the minions of the law if we fellers keep our mouths shut an you sneak off into the country somewhere i dont see how anybody could find you  but whered i go seth asked his tears checked by the great fear which came with the supposed knowledge of what he had done  anywhere heres snip all ready to take a journey for his health an in ten minutes youll be out of the city but it aint safe to hang round thinkin of it very long for the detectives will be runnin their legs off tryin to earn the money thats promised by the advertisement  seth made no reply and his most intimate friends understood that if he was to be saved from prison the time had arrived when they must act without waiting for his decision  they held a hurried consultation while seth stood caressing snip without being really conscious of what he did and then teddy and tim ranged themselves either side of the culprit who had unwittingly brought himself under the ban of the law  seizing him by the arms they forced the lad forward in the direction of broadway tim saying hoarsely to those who gave token of their intention to follow  you fellers must keep away else the cops will know were up to somethin crooked wait here an me an teddyll come back as soon as weve taken care of seth  this injunction was not obeyed without considerable grumbling on the part of the more curious and but for the efforts of two or three of the wiser heads the fugitive and his accomplices would have aroused the suspicions of the dullest policeman in the city  youll get yourselves into a heap of trouble if anybody knows you helped me to run away seth said in a tone of faint remonstrance  it cant be helped teddy replied firmly urging the hunted boy to a faster pace we aint goin to stand by an see you lugged off to jail while theres a show of our doin anything keep your eye on snip sos he wont bark an well look after the rest of the business  even if seth had been averse to running away from the possible danger which threatened he would have been forced to continue the flight so lately begun because of the energy displayed by his friends  tim and teddy literally dragged him along crossing the street at one point to avoid a policeman and again dodging into a friendly doorway when the guardians of the peace came upon them suddenly  had any one observed particularly the movements of these three lads the gravest suspicions must have been awakened for they displayed a consciousness of guilt in every movement and showed plainly that their great desire was to escape scrutiny  seth was so enveloped in sorrow and fear as to be ignorant of the direction in which he and snip were being forced he understood dimly that those who had the business of escape in hand were bent on gaining the river but to more than that he gave no heed  finally when they were arrived at a ferryslip teddy paid the passage money and seth was led to the forward end of the boat in order as tim explained that he might be ready to jump ashore instantly the pier on the opposite side was gained in case the officers of justice had tracked them thus far  now forced to remain inactive for a certain time seths friends took advantage of the opportunity to give him what seemed to be muchneeded advice  the minute the boat strikes the dock you must take a sneak teddy said impressively clutching seth vigorously by the shoulder to insure attention well hang round here to make sure the detectives havent got on to your trail an then well go back  but what am i to do afterward seth asked helplessly  there aint any need of very much guessin about that youre bound to get where therell be a chance of hidin an you want to be mighty lively  snip an i will have to earn money enough to keep us goin an how can it be done while im hidin  how much have you got now  bout fifty cents  tim drew from his pocket a handful of coins mostly pennies and retaining only three cents with which to pay his return passage on the ferryboat forced them upon the fugitive saying when the boy remonstrated  youll need it all an i can hustle a little livelier tonight or borrow from some of the other fellers if trade dont show up as it oughter  teddy followed his comrades example paying no heed to seths expostulations save as he said  were bound to give you a lift old man so dont say anything more about it if you was the only feller in this city what had passed a lead nickel perhaps this thing would look different to me but the way i reckon it is that the man what put the advertisement in the paper jest cause hed been done outer five cents is a mighty poor citizen an i stand ready to do all i can towards keepin you away from him  look here fellers seth cried in what was very like despair as the steamer neared the dock i dont know what to do even after youve put up all your money where can snip an i go weve got to earn our livin an i dont see how its to be done if were bound to hide all the time  thats easy enough and tim spoke hopefully the city is a fool alongside the country an im countin on your havin a reglar snap after you get settled down when we land youre to strike right out an keep on goin till youre where theres nothin but farms with milk an pie an stuff to eat layin round loose for the first feller what comes to pick em up pip smith says farmers dont do much of anything but fill theirselves with good things an ive allers wanted to try my hand with em for one summer  seth shook his head doubtfully although he had never been in the country it did not seem reasonable that the picture drawn by pip smith was truthful otherwise every city boy would turn farmers assistant rather than remain where it cost considerable labor to provide themselves with food and a shelter  youll strike it rich somewhere teddy said with an air of conviction an then you can sneak back long enough to tell us where youre hangin out ill work down round the markets for a spell an prhaps ill see some of the hayseeders youve run across  the conversation was brought to a close abruptly as the ferryboat entered the dock with many a bump and reel against the heavy timbers and seth with snip hugged tightly to his bosom pressed forward to the gates that he might be ready to leap ashore instantly they were opened  keep your upper lip stiff an dont stop once youve started till youre so far from new york that the detectives cant find you tim whispered encouragingly and ten seconds later the fugitive was running at full speed up the gangway snip barking shrilly at the throng on either side  tim and teddy followed their friend to the street beyond the ticket office and there stood watching until he had disappeared from view then the latter said with a longdrawn sigh  i wish it had been almost any other feller what passed the lead nickel for seth hasnt got sand enough to do whats needed if he counts on keepin outer jail and tim replied sadly  if a feller stuck me with a counterfeit id think i had a right to shove it along but after all this scrape ill keep my eyes open mighty wide else it may be a case of the country for me an i aint hankerin after livin on a farm even if pip smith does think its sich a soft snap  then the friends of the fugitives returned to the ferryboat in order that they might without delay make a report to those acquaintances whom they knew would be eagerly waiting as to how seth had fared at the outset of his flight     chapter ii  the country   seth had little idea as to the direction he had taken save that the street led straight away from the water and surely he must come into the country finally by pursuing such a course  neither time nor distance gave him relief of mind it was much as if flight served to increase the fear in his mind and even after having come to the suburbs of the city he looked over his shoulder apprehensively from time to time almost expecting to see the officers of the law in hot pursuit  if it had been possible for snip to understand the situation fully he could not have behaved with more discretion according to his masters views  instead of begging to be let down that he might enjoy a frolic on the green grass he remained passive in seths arms pressing his nose up to the lads neck now and then as if expressing sympathy the little fellow did not so much as whine when they passed rapidly by a coollooking bubbling stream even though his tongue was lolling out red and dripping with perspiration but seth understood that his pet would have been much refreshed with a drink of the running water and said in a soothing affectionate tone  i dont dare to stop yet a while snippey dear for nobody knows how near the officers may be and you had better go thirsty a little longer than be kicked out into the street when im locked up in jail  a big lump came into the fugitives throat at the picture he had drawn and the brook was left far behind before he could force it down sufficiently to speak  then the two were come to a small shop in the windows of which were displayed a variety of wares from slate pencils to mint drops and here seth halted irresolutely  he had continued at a rapid pace and fully an hour was passed since he parted from his friends he was both hungry and weary there were but few buildings to be seen ahead and so he argued with himself this might be his last opportunity to purchase anything which would serve as food until he was launched into that wilderness known to him as the country  no person could be seen in either direction and seth persuaded himself that it might be safe to halt here for so long a time as would be necessary to select something from the varied stock to appease hunger and at the same time be within his limited means  for the first moment since leaving the ferryslip he allowed snip to slip out of his arms but caught him up again very quickly as the dog gave strong evidence of a desire to spend precious time in a frolic  you must wait a spell longer snippey dear he muttered we may have to run for it an i mightnt have a chance to get you in my arms again it would be terrible if the officers got hold of you an im afraid theyd try it for the sake of catchin me cause everybody knows i wouldnt leave you no matter what happened  then seth stole softly into the shop as if fearing to awaken the suspicion of the proprietor by a bold approach and once inside gazed quickly around  two or three early unwholesomelooking apples and a jar of ginger cakes made up the list of eatables and his decision was quickly made  how many of them cakes will you sell for five cents he asked timidly of the slovenly woman who was embroidering an odd green flower on a small square of soiled and faded red silk  she looked at him listlessly and then gazed at the cakes meditatively  i dont know the price of them this shop isnt mine im tendin it for a friend  then you cant sell things and seth turned to go fearing lest he had already loitered too long  oh dear yes thats what im here for but i never had a customer for cakes an to tell the truth i dont believe one of em has been sold for a month do you know what they are worth  the bakers sell a doughnut as big as three of them for a cent an throw in an extra one if theyre stale  the lady deposited her embroidery on a sheet of brown paper which covered one end of the counter and surveyed the cakes  it seems to me that a cent for three of them would be a fair price she said at length after having broken one in order to gain some idea of its age  have you got anything else to eat  that candy is real good especially the checkerberry sticks but perhaps you rather have somethin more fillin  ill take five cents worth of cakes seth said hurriedly for it seemed as if he had been inside the shop a very long while  the amateur clerk set about counting the stale dainties in a businesslike way but at that instant snip came into view from behind his master and she ceased the task at once to cry in delight  what a dear little dog did he come with you  yes maam seth replied hesitatingly and he added as the woman stooped to caress snip were in a big hurry an if youll give me the cakes ill thank you  dear me why didnt you say so at first and she resumed her task of counting the cakes stopping now and then to speak to snip who was sitting up on his hind legs begging for a bit of the stale pastry how far are you going  i dont know you see we cant walk very fast  got friends out this way i take it  wellyesnothat is i dont know wont you please hurry  the woman seemed to think it necessary she should feed snip with a portion of one cake that had already been counted out for seth and to still further tempt the dogs appetite by giving him an inch or more broken from one of the checkerberry sticks before attending to her duties as clerk after which she concluded her portion of the transaction by holding out a not overcleanly hand for the money  seth hurriedly gave her five pennies and then seizing snip in his arms ran out of the shop regardless of the questions she literally hurled after him  his first care was to gaze down the road in the direction from which he had just come and the relief of mind was great when he failed to see any signs of life  they havent caught up with us yet snippey he said as if certain the officers were somewhere in the rear bent on taking him prisoner if they stop at the store that woman will be sure to say we were here  having thus spurred himself on he continued the journey half an hour longer when they had arrived at a grove of small trees and bushes through which ran a tiny brook  we can hide in here an youll have a chance to run around on the grass till youre tired he said as after making certain there was no one in sight to observe his movements he darted amid the shrubbery  it was not difficult for a boy tired as was seth to find a restinviting spot by the side of the stream where the bushes hid him from view of any who might chance to pass along the road and without loss of time snip set himself the task of chasing every butterfly that dared come within his range of vision ceasing only for a few seconds at a time to lick his masters hand or take his share of the stale pastry  it was most refreshing to seth this halt beneath the shade of the bushes where the brook sang such a song as he had never heard before and despite the age of the cake his hunger was appeased save for the haunting fear that the officers of the law might be close upon his heels he would have been very happy and even under the painful circumstances attending his departure he enjoyed in a certain degree the unusual scene before him  then snip wearied with his fruitless pursuit of the butterflies crept close by his masters side for a nap and seth yielded to the temptation to stretch himself out at full length on the soft cool moss  there was in his mind the thought that he must resume the flight within a short time lest he fail to find a shelter before the night had come but the dancing waters sang a most entrancing and restinviting melody until his eyes closed despite his efforts to hold them open and master and dog were wrapped in slumber  the birds gathered on the branches above the heads of the sleepers gazing down curiously and with many an inquiring twitter as if asking whether this boy was one who would do them a mischief if it lay in his power and the butterflies flaunted their gaudy wings within an inch of snips eyes but the slumber was not broken  the sun had no more than an hours time remaining before his days work in that particular section of the country had come to an end when a brown moth fluttered down upon seths nose where he sat pluming his wings in such an energetic manner that the boy suddenly sneezed himself into wakefulness while snip leaped up with a chorus of shrill barks and yelps which nearly threw the curious birds into hysterics  its almost sunset snippey dear an weve been idlin here when we oughter been huntin for a house where we can stay till mornin its fine i know he added as he took the tiny dog in his arms but i dont believe it would be very jolly to hang round in such a place all night besides who knows but there are bears we must be a terrible long way in the country an if the farmers are as good as pip smith tells about we can get a chance to sleep in a house  the fear that the officers might be close upon his heels had fled it seemed as if many many hours had passed since he took leave of tim and teddy and it was possible the representatives of law would not pursue him so far into the country  he had yet on hand a third of the stale cakes and with these in his pocket as token that he would not go supperless to bed and snip on his arm he resumed the flight once more  after a brisk walk of half an hour still on a course directly away from the river as he believed seth began to look about him for a shelter during the night  well stop at the first house that looks as if the folks who live in it might be willin to help two fellers like us along an ask if we can stay all night he said to snip speaking in a more cheery tone than he had indulged in since the fearinspiring advertisement had been brought to his attention  he did not adhere strictly to this plan however for when he was come to a farmhouse which had seemed to give token of sheltering generous people a big black dog ran out of the yard growling and snapping much to snippeys alarm and seth hurried on at full speed  that wouldnt be any place for you young man he said patting the dogs head well sleep out of doors rather than have you scared half to death  ten minutes later he knocked at the door of a house and on making his request to a surlylooking man was told that they had no use for tramps  seth did not stop to explain that he could not rightly be called a tramp but ran onward as if fearful lest the farmer might pursue to punish him for daring to ask such a favor  three times within fifteen minutes did he ask in vain for a shelter and then his courage had oozed out at his fingers ends  if pip smith was here hed see that there aint much milk an pie layin round to be picked up an it begins to look snippey as if wed better stayed down there by the brook  master snip growled as if to say that he too believed they had made a mistake in pushing on any farther and the sun hid his face behind the hills as a warning for young boys and small dogs to get under cover  seth was discouraged and very nearly frightened he began to fear that he might get himself and snip into serious trouble by any further efforts at finding a charitably disposed farmer and after the shadows of night had begun to lengthen until every bush and rock was distorted into some hideous or fantastic shape he was standing opposite a small barn adjoining a yet smaller dwelling  no light could be seen from the building it was as if the place had been deserted and such a state of affairs seemed more promising to seth than any he had seen  if the people are at home an we ask them to let us stay all night well be driven away so spose we creep in there an at the first show of mornin well be off it cant do any harm for us to sleep in a barn when the folks dont know it  the barking of a dog in the distance caused him to decide upon a course of action very quickly and in the merest fraction of time he was inside the building groping around the main floor on which had been thrown a sufficient amount of hay to provide a dozen boys with a comfortable bed  he could hear some animal munching its supper a short distance away and this sound robbed the gloomy interior of half its imaginary terrors  promising himself that he would leave the place before the occupants of the house were stirring next morning seth made his bed by burrowing into the hay and with snip nestling close by his side was soon ready for another nap  the fugitive had taken many steps during his flight and despite the slumber indulged in by the side of the brook his eyes were soon closed in profound sleep  many hours later the shrill barking of snip awakened seth and he sat bolt upright on the hay rubbing his sleepy eyes as if trying to prove that those useful members had deceived him in some way  the rays of the morning sun were streaming in through the open door in a golden flood and with the radiance came sweet odors borne by the gentle breeze  seth gave no heed just at that moment to the wondrous beauties of nature to be seen on every hand when even the rough barn was gilded and perfumed for standing in the doorway as if literally petrified with astonishment was a motherly looking little woman whose upraised hands told of bewilderment and surprise while from the expression on her face one could almost have believed that she was really afraid of the tiny snip  is that animal dangerous little boy she asked nervously after a brief but to seth painful pause  whowhat animal oh you mean snip why he couldnt harm anybody if he tried an besides he wouldnt hurt a fly he always barks when strange folks come near where i am sos to make me think hes a watchdog do you own this barn  yesthat is to say it has always belonged to the morses an there are none left now except gladys an me  i hope you wont be mad cause i came in here last night i counted on gettin away before you waked up but the bed was so soft that it aint any wonder i kept right on sleepin  have you been here all night the little woman asked in surprise advancing a pace now that snip had decided there was no longer any necessity for him to continue the shrill outcries  i didnt have any place to sleep there wasnt a light to be seen in your house well to tell the truth i was afraid id be driven away sames i had been at the other places so sneaked in  aunt hannah aunt hannah  it was a sweet clear childish voice which thus interrupted the conversation and the little woman said nervously as she glanced suspiciously at snip  i wish you would hold your dog little boy that is gladys an shes so reckless that im in fear of her life every minute she is near strange animals  seth did not have time to comply with this request before a pinkcheeked little miss of about his own age came dancing into the barn like a june wind which burdens itself with the petals of the early roses  oh aunt hannah why where in the world did that little boywhat a perfectly lovely dog oh you dear  this last exclamation was called forth by master snip himself who bounded forward with every show of joy and stood erect on his hind feet with both forepaws raised as if asking to be taken in her arms  dont gladys you mustnt touch that animal for nobody knows whether he may not be ferocious  the warning came too late gladys already had snip in her arms and as the little fellow struggled to lick her cheek in token of his desire to be on friendly terms she said laughingly  you poor foolish aunt hannah to think that a mite of a dog like this one could ever be ferocious isnt he a perfect beauty i never saw such a dear  the little woman hovered helplessly around much like a sparrow whose fledglings are in danger she feared lest the dog should do the child a mischief and yet dared not come so near as to rescue her from the imaginary danger  there was just a tinge of jealousy in seths heart as he gazed at snips demonstrations of affection for this stranger it seemed as if he had suddenly lost his only friend and at that moment it was the greatest misfortune that could befall him  gladys was so occupied with the dog as to be unconscious of aunt hannahs anxiety she admired snips silky hair declared that he needed a bath and insisted on knowing how such a treasure had come into seths possession  the boy was not disposed to admit that he had no real claim upon the dog save such as might result from having found him homeless and friendless in the street but willing that the girl should admire his pet yet more  put him on the floor an see how much he knows seth said without replying to her question  then snip was called upon to show his varied accomplishments he sat bolt upright holding a wisp of straw in his mouth walked on his hind feet with seth holding him by one paw whirled around and around on being told to dance leaped over the handle of the hayfork barking and yelping with excitement and otherwise gave token of being very intelligent  gladys was in an ecstasy of delight and even the little woman so far overcame her fear of animals as to venture to touch snips outstretched paw when he gravely offered to shake hands  not until at least a quarter of an hour had passed was any particular attention paid to seth and by this time aunt hannah was willing to admit that while dogs in general frightened her however peaceable they appeared to be she thought a little fellow like snip might be almost as companionable as a cat  of course you wont continue your journey until after breakfast she said in a matteroffact tone and gladys will take you into the kitchen where you can wash your face and hands while i am milking  then it was that seth observed a bright tin pail and a threelegged stool lying on the ground just outside the big door as if they had fallen from the little womans hands when she was alarmed by hearing snips note of defiance and warning  gladys had the dog in her arms and nodding to seth as if to say he should follow she led the way to the house while aunt hannah disappeared through a doorway opening from the main portion of the barn  theres the towel the soap and water she said pointing toward a wooden sink in one corner of what was to seth the most wonderful kitchen he had ever seen dont you think snippey would like some milk  im certain he would seth replied promptly he hasnt had anything except dry ginger cake since yesterday mornin  a moment later master snip had before him a saucer filled with such milk as it is safe to say he had not seen since seth took him in charge and the eager way in which he lapped it showed that it was appreciated fully  the fugitive did not make his toilet immediately because of the irresistible temptation to gaze about him  the walls of the kitchen were low but in the newcomers eyes this was an added attraction because it gave to the room such an hospitable appearance the floor was more cleanly than any table he had ever seen the bricks of the fireplace at one side of which stood a small cookstove were as red as if newly painted while on the dresser and the mantel across the broad chimney were tin dishes that shone like newly polished silver  a large rockingchair a couch covered with chintz and half a dozen straightbacked spiderlegged chairs were ranged methodically along the sides of the room while in the centre of the floor so placed that the fresh morning breeze which entered by the door would blow straight across it to the window shaded by lilac bushes was a table covered with a snowy cloth  well if this is a farmers house i wouldnt wonder if a good bit of pip smiths yarn was true seth muttered to himself as he turned toward the sink over which hung a towel so white that he could hardly believe he would be allowed to dry his face and hands with it  he was alone in the kitchen snip having had a most satisfactory breakfast of what he must have believed was real cream had run out of doors to chase a leaf blown by the wind and gladys was close behind alternately urging him in the pursuit and showering praises upon the sweetest dog that ever lived  folks that live like this must be mighty rich seth thought as he plunged his face into a basin of clear water it aint likely snip an me will strike it so soft again an i expect hell be terrible sorry to leave i reckon itll be all right to hang round an hour or so an then we must get out lively i wonder if that little bit of a woman expects ill pay for breakfast     chapter iii  aunt hannah   with a broken comb which he used upon snips hair as well as his own seth concluded his toilet and neither the little woman nor the girl having returned to the house stood in the doorway gazing out upon as peaceful a scene as a boy pursued by the officers of the law could well desire to see  on either hand ran the dusty road not unlike a yellow ribbon upon a cloth of green and bordering it here and there were clumps of bushes or groves of pine or of oak as if planted for the especial purpose of affording to the weary traveller a screen from the blinding sun  the little farmhouse stood upon the height of a slight elevation from which could be had a view of the country round about on either hand and although so near to the great city there were no settlements villages or towns to be seen  surely the lad said to himself he had at last arrived at the country and if all houses were as hospitablelooking as cleanly and as inviting in appearance as was this one then pip smiths story had in it considerably more than a grain of truth  it must be mighty nice to have money enough to live in a place like this seth said to himself it would please snip way down to the ground but i mustnt think of it cause theres no chance for a feller like me to earn a livin here an we cant always count on folks givin us what we need to eat  then aunt hannah came out from the barn carrying in one hand a glistening tin pail filled with foaming milk and in the other the threelegged stool  seth ran toward her and held out his hand as if believing she would readily yield at least a portion of her burden but she shook her head smiling  bless your heart my child i ought to be able to carry one pail of milk seeing that ive done as much or more every day since i was gladyss age  but thats no reason why i shouldnt help along a little to make up for your not bein mad cause snip an me slept in the barn besides id like to say to the fellers that id carried as much milk as a whole pail full once in my lifethat is if i ever see em again he added with a sigh  then you came from the city  yes an i never got so far out in the country before say its mighty fine aint it and as aunt hannah relinquished her hold on the pail seth started toward the house without waiting for a reply to his question  after placing the stool bottom up by the side of the broad stone which served as doorstep the little woman called to gladys  its time whiteface was taken to pasture child  do you mean the cow seth asked  yes dear  why cant i take her to the pasture that is if youll tell me where to find it  unfasten her chain and she will show you the way its only across the road over yonder  seth ran quickly to the barn and having arrived at the doorway through which aunt hannah disappeared when she went about the task of milking he halted in surprise and fear looking at what seemed to him an enormous beast with long threatening horns which she shook now and then in what appeared to be a most vicious fashion  only once before had seth ever seen an animal of this species and then it was when he and pip smith had travelled over to the erie yards to see a drove of oxen taken from the cars to the abattoir  it surely seemed very dangerous to turn loose such a huge beast but seth was determined to perform whatsoever labor lay in his power with the idea that he might not be called upon to pay quite as much for breakfast and summing up all his courage he advanced toward the cow  she shook her head restively impatient for the breakfast of sweet grass and he leaped back suddenly frightened as badly of her as aunt hannah had been of snip  once more he made an attempt and once more leaped back in alarm this time to be greeted with a peal of merry laughter and a volley of shrill barks from snip who probably fancied seth stood in need of his protection  why did you jump so gladys asked merrily  seths face reddened and he stammered not a little in reply  i reckon that cow would make it kinder lively for strangers wouldnt he  and you are really afraid of poor old whiteface why shes as gentle as snippey though of course you couldnt pet her so much  then gladys stepped boldly forward and snip whined and barked in a perfect spasm of fear at being carried so near the formidablelooking animal  now you are just as foolish as your master gladys said with a hearty laugh but she allowed the dog to slip down from her arms and as he sought safety behind his master she unloosened the chain from the cows neck leading her by the horn out of the barn  then it was that snip plucked up courage to join the girl who had been so kind to him and seth thoroughly ashamed at having betrayed so much cowardice followed his example  i want to do something toward paying for my breakfast he said hesitatingly but i never saw a cow before and that one acted as if he was up to mischief i spose theyre a good deal like dogsall right after a feller gets acquainted with em  some cows are ugly i suppose gladys replied reflectively taking snip once more in her arms as the little fellow hung back in alarm when whiteface stopped to gather a tempting bunch of clover but aunt hannah has had this one ever since she was a calf and we two are great friends shes a real wellbehaved cow an never makes any trouble about going into pasture there shes in now and all weve got to do is to put up the bars by the time we get back breakfast will be ready did you walk all the way from the city  there was no necessity for seth to make a reply because at this instant an audacious wren flew past within a dozen inches of snips nose causing him to spring from the girls arms in a vain pursuit which was not ended until the children were at the kitchen door  the morning meal was prepared and as gladys drew out a chair to show seth where he should sit aunt hannah asked anxiously  what does the dog do while you are eating  youll see how well he can behave himself snips master replied proudly as the little fellow laid down on the floor at a respectful distance from the table  much to seths surprise instead of immediately beginning the meal the little woman bowed her head reverentially gladys following the example and for the first time in his life did the boy hear a blessing invoked upon the food of which he was about to partake  it caused him just a shade of uneasiness and perhaps awe this prayin before breakfast as he afterward expressed it while going over the events of the day with snip and he did not feel wholly at ease until the meal had well nigh come to an end  then the little woman gave free rein to her curiosity by asking  where are you going my boy  thats what i dont just know seth replied after a short pause pip smith he said the country was a terrible nice place to live in an when snip an i had to come away i thought perhaps we could find a chance to earn some money  havent you any parents or a home aunt hannah asked in surprise  i dont spose i have i did live over to mr genets in jersey city but he died an i had to hustle for myself  had to what aunt hannah asked  why shinny round for money enough to pay my way there aint much of anything a feller like me can do but sell papers an i dont cut any big ice at that cause i cant get round as fast as the other boys  did you earn enough to provide you with food and clothes an a place to sleep  well sometimes you see i aint flashin up very strong on clothes an snip an i had a room down to mother hydes that cost us eighty cents a week we could most always get along except sometimes when there was a heavy storm an trade turned bad  i suppose you became discouraged with that way of living the little woman said reflectively  well it aint so awful swell but then you cant call it so terrible bad perhaps some time i could have got money enough to start a newsstand an then id been all right you know  why did you come into the country  you see we had to leave mighty sudden cause  seth checked himself he had been very near to explaining exactly why he left new york so unceremoniously perhaps but for the prayers before breakfast he might have told this kindly faced little woman all his troubles now however he did not care to do so believing she would consider he had committed a great crime in passing a lead nickel even though unwittingly  neither was he willing to tell so good a woman an absolute untruth and therefore held his peace but the flush which had come into his cheeks was ample proof to his hostess that in his life was something which caused shame  aunt hannah looked at him for an instant and then as if realizing that the scrutiny might cause him uneasiness turned her eyes away as she asked in a low tone  do you believe it would be possible for you to find such work in the country as would support you and the dog  i dont know anything about it cause you see i never was in the country before seth replied decidedly relieved by this change in the subject of conversation pip smith thought there was milk an pies layin round to be picked up by anybody an accordin to his talk it seemed as if a feller might squeak along somehow if i could always have such a bed as i got last night the rest of it wouldnt trouble a great deal  but you slept in the barn gladys cried  yes it was nicer than any room mother hydes got dont boys like me do something to earn money out this way  the farmers sons find employment enough round home but i dont think you would be able to earn very much my boy  i might strike something seth said reflectively at any rate snip an ill have to keep movin  then you have no idea where youre going and aunt hannah appeared to be distressed in mind  i wish i did seth replied with a sigh and gladys said quickly  you cant keep walkin round all the time for what will you do when it rains  perhaps i might come across a barn sames i did last night  and grow to be a regular tramp  i wouldnt be one if i was willin to work would i thats all snip an me ask for now is just a chance to earn what well eat an a place to sleep  aunt hannah rose from the table quickly in apparently a preoccupied manner and the conversation was thus brought to an abrupt close  snip who had already breakfasted most generously scrambled to his feet for another excursion into the wonderful fields where he might chase butterflies to his hearts content and seth lingered by the open doorway undecided as to what he should say or do  gladys began removing the dishes from the table aunt hannah assisting now and then listlessly as if her mind was far away and after two or three vain efforts seth managed to ask  how much will i have to pay for breakfast an sleepin in the barn  why bless your heart my boy i wouldnt think of chargin anything for that the little woman said almost sharply  but we must pay our way you know though i aint got such a dreadful pile of money i dont want folks to think were regular tramps  you neednt fear anything of that kind yet a while but if it would make you feel more comfortable in mind to do something toward payin for the food which has been freely given you may try your hand at clearin up the barn gladys an i aim to keep it cleanly but even at the best it doesnt look as i would like to see it  seth sat about this task with alacrity although not knowing exactly what ought to be done but the boy who is willing to work and eager to please will generally succeed in his efforts even though he be ignorant as to the proper method  it was while working at that end of the barn nearest the house at a time when aunt hannah and gladys were standing at the open window washing the breakfast dishes that he overheard without absolutely intending to do so a certain conversation not meant for his ears  it is true he had no right to listen and also true that the hum of voices came to his ears several moments before he paid any attention whatsoever or made an effort to distinguish the words  then that which he heard literally forced him to listen for more  it was aunt hannah who said evidently in reply to a suggestion from gladys  it is a pity and a shame to see a child like that poor little lame boy wandering about the country trying to find work when he isnt fitted for anything of the kind but how could we give him a home here my dear  i am sure it wouldnt cost you anything aunt hannah with three spare rooms in the house and hardly ever a visitor to use one of them why couldnt he have a bed here  he can my dear and its my duty to give him a home as i see plainly but you cant imagine what a cross it will be for me to have a boy and a dog around the old place i have lived here alone so many years except after you came that a new face even though it be a friendly one disturbs me  surely youd get used to him in a few days and hes a boy who tries to do all he can in the way of helping  i believe so my dear and therefore because it seems to be my duty im goin to ask him to stay at least until he can find a better home but at the same time i hold that it will be a dreadful cross for me to bear  seth suddenly became aware that he was playing the part of a sneak by thus listening and although eager to hear more turned quickly away busying himself at the opposite side of the barn where it would not be possible to play the eavesdropper in even so slight a degree  until now it had never come into his mind that this little woman whose home was so exceedingly inviting might give him an opportunity to remain even for the space of twentyfour hours but as it was thus suggested he realized how happy both he and snip would be in such a place and believed he could ask for nothing more in this world if it should be his good fortune to have an opportunity to stay  there was little probability the officers of the law would find him here however rigorously the search might be continued and it seemed as if every day spent in such a household must be filled with unalloyed pleasure  he stopped suddenly in his work as the thought came that it had already been decided he should have an invitation to remain and a great joy came into his heart just for an instant after which he forced it back resolutely saying to himself  a feller who would bother a good woman like aunt hannah deserves to be kicked shes made up her mind to give me a chance jest cause she thinks its something that oughter be done but i aint goin to play mean with her its lucky i happened to hear what was said else id have jumped at the chance of stayin when she told me i might  at that moment snip came into the barn eager to be petted by his master and wearied with the fruitless chase after foolish and annoying birds  its tough on you little man cause a home like this is jest what youve been achin for an theyd be awful good to you seth whispered as he took the dog in his arms how would it be if i should sneak off an leave you with em i oughter do it snippey dear but it would most break my heart to give up the only family ive got an thats where im mighty mean youd have a great time here an by stickin to me there aint much show for fun unless things take a terribly sudden turn  snip licked his masters chin by way of reply and seth pressed the little fellow yet more closely saying with what was very like a sob  i cant do it little man i cant do it you must stick to me else ill be the lonesomest feller in all the world well hold on here a spell an then hustle once more it must be well find somebody wholl give us work providin the detectives dont nab me  then he turned his attention once more to the task set him by aunt hannah and snip sat on the threshold of the door watching his master and snapping at the impudent sparrows until gladys came out with an invitation for the dog to escort her to a neighbors house where she was forced to go with a message  ill take good care of him she called to seth as snip ran on joyously in advance and bring him back before you finish sweeping the barn  im not afraid of his comin to any harm while you keep an eye on him but i believe hes beginnin to like you almost bettern he does me seth replied with a shade of sorrow in his tone whereat gladys laughed merrily  then the boy continued his work with a will and ample evidence of his labor was apparent when aunt hannah came out looking very much like the fairy godmothers of once upon a time stories despite the wrinkles on her placid face  it looks very neat she said approvingly i never would have believed a boy could be so handy with a broom last spring i hired william dean the son of a neighbor to tidy up the barn and the yard but it looked worse when he had finished than before  have i earned the breakfast snip and i ate seth asked pleased with her praise  indeed you have child although there was no reason for doing anything of the kind when we share with those who are less fortunate we are doing no more than our duty an i dont like to think that you feel it necessary to pay for a mouthful of food  it was the very nicest breakfast i ever had missmiss  you may call me aunt hannah for im an aunt to all the children in the neighborhood accordin to their way of thinking would you be contented to stay here for a while my dear  indeed i would was the emphatic reply and then seth added remembering the conversation he had overheard that is i would if i could but snip an me have got to hunt for a chance to earn our livin an it wont do to think of loafin here even though it is such a fine place  aunt hannah smiled kindly and said with a certain show of determination as if forcing herself to an unwelcome decision  you an the little dog shall stay for a while my boy and perhaps you can find some kind of work nearabout but if not surely it wont increase my cost of living for well have a garden which is what im not able to attend to now ive grown so old why did you leave the city my child  had it not been for that praying before breakfast seth would have invented some excuse for his flight but now he could not bring himself as he gazed into the kindly eyes either to utter a deliberate falsehood or to make an equivocal reply  id like to tell you he said hesitatingly after a long pause during which aunt hannah looked out across the meadow rather than at him id like to tell you but i cant he repeated  i dont believe you are a bad boy seth she said mildly but without glancing toward him  the lad remained silent with downcast eyes and when it seemed to him as if many minutes had passed the little woman added  perhaps you will tell me after we are better acquainted gladys declares an ive come quite to her way of thinking that you should remain with us for a time i dont believe you could find work such as would pay for your board and lodging unless it was with an old woman like me and so were to consider you and snip as members of the family  seth shook his head feebly at first for the temptation to accept the invitation was very great and then decidedly as if the decision he had arrived at could not be changed  would you rather go away aunt hannah asked in surprise  no i wouldnt seth cried passionately the tears coming dangerously near his eyelids id do anything in this world for the sake of havin such a home as this but all the same snip an i cant stay to bother you well leave when he comes back  listen to me my child and now the little woman spoke with a degree of firmness which sounded strangely from one so mild you are not to go away this day no matter what may be done later we will talk about my plan after dinner and then perhaps youll feel like explaining why you think it necessary to go further in search of work after i have given you a chance to earn what you and the dog may need  then gladys voice was heard in the distance as she urged snip on in his pursuit of a butterfly and aunt hannah went quickly into the dwelling leaving seth gazing after her wistfully as he muttered  i never believed there was such a good woman in this world     chapter iv  the flight   neither gladys nor snip came into the barn immediately after their return probably because the former had some report to make as to the message with which she had been entrusted and seth was left alone to turn over in his mind all that aunt hannah had said  a very disagreeable half hour he spent in the conflict between what he believed to be his duty and his inclination  it seemed that all his troubles would be at an end if he might remain in that peaceful place as the little woman had suggested and he knew full well that he could never hope to find as pleasant an abiding place  as the matter presented itself to his mind he was not at liberty to accept the generous invitation unless the story of why he left new york was first told and once aunt hannah was aware that he had transgressed the law by passing counterfeit money it seemed certain she would look upon him as a sinner too great for pardon  he believed it was better to go without explanations than be utterly cast off by the little woman whom he was rapidly beginning to love and in addition forfeit her friendship forever so long as she could only guess at the reasons for his flight she might think of him kindly and perhaps in time he would be able to prove that he was worthy of confidence  ill come back when im a man an then shell have to believe i didnt mean to do anything so terrible bad when i passed the lead nickel he said to himself in an effort to strengthen the resolution just made it would be mighty nice to live here an what a good time snip could have  then he tried to convince himself that his pet should be left behind but the thought of going away from that charming homewhich might have been his but for the carelessness in handling the counterfeit moneyleaving behind the only friend he had known for many a long day brought the tears to his eyes again  ill have to take the poor little man with me an itll come mighty rough on him he said with a sob i reckon he thinks this kind of fun when he can chase butterflies an birds to his hearts content is goin to last an hell be dreadfully disappointed after we leave but i couldnt get along without him  gladys interrupted his mournful train of thought and perhaps it was well for the boy was rapidly working himself into a most melancholy frame of mind  she and snip came tearing into the barn as if there was no other aim in this life than enjoyment and so startled the sorrowing seth that he arose to his feet in something very nearly resembling alarm  if you jump like that i shall begin to think you are as nervous as aunt hannah she cried with a merry laugh she insists that between snip and me there will no longer be any peace for her unless we sober down very suddenly but do you know seth that ive lived here with no other companion than the dear old woman so long it seems as if some good fairy had sent this little fluff of white to make me happy i had rather have him for a friend than all the children in the neighborhood which isnt saying very much in view of the fact that the two dean boys and malvinia stubbs are the only people of nearabout my age in this section of the country  i believe snip thinks as much of you as you do of him seth replied gloomily i never knew him to make friends with any one before but perhaps that was because he saw only the fellers who liked to tease him if i wasnt mighty mean hed stay here all the time  of course hell stay gladys cried as she tossed the tiny dog in the air while he gave vent to an imitation growl aunt hannah and i have arranged it without so much as asking your permission you two are to live here snips work is to enjoy himself with me while youre to make a garden the like of which wont be seen this side of new york what do you think of settling down to being a farmer  id like it mighty well but it cant be done and seth gazed out through the open door not daring to meet miss gladys startled gaze  wait till youve talked with aunt hannah she exclaimed after the first burst of surprise had passed weve fixed everything an youll find that there isnt a word for you to say  i have talked with her seth replied gloomily wed both love to stay mighty well but we cant  id like to know why and now gladys was on her feet looking sternly at the sorrowful guest neither you nor snip have got a home an heres one with the best woman who ever livedthat much i know to a certainty  i believe you but it cant be done and the boy walked to the other side of the barn as if to end the conversation  gladys looked after him for a moment in mingled surprise and petulance and then taking snip in her arms she walked straight into the house leaving him seemingly more alone than ever  during the remainder of the forenoon neither aunt hannah gladys nor snip came out of the door and then the little woman summoned him to dinner  seth entered the house much as a miserable culprit might have done and after making a toilet at the kitchen sink sat down at the table in obedience to aunt hannahs instructions  this time he half expected she would pray and was not mistaken not having been taken by surprise he heard every word and his cheeks crimsoned with mingled shame and pleasure as she asked her heavenly father to bless and guide the homeless stranger who had come to them inclining his heart to the right path  aunt hannah did not use many words in asking the blessing but to seth each one was full of a meaning which could not be mistaken and he knew she was pleading that he might be willing to confess his sins  perhaps if the good woman had asked at the conclusion of the prayer why he left new york seth would have told her everything but no word was spoken on the subject and by the time dinner had come to an end he was more firmly convinced than ever that she could not forgive him for having passed the counterfeit money  nothing was said regarding his departure or the proposition that he should become a member of the household but gladys gave the outlines of a journey she proposed making with snip that afternoon and the heavyhearted boy understood that it was not her purpose to return until nightfall  then aunt hannah asked if he felt equal to the task of spading up a small piece of ground behind the barn where she counted on making a garden and he could do no less than agree to undertake the task  therefore did it seem to him as if he was in duty bound to remain at the farm during the remainder of that day at least but there was in his mind the fact that he must continue his aimless journey that very night or be willing to give a detailed account of his wrongdoing  immediately after the meal had been brought to a close seth went out with the little woman to begin the work of making ready for a garden  when she had explained what was necessary to be done he labored at the task with feverish energy for it seemed to him as if the task must be concluded before he would be at liberty to leave the farm and go he must because each moment was it becoming more nearly impossible to bring himself to confess why he and snip were fugitives  some of the neighbors called upon aunt hannah that afternoon therefore she was forced to leave him alone after having described what must be done in order to make a garden of the unpromising looking land behind the barn and he knew that gladys and snip would not return until time for supper because the girl had plainly given him to understand as much during the conversation at the dinnertable  his hands were blistered and his back ached because of the unaccustomed labor but the work was completed to the best of his ability before sunset and then aunt hannah found time to inspect the result of his toil  i declare you have done as well as any man i could have hired an a good deal better than some she exclaimed and a flush of joy overspread seths face as he arose with difficulty from the grass where he had thrown himself for a muchneeded rest william dean tried to do the same thing but when he had finished the ground looked as if it had no more than been teased with a comb you have turned it up till it is the same as ploughed an well have a famous garden even though it is a bit late in the season  im glad you like it the boy replied of course i could do such work quicker after id tried my hand at it two or three times  i didnt expect youd more than half finish it in one day an now theres nothing to be done but put in the seeds well see to that in the morning i must go after whiteface now or we shall have a late supper have you seen anything of gladys  she hasnt been here say why cant i get the cow  i suppose you might for shes gentle as a kitten but you must be tired  i reckon it wont hurt me to walk from here to the pasture and seth started off at full speed delighted with the opportunity to perform yet more work for there was in his mind the thought that aunt hannah would think kindly of him after he was gone if he showed himself willing to do whatsoever came in his way  it did not seem exactly safe to walk deliberately up to that enormous beast of a cow but since gladys had done so he advanced without any great show of fear and was surprised at discovering that she willingly obeyed the pressure on her horns  he led her into the cleanly barn threw some hay into the manger and then fastened the chain around her neck all the while wondering at his own bravery  is there anything more for me to do he asked as aunt hannah came out of the house with the threelegged stool and the glistening tin pail  youve earned a rest my dear the little woman said cheerily sit down on the front porch and enjoy the sensation which comes to every one who has done a good days work we poor people can have what rich folks cant or dont which amounts to much the same thing  seth did not avail himself of this permission but stood on the threshold of the tieup watching the little woman force out the big streams of milk without apparent effort until the desire to successfully perform the same task was strong upon him  dont you think i could do that he asked timidly  i dare say you might my child there isnt much of a knack to it  would you be willin to let me try  of course you shall and aunt hannah got up quickly from the stool be gentle and youll have no trouble  seth failed at first but after a few trials he was able to extract a thin stream of the foaming fluid although whiteface did not appear well pleased with his experiments  then aunt hannah took the matter in hand and when she had finished seth carried the pail for her arriving at the kitchen just as gladys and snip entered both seemingly weary with their afternoons frolic  bread baked that forenoon and warm milk made up the evening meal and again aunt hannah prayed for the stranger much to his secret satisfaction  while they were at the table the little woman said in a low tone of authority such as did not seem suited to her lips  you are to stay here until morning seth and then we will have another talk im an oldfashioned old maid an believe in early to bed an early to rise therefore we dont light lamp or candle in the summertime unless some of the neighbors loiter later than usual you are to sleep in the room over the kitchen my boy and when we have finished supper i guess youll be glad to lie down for spading up a piece of grass land isnt easy work  understanding from these remarks that he was expected to retire without delay seth took snip in his arms immediately the meal had come to a close and said as he stood waiting to be shown the way to his room  youve been mighty good to us missaunt hannah an i hope well have a chance to pay you back some day  youve done that this afternoon gladys cried laughingly aunt hannah has wanted that garden spot spaded ever since the snow went away and the boys around here were too lazy to do it all hands including snip will have a share in the planting and i wouldnt be surprised if we beat our neighbors even though it is late for such work  seth would have liked to take leave of these two who had been so kind to him for he was still determined to leave the house secretly as soon as was possible but he did not dare say all that was in his mind lest his purpose be betrayed and followed aunt hannah as she led the way to the room above the kitchen  you wont forget to say your prayers she said kissing him goodnight an act which brought the tears to his eyes and seth shook his head by way of promise although never did he remember having done such a thing  after undressing and when snip had been provided with a comfortable bed in the cushioned rockingchair seth attempted to do as he had promised and found it an exceedingly difficult task there was in his heart both thanksgiving and sorrow but he could not give words to either and after several vain efforts he said reverentially  i hope aunt hannah will have just as snifty a time in this world as she deserves for shes a dandy if there ever was one  then he crept between the lavenderscented sheets and gave himself up to the pleasure of gazing at his surroundings  never before had he seen such a room so comfortinviting and cleanly there were two regular pillows on the bed and each of them enclosed in a snowy white case which was most pleasing to the cheek while the fragrant sheets seemed much too fine to be slept on  snip was quite as well satisfied with the surroundings as his master the chair cushion was particularly soft and he curled himself into a little ring with a sigh of content which told that if the question of leaving the morse farm might be decided by him he and his master would remain there all their lives  weary as seth was he found it exceedingly difficult to prevent his eyes from closing in slumber yet sleep was a luxury he could not indulge in at that time lest he should not awaken at an hour when he might leave the dwelling without arousing the other inmates  perhaps it would have been wiser had he not undressed himself but the temptation of getting into such a bed as aunt hannah had provided for his benefit was greater than he could withstand therefore must he be exceedingly careful not to venture even upon the border of dreamland  it is needless to make any attempt at trying to describe seths condition of mind for it may readily be understood that his grief was great more than once did he say to himself it would be better to tell aunt hannah all but each time he understood or believed he did that by such a course he should not only be cutting himself off from all possibility of remaining longer at the farm but would be forfeiting her friendship  to his mind he would be forced to leave the farm if he told the story and he could not remain without doing so therefore it seemed wisest to run away thus avoiding a most painful scene  then came the time when his eyelids rebelled against remaining open and in order to save himself from falling asleep it seemed necessary to get out of bed  crouching by the window after having dressed himself he gazed out over the broad fields that were bathed by the moonlight and pictured to himself the pleasure of viewing them night after night with the knowledge that they formed a portion of his home and then such a revery being almost painful he nerved himself for what was to be done by taking snip in his arms the dog was sleeping soundly and seth whispered in a voice which was far from being steady  its too bad old man but we cant help ourselves youll be sorry not to see gladys when you wake but you wont feel half so bad as i shall cause i know what a slim chance there is of our ever strikin another place like this  then he opened the door softly still holding snip in his arms  not a sound could be heard he crept to the head of the stairs and listened intently  it was as if he and snip were the only occupants of the house seth had no very clear idea as to how long he had been in the chamber but it seemed as if at least two hours had passed since aunt hannah bade him goodnight and there was no reason why he should not begin the flight at once  with his hand on snips head as a means of preventing the dog from growling in case any unusual sound was heard seth began the descent of the stairs creeping from one to the other with the utmost caution while the boards creaked and groaned under his weight until it seemed certain both aunt hannah and gladys must be aroused  in trying to move yet more cautiously he staggered against the stairrail squeezing snip until the little fellow yelped sharply and seth stood breathlessly awaiting some token that the mistress of the house had been alarmed  he was surprised because of hearing nothing it appeared strange that any one could sleep while he was making such a noise and yet the silence was as profound as before he began to descend  never had he believed a flight of stairs could be so long and when it seemed as if he should be at the bottom he had hardly gotten more than halfway down  the descent came to an end however as must all things in this world and he groped his way toward the kitchen door not so much as daring to breathe  once he fancied it was possible to distinguish a slight rustling sound but when he stopped all was silent as before therefore the fugitive went on until his hand was on the kitchen door  the key was turned noiselessly in the lock he raised the latch and the door swung open with never a creak  the moonlight flooded that portion of the kitchen where he stood irresolute as if even now believing it might be better to confess why he had been forced to come away from new york and as he turned his head ever so slightly to listen a sudden fear came upon him  he saw not more than half a dozen paces distant a human form advancing a cry of fear burst from his lips and he would have leaped out of the open door but that a gentle pressure on his shoulder restrained him  where are you going my child a kindly voice asked and he knew that what he had mistaken for an apparition was none other than aunt hannah  seth could not speak his mouth had suddenly become parched and his knees trembled beneath him he had been discovered while seemingly prowling around the house like a thief and on the instant he realized in what way his actions might be misconstrued  where are you going seth dear  i wasnti had to run away aunt hannah an thats the truth of it he cried passionately suddenly recovering the use of his tongue  why didnt you tell me at suppertime  i was afraid you and gladys would try to stop me an perhaps i couldnt stick to what id agreed on  do you really want to leave us seth  indeed i dont aunt hannah id give anything in this world if i could stay for this is the very nicest place i ever was in oh indeed i dont want to go away  then why not stay  i cant i cant cause id have to tell  seth did not finish the sentence but buried his face in snips silky hair  is it because you cant tell me why you left the city and the little woman laid her hand on the boys shoulder with a motion not unlike a caress  seth nodded but did not trust himself to speak  then go right back to bed you shall stay here my dear until the time comes when you can confide in me and meanwhile i will not believe you have been guilty of any wickedness     chapter v  an accident   filled with shame and confusion seth made no resistance when aunt hannah ordered him back to bed but obeyed silently moving stealthily as when he began the flight he was trembling as with a sudden chill when he undressed and laid himself down while snip lost no time in curling his tiny body into a good imitation of a ball wondering perhaps why he had thus been needlessly disturbed in his beauty sleep  seth was no longer capable of speculating upon the problem in which he had been involved through a lead nickel and an advertisement in the newspapers he could only realize that aunt hannah had good reason to believe him a thief or worse otherwise she would not have been waiting to discover if he attempted to prowl around the house while she was supposed to be asleep and his cheeks burned with shame at the thought  he wished that the night might never come to an end and then he would not be forced to meet her face to face as he must when the sun rose  of course shell tell gladys where she found me an both of em will believe im the worst feller that ever lived he whispered to himself and then tears bitter and scalding flowed down his cheeks moistening the spotless linen but bringing some slight degree of comfort because sleep quickly followed in their train  seth was awakened next morning by aunt hannahs voice as she called gently  its time to get up my dear the sun is out looking for boys an dogs an you mustnt disappoint him  snip ran eagerly down the stairs as if to greet some one for whom he had a great affection and seth heard the little woman say to him  i really believe gladys was in the right when she said i would come to like you almost as much as if you were a cat do you want a saucer of milk  she wont talk so pleasantly when i get there seth said to himself id rather take a sound flogging than have her look at me as if i was a thief  the lad soon came to know aunt hannah better than to accuse her of being cruel even in the slightest degree  when he entered the kitchen she greeted him with a kindly smile and said much as if the events of the previous night were no more than a disagreeable dream  you see im beginning to depend on you already seth gladys isnt up yet and ive left whiteface in the barn thinkin youd take her to the pasture the grass is wet with dew an im gettin so old that i dont dare take the chances of wetting my feet  seth did not wait to make his toilet but ran swiftly to the barn rejoicing because of the opportunity to perform some task  when the cow had been cared for he loitered around outside picking up a stick here and a stone there as if it was of the highest importance that the lawn in front of the house be freed from litter of every kind before breakfast  his one desire was to avoid coming face to face with aunt hannah until it should be absolutely necessary and while he was thus inventing work gladys came out in search of snip  seth understood at once that the girl was yet ignorant of his attempt to run away and his heart swelled with gratitude toward the little woman who had thus far kept secret what he would have been ashamed to tell  just then snip was of far more importance in the eyes of aunt hannahs niece than was his master and after a hasty goodmorning she ran away with the dog at her heels for the accustomed exercise before breakfast  come in an wash your face my dear breakfast will be cooked by the time you are ready to eat it and such work as you are doing may as well be left until a more convenient season  seth felt forced to obey this summons promptly but he did not dare meet the little womans glance had he observed her closely however it would have been seen that she studiously avoided looking toward him aunt hannah was averse to causing pain even to the brutes which came in her way and at this particular time she understood very much of what was in the boys mind  seth feared lest in the prayer before breakfast some reference might be made to what he had attempted to do during the night but his fears were groundless the little woman asked that her fathers blessing might fall upon the homeless but the words were spoken in the same fervent kindly tone as on the evening previous and again the boy thanked her in his heart  when the morning meal had come to an end gladys was eager seth should join her and snip on an excursion through the grove where squirrels were said to be thick as peas and under almost any other circumstances the guest would have been delighted to accept the invitation but now he insisted that there was very much work to be done before nightfall which would force him to remain near the house  weve only to plant the garden aunt hannah interrupted an then theres no reason why you shouldnt enjoy a stroll among the trees  seth remained silent but determined to do all in his power to atone for what seemed to him very nearly a crime and gladys decided that she must also take part in the sowing of the seeds  until noon the three with snip as a most interested spectator worked industriously and then as aunt hannah said there was nothing to be done save wait patiently until the sun and the rain had performed their portion of the task  seth did not join gladys and snip in their afternoon romp but continued at his selfimposed tasks until night had come doing quite as much work with his mind as his hands twenty times over he resolved to tell the little woman exactly why he was forced to run away from new york and as often decided he could not confess himself such a criminal as it seemed certain because of the advertisement he really was  i couldnt stand it to have her look at me after she knew everything he repeated again and again  there was no idea in his mind as to how the matter might end save when now and then he had the faintest of faint hopes that perhaps she might forget or learn the truth from some one other than himself  during three days he struggled between what he knew to be duty and his own inclination and in all that time the little woman never showed by word or look that there was any disagreeable secret between them  seth tried to ease his conscience by working most industriously during every moment of daylight and then came the time when it was absolutely impossible to find anything more for his hands to do he had swept the barn floor until it was as clean as a broom could make it the wood in the shed had been piled methodically a goodly supply of kindlings were prepared and not so much as a pebble was to be seen on the velvety lawn  gladys had tried in vain to entice him away from what she declared was useless labor and snip did all within the power of a dog to coax his master into joining him in the jolly strolls among the trees or across the green fields and yet seth remained nearabout the little house in a feverish search for something with which to employ his hands  its no use snippey dear he said on the fourth night of his stay at the farm after the family had retired i cant stay an not tell aunt hannah an its certain we wont be allowed to stop moren a minute after she knows the truth if i could talk to her in the dark when i couldnt see her face it wouldnt seem quite so bad but we go to bed so early theres no chance for that we must have it out mighty soon for i cant hang round here many hours longer without tellin all about ourselves  he was not ready for bed although an hour had passed since he bade aunt hannah and gladys goodnight  the moon had gilded the rail fence the shed and the barn until they were transformed into fairy handiwork the road gleamed like gold with an enamel of black marking the position of trees and bushes and seth had gazed upon the wondrous picture without really being aware of times flight  having repeated to snip that which was in his mind the boy was on the point of making himself ready for a visit from the dream elves when he heard apparently from the room below what sounded like a fall a smothered exclamation and the splintering of glass  only for a single instant did he stand motionless and then realizing that some accident must have happened he ran downstairs snip following close behind barking shrilly  once in the kitchen an exclamation of terror burst from his lips  the room was illumined by a line of fire seemingly extending entirely across the floor which was fringed by a dense smoke that rose nearly to the ceiling and beside the table where she had evidently fallen lay aunt hannah struggling to smother with bare hands the yellow dancing flames that had fastened upon her clothing  it needed not the fragments of glass and brass to tell seth that the little woman had accidentally fallen breaking the lamp she carried and that the fire was fed by oil  like a flash there came into his mind the memory of that night when dud wilson overturned a lamp on the floor of his newsstand and he had heard it said then that the property might have been saved if the boys had smothered the flames with their coats or any fabric of woollen instead of trying to drown it out with water  he pulled off his coat in a twinkling threw it over the prostrate woman and added to the covering rag rugs from the floor pressing them down firmly as he said in a trembling voice much as though speaking to a child  dont get scared we cant put the fire out with water but ill soon smother it  you neednt bother about me my child but attend to the house it would be dreadful if we should lose the dear old home  ill get the best of this business in a jiffy but it wont do to give you a chance of bein burned  there is no fire here now and aunt hannah threw back the rugs despite seths hold upon them to show that the flames were really quenched for mercys sake save the house its the only home i ever knew an my heart would be wellnigh broken if i lost it  before she had ceased speaking seth was flinging rug after rug on the burning oil for aunt hannah like many another woman living in the country had an ample supply of such floor coverings  not until he had entirely covered that line of flame and had danced to and fro over the rugs to stamp out the last spark of fire did he venture to open the outside door and it was high time for the pungent smoke filled the kitchen until it was exceedingly difficult to breathe  the little woman remained upon the floor where seth had first found her and it was only after the night breeze was blowing through the room carrying off the stifling vapor that the boy had time to wonder why she made no effort to rise  are you hurt he cried anxiously running to her side  never mind me until the fire is out  there is no more fire an im bound to mind you are you hurt  it doesnt seem possible my dear an yet i cant use either ankle or wrist of course the bones are not broken but old people like me dont fall harmlessly as do children  seth was more alarmed now than when he saw the flames of the burning oil threatening the destruction of the building and he dumbly wondered why gladys did not make her appearance  the first excitement was over and now he had time in which to be frightened  what can i do oh what can i do he cried running to and fro and then hardly aware of his movements he shouted loudly for gladys  dont waken her aunt hannah cried warningly if you cant help me there is nothing she can do  aint she in the house seth asked nervously  he feared aunt hannah might die and even though she was in no real danger to stand idly by not knowing how to aid her was terrible  he failed to observe that snip was no longer in the room but just at that moment his shrill barking was heard in an adjoining apartment and seth knew the dog had gone to find his little playmate  you mustnt get frightened after the danger is all over my dear aunt hannah said soothingly but for you the house would have been destroyed and now we have nothing to fear  but you cant get up seth wailed  that wouldnt be a great misfortune compared with losing our home even if i never got up again the little woman said quietly but im not going to lie here surely you can help me on to the couch  tell me how to do it seth cried eagerly and at that moment gladys appeared in the doorway  lean over so that i may put my arms around your neck aunt hannah said giving no heed to the girls cry of alarm  she fell an hurt herself seth said hurriedly to gladys as he obeyed the little womans injunction and then as the latter put her uninjured arm over his neck he tried to aid the movement by clasping her waist  if you can help me just a little bit well soon have her on the couch he cried to gladys who by this time was standing at his side  aunt hannah was a tiny woman and the children small though they were did not find it an exceedingly difficult task to raise her bodily from the floor  then gladys lighted a lamp and it was seen that in addition to the injuries received by the fall aunt hannah had been grievously burned  yes im in some pain she said in reply to seths anxious questioning but now that the house has been saved i have no right to complain get some flour gladys and while you are putting it on the worst of the burns perhaps seth will run over to mrs dean an ask if she can come here a few minutes  where does mis dean live the lad asked hurriedly starting toward the door and he was already outside when gladys replied  its the first house past the grove where snip and i went this afternoon  seth gave no heed to his lameness as he ran at full speed down the road the thought that now was the time when he might in some slight degree repay aunt hannah for having given shelter to him and snip lending speed to his feet  the dean family had not yet retired when he arrived at the farmhouse and stopping only sufficiently long to tell in fewest possible words of what had happened seth ran back to help gladys care for the invalid for he was feverishly eager to have some part in the nursing  aunt hannah was on the couch with her wounds partially bandaged when the boy returned and although her suffering must have been severe that placid face was as serene as when he bade her goodnight  mis dean is comin right away what can i do  nothing more my dear the little woman replied quietly you have been of such great service to me this night that i can never repay you  please dont say that aunt hannah seth cried his face flushing with shame as he remembered the past if i could only do somethin real big then perhaps you wouldnt think i was so awful bad  i believe you to be a good boy seth and shall until you tell me to the contrary even then she added with a smile i fancy it will be possible to find a reasonable excuse  the arrival of mrs dean put an end to any further conversation and seth was called upon to aid in carrying aunt hannah to the foreroom in which was the best bed although the little woman protested against anything of the kind  i am as well off in my own bed sarah dean dont treat me as if i was a child who didnt know what was best  you are goin into the foreroom hannah morse an thats all there is about it that bed hasnt been used since the year your brother benjamin was at home an ive always said that if anything happened to you an i had charge of affairs you should get some comfort out of the feathers you earned pickin berries well take her into the foreroom boy for its the most cheerful an she deserves the best thats goin  you can bet she does seth exclaimed with great emphasis and then he gave all his attention to obeying the many commands which issued from mrs deans mouth  when the little woman had been disposed of according to her neighbors ideas of comfort seth was directed to build a fire in the kitchen stove gladys received instructions to bring all the old linen to be found and snip was ordered into the shed  aunt hannah protested vehemently against this last order with the result that the dog was banished to gladys chamber and then mrs dean proceeded to attend to the invalid without giving her a voice in any matter however nearly it might concern herself  seth took up his station in the kitchen when other neighbors arrived summoned most likely by mr dean and here gladys joined him after what had seemed to the boy a very long time  how is she he asked when the girl came softly into the room as if thinking he might be asleep  her hands and arms are burned very badly why seth there are blisters as big as my hand and mrs dean says she suffers terribly but the dear old woman hasnt made the least little complaint  thats cause shes so good if i was like her i neednt bother my head bout what was goin to happen after i died it would be a funny kind of an angel who wasnt glad to see aunt hannah  shed have burned to death but for you  that aint so gladys i didnt do very much cept throw the rugs an my coat over her  shes just been telling mrs dean that you saved her life and the house  did she really seth cried excitedly did she say it in them very same words  aunt hannah made it sound a good deal better than i can she said god sent you to this house to help her in the time of trouble an shes goin to see that you always have a home here  wasnt she kinder out of her head seth asked quickly ive heard mother hyde say that folks got crazylike when they ached pretty bad  aunt hannah knew every word she was saying and its true that she might have burned to death if you hadnt been in the house for i never heard a thing till snippey came into my room barking  i hope i did do as much but it dont seem jest true  dont you think the house would have burned if some one hadnt put out the fire very quickly  perhaps so cause the flames jumped up mighty high  and since she couldnt move wouldnt she have been burned to death  i hope so  why seth barrows how wicked you are  no no gladys i didnt mean i hoped shed have burned to death but i hoped i really an truly saved her life cause then she wont jump down on me so hard when i tell her  tell her what  why snip an i had to run away from new york  is it something youre ashamed of gladys asked quickly and in surprise  seth nodded while the flush of shame crept up into his cheeks  gladys gazed at him earnestly while one might have counted ten and then said speaking slowly and distinctly  i dont believe it aunt hannah says youre the best boy she ever saw an she knows  did aunt hannah tell you that or are you tryin to stuff me and seth rose to his feet excitedly  i hope you dont think id tell a lie  of course i dont gladys but if you only knew how much it means to meaunt hannahs sayin what you claim she didthere wouldnt be any wonder i had hard work to believe it  she said to me those very same words  what ones  that you was the best boy she ever saw an it was only yesterday afternoon when you were splitting kindling wood that she said it  then suddenly to gladys intense surprise seth dropped his head on his arm and burst into a flood of tears     chapter vi  sunshine   mrs dean had taken entire charge of the invalid and the house and so many of the neighbors insisted on aiding her that gladys and seth were pushed aside as if they had been strangers  at midnight when one of the volunteer nurses announced that aunt hannah was resting as comfortably as could be expected under the circumstances gladys in obedience to mrs deans peremptory command went to bed but seth positively refused to leave the kitchen  somethin that i could do might turn up an i count on bein ready for it he said when the neighbor urged him to lie down snip an ill stay here an if we get sleepy whats to hinder our takin a nap on the couch  so eager was the boy for an opportunity to serve aunt hannah that he resolutely kept his eyes open during the remainder of the night lest the volunteer nurses should fail to waken him if his services were needed and to accomplish this he made frequent excursions out of doors where the wind swept the sand from his eyes  with the first light of dawn he set about effacing so far as might be possible all traces of fire from the kitchen and was washing the floor when mrs dean came out from the foreroom  well i do declare she exclaimed in surprise hannah morse said you was a handy boy round the house but this is a little moren i expected i wish my william could take a few lessons from you  i didnt count on gettin the floor very clean seth replied modestly but secretly delighted with the unequivocal praise if the oil and smut is taken off itll be easier to put things into shape  youre doin wonderfully my boy an when i tell hannah morse shell be pleased cause a speck of dirt anywhere about the house does fret her mortally bad  seth did not venture to look up lest mrs dean should see the joy in his eyes for to his mind the good woman could do him no greater service than give the invalid an account of his desire to be useful in the household  is aunt hannah burned very much he asked as the nurse set about making herself a cup of tea  i allow itll be a full month before she gets around again at first i was afraid shed broken some bones but mrs stubbs declares its only a bad sprain it seems that she had a headache an came for the camphor bottle when she slipped an fell against the table the wonder to me is that this house wasnt burned to the ground  then mrs dean questioned seth as to himself and his reasons for coming into the country in search of work but the boy did not consider it necessary to give any more information than pleased him although the good woman was most searching in her inquiries  then gladys entered the kitchen and the two children made preparations for breakfast after seth had brought to an end his selfimposed task of washing the floor  mr dean came over to milk whiteface and seth insisted that he be allowed to try his hand at the work claiming that if aunt hannah was to be a helpless invalid during a full month as mrs dean had predicted it was absolutely necessary he be able to care for the cow  the old adage that a willing pupil is an apt one was verified in this case for the lad succeeded so well in his efforts that mr dean declared it would not be necessary for him to come to the morse farm again so far as caring for the cow was concerned  very proud was seth when he brought the pail of foaming milk into the kitchen with the announcement that he had done nearly all the work and gladys ran to tell aunt hannah what she considered exceedingly good news  during the next two days either mrs dean or mrs stubbs ruled over the morse household by virtue of their supposed rights as nurses and in all this time seth had not been allowed to see the invalid  gladys visited the foreroom from time to time reporting that aunt hannah was doing as well as could be expected and seth had reason to believe the little womans suffering would now abate unless some unexpected change in her condition prevented  the neighbors sent newspapers and books for gladys to read to her aunt during such moments as she was able to listen and while the girl was thus employed seth busied himself in the kitchen taking great pride in keeping every article neat and cleanly as aunt hannah herself would have done  then came the hour which the boy had been looking forward to with mingled hope and fear he had fully decided to tell all his story to the little woman who had been so kind to him and was resolved that the unpleasant task should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity  it was nearly noon the good neighbors were at their own homes for a brief visit and gladys came from the foreroom where she had been reading the daily paper aloud saying to seth  aunt hannah thinks i ought to run out of doors a little while because i have stayed in the house so long there isnt the least bit of need but i must go else shell worry herself sick she says you can sit with her an ill take snippey with me for hes needing fresh air more than i am  just for a moment seth hesitated the time had come when he must if ever carry his good resolutions into effect and there was little doubt in his mind but that aunt hannah would insist upon his leaving the farm without delay once she knew all his wickedness  gladys did not give him very much time for reflection with snip at her heels she hurried down the road and seth knew he must not leave the invalid alone many moments  aunt hannahs eyes were open when he entered the foreroom and but for that fact he might almost have believed she was dead so pale was her face the bandaged hands were outside the coverings and seth had been told that she could not move them unaided except at the cost of most severe pain  i knew you would be forced to come when gladys went out and that was why i sent her we twoyou an ineed to have a quiet chat together and there is little opportunity unless we are alone in the house  seths face was flushed crimson he believed aunt hannah had come to the conclusion that he must not be allowed to remain at the farm any longer unless he confessed why it had been necessary to leave new york and his one desire was to speak before she should be able to make a demand  i oughter  he stammered and stopped unable to begin exactly as he desired and the little woman said quietly but in a tone which told that the words came from her heart  you have saved the old home an my life as well seth even if i had hesitated at making you one of the family i could not do so now after owing you so much  dont talk like that aunt hannah dont tell bout what you owe me seth cried tearfully its the other way an snip an i are mighty lucky if for no other reason than that weve seen you wait a minute he pleaded as the invalid was about to speak ever since you got hurt ive wanted to tell everything you asked the other day an i promised snip an myself that id do it the very first chance if it  there is no need of your tellin me my child unless you really think it necessary i have no doubts as to your honesty and truly hope that your wanderings are over  we shall have to go but im bound to tell the truth now cause i know you think i was tryin to steal somethin when we were only goin to run away sos you wouldnt know what ive done  my dear boy and aunt hannah vainly tried to raise her head i never thought for a single minute that you came downstairs for any other purpose than to leave the house secretly  an thats jest the truth now dont say a word till ive told you all about it an please not look at me  then speaking hurriedly lest she should interrupt him in what was an exceedingly difficult task seth told of the advertisement of the counterfeit money he had unwittingly passed and of his flight aided by teddy and tim  i didnt mean to do it he concluded amid his sobs but i reckon id tried to get rid of it some time cause i couldnt afford to lose so much money of course theyll put me in jail if the detectives catch me an if i should be locked up for ever so many years wont you let gladys take care of poor little snippey  come here an kiss me seth aunt hannah said softly i wish i could put my hand on your head and youve been frightened out of your wits because of that counterfeit nickel she added when he had obeyed you poor little child if you had told me your troubles would soon have come to an end but you must understand that in this world the only honest course is to atone for your faults rather than run away from them the good book says that your sins shall find you out and it is true my dear as true as is every word that has come to us from god but im not allowin that you have committed any grievous sin in this matter do you know gladys read your story in the paper before i sent her for a walk and that is why i wanted to be alone with you  seth looked up in surprise which was almost bewilderment and aunt hannah continued with a bright smile that was like unto the sunshine after a shower  take up the newspaper lying on the table i told gladys to fold it so you might find the article i wanted you to read  seth did as she directed but without glancing at the printed sheet  can you read dear  not very well cause i have to spell out the big words  hold it before my eyes while i make the attempt there isnt very much of a story but it will mean a great deal to you i hope  seth was wholly at a loss to understand the little womans meaning but he did as she directed and listened without any great show of enthusiasm to the following      messrs symonds  symonds the wellknown attorneys of pine     street are willing to confess that they are not well informed     regarding the character of the average newsboy of this city and     by such ignorance have defeated their own ends several days ago     the gentlemen were notified by a professional brother in san     francisco that a client of his lately deceased had bequeathed to     one seth barrows the sum of five thousand dollars all the     information that could be given concerning the heir was that he     had been living with a certain family in jersey city and was now     believed to be selling newspapers in this city his age was stated     as about eleven years and he owed his good fortune to the fact     that the dead man was his uncle      it is not a simple matter to find any particular street merchant     in new york city but messrs symonds  symonds began their search     by advertising in the newspapers for the lad as has been since     learned the friends of the young heir saw the notice which had     been inserted by the attorneys and straightway believed the lad     was wanted because of some crime committed the boy himself must     have had a guilty conscience for he fled without delay carrying     with him into exile a small white terrier his only worldly     possession the moral of this incident is that when you want to     find a boy of the streets be careful to state exactly why you     desire to see him otherwise the game may give you the slip rather     than take chances of being brought face to face with the officers     of the law  it was not until aunt hannah had concluded that seth appeared to understand he was the boy referred to and then he asked excitedly  do you suppose the seth barrows told about there can be me  of course my dear isnt this your story just as you have repeated it to me  but there isnt anybody whod leave me so much money as that aunt hannah theres a big mistake somewhere  do you remember of ever hearing that you had an uncle in california  indeed i dont i thought snip was all the relation i had in the world  why did the man in jersey city allow you to live with him  i dont know i had pretty good clothes then an didnt have to work cause i was too small  well the little woman said with a sigh as if the exertion of talking had wearied her i dont pretend to be able to straighten out the snarl but im certain you are the boy spoken of in the newspaper story for it isnt reasonable to suppose that two lads of the same age have lately run away from new york because of an advertisement the money must be yours my dear and instead of being a homeless wanderer youre quite a wealthy gentleman  i wouldnt take the chances of goin to see about it seth said thoughtfully cause what weve read may be only a trap to catch me  now dont be too suspicious my dear im not countin on your going into that wicked city just yet ive sent for nathan dean an you may be sure hell get at the bottom of the matter for hes a master hand at such work  then mrs dean entered to take up her duties of nurse once more and seth went into the barn where he could be alone to think over the strange turn which his affairs appeared to be taking  gladys joined him half an hour later and asked abruptly  what did aunt hannah say to you  why do you think she counted on talkin to me  because i read that story in the newspaper then she wanted me to go out for a walk and said id better ask mr dean to come over this afternoon i couldnt help knowing it was about you but didnt say anything to her because mrs dean thinks she oughtnt to be excited did you tell her why you and snippey ran away  of course i did an was countin on doin that same thing the first chance i had to speak with her alone though i made sure shed send me away  then seth repeated that which he had told aunt hannah and while he was thus engaged mr dean entered the house  during the two days which followed gladys and seth held long conversations regarding the possible good fortune which might come to the latter but nothing definite was known until the hour when aunt hannah was allowed to sit in an easychair for the first time since the accident  then it was that mr dean returned from new york and came to make his report  there was no longer any question but that it was really seths uncle who had lately died in san francisco or that he had bequeathed the sum of five thousand dollars to his nephew  it appeared according to mr deans story as learned from messrs symonds  symonds that daniel barrows had cared for his brothers child to the extent of paying richard genet of jersey city a certain sum of money each year to provide for and clothe the lad mr genet having died suddenly and without leaving anything to show whom seth had claims upon the boy was left to his own devices while his uncle because of carelessness or indifference made no effort to learn what might have become of the child  there were certain formalities of law to be complied with before the inheritance would be paid among which was the naming of a guardian for the heir  aunt hannah declared that it was her duty as well as pleasure to make the lame boy one of her family and to such end mr dean had several conferences with symonds  symonds after which the little woman was duly appointed guardian of the heir  there is little more that can be told regarding those who now live on the morse farm for the very good reason that all which has been related took place only a few months ago but at some time in the future if the readers so please it shall be the duty of the author to set down what befell aunt hannah seth gladys and snip after the inheritance was paid  that they were a very happy family goes without saying for who could be discontented or fretful in aunt hannahs home and in the days to come when father time lays his hand heavily upon the little woman seth knows that then if not before he can repay her in some degree for the kindness shown when he and snip were fugitives fleeing from nothing worse than a newspaper advertisement   the end
