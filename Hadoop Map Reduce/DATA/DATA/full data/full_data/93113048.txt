doubtful which was first hand on hilt rememberest thou ready       for the blow sure whatever else we met we should       meet our foe spurred or baulked at evry stride by the       others strength so we rode the ages down and every oceans       length where did you refrain from us or we       refrain from you ask the wave that has not watched war       between us two others held us for a while but with       weaker charms these we quitted at the call for each       others arms eager toward the known delight equally       we strove each the others mystery terror need       and love to each others open court with our       proofs we came where could we find honour else or men       to test the claim from each others throat we wrenched       valours last reward that extorted word of praise gasped       twixt lunge and guard in each others cup we poured mingled       blood and tears brutal joys unmeasured hopes       intolerable fears all that soiled or salted life for a thousand       years proved beyond the need of proof matched       in every clime o companion we have lived greatly       through all time yoked in knowledge and remorse now we       come to rest laughing at old villainies that time has       turned to jest pardoning old necessity no pardon can       efface that undying sin we shared in rouen       marketplace now we watch the new years shape

guard set       for peace on earth  broke to every known mischance lifted over       all by the light sane joy of life the buckler of       the gaul furious in luxury merciless in toil terrible with strength renewed from a       tireless soil strictest judge of her own worth gentlest of       mens mind first to follow truth and last to leave old       truths behind france beloved of every soul that loves or       serves its kind  first published june 24 1913    i  on the frontier of civilization   its a pretty park said the french artillery officer weve done a lot for it since the owner left  i hope hell appreciate it when he comes back  the car traversed a winding drive through woods between banks embellished with little chalets of a rustic nature  at first the chalets stood their full height above ground suggesting teagardens in england  further on they sank into the earth till at the top of the ascent only their solid brown roofs showed  torn branches drooping across the driveway with here and there a scorched patch of undergrowth explained the reason of their modesty  the chateau that commanded these glories of forest and park sat boldly on a terrace  there was nothing wrong with it except if one looked closely a few scratches or dints on its white stone walls or a neatly drilled hole under a flight of steps  one such hole ended in an unexploded shell  yes said the officer  they arrive here occasionally  something bellowed across the folds of the wooded hills something grunted in reply  something passed overhead querulously but not without dignity  two clear fresh barks joined the chorus and a man moved lazily in the direction of the guns  well  suppose we come and look at things a little said the commanding officer  an observation post  there was a specimen treea tree worthy of such a parkthe sort of tree visitors are always taken to admire  a ladder ran up it to a platform  what little wind there was swayed the tall top and the ladder creaked like a ships gangway  a telephone bell tinkled 50 foot overhead  two invisible guns spoke fervently for half a minute and broke off like terriers choked on a leash  we climbed till the topmost platform swayed sicklily beneath us  here one found a rustic shelter always of the teagarden pattern a table a map and a little window wreathed with living branches that gave one the first view of the devil and all his works  it was a stretch of open country with a few sticks like old toothbrushes which had once been trees round a farm  the rest was yellow grass barren to all appearance as the veldt  the grass is yellow because they have used gas here said an officer  their trenches are  you can see for yourself  the guns in the woods began again  they seemed to have no relation to the regularly spaced bursts of smoke along a little smear in the desert earth two thousand yards awayno connection at all with the strong voices overhead coming and going  it was as impersonal as the drive of the sea along a breakwater  thus it went  a pausea gathering of sound like the race of an incoming wave then the highflung heads of breakers spouting white up the face of a groyne  suddenly a seventh wave broke and spread the shape of its foam like a plume overtopping all the others  thats one of our torpilleurswhat you call trenchsweepers said the observer among the whispering leaves  some one crossed the platform to consult the map with its ranges  a blistering outbreak of white smokes rose a little beyond the large plume  it was as though the tide had struck a reef out yonder  then a new voice of tremendous volume lifted itself out of a lull that followed  somebody laughed  evidently the voice was known  that is not for us a gunner said  they are being waked up from he named a distant french position  so and so is attending to them there  we go on with our usual work  look another torpilleur  the barbarian  again a big plume rose and again the lighter shells broke at their appointed distance beyond it  the smoke died away on that stretch of trench as the foam of a swell dies in the angle of a harbour wall and broke out afresh half a mile lower down  in its apparent laziness in its awful deliberation and its quick spasms of wrath it was more like the work of waves than of men and our high platforms gentle sway and glide was exactly the motion of a ship drifting with us toward that shore  the usual work  only the usual work the officer explained sometimes it is here  sometimes above or below us  i have been here since may  a little sunshine flooded the stricken landscape and made its chemical yellow look more foul  a detachment of men moved out on a road which ran toward the french trenches and then vanished at the foot of a little rise  other men appeared moving toward us with that concentration of purpose and bearing shown in both armies whendinner is at hand  they looked like people who had been digging hard  the same work  always the same work the officer said and you could walk from here to the sea or to switzerland in that ditchand youll find the same work going on everywhere it isnt war  its better than that said another  its the eatingup of a people  they come and they fill the trenches and they die and they die and they send more and those die  we do the same of course butlook  he pointed to the large deliberate smokeheads renewing themselves along that yellowed beach  that is the frontier of civilization  they have all civilization against them those brutes yonder  its not the local victories of the old wars that were after  its the barbarianall the barbarian now youve seen the whole thing in little  come and look at our children  soldiers in caves  we left that tall tree whose fruits are death ripened and distributed at the tingle of small bells  the observer returned to his maps and calculations the telephoneboy stiffened up beside his exchange as the amateurs went out of his life  some one called down through the branches to ask who was attending tobelial let us say for i could not catch the guns name  it seemed to belong to that terrific new voice which had lifted itself for the second or third time  it appeared from the reply that if belial talked too long he would be dealt with from another point miles away  the troops we came down to see were at rest in a chain of caves which had begun life as quarries and had been fitted up by the army for its own uses  there were underground corridors antechambers rotundas and ventilating shafts with a bewildering play of cross lights so that wherever you looked you saw goyas pictures of menatarms  every soldier has some of the old maid in him and rejoices in all the gadgets and devices of his own invention  death and wounding come by nature but to lie dry sleep soft and keep yourself clean by forethought and contrivance is art and in all things the frenchman is gloriously an artist  moreover the french officers seem as motherkeen on their men as their men are brotherfond of them  maybe the possessive form of address  mon general mon capitaine helps the idea which our men cloke in other and curter phrases  and those soldiers like ours had been welded for months in one furnace  as an officer said  half our orders now need not be given  experience makes us think together  i believe too that if a french private has an ideaand they are full of ideasit reaches his c 0 quicker than it does with us  the sentinel hounds  the overwhelming impression was the brilliant health and vitality of these men and the quality of their breeding  they bore themselves with swing and rampant delight in life while their voices as they talked in the sidecaverns among the stands of arms were the controlled voices of civilization yet as the lights pierced the gloom they looked like bandits dividing the spoil  one picture though far from war stays with me  a perfectly built darkskinned young giant had peeled himself out of his blue coat and had brought it down with a swish upon the shoulder of a halfstripped comrade who was kneeling at his feet with some footgear  they stood against a background of semiluminous blue haze through which glimmered a pile of coppery straw half covered by a red blanket  by divine accident of light and pose it st martin giving his cloak to the beggar  there were scores of pictures in these galleriesnotably a rockhewn chapel where the red of the cross on the rough canvas altarcloth glowed like a ruby  further inside the caves we found a row of little rockcut kennels each inhabited by one wise silent dog their duties begin in at night with the sentinels and listeningposts  and believe me a proud instructor my fellow here knows the difference between the noise of our shells and the boche shells  when we came out into the open again there were good opportunities for this study  voices and wings met and passed in the air and perhaps one strong young tree had not been bending quite so far across the picturesque parkdrive when we first went that way  oh yes said an officer shells have to fall somewhere and he added with fine toleration it is after all against us that the boche directs them  but come you and look at my dugout  its the most superior of all possible dugouts  no  come and look at our mess  its the ritz of these parts  and they joyously told how they had got or procured the various fittings and elegancies while hands stretched out of the gloom to shake and men nodded welcome and greeting all through that cheery brotherhood in the woods  work in the fields  the voices and the wings were still busy after lunch when the car slipped past the teahouses in the drive and came into a country where women and children worked among the crops there were large raw shell holes by the wayside or in the midst of fields and often a cottage or a villa had been smashed as a bonnetbox is smashed by an umbrella  that must be part of belials work when he bellows so truculently among the hills to the north  we were looking for a town that lives under shellfire  the regular road to it was reported unhealthynot that the women and children seemed to care  we took byways of which certain exposed heights and corners were lightly blinded by windbrakes of dried treetops  here the shell holes were rather thick on the ground  but the women and the children and the old men went on with their work with the cattle and the crops and where a house had been broken by shells the rubbish was collected in a neat pile and where a room or two still remained usable it was inhabited and the tattered windowcurtains fluttered as proudly as any flag  and time was when i used to denounce young france because it tried to kill itself beneath my car wheels and the fat old women who crossed roads without warning and the specially deaf old men who slept in carts on the wrong side of the road  now i could take off my hat to every single soul of them but that one cannot traverse a whole land bareheaded  the nearer we came to our town the fewer were the people till at last we halted in a wellbuilt suburb of paved streets where there was no life at all     a wrecked town  the stillness was as terrible as the spread of the quick busy weeds between the pavingstones the air smelt of pounded mortar and crushed stone the sound of a footfall echoed like the drop of a pebble in a well  at first the horror of wrecked apartmenthouses and big shops laid open makes one waste energy in anger  it is not seemly that rooms should be torn out of the sides of buildings as one tears the soft heart out of english bread that villa roofs should lie across iron gates of private garages or that drawingroom doors should flap alone and disconnected between two emptinesses of twisted girders  the eye wearies of the repeated pattern that burst shells make on stone walls as the mouth sickens of the taste of mortar and charred timber  one quarter of the place had been shelled nearly level the facades of the houses stood doorless roofless and windowless like stage scenery  this was near the cathedral which is always a favourite mark for the heathen  they had gashed and ripped the sides of the cathedral itself so that the birds flew in and out at will they had smashed holes in the roof knocked huge cantles out of the buttresses and pitted and starred the paved square outside  they were at work too that very afternoon though i do not think the cathedral was their objective for the moment  we walked to and fro in the silence of the streets and beneath the whirring wings overhead  presently a young woman keeping to the wall crossed a corner  an old woman opened a shutter how it jarred and spoke to her  the silence closed again but it seemed to me that i heard a sound of singingthe sort of chant one hears in nightmarecities of voices crying from underground  in the cathedral  nonsense said an officer  who should be singing here we circled the cathedral again and saw what pavementstones can do against their own city when the shell jerks them upward  but there was singing after allon the other side of a little door in the flank of the cathedral  we looked in doubting and saw at least a hundred folk mostly women who knelt before the altar of an unwrecked chapel  we withdrew quietly from that holy ground and it was not only the eyes of the french officers that filled with tears  then there came an old old thing with a prayerbook in her hand pattering across the square evidently late for service  and who are those women i asked  some are caretakers people who have still little shops here there is one quarter where you can buy things  there are many old people too who will not go away  they are of the place you see  and this bombardment happens often i said  it happens always  would you like to look at the railway station  of course it has not been so bombarded as the cathedral  we went through the gross nakedness of streets without people till we reached the railway station which was very fairly knocked about but as my friends said nothing like as much as the cathedral  then we had to cross the end of a long street down which the boche could see clearly  as one glanced up it one perceived how the weeds to whom mens war is the truce of god had come back and were well established the whole length of it watched by the long perspective of open empty windows    ii  the nations spirit and a new inheritance   we left that stricken but undefeated town dodged a few miles down the roads beside which the women tended their cows and dropped into a place on a hill where a moroccan regiment of many experiences was in billets  they were mohammedans bafflingly like half a dozen of our indian frontier types though they spoke no accessible tongue they had of course turned the farm buildings where they lay into a little bit of africa in colour and smell  they had been gassed in the north shot over and shot down and set up to be shelled again and their officers talked of north african wars that we had never heard ofsultry days against long odds in the desert years ago  afterwardis it not so with you alsowe get our best recruits from the tribes we have fought  these men are children  they make no trouble they only want to go where cartridges are burnt  they are of the few races to whom fighting is a pleasure  and how long have you dealt with them  a long timea long time  i helped to organize the corps  i am one of those whose heart is in africa  he spoke slowly almost feeling for his french words and gave some order  i shall not forget his eyes as he turned to a huge brown afreedeelike mussulman hunkering down beside his accoutrements  he had two sides to his head that bearded burned slowspoken officer met and parted with in an hour  the day closedafter an amazing interlude in the chateau of a dream which was all glassy ponds stately trees and vistas of white and gold saloons  the proprietor was somebodys chauffeur at the front and we drank to his excellent health at a little village in a twilight full of the petrol of many cars and the wholesome flavour of healthy troops  there is no better guide to camp than ones own thoughtful nose and though i poked mine everywhere in no place then or later did it strike that vile betraying taint of underfed unclean men and the same with the horses  the line that never sleeps  it is difficult to keep an edge after hours of fresh air and experiences so one does not get the most from the most interesting part of the daythe dinner with the local headquarters  here the professionals meetthe line the gunners the intelligence with stupefying photoplans of the enemys trenches the supply the staff who collect and note all things and are very properly chaffed and be sure the interpreter who by force of questioning prisoners naturally develops into a sadducee  it is their little asides to each other the slang and the halfwords which if one understood instead of blinking drowsily at ones plate would give the days history in little  but tire and the difficulties of a sister not a foreign tongue cloud everything and one goes to billets amid a murmur of voices the rush of single cars through the night the passage of battalions and behind it all the echo of the deep voices calling one to the other along the line that never sleeps                            the ridge with the scattered pines might have hidden children at play  certainly a horse would have been quite visible but there was no hint of guns except a semaphore which announced it was forbidden to pass that way as the battery was firing the boches must have looked for that battery too  the ground was pitted with shell holes of all calibressome of them as fresh as molecasts in the misty damp morning others where the poppies had grown from seed to flower all through the summer  and where are the guns i demanded at last  they were almost under ones hand their ammunition in cellars and dugouts beside them  as far as one can make out the 75 gun has no pet name  the bayonet is rosalie the virgin of bayonne but the 75 the watchful nurse of the trenches and little sister of the line seems to be always soixante quinze  even those who love her best do not insist that she is beautiful  her merits are frenchlogic directness simplicity and the supreme gift of occasionality  she is equal to everything on the spur of the moment  one sees and studies the few appliances which make her do what she does and one feels that any one could have invented her  famous french 75s  as a matter of fact says a commandant anybodyor rather everybody did  the general idea is after suchandsuch system the patent of which had expired and we improved it the breech action with slight modification is somebody elses the sighting is perhaps a little special and so is the traversing but at bottom it is only an assembly of variations and arrangements  that of course is all that shakespeare ever got out of the alphabet  the french artillery make their own guns as he made his plays  it is just as simple as that  there is nothing going on for the moment its too misty said the commandant  i fancy that the boche being as a rule methodical amateurs are introduced to batteries in the boches intervals  at least there are hours healthy and unhealthy which vary with each position  but the commandant reflected a moment there is a placeand a distance  let us say          he gave a range  the gunservers stood back with the bored contempt of the professional for the layman who intrudes on his mysteries other civilians had come that way beforehad seen and grinned and complimented and gone their way leaving the gunners high up on the bleak hillside to grill or mildew or freeze for weeks and months  then she spoke  her voice was higher pitched it seemed than ourswith a more shrewish tang to the speeding shell  her recoil was as swift and as graceful as the shrug of a frenchwomans shoulders the empty case leaped forth and clanged against the trail the tops of two or three pines fifty yards away nodded knowingly to each other though there was no wind  theyll be bothered down below to know the meaning of our single shot  we dont give them one dose at a time as a rule somebody laughed  we waited in the fragrant silence  nothing came back from the mist that clogged the lower grounds though no shell of this war was ever launched with more earnest prayers that it might do hurt  then they talked about the lives of guns what number of rounds some will stand and others will not how soon one can make two good guns out of three spoilt ones and what crazy luck sometimes goes with a single shot or a blind salvo  lesson from the boche  a shell must fall somewhere and by the law of averages occasionally lights straight as a homing pigeon on the one spot where it can wreck most  then earth opens for yards around and men must be dug outsome merely breathless who shake their ears swear and carry on and others whose souls have gone loose among terrors  these have to be dealt with as their psychology demands and the french officer is a good psychologist  one of them said  our national psychology has changed  i do not recognize it myself  what made the change  the boche  if he had been quiet for another twenty years the world must have been hisrotten but all his  now he is saving the world  how  because he has shown us what evil is  weyou and i england and the resthad begun to doubt the existence of evil  the boche is saving us  then we had another look at the animal in its trencha little nearer this time than before and quieter on account of the mist  pick up the chain anywhere you please you shall find the same observationpost table map observer and telephonist the same alwayshidden alwaysready guns and same vexed foreshore of trenches smoking and shaking from switzerland to the sea  the handling of the war varies with the nature of the country but the tools are unaltered  one looks upon them at last with the same weariness of wonder as the eye receives from endless repetitions of egyptian hieroglyphics  a long low profile with a lump to one side means the fieldgun and its attendant ammunitioncase a circle and slot stand for an observationpost the trench is a bent line studded with vertical plumes of explosion the great guns of position coming and going on their motors repeat themselves as scarabs and man himself is a small blue smudge no larger than a foresight crawling and creeping or watching and running among all these terrific symbols  tragedy of rheims  but there is no hieroglyphic for rheims no blunting of the mind at the abominations committed on the cathedral there the thing peers upward maimed and blinded from out of the utter wreckage of the archbishops palace on the one side and dustheaps of crumbled houses on the other  they shelled as they still shell it with high explosives and with incendiary shells so that the statues and the stonework in places are burned the colour of raw flesh  the gargoyles are smashed statues crockets and spires tumbled walls split and torn windows thrust out and tracery obliterated  wherever one looks at the tortured pile there is mutilation and defilement and yet it had never more of a soul than it has today  insidecover yourselves gentlemen said the sacristan this place is no longer consecratedeverything is swept clear or burned out from end to end except two candlesticks in front of the niche where joan of arcs image used to stand there is a french flag there now  and the last time i saw rheims cathedral was in a spring twilight when the great west window glowed and the only lights within were those of candles which some penitent english had lit in joans honour on those same candlesticks  the high altar was covered with floorcarpets the pavement tiles were cracked and jarred out by the rubbish that had fallen from above the floor was gritty with dust of glass and powdered stone little twists of leading from the windows and iron fragments  two great doors had been blown inwards by the blast of a shell in the archbishops garden till they had bent grotesquely to the curve of a cask  there they had jammed  the windowsbut the record has been made and will be kept by better hands than mine  it will last through the generation in which the teuton is cut off from the fellowship of mankindall the long still years when this war of the body is at an end and the real war begins  rheims is but one of the altars which the heathen have put up to commemorate their own death throughout all the world  it will serve  there is a mark well known by now which they have left for a visible seal of their doom  when they first set the place alight some hundreds of their wounded were being tended in the cathedral  the french saved as many as they could but some had to be left  among them was a major who lay with his back against a pillar  it has been ordained that the signs of his torments should remainan outline of both legs and half a body printed in greasy black upon the stones  there are very many people who hope and pray that the sign will be respected at least by our childrens children  iron nerve and faith  and in the meantime rheims goes about what business it may have with that iron nerve and endurance and faith which is the new inheritance of france  there is agony enough when the big shells come in there is pain and terror among the people and always fresh desecration to watch and suffer  the old men and the women and the children drink of that cup daily and yet the bitterness does not enter into their souls  mere words of admiration are impertinent but the exquisite quality of the french soul has been the marvel to me throughout  they say themselves when they talk  we did not know what our nation was  frankly we did not expect it ourselves  but the thing came andyou see we go on  or as a woman put it more logically what else can we do remember we knew the boche in 70 when you did not  we know what he has done in the last year  this is not war  it is against wild beasts that we fight  there is no arrangement possible with wild beasts  this is the one vital point which we in england must realize  we are dealing with animals who have scientifically and philosophically removed themselves inconceivably outside civilization  when you have heard a fewonly a fewtales of their doings you begin to understand a little  when you have seen rheims you understand a little more  when you have looked long enough at the faces of the women you are inclined to think that the women will have a large say in the final judgment  they have earned it a thousand times     iii  battle spectacle and a review  travelling with two chauffeurs is not the luxury it looks since there is only one of you and there is always another of those iron men to relieve the wheel  nor can i decide whether an exprofessor of the german tongue or an exroadracer who has lived six years abroad or a marechal des logis or a brigadier makes the most thrusting driver through threemile stretches of military traffic repeated at halfhour intervals sometimes it was motorambulances strung all along a level or supply or those eternal big guns coming round corners with trees chained on their long backs to puzzle aeroplanes and their leafy bigshell limbers snorting behind them  in the rare breathingspaces men with rollers and road metal attacked the road  in peace the roads of france thanks to the motor were none too good  in war they stand the incessant traffic far better than they did with the tourist  my impression after some seven hundred miles printed off on me at between 60 and 70 kilometreswas of uniform excellence  nor did i come upon any smashes or breakdowns in that distance and they were certainly trying them hard  nor which is the greater marvel did we kill anybody though we did miracles down the streets to avoid babes kittens and chickens  the land is used to every detail of war and to its grime and horror and makeshifts but also to wars unbounded courtesy kindness and longsuffering and the gaiety that comes thank god to balance overwhelming material loss  farm life amidst war  there was a village that had been stamped flat till it looked older than pompeii  there were not three roofs left nor one whole house  in most places you saw straight into the cellars  the hops were ripe in the gravedotted fields round about  they had been brought in and piled in the nearest outline of a dwelling  women sat on chairs on the pavement picking the goodsmelling bundles  when they had finished one they reached back and pulled out another through the windowhole behind them talking and laughing the while  a cart had to be maneuvered out of what had been a farmyard to take the hops to market  a thick broad fairhaired wench of the sort that millet drew flung all her weight on a spoke and brought the cart forward into the street  then she shook herself and hands on hips danced a little defiant jig in her sabots as she went back to get the horse  another girl came across a bridge  she was precisely of the opposite type slender creamyskinned and delicatefeatured  she carried a brandnew broom over her shoulder through that desolation and bore herself with the pride and grace of queen iseult  the farmgirl came out leading the horse and as the two young things passed they nodded and smiled at each other with the delicate tangle of the hopvines at their feet  the guns spoke earnestly in the north  that was the argonne where the crown prince was busily getting rid of a few thousands of his fathers faithful subjects in order to secure himself the reversion of his fathers throne  no man likes losing his job and when at long last the inner history of this war comes to be written we may find that the people we mistook for principals and prime agents were only average incompetents moving all hell to avoid dismissal  for it is absolutely true that when a man sells his soul to the devil he does it for the price of half nothing  watching the gunfire  it must have been a hot fight  a village wrecked as is usual along this line opened on it from a hillside that overlooked an italian landscape of carefully drawn hills studded with small villagesa plain with a road and a river in the foreground and an allrevealing afternoon light upon everything  the hills smoked and shook and bellowed  an observationballoon climbed up to see while an aeroplane which had nothing to do with the strife but was merely training a beginner ducked and swooped on the edge of the plain  two rosepink pillars of crumbled masonry guarding some carefully trimmed evergreens on a lawn half buried in rubbish represented an hotel where the crown prince had once stayed  all up the hillside to our right the foundations of houses lay out like a bit of tripe with the sunshine in their square hollows  suddenly a band began to play up the hill among some trees and an officer of local guards in the new steel antishrapnel helmet which is like the seventeenth century sallet suggested that we should climb and get a better view  he was a kindly man and in speaking english had discovered as i do when speaking french that it is simpler to stick to one gender  his choice was the feminine and the boche described as she throughout made me think better of myself which is the essence of friendship  we climbed a flight of old stone steps for generations the playground of little children and found a ruined church and a battalion in billets recreating themselves with excellent music and a little horseplay on the outer edge of the crowd  the trouble in the hills was none of their business for that day  still higher up on a narrow path among the trees stood a priest and three or four officers  they watched the battle and claimed the great bursts of smoke for one side or the other at the same time as they kept an eye on the flickering aeroplane  ours they said half under their breath theirs  no not ours that onetheirs        that fool is banking too steep        thats boche shrapnel  they always burst it high  thats our big gun behind that outer hill        hell drop his machine in the street if he doesnt take care        there goes a trenchsweeper those last two were theirs but thatit was a full roar was ours  behind the german lines  the valley held and increased the sounds till they seemed to hit our hillside like a sea  a change of light showed a village exquisitely pencilled atop of a hill with reddish haze at its feet  what is that place i asked  the priest replied in a voice as deep as an organ  that is saint  it is in the boche lines  its condition is pitiable  the thunders and the smokes rolled up and diminished and renewed themselves but the small children romped up and down the old stone steps the beginners aeroplane unsteadily chased its own shadow over the fields and the soldiers in billet asked the band for their favourite tunes  said the lieutenant of local guards as the cars went on sheplaytipperary  and she didto an accompaniment of heavy pieces in the hills which followed us into a town all ringed with enormous searchlights french and boche together scowling at each other beneath the stars                            it happened about that time that lord kitchener with general joffre reviewed a french army corps  we came on it in a vast dip of ground under grey clouds as one comes suddenly on water for it lay out in misty blue lakes of men mixed with darker patches like osiers and undergrowth of guns horses and wagons  a straight road cut the landscape in two along its murmuring front  veterans of the war  it was as though cadmus had sown the dragons teeth not in orderly furrows but broadcast till horrified by what arose he had emptied out the whole bag and fled  but these were no new warriors  the record of their mere pitched battles would have satiated a napoleon  their regiments and batteries had learnt to achieve the impossible as a matter of routine and in twelve months they had scarcely for a week lost direct contact with death  we went down the line and looked into the eyes of those men with the used bayonets and rifles the packs that could almost stow themselves on the shoulders that would be strange without them at the splashed guns on their repaired wheels and the easyworking limbers  one could feel the strength and power of the mass as one feels the flush of heat from off a sunbaked wall  when the generals cars arrived there there was no loud word or galloping about  the lakes of men gathered into straightedged battalions the batteries aligned a little a squadron reined back or spurred up but it was all as swiftly smooth as the certainty with which a man used to the pistol draws and levels it at the required moment  a few peasant women saw the generals alight the aeroplanes which had been skimming low as swallows along the front of the line theirs must have been a superb view ascended leisurely and waited on like hawks  then followed the inspection and one saw the two figures tall and short growing smaller side by side along the white road till far off among the cavalry they entered their cars again and moved along the horizon to another rise of greygreen plain  the army will move across where you are standing  get to a flank some one said  an army in motion  we were no more than well clear of that immobile host when it all surged forward headed by massed bands playing a tune that sounded like the very pulse of france  the two generals with their staff and the french minister for war were on foot near a patch of very green lucerne they made about twenty figures in all  the cars were little grey blocks against the grey skyline  there was nothing else in all that great plain except the army no sound but the changing notes of the aeroplanes and the blunted impression rather than noise of feet of men on soft ground  they came over a slight ridge so that one saw the curve of it first furred then grassed with the tips of bayonets which immediately grew to full height and then beneath them poured the wonderful infantry  the speed the thrust the drive of that broad blue mass was like a tiderace up an arm of the sea and how such speed could go with such weight and how such weight could be in itself so absolutely under control filled one with terror  all the while the band on a far headland was telling them and telling them as if they did not know of the passion and gaiety and high heart of their own land in the speech that only they could fully understand  to hear the music of a country is like hearing a woman think aloud  what is the tune i asked of an officer beside me  my faith i cant recall for the moment  ive marched to it often enough though  sambreetmeuse perhaps  look there goes my battalion  those chasseurs yonder  he knew of course but what could a stranger identify in that earthshaking passage of thirty thousand  artillery and cavalry  the note behind the ridge changed to something deeper  ah  our guns said an artillery officer and smiled tolerantly on the last blue waves of the line already beating toward the horizon  they came twelve abreastone hundred and fifty guns free for the moment to take the air in company behind their teams and next week would see them hidden singly or in lurking confederacies by mountain and marsh and forest or the wrecked habitations of menwhere  the big guns followed them with that longnosed air of detachment peculiar to the breed  the gunner at my side made no comment  he was content to let his arm speak for itself but when one big gun in a sticky place fell out of alignment for an instant i saw his eyebrows contract  the artillery passed on with the same inhuman speed and silence as the line and the cavalrys shattering trumpets closed it all  they are like our cavalry in that their horses are in high condition and they talk hopefully of getting past the barbed wire one of these days and coming into their own  meantime they are employed on various work as requisite and they all sympathize with our roughrider of dragoons who flatly refused to take off his spurs in the trenches  if he had to die as a damned infantryman he wasnt going to be buried as such  a troophorse of a flanking squadron decided that he had had enough of war and jibbed like lots wife  his rider we all watched him ranged about till he found a stick which he used but without effect  then he got off and led the horse which was evidently what the brute wanted for when the man remounted the jibbing began again  the last we saw of him was one immensely lonely figure leading one bad but happy horse across an absolutely empty world  think of his receptionthe sole man of 40000 who had fallen out  the boche as mr smith  the commander of that army corps came up to salute  the cars went away with the generals and the minister for war the army passed out of sight over the ridges to the north the peasant women stooped again to their work in the fields and wet mist shut down on all the plain but one tingled with the electricity that had passed  now one knows what the solidarity of civilization means  later on the civilized nations will know more and will wonder and laugh together at their old blindness  when lord kitchener went down the line before the march past they say that he stopped to speak to a general who had been marchands chief of staff at the time of fashoda  and fashoda was one of several cases when civilization was very nearly maneuvered into fighting with itself for the king of prussia as the saying goes  the allembracing vileness of the boche is best realized from french soil where they have had large experience of it  and yet as some one observed we ought to have known that a race who have brought anonymous letterwriting to its highest pitch in their own dirty court affairs would certainly use the same methods in their foreign politics  why didnt we realize  for the same reason another responded that society did not realize that the late mr smith of your england who married three wives bought baths in advance for each of them and when they had left him all their money drowned them one by one  and were the baths by any chance called denmark austria and france in 1870 a third asked  no they were respectable british tubs  but until mr smith had drowned his third wife people didnt get suspicious  they argued that men dont do such things  that sentiment is the criminals best protection     iv  the spirit of the people   we passed into the zone of another army and a hillier country where the border villages lay more sheltered  here and there a town and the fields round it gave us a glimpse of the furious industry with which france makes and handles material and troops  with her as with us the wounded officer of experience goes back to the drillground to train the new levies  but it was always the little crowded defiant villages and the civil population waiting unweariedly and cheerfully on the unwearied cheerful army that went closest to the heart  take these pictures caught almost anywhere during a journey  a knot of little children in difficulties with the village watertap or highhandled pump  a soldier bearded and fatherly or young and slim and therefore rather shy of the big girls chaff comes forward and lifts the pail or swings the handle  his reward from the smallest babe swung high in air or if he is an older man pressed against his knees is a kiss  then nobody laughs  or a fat old lady making oration against some wicked young soldiers who she says know what has happened to a certain bottle of wine  and i meant it for allyes for all of you this evening instead of the thieves who stole it  yes i tell youstole it  the whole street hears her so does the officer who pretends not to and the amused halfbattalion up the road  the young men express penitence she growls like a thunderstorm but softening at last cuffs and drives them affectionately before her  they are all one family  or a girl at work with horses in a ploughed field that is dotted with graves  the machine must avoid each sacred plot so hands on the ploughstilts her hair flying forward she shouts and wrenches till her little brother runs up and swings the team out of the furrow  every aspect and detail of life in france seems overlaid with a smooth patina of longcontinued wareverything except the spirit of the people and that is as fresh and glorious as the sight of their own land in sunshine  a city and woman  we found a city among hills which knew itself to be a prize greatly coveted by the kaiser  for truly it was a pleasant a desirable and an insolent city  its streets were full of life it boasted an establishment almost as big as harrods and full of buyers and its women dressed and shod themselves with care and grace as befits ladies who at any time may be ripped into rags by bombs from aeroplanes  and there was another city whose population seemed to be all soldiers in training and yet another given up to big guns and ammunition an extraordinary sight  after that we came to a little town of pale stone which an army had made its headquarters  it looked like a plain woman who had fainted in public  it had rejoiced in many public institutions that were turned into hospitals and offices the wounded limped its wide dusty streets detachments of infantry went through it swiftly and utterly bored motorlorries cruised up and down roaring i suppose for something to look at or to talk to  in the centre of it i found one janny or rather his marble bust brooding over a minute ironrailed garden of halfdried asters opposite a shutup school which it appeared from the inscription janny had founded somewhere in the arid thirties  it was precisely the sort of school that janny by the look of him would have invented not even french adaptability could make anything of it  so janny had his school with a faint perfume of varnish all to himself in a hot stillness of usedup air and little whirls of dust and because that town seemed so barren i met there a french general whom i would have gone very far to have encountered he like the others had created and tempered an army for certain work in a certain place and its hand had been heavy on the boche  we talked of what the french woman was and had done and was doing and extolled her for her goodness and her faith and her splendid courage  when we parted i went back and made my profoundest apologies to janny who must have had a mother  the pale overwhelmed town did not now any longer resemble a woman who had fainted but one who must endure in public all manner of private woe and still with hands that never cease working keeps her soul and is cleanly strong for herself and for her men  french officers  the guns began to speak again among the hills that we dived into the air grew chillier as we climbed forest and wet rocks closed round us in the mist to the sound of waters trickling alongside there was a tang of wet fern cut pine and the first breath of autumn when the road entered a tunnel and a new worldalsace  said the governor of those parts thoughtfully  the main thing was to get those factory chimneys smoking again  they were doing so in little flats and villages all along  you wont see any girls because theyre at work in the textile factories  yes it isnt a bad country for summer hotels but im afraid it wont do for winter sports  weve only a metre of snow and it doesnt lie except when you are hauling guns up mountains  then of course it drifts and freezes like davos  thats our new railway below there  pity its too misty to see the view  but for his medals there was nothing in the governor to show that he was not english  he might have come straight from an indian frontier command  one notices this approximation of type in the higher ranks and many of the juniors are cut out of the very same cloth as ours  they get whatever fun may be going  their performances are as incredible and outrageous as the language in which they describe them afterward is bald but convincing andi overheard the tailend of a yarn told by a child of twenty to some other babes  it was veiled in the obscurity of the french tongue and the points were lost in shouts of laughter but i imagine the subaltern among his equals displays just as much reverence for his elders and betters as our own boys do the epilogue at least was as old as both armies  and what did he say then  oh the usual thing  he held his breath till i thought hed burst  then he damned me in heaps and i took good care to keep out of his sight till next day  but officially and in the high social atmosphere of headquarters their manners and their meekness are of the most admirable  there they attend devoutly on the wisdom of their seniors who treat them so it seemed with affectionate confidence  front that never sleeps  when the days reports are in all along the front there is a man expert in the meaning of things who boils them down for that cold official digest which tells us that there was the usual grenade fighting at  we made appreciable advance at c  the original material comes in sheaves and sheaves where individual character and temperament have full and amusing play  it is reduced for domestic consumption like an overwhelming electric current  otherwise we could not take it in  but at closer range one realizes that the front never sleeps never ceases from trying new ideas and weapons which so soon as the boche thinks he has mastered them are discarded for newer annoyances and bewilderments  the boche is above all things observant and imitative said one who counted quite a few boches dead on the front of his sector  when you present him with a new idea he thinks it over for a day or two  then he presents his riposte  yes my general  that was exactly what he did to me when i did so and so  he was quite silent for a day  thenhe stole my patent  and you  i had a notion that hed do that so i had changed the specification  thus spoke the staff and so it is among the junior commands down to the semiisolated posts where boynapoleons live on their own through unbelievable adventures  they are inventive young devils these veterans of 21 possessed of the single idealto killwhich they follow with men as singleminded as themselves  battlefield tactics do not exist when a whole nation goes to ground there can be none of the victories of the old bookish days  but there is always the killingthe wellschemed smashing of a full trench the rushing out and the mowing down of its occupants the unsuspicious battalion far in the rear located after two nights extreme risk alone among rubbish of masonry and wiped out as it eats or washes itself and more rarely the body to body encounter with animals removed from the protection of their machinery when the bayonets get their chance  the boche does not at all like meeting men whose womenfolk he has dishonoured or mutilated or used as a protection against bullets  it is not that these men are angry or violent  they do not waste time in that way  they kill him  the business of war  the french are less reticent than we about atrocities committed by the boche because those atrocities form part of their lives  they are not tucked away in reports of commissions and vaguely referred to as too awful  later on perhaps we shall be unreserved in our turn  but they do not talk of them with any babbling heat or bleat or make funny little appeals to a public opinion that like the boche has gone underground  it occurs to me that this must be because every frenchman has his place and his chance direct or indirect to diminish the number of boches still alive whether he lies out in a sandwich of damp earth or sweats the big guns up the crests behind the trees or brings the fat loaded barges into the very heart of the city where the shellwagons wait or spends his last crippled years at the harvest he is doing his work to that end  if he is a civilian he mayas he doessay things about his government which after all is very like other popular governments  a lifetime spent in watching how the cat jumps does not make liontamers  but there is very little human rubbish knocking about france to hinder work or darken counsel  above all there is a thing called the honour of civilization to which france is attached  the meanest man feels that he in his place is permitted to help uphold it and i think bears himself therefore with new dignity  a contrast in types  this is written in a garden of smooth turf under a copper beech beside a glassy millstream where soldiers of alpine regiments are writing letters home while the guns shout up and down the narrow valleys  a great wolfhound who considers himself in charge of the oldfashioned farmhouse cannot understand why his master aged six should be sitting on the knees of the marechal des logis the iron man who drives the big car  but you are french little one says the giant with a yearning arm round the child  yes very slowly mouthing the french words icant speakfrenchbutiamfrench  the small face disappears in the big beard  somehow i cant imagine the marechal des logis killing babieseven if his superior officer now sketching the scene were to order him                            the great building must once have been a monastery  twilight softened its gaunt wings in an angle of which were collected fifty prisoners picked up among the hills behind the mists  they stood in some sort of military formation preparatory to being marched off  they were dressed in khaki the colour of gassed grass that might have belonged to any army  two wore spectacles and i counted eight faces of the fifty which were asymmetricalout of drawing on one side  some of their later drafts give us that type said the interpreter  one of them had been wounded in the head and roughly bandaged  the others seemed all sound  most of them looked at nothing but several were vividly alive with terror that cannot keep the eyelids still and a few wavered on the grey edge of collapse  they were the breed which at the word of command had stolen out to drown women and children had raped women in the streets at the word of command and always at the word of command had sprayed petrol or squirted flame or defiled the property and persons of their captives  they stood there outside all humanity  yet they were made in the likeness of humanity  one realized it with a shock when the bandaged creature began to shiver and they shuffled off in response to the orders of civilized men     v  life in trenches on the mountain side   very early in the morning i met alan breck with a halfhealed bulletscrape across the bridge of his nose and an alpine cap over one ear  his people a few hundred years ago had been scotch  he bore a scotch name and still recognized the head of his clan but his french occasionally ran into german words for he was an alsatian on one side  this he explained is the very best country in the world to fight in  its picturesque and full of cover  im a gunner  ive been here for months  its lovely  it might have been the hills under mussoorie and what our cars expected to do in it i could not understand  but the demondriver who had been a roadracer took the 70 hp mercedes and threaded the narrow valleys as well as occasional halfswiss villages full of alpine troops at a restrained thirty miles an hour  he shot up a newmade road more like mussoorie than ever and did not fall down the hillside even once  an ammunitionmule of a mountainbattery met him at a tight corner and began to climb a tree  see  there isnt another place in france where that could happen said alan  i tell you this is a magnificent country  the mule was hauled down by his tail before he had reached the lower branches and went on through the woods his ammunitionboxes jinking on his back for all the world as though he were rejoining his battery at jutogh  one expected to meet the little hill people bent under their loads under the forest gloom  the light the colour the smell of wood smoke pineneedles wet earth and warm mule were all himalayan  only the mercedes was violently and loudly a stranger  halt said alan at last when she had done everything except imitate the mule  the road continues said the demondriver seductively  yes but they will hear you if you go on  stop and wait weve a mountain battery to look at  they were not at work for the moment and the commandant a grim and forceful man showed me some details of their construction  when we left them in their bowerit looked like a hill priests wayside shrinewe heard them singing through the steepdescending pines  they too like the 75s seem to have no pet name in the service  it was a poisonously blind country  the woods blocked all sense of direction above and around  the ground was at any angle you please and all sounds were split up and muddled by the treetrunks which acted as silencers  high above us the respectable allconcealing forest had turned into sparse ghastly blue sticks of timberan assembly of lepertrees round a bald mountain top  thats where were going said alan  isnt it an adorable country  trenches  a machinegun loosed a few shots in the fumbling style of her kind when they feel for an opening  a couple of rifle shots answered  they might have been half a mile away or a hundred yards below  an adorable country  we climbed up till we found once again a complete teagarden of little sunk houses almost invisible in the brownpink recesses of the thick forest  here the trenches began and with them for the next few hours life in two dimensionslength and breadth  you could have eaten your dinner almost anywhere off the swept dry ground for the steep slopes favoured draining there was no lack of timber and there was unlimited labour  it had made neat doublelength dugouts where the wounded could be laid in during their passage down the mountain side welltended occasional latrines properly limed dugouts for sleeping and eating overhead protections and toolsheds where needed and as one came nearer the working face very clever cellars against trenchsweepers  men passed on their business a squad with a captured machinegun which they tested in a sheltered dip armourers at their benches busy with sick rifles fatigueparties for straw rations and ammunition long processions of single blue figures turned sideways between the brown sunless walls  one understood after a while the nightmare that lays hold of trenchstale men when the dreamer wanders for ever in those blind mazes till after centuries of agonizing flight he finds himself stumbling out again into the white blaze and horror of the mined fronthe who thought he had almost reached home  in the front line  there were no trees above us now  their trunks lay along the edge of the trench built in with stones where necessary or sometimes overhanging it in ragged splinters or bushy tops bits of cloth not french showed too in the uneven lines of debris at the trench lip and some thoughtful soul had marked an unexploded boche trenchsweeper as not to be touched  it was a young lawyer from paris who pointed that out to me  we met the colonel at the head of an indescribable pit of ruin full of sunshine whose steps ran down a very steep hillside under the lee of an almost vertically plunging parapet  to the left of that parapet the whole hillside was one gruel of smashed trees split stones and powdered soil it might have been a ragpickers dumpheap on a colossal scale  alan looked at it critically  i think he had helped to make it not long before  were on the top of the hill now and the boches are below us said he  we gave them a very fair sickener lately  this said the colonel is the front line  there were overhead guards against handbombs which disposed me to believe him but what convinced me most was a corporal urging us in whispers not to talk so loud  the men were at dinner and a good smell of food filled the trench  this was the first smell i had encountered in my long travels uphilla mixed entirely wholesome flavour of stew leather earth and rifleoil  front line professionals  a proportion of men were standing to arms while others ate but dinnertime is slack time even among animals and it was close on noon  the boches got their soup a few days ago some one whispered  i thought of the pulverized hillside and hoped it had been hot enough  we edged along the still trench where the soldiers stared with justified contempt i thought upon the civilian who scuttled through their life for a few emotional minutes in order to make words out of their blood  somehow it reminded me of coming in late to a play and incommoding a long line of packed stalls  the whispered dialogue was much the same pardon  i beg your pardon monsieur  to the right monsieur  if monsieur will lower his head  one sees best from here monsieur and so on  it was their day and nightlong business carried through without display or heat or doubt or indecision  those who worked worked those off duty not five feet behind them in the dugouts were deep in their papers or their meals or their letters while death stood ready at every minute to drop down into the narrow cut from out of the narrow strip of unconcerned sky  and for the better part of a week one had skirted hundreds of miles of such a frieze  the loopholes not in use were plugged rather like oldfashioned hives  said the colonel removing a plug here are the boches  look and youll see their sandbags through the jumble of riven trees and stones one saw what might have been a bit of green sacking  theyre about seven metres distant just here the colonel went on  that was true too  we entered a little fortalice with a cannon in it in an embrasure which at that moment struck me as unnecessarily vast even though it was partly closed by a frail packingcase lid  the colonel sat him down in front of it and explained the theory of this sort of redoubt  by the way he said to the gunner at last cant you find something better than that  he twitched the lid aside  i think its too light  get a log of wood or something  handy trenchsweepers  i loved that colonel  he knew his men and he knew the boches had them marked down like birds  when he said they were beside dead trees or behind boulders sure enough there they were  but as i have said the dinnerhour is always slack and even when we came to a place where a section of trench had been bashed open by trenchsweepers and it was recommended to duck and hurry nothing much happened  the uncanny thing was the absence of movement in the boche trenches  sometimes one imagined that one smelt strange tobacco or heard a riflebolt working after a shot  otherwise they were as still as pig at noonday  we held on through the maze past trenchsweepers of a handy light pattern with their screwtailed charge all ready and a grave or so and when i came on men who merely stood within easy reach of their rifles i knew i was in the second line when they lay frankly at ease in their dugouts i knew it was the third  a shotgun would have sprinkled all three  no flat plains said alan  no hunting for gun positions the hills are full of themand the trenches close together and commanding each other  you see what a beautiful country it is  the colonel confirmed this but from another point of view war was his business as the still woods could testifybut his hobby was his trenches  he had tapped the mountain streams and dug out a laundry where a man could wash his shirt and go up and be killed in it all in a morning had drained the trenches till a muddy stretch in them was an offence and at the bottom of the hill it looked like a hydropathic establishment on the stage he had created baths where half a battalion at a time could wash  he never told me how all that country had been fought over as fiercely as ypres in the west nor what blood had gone down the valleys before his trenches pushed over the scalped mountain top  no  he sketched out new endeavours in earth and stones and trees for the comfort of his men on that populous mountain  and there came a priest who was a sublieutenant out of a wood of snuffbrown shadows and halfveiled trunks  would it please me to look at a chapel  it was all open to the hillside most tenderly and devoutly done in rustic work with reedings of peeled branches and panels of moss and thatchst huberts own shrine  i saw the hunters who passed before it going to the chase on the far side of the mountain where their game lay                            a bombarded town  alan carried me off to tea the same evening in a town where he seemed to know everybody  he had spent the afternoon on another mountain top inspecting gun positions whereby he had been shelled a littlemarmite is the slang for it  there had been no serious marmitage and he had spotted a boche position which was marmitable  and we may get shelled now he added hopefully  they shell this town whenever they think of it  perhaps theyll shell us at tea  it was a quaintly beautiful little place with its mixture of french and german ideas its old bridge and gentleminded river between the cultivated hills  the sandbagged cellar doors the ruined houses and the holes in the pavement looked as unreal as the violences of a cinema against that soft and simple setting  the people were abroad in the streets and the little children were playing  a big shell gives notice enough for one to get to shelter if the shelter is near enough  that appears to be as much as any one expects in the world where one is shelled and that world has settled down to it  peoples lips are a little firmer the modelling of the brows is a little more pronounced and maybe there is a change in the expression of the eyes but nothing that a casual afternoon caller need particularly notice  cases for hospital  the house where we took tea was the big house of the place old and massive a treasure house of ancient furniture  it had everything that the moderate heart of man could desire gardens garages outbuildings and the air of peace that goes with beauty in age  it stood over a high cellarage and opposite the cellar door was a brandnew blindage of earth packed between timbers  the cellar was a hospital with its beds and stores and under the electric light the orderly waited ready for the cases to be carried down out of the streets  yes they are all civil cases said he  they come without much warninga woman gashed by falling timber a child with its temple crushed by a flying stone an urgent amputation case and so on  one never knows bombardment the boche textbooks say is designed to terrify the civil population so that they may put pressure on their politicians to conclude peace  in real life men are very rarely soothed by the sight of their women being tortured  we took tea in the hall upstairs with a propriety and an interchange of compliments that suited the little occasion there was no attempt to disguise the existence of a bombardment but it was not allowed to overweigh talk of lighter matters  i know one guest who sat through it as near as might be inarticulate with wonder  but he was english and when alan asked him whether he had enjoyed himself he said oh yes  thank you very much  nice people arent they alan went on  oh very nice  andand such good tea  he managed to convey a few of his sentiments to alan after dinner  but what else could the people have done said he  they are french     vi  the common task of a great people   this is the end of the line said the staff officer kindest and most patient of chaperons  it buttressed itself on a fortress among hills  beyond that the silence was more awful than the mixed noise of business to the westward  in mileage on the map the line must be between four and five hundred miles in actual trenchwork many times that distance  it is too much to see at full length the mind does not readily break away from the obsession of its entirety or the grip of its detail  one visualizes the thing afterwards as a whitehot gash worming all across france between intolerable sounds and lights under ceaseless blasts of whirled dirt  nor is it any relief to lose oneself among wildernesses of piling stoning timbering concreting and wirework or incalculable quantities of soil thrown up raw to the light and cloaked by the changing seasonsas the unburied dead are cloaked  yet there are no words to give the essential simplicity of it it is the rampart put up by man against the beast precisely as in the stone age  if it goes all that keeps us from the beast goes with it  one sees this at the front as clearly as one sees the french villages behind the german lines sometimes people steal away from them and bring word of what they endure  where the rifle and the bayonet serve men use those tools along the front  where the knife gives better results they go in behind the handgrenades with the naked twelveinch knife  each race is supposed to fight in its own way but this war has passed beyond all the known ways  they say that the belgians in the north settle accounts with a certain dry passion which has varied very little since their agony began some sections of the english line have produced a softvoiced rather reserved type which does its work with its mouth shut the french carry an edge to their fighting a precision and a dreadful knowledge coupled with an insensibility to shock unlike anything one has imagined of mankind  to be sure there has never been like provocation for never since the aesir went about to bind the fenris wolf has all the world united to bind the beast  the last i saw of the front was alan breck speeding back to his gunpositions among the mountains and i wondered what delight of what household the lad must have been in the old days  supports and reserves  then we had to work our way department by department against the tides of men behind the linesupports and their supports reserves and reserves of reserves as well as the masses in training  they flooded towns and villages and when we tried shortcuts we found them in every bylane  have you seen mounted men reading their home letters with the reins thrown on the horses necks moving in absorbed silence through a street which almost said hush to its dogs or met in a forest a procession of perfectly new big guns apparently taking themselves from the foundry to the front  in spite of their love of drama there is not much windowdressing in the french character  the boche who is the priest of the higher counterjumpery would have had half the neutral press out in cars to advertise these vast spectacles of men and material  but the same instinct as makes their rich farmers keep to their smocks makes the french keep quiet  this is our affair they argue  everybody concerned is taking part in it  like the review you saw the other day there are no spectators  but it might be of advantage if the world knew  mine was a foolish remark  there is only one world today the world of the allies  each of them knows what the others are doing andthe rest doesnt matter  this is a curious but delightful fact to realize at first hand  and think what it will be later when we shall all circulate among each other and open our hearts and talk it over in a brotherhood more intimate than the ties of blood  i lay that night at a little french town and was kept awake by a man somewhere in the hot still darkness howling aloud from the pain of his wounds  i was glad that he was alone for when one man gives way the others sometimes follow  yet the single note of misery was worse than the baying and gulping of a whole ward  i wished that a delegation of strikers could have heard it                            that a civilian should be in the war zone at all is a fair guarantee of his good faith  it is when he is outside the zone unchaperoned that questions begin and the permits are looked into  if these are irregularbut one doesnt care to contemplate it  if regular there are still a few counterchecks  as the sergeant at the railway station said when he helped us out of an impasse  you will realize that it is the most undesirable persons whose papers are of the most regular it is their business you see  the commissary of police is at the hotel de ville if you will come along for the little formality  myself i used to keep a shop in paris  my god these provincial towns are desolating  parisand no foreigners  he would have loved his paris as we found it  life was renewing itself in the streets whose drawing and proportion one could never notice before  peoples eyes and the womens especially seemed to be set to a longer range a more comprehensive gaze  one would have said they came from the sea or the mountains where things are few and simple rather than from houses  best of all there were no foreignersthe beloved city for the first time was french throughout from end to end  it felt like coming back to an old friends house for a quiet talk after he had got rid of a houseful of visitors the functionaries and police had dropped their masks of official politeness and were just friendly  at the hotels so like school two days before the term begins the impersonal valet the chambermaid of the set twofranc smile and the unbending headwaiter had given place to ones own brothers and sisters full of ones own anxieties  my son is an aviator monsieur  i could have claimed italian nationality for him at the beginning but he would not have it       both my brothers monsieur are at the war  one is dead already  and my fiance i have not heard from him since march  he is cook in a battalion        here is the winelist monsieur  yes both my sons and a nephew andi have no news of them not a word of news  my god we all suffer these days  and so too among the shopsthe mere statement of the loss or the grief at the heart but never a word of doubt never a whimper of despair  now why asked a shopkeeper does not our government or your government or both our governments send some of the british army to paris  i assure you we should make them welcome  perhaps i began you might make them too welcome  he laughed  we should make them as welcome as our own army they would enjoy themselves  i had a vision of british officers each with ninety days pay to his credit and a damsel or two at home shopping consumedly  and also said the shopkeeper the moral effect on paris to see more of your troops would be very good  but i saw a quite english provostmarshal losing himself in chase of defaulters of the new army who knew their paris still there is something to be said for the ideato the extent of a virtuous brigade or so  at present the english officer in paris is a scarce bird and he explains at once why he is and what he is doing there  he must have good reasons i suggested teeth to an acquaintance  no good he grumbled theyve thought of that too  behind our lines is simply crawling with dentists now  a people transfigured  if one asked after the people that gave dinners and dances last year where every one talked so brilliantly of such vital things one got in return the addresses of hospitals  those pleasant hostesses and maidens seemed to be in charge of departments or on duty in wards or kitchens or sculleries some of the hospitals were in paris  their staffs might have one hour a day in which to see visitors  others were up the line and liable to be shelled or bombed  i recalled one frenchwoman in particular because she had once explained to me the necessities of civilized life  these included a masseuse a manicurist and a maid to look after the lapdogs  she is employed now and has been for months past on the disinfection and repair of soldiers clothes there was no need to ask after the men one had known  still there was no sense of desolation  they had gone on the others were getting ready  all france works outward to the frontprecisely as an endless chain of firebuckets works toward the conflagration  leave the fire behind you and go back till you reach the source of supplies  you will find no break no pause no apparent haste but never any slackening  everybody has his or her bucket little or big and nobody disputes how they should be used  it is a people possessed of the precedent and tradition of war for existence accustomed to hard living and hard labour sanely economical by temperament logical by training and illumined and transfigured by their resolve and endurance  you know when supreme trial overtakes an acquaintance whom till then we conceived we knew how the mans nature sometimes changes past knowledge or belief  he who was altogether such an one as ourselves goes forward simply even lightly to heights we thought unattainable  though he is the very same comrade that lived our small life with us yet in all things he has become great  so it is with france today  she has discovered the measure of her soul  the new war  one sees this not alone in theit is more than contempt of deathin the godlike preoccupation of her people under arms which makes them put death out of the account but in the equal passion and fervour with which her people throughout give themselves to the smallest as well as the greatest tasks that may in any way serve their sword  i might tell you something that i saw of the cleaning out of certain latrines of the education and antecedents of the cleaners what they said in the matter and how perfectly the work was done  there was a little rabelais in it naturally but the rest was pure devotion rejoicing to be of use  similarly with stables barricades and barbedwire work the clearing and piling away of wrecked houserubbish the serving of meals till the service rocks on its poor tired feet but keeps its temper and all the unlovely monotonous details that go with war  the women as i have tried to show work stride for stride with the men with hearts as resolute and a spirit that has little mercy for shortcomings  a woman takes her place wherever she can relieve a manin the shop at the posts on the tramways the hotels and a thousand other businesses she is inured to fieldwork and half the harvest of france this year lies in her lap  one feels at every turn how her men trust her  she knows for she shares everything with her world what has befallen her sisters who are now in german hands and her soul is the undying flame behind the mens steel  neither men nor women have any illusion as to miracles presently to be performed which shall sweep out or drive back the boche  since the army is the nation they know much though they are officially told little  they all recognize that the oldfashioned victory of the past is almost as obsolete as a rifle in a frontline trench  they all accept the new war which means grinding down and wearing out the enemy by every means and plan and device that can be compassed  it is slow and expensive but as deadly sure as the logic that leads them to make it their one work their sole thought their single preoccupation  a nations confidence  the same logic saves them a vast amount of energy  they knew germany in 70 when the world would not believe in their knowledge they knew the german mind before the war they know what she has done they have photographs during this war they do not fall into spasms of horror and indignation over atrocities that cannot be mentioned as the english papers say  they mention them in full and book them to the account they do not discuss nor consider nor waste an emotion over anything that germany says or boasts or argues or implies or intrigues after  they have the hearts ease that comes from all being at work for their country the knowledge that the burden of work is equally distributed among all the certainty that the women are working side by side with the men the assurance that when one mans task is at the moment ended another takes his place  out of these things is born their power of recuperation in their leisure their reasoned calm while at work and their superb confidence in their arms  even if france of today stood alone against the worlds enemy it would be almost inconceivable to imagine her defeat now wholly so to imagine any surrender  the war will go on till the enemy is finished the french do not know when that hour will come they seldom speak of it they do not amuse themselves with dreams of triumphs or terms  their business is war and they do their business
