25353534	the gun  by philip k dick       nothing moved or stirred everything was silent dead only the gun     showed signs of life  and the trespassers had wrecked that for     all time the return journey to pick up the treasure would be a     cinch  they smiled   the captain peered into the eyepiece of the telescope he adjusted the focus quickly  it was an atomic fission we saw all right he said presently he sighed and pushed the eyepiece away any of you who wants to look may do so but its not a pretty sight  let me look tance the archeologist said he bent down to look squinting good lord he leaped violently back knocking against dorle the chief navigator  why did we come all this way then dorle asked looking around at the other men theres no point even in landing lets go back at once  perhaps hes right the biologist murmured but id like to look for myself if i may he pushed past tance and peered into the sight  he saw a vast expanse an endless surface of gray stretching to the edge of the planet at first he thought it was water but after a moment he realized that it was slag pitted fused slag broken only by hills of rock jutting up at intervals nothing moved or stirred everything was silent dead  i see fomar said backing away from the eyepiece well i wont find any legumes there he tried to smile but his lips stayed unmoved he stepped away and stood by himself staring past the others  i wonder what the atmospheric sample will show tance said  i think i can guess the captain answered most of the atmosphere is poisoned but didnt we expect all this i dont see why were so surprised a fission visible as far away as our system must be a terrible thing  he strode off down the corridor dignified and expressionless they watched him disappear into the control room  as the captain closed the door the young woman turned what did the telescope show good or bad  bad no life could possibly exist atmosphere poisoned water vaporized all the land fused  could they have gone underground  the captain slid back the port window so that the surface of the planet under them was visible the two of them stared down silent and disturbed mile after mile of unbroken ruin stretched out blackened slag pitted and scarred and occasional heaps of rock  suddenly nasha jumped look over there at the edge do you see it  they stared something rose up not rock not an accidental formation it was round a circle of dots white pellets on the dead skin of the planet a city buildings of some kind  please turn the ship nasha said excitedly she pushed her dark hair from her face turn the ship and lets see what it is  the ship turned changing its course as they came over the white dots the captain lowered the ship dropping it down as much as he dared piers he said piers of some sort of stone perhaps poured artificial stone the remains of a city  oh dear nasha murmured how awful she watched the ruins disappear behind them in a halfcircle the white squares jutted from the slag chipped and cracked like broken teeth  theres nothing alive the captain said at last i think well go right back i know most of the crew want to get the government receiving station on the sender and tell them what we found and that we  illustration                                       he staggered  the first atomic shell had struck the ship spinning it around the captain fell to the floor crashing into the control table papers and instruments rained down on him as he started to his feet the second shell struck the ceiling cracked open struts and girders twisted and bent the ship shuddered falling suddenly down then righting itself as automatic controls took over  the captain lay on the floor by the smashed control board in the corner nasha struggled to free herself from the debris  outside the men were already sealing the gaping leaks in the side of the ship through which the precious air was rushing dissipating into the void beyond help me dorle was shouting fire over here wiring ignited two men came running tance watched helplessly his eyeglasses broken and bent  so there is life here after all he said half to himself but how could  give us a hand fomar said hurrying past give us a hand weve got to land the ship  it was night a few stars glinted above them winking through the drifting silt that blew across the surface of the planet  dorle peered out frowning what a place to be stuck in he resumed his work hammering the bent metal hull of the ship back into place he was wearing a pressure suit there were still many small leaks and radioactive particles from the atmosphere had already found their way into the ship  nasha and fomar were sitting at the table in the control room pale and solemn studying the inventory lists  low on carbohydrates fomar said we can break down the stored fats if we want to but  i wonder if we could find anything outside nasha went to the window how uninviting it looks she paced back and forth very slender and small her face dark with fatigue what do you suppose an exploring party would find  fomar shrugged not much maybe a few weeds growing in cracks here and there nothing we could use anything that would adapt to this environment would be toxic lethal  nasha paused rubbing her cheek there was a deep scratch there still red and swollen then how do you explainit according to your theory the inhabitants must have died in their skins fried like yams but who fired on us somebody detected us made a decision aimed a gun  and gauged distance the captain said feebly from the cot in the corner he turned toward them thats the part that worries me the first shell put us out of commission the second almost destroyed us they were well aimed perfectly aimed were not such an easy target  true fomar nodded well perhaps well know the answer before we leave here what a strange situation all our reasoning tells us that no life could exist the whole planet burned dry the atmosphere itself gone completely poisoned  the gun that fired the projectiles survived nasha said why not people  its not the same metal doesnt need air to breathe metal doesnt get leukemia from radioactive particles metal doesnt need food and water  there was silence  a paradox nasha said anyhow in the morning i think we should send out a search party and meanwhile we should keep on trying to get the ship in condition for the trip back  itll be days before we can take off fomar said we should keep every man working here we cant afford to send out a party  nasha smiled a little well send you in the first party maybe you can discoverwhat was it you were so interested in  legumes edible legumes  maybe you can find some of them only  only what  only watch out they fired on us once without even knowing who we were or what we came for do you suppose that they fought with each other perhaps they couldnt imagine anyone being friendly under any circumstances what a strange evolutionary trait interspecies warfare fighting within the race  well know in the morning fomar said lets get some sleep                                       the sun came up chill and austere the three people two men and a woman stepped through the port dropping down on the hard ground below  what a day dorle said grumpily i said how glad id be to walk on firm ground again but  come on nasha said up beside me i want to say something to you will you excuse us tance  tance nodded gloomily dorle caught up with nasha they walked together their metal shoes crunching the ground underfoot nasha glanced at him  listen the captain is dying no one knows except the two of us by the end of the dayperiod of this planet hell be dead the shock did something to his heart he was almost sixty you know  dorle nodded thats bad i have a great deal of respect for him you will be captain in his place of course since youre vicecaptain now  no i prefer to see someone else lead perhaps you or fomar ive been thinking over the situation and it seems to me that i should declare myself mated to one of you whichever of you wants to be captain then i could devolve the responsibility  well i dont want to be captain let fomar do it  nasha studied him tall and blond striding along beside her in his pressure suit im rather partial to you she said we might try it for a time at least but do as you like look were coming to something  they stopped walking letting tance catch up in front of them was some sort of a ruined building dorle stared around thoughtfully  do you see this whole place is a natural bowl a huge valley see how the rock formations rise up on all sides protecting the floor maybe some of the great blast was deflected here  they wandered around the ruins picking up rocks and fragments i think this was a farm tance said examining a piece of wood this was part of a tower windmill  really nasha took the stick and turned it over interesting but lets go we dont have much time  look dorle said suddenly off there a long way off isnt that something he pointed  nasha sucked in her breath the white stones  what  nasha looked up at dorle the white stones the great broken teeth we saw them the captain and i from the control room she touched dorles arm gently thats where they fired from i didnt think we had landed so close  what is it tance said coming up to them im almost blind without my glasses what do you see  the city where they fired from  oh all three of them stood together well lets go tance said theres no telling what well find there dorle frowned at him  wait we dont know what we would be getting into they must have patrols they probably have seen us already for that matter  they probably have seen the ship itself tance said they probably know right now where they can find it where they can blow it up so what difference does it make whether we go closer or not  thats true nasha said if they really want to get us we havent a chance we have no armaments at all you know that  i have a hand weapon dorle nodded well lets go on then i suppose youre right tance  but lets stay together tance said nervously nasha youre going too fast  nasha looked back she laughed if we expect to get there by nightfall we must go fast                                       they reached the outskirts of the city at about the middle of the afternoon the sun cold and yellow hung above them in the colorless sky dorle stopped at the top of a ridge overlooking the city  well there it is whats left of it  there was not much left the huge concrete piers which they had noticed were not piers at all but the ruined foundations of buildings they had been baked by the searing heat baked and charred almost to the ground nothing else remained only this irregular circle of white squares perhaps four miles in diameter  dorle spat in disgust more wasted time a dead skeleton of a city thats all  but it was from here that the firing came tance murmured dont forget that  and by someone with a good eye and a great deal of experience nasha added lets go  they walked into the city between the ruined buildings no one spoke they walked in silence listening to the echo of their footsteps  its macabre dorle muttered ive seen ruined cities before but they died of old age old age and fatigue this was killed seared to death this city didnt dieit was murdered  i wonder what the city was called nasha said she turned aside going up the remains of a stairway from one of the foundations do you think we might find a signpost some kind of plaque  she peered into the ruins  theres nothing there dorle said impatiently come on  wait nasha bent down touching a concrete stone theres something inscribed on this  what is it tance hurried up he squatted in the dust running his gloved fingers over the surface of the stone letters all right he took a writing stick from the pocket of his pressure suit and copied the inscription on a bit of paper dorle glanced over his shoulder the inscription was      franklin apartments  thats this city nasha said softly that was its name  tance put the paper in his pocket and they went on after a time dorle said nasha you know i think were being watched but dont look around  the woman stiffened oh why do you say that did you see something  no i can feel it though dont you  nasha smiled a little i feel nothing but perhaps im more used to being stared at she turned her head slightly oh  dorle reached for his hand weapon what is it what do you see tance had stopped dead in his tracks his mouth half open  the gun nasha said its the gun  look at the size of it the size of the thing dorle unfastened his hand weapon slowly thats it all right  the gun was huge stark and immense it pointed up at the sky a mass of steel and glass set in a huge slab of concrete even as they watched the gun moved on its swivel base whirring underneath a slim vane turned with the wind a network of rods atop a high pole  its alive nasha whispered its listening to us watching us  the gun moved again this time clockwise it was mounted so that it could make a full circle the barrel lowered a trifle then resumed its original position  but who fires it tance said  dorle laughed no one no one fires it  they stared at him what do you mean  it fires itself  they couldnt believe him nasha came close to him frowning looking up at him i dont understand what do you mean it fires itself  watch ill show you dont move dorle picked up a rock from the ground he hesitated a moment and then tossed the rock high in the air the rock passed in front of the gun instantly the great barrel moved the vanes contracted                                       the rock fell to the ground the gun paused then resumed its calm swivel its slow circling  you see dorle said it noticed the rock as soon as i threw it up in the air its alert to anything that flies or moves above the ground level probably it detected us as soon as we entered the gravitational field of the planet it probably had a bead on us from the start we dont have a chance it knows all about the ship its just waiting for us to take off again  i understand about the rock nasha said nodding the gun noticed it but not us since were on the ground not above its only designed to combat objects in the sky the ship is safe until it takes off again then the end will come  but whats this gun for tance put in theres no one alive here everyone is dead  its a machine dorle said a machine that was made to do a job and its doing the job how it survived the blast i dont know on it goes waiting for the enemy probably they came by air in some sort of projectiles  the enemy nasha said their own race it is hard to believe that they really bombed themselves fired at themselves  well its over with except right here where were standing this one gun still alert ready to kill itll go on until it wears out  and by that time well be dead nasha said bitterly  there must have been hundreds of guns like this dorle murmured they must have been used to the sight guns weapons uniforms probably they accepted it as a natural thing part of their lives like eating and sleeping an institution like the church and the state men trained to fight to lead armies a regular profession honored respected  tance was walking slowly toward the gun peering nearsightedly up at it quite complex isnt it all those vanes and tubes i suppose this is some sort of a telescopic sight his gloved hand touched the end of a long tube  instantly the gun shifted the barrel retracting it swung  dont move dorle cried the barrel swung past them as they stood rigid and still for one terrible moment it hesitated over their heads clicking and whirring settling into position then the sounds died out and the gun became silent  tance smiled foolishly inside his helmet i must have put my finger over the lens ill be more careful he made his way up onto the circular slab stepping gingerly behind the body of the gun he disappeared from view  where did he go nasha said irritably hell get us all killed  tance come back dorle shouted whats the matter with you  in a minute there was a long silence at last the archeologist appeared i think ive found something come up and ill show you  what is it  dorle you said the gun was here to keep the enemy off i think i know why they wanted to keep the enemy off  they were puzzled  i think ive found what the gun is supposed to guard come and give me a hand  all right dorle said abruptly lets go he seized nashas hand come on lets see what hes found i thought something like this might happen when i saw that the gun was  like what nasha pulled her hand away what are you talking about you act as if you knew what hes found  i do dorle smiled down at her do you remember the legend that all races have the myth of the buried treasure and the dragon the serpent that watches it guards it keeping everyone away  she nodded well  dorle pointed up at the gun  that he said is the dragon come on                                       between the three of them they managed to pull up the steel cover and lay it to one side dorle was wet with perspiration when they finished  it isnt worth it he grunted he stared into the dark yawning hole or is it  nasha clicked on her hand lamp shining the beam down the stairs the steps were thick with dust and rubble at the bottom was a steel door  come on tance said excitedly he started down the stairs they watched him reach the door and pull hopefully on it without success give a hand  all right they came gingerly after him dorle examined the door it was bolted shut locked there was an inscription on the door but he could not read it  now what nasha said  dorle took out his hand weapon stand back i cant think of any other way he pressed the switch the bottom of the door glowed red presently it began to crumble dorle clicked the weapon off i think we can get through lets try  the door came apart easily in a few minutes they had carried it away in pieces and stacked the pieces on the first step then they went on flashing the light ahead of them  they were in a vault dust lay everywhere on everything inches thick wood crates lined the walls huge boxes and crates packages and containers tance looked around curiously his eyes bright  what exactly are all these he murmured something valuable i would think he picked up a round drum and opened it a spool fell to the floor unwinding a black ribbon he examined it holding it up to the light  look at this  they came around him pictures nasha said tiny pictures  records of some kind tance closed the spool up in the drum again look hundreds of drums he flashed the light around and those crates lets open one  dorle was already prying at the wood the wood had turned brittle and dry he managed to pull a section away  it was a picture a boy in a blue garment smiling pleasantly staring ahead young and handsome he seemed almost alive ready to move toward them in the light of the hand lamp it was one of them one of the ruined race the race that had perished  for a long time they stared at the picture at last dorle replaced the board  all these other crates nasha said more pictures and these drums what are in the boxes  this is their treasure tance said almost to himself here are their pictures their records probably all their literature is here their stories their myths their ideas about the universe  and their history nasha said well be able to trace their development and find out what it was that made them become what they were  dorle was wandering around the vault odd he murmured even at the end even after they had begun to fight they still knew someplace down inside them that their real treasure was this their books and pictures their myths even after their big cities and buildings and industries were destroyed they probably hoped to come back and find this after everything else was gone  when we get back home we can agitate for a mission to come here tance said all this can be loaded up and taken back well be leaving about  he stopped  yes dorle said dryly well be leaving about three dayperiods from now well fix the ship then take off soon well be home that is if nothing happens like being shot down by that  oh stop it nasha said impatiently leave him alone hes right all this must be taken back home sooner or later well have to solve the problem of the gun we have no choice  dorle nodded whats your solution then as soon as we leave the ground well be shot down his face twisted bitterly theyve guarded their treasure too well instead of being preserved it will lie here until it rots it serves them right  how  dont you see this was the only way they knew building a gun and setting it up to shoot anything that came along they were so certain that everything was hostile the enemy coming to take their possessions away from them well they can keep them  nasha was deep in thought her mind far away suddenly she gasped dorle she said whats the matter with us we have no problem the gun is no menace at all  the two men stared at her  no menace dorle said its already shot us down once and as soon as we take off again  dont you see nasha began to laugh the poor foolish gun its completely harmless even i could deal with it alone  you  her eyes were flashing with a crowbar with a hammer or a stick of wood lets go back to the ship and load up of course were at its mercy in the air thats the way it was made it can fire into the sky shoot down anything that flies but thats all against something on the ground it has no defenses isnt that right  dorle nodded slowly the soft underbelly of the dragon in the legend the dragons armor doesnt cover its stomach he began to laugh thats right thats perfectly right  lets go then nasha said lets get back to the ship we have work to do here                                       it was early the next morning when they reached the ship during the night the captain had died and the crew had ignited his body according to custom they had stood solemnly around it until the last ember died as they were going back to their work the woman and the two men appeared dirty and tired still excited  and presently from the ship a line of people came each carrying something in his hands the line marched across the gray slag the eternal expanse of fused metal when they reached the weapon they all fell on the gun at once with crowbars hammers anything that was heavy and hard  the telescopic sights shattered into bits the wiring was pulled out torn to shreds the delicate gears were smashed dented  finally the warheads themselves were carried off and the firing pins removed  the gun was smashed the great weapon destroyed the people went down into the vault and examined the treasure with its metalarmored guardian dead there was no danger any longer they studied the pictures the films the crates of books the jeweled crowns the cups the statues  at last as the sun was dipping into the gray mists that drifted across the planet they came back up the stairs again for a moment they stood around the wrecked gun looking at the unmoving outline of it  then they started back to the ship there was still much work to be done the ship had been badly hurt much had been damaged and lost the important thing was to repair it as quickly as possible to get it into the air  with all of them working together it took just five more days to make it spaceworthy                                       nasha stood in the control room watching the planet fall away behind them she folded her arms sitting down on the edge of the table  what are you thinking dorle said  i nothing  are you sure  i was thinking that there must have been a time when this planet was quite different when there was life on it  i suppose there was its unfortunate that no ships from our system came this far but then we had no reason to suspect intelligent life until we saw the fission glow in the sky  and then it was too late  not quite too late after all their possessions their music books their pictures all of that will survive well take them home and study them and theyll change us we wont be the same afterwards their sculpturing especially did you see the one of the great winged creature without a head or arms broken off i suppose but those wings it looked very old it will change us a great deal  when we come back we wont find the gun waiting for us nasha said next time it wont be there to shoot us down we can land and take the treasure as you call it she smiled up at dorle youll lead us back there as a good captain should  captain dorle grinned then youve decided  nasha shrugged fomar argues with me too much i think all in all i really prefer you  then lets go dorle said lets go back home  the ship roared up flying over the ruins of the city it turned in a huge arc and then shot off beyond the horizon heading into outer space                                       down below in the center of the ruined city a single halfbroken detector vane moved slightly catching the roar of the ship the base of the great gun throbbed painfully straining to turn after a moment a red warning light flashed on down inside its destroyed works  and a long way off a hundred miles from the city another warning light flashed on far underground automatic relays flew into action gears turned belts whined on the ground above a section of metal slag slipped back a ramp appeared  a moment later a small cart rushed to the surface  the cart turned toward the city a second cart appeared behind it it was loaded with wiring cables behind it a third cart came loaded with telescopic tube sights and behind came more carts some with relays some with firing controls some with tools and parts screws and bolts pins and nuts the final one contained atomic warheads  the carts lined up behind the first one the lead cart the lead cart started off across the frozen ground bumping calmly along followed by the others moving toward the city  to the damaged gun
