37159913	the madman and the pirate by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a beautiful island lying like a gem on the breast of the great pacific a coral reef surrounding and a calm lagoon within on the glasslike surface of which rests a most piraticallooking schooner  such is the scene to which we invite our readers attention for a little while  at the time of which we write it was an eminently peaceful scene  so still was the atmosphere so unruffled the water that the island and the piraticallooking schooner seemed to float in the centre of a duplex world where every cloudlet in the blue above had its exact counterpart in the blue below  no sounds were heard save the dull roar of the breaker that fell at long regular intervals on the seaward side of the reef and no motion was visible except the backfin of a shark as it cut a line occasionally on the sea or the stately sweep of an albatross as it passed above the schooners masts and cast a look of solemn inquiry upon her deck  but that schooner was not a pirate  she was an honest traderat least so it was saidthough what she traded in we have no more notion than the albatross which gazed at her with such inquisitive sagacity  her decks were not particularly clean her sails by no means snowwhite she had indeed four goodlysized carronades but these were not an extraordinary part of a peaceful traders armament in those regions where man was and still is unusually savage  the familiar union jack hung at her peak and some of her men were sedatelooking englishmen though others were lascars and malays of the cutthroat type of whom any wickedness might be expected when occasion served  the crew seemed to have been overcome by the same somnolent influence that had subdued nature for they all lay about the deck sleeping or dozing in various sprawling attitudes with the exception of the captain and the mate  the former was a huge rugged man of forbidding aspect and obviously savage temper  the latterwell it is not easy to say what were his chief characteristics so firmly did he control the features of a fine countenance in which the tigerlike blue eyes alone seemed untamable he was not much above the middle height but his compact frame was wiry and full of youthful force  lower away the dinghy said the captain gruffly to the mate and let one of these lazy lubbers get into her with a box of figs  get into her yourself  i may want you  the mate replied with a stern ay ay sir and rose from the guncarriage on which he had been seated while the captain went below  in a few minutes the latter reappeared and soon the little boat with its three occupants was skimming over the lagoon towards the land  on that land a strange and interesting work was going on at the time it was no less than the erection of a church by men who had never before placed one stone upon anotherat least with a view to housebuilding  the tribe to which these builders belonged had at first received their missionary with yells of execration had torn the garments from his back had kicked him into the sea and would infallibly have drowned him if the boat from which he landed had not returned in haste and rescued him  fortunately that missionary was well accustomed to a state of nudity being himself a south sea islander  he was also used to a pretty rough life besides being young and strong  he therefore soon recovered from the treatment he had received and not many weeks afterwards determined to make another attempt to land on the island of ratingaas our coralgem on the oceans breast was named  for waroongas heart had been opened by the holy spirit to receive jesus christ and the consequent flame of love to the souls of his countrymen burned too brightly to be quenched by a first failure  the desire to possess the little box of clothes and trifles with which he had landed on ratinga had been the cause he thought of the savages attacking him so he resolved to divest himself totally of this worlds goods and go to his brethren with nothing but the word of god in his hand  he did so the missionboat once again conveyed him from headquarters to the scene of his former discomfiture and when close to the beach where the natives awaited the landing of the party with warlike demonstrations he slipped out of his clothes into the water and swam ashorethe bible in the native tongue being tied carefully on the top of his head to keep it dry  surprise at this mode of proceeding caused the natives to receive him with less violence than before  their curiosity led them to listen to what he had to say  then a chief named tomeo took him by the shoulders placed his nose against that of waroonga and rubbed it  this being equivalent to a friendly shake of the hand the missionary signalled to his friends in the boat to go away which they accordingly did and left their courageous brother to his fate  it is not our purpose to recount the whole history of this good mans enterprise  let it suffice to say that the natives of ratinga turned round childlikeand they were little more than grown up children swallowed all he had to say and did all he bid them door nearly all for of course there were a few selfwilled characters among them who objected at first to the wholesale changes that waroonga introduced in their manners and customs  in the course of a few months they formally embraced christianity burned their idols and solemnly promised that if any more unfortunate ships or boats chanced to be wrecked on their shores they would refrain from eating the mariners  thus much accomplished waroonga in the joy of his heart launched a canoe and with some of his converts went off to headquarters to fetch his wife he fetched her and she fetched a fat little brown female baby along with her  missionaries to the southern seas as is well known endeavour to impress on converts the propriety not to say decency of a moderate amount of clothing  mrs waroongawho had been named betsy was therefore presented to the astonished natives of ratinga in a short calico gown of sunflower pattern with a flounce at the bottom a bright yellow neckerchief and a coalscuttle bonnet which quivered somewhat in consequence of being too large and of slender build  decency and propriety not being recognised apparently among infants the brown babywho had been named zariffa at baptismlanded in what may be styled adamite costume  then waroonga built himself a bamboo house and set up a school  soon after that he induced a half italian half spanish sailor named antonio zeppa who had been bred in england to settle with his wife and son on the island and take charge of the school  for this post zeppa and his wife were well qualified both having received an education beyond that usually given to persons in their rank of life  besides this antonio zeppa had a gigantic frame a genial disposition and a spirit of humility or rather childlike simplicity which went far to ingratiate him with the savages  after several years residence in this field of labour waroonga conceived the grand idea of building a house of god  it was to be built of coralrock cemented together with corallime  now it was while the good people of ratinga were in the first fervour of this new enterprise that the dinghy with its three occupants approached their shore  at that particular point of time the walls of the new church had begun to rise above the foundations for the chief tomeo had entered into the matter with intense enthusiasm and as tomeo was supreme chief every one else felt bound to follow his example and work hard but to do them justice they required no stimulant the whole community entered into it with inexpressible glee  zeppa taught them everything because no one else knew anything except of course waroonga who however was not much in advance of his native congregation save in spiritual matters  zeppa showed them how to burn lime out of the coralrock and they gazed with openeyedand openmouthed wonder at the process  then the great chief tomeo gave the word to burn lime and buttchee the chief second in command backed him up by kicking the native nearest to his foot and echoing the order go burn lime  the entire population began to burn lime forthwith and would have gone on burning lime enough to have built a south sea pyramid equal to cheops if they had not been checked and their blazing energies turned into stonehewing and dressing and other channels  thus the work went on merrily and so engrossed were they with it that they did not at first observe the arrival of the visitors  of course they were aware of the schooners presence and had been off to her the previous day before she had furled her sails to offer fruits and vegetables but it was some time before they discovered that three strangers had landed and were gazing at them while they toiled  zeppa had a black servant a negro whom he had induced to follow him this man took a prominent oversight of the works  he was by nature a cook but churchbuilding occupied his leisure moments and he prided himself upon being not only cleverer but considerably blacker than the islanders  now you keep out ob de road leetil za  this was addressed to zariffa who by that time could not only toddle but trowel besides being able to swim like a duck  take care missy za dat clumsy feller wid the big stonelet him fall andoh  the negro gave vent to a yell for the accident he feared actually occurred  the clumsy native let a huge piece of coralrock fall from his shoulder which just missed crushing the brown little girl  it dropped on a mass of soft lime which flew up in all directions making zariffa piebald at once and what was more serious sending a lump straight into tomeos face  this was too much for the great man  he seized the culprit by the neck and thrust his brown visage down upon the lime from which he arose white leaving a beautiful cast of his features behind him  tomeo was pacified at once  he burst into a loud laugh while the guilty man slunk humbly away not however without receiving a salute from buttchees active foot in passing  at this moment zeppa came up holding his son orlando a wellgrown lad of fourteen by the hand  he at once observed the captain of the schooner and going forward shook hands with him and the mate  he had made their acquaintance the day before when the vessel anchored in the lagoon  i have come to say goodbye mr zeppa  we have finished taking in fresh water sooner than i had expected and will be ready to sail with the evening breeze  indeed  i regret this for various reasons replied zeppa in a soft musical voice that one scarcely expected to issue from such a capacious chest  there was about the man an air of gentle urbanity and tenderness which might have induced a stranger to suppose him effeminate had not his manly looks and commanding stature rendered the idea absurd  in the first place he continued my wife and i had hoped to show you some hospitality  you know we seldom have visitors to this outoftheway island  then we wanted your advice with regard to the building of our church which you see is progressing rapidly and last but not least i wished to ask a favour which it will be impossible to grant if you sail tonight  perhaps not impossible said captain daniel whose gruff nature was irresistibly mellowed by the sweet spirit of the giant who addressed him  what dye want me to do  i meant to ask a passage in your vessel for my son and myself to the island of otava  it is not far off and you said yesterday that you intend to pass close to it  you see i am something of a trader as well as a missionaryschoolmaster but if you sail tonight i have not time to get ready  if thats all your difficulty returned the captain ill delay till tomorrow night  a day wont make much differencewill it mr rosco he said turning to the mate  you know best replied the mate somewhat sharply i dont command the schooner  the captain looked at the officer with an angry frown and then turning quickly to zeppa said  well if that time will do it is settled  you and your son may go with me  and see here ive brought a box of figs for your wife since you wont take anything for the help you gave me this morning  you shall present it yourself said zeppa with a pleased smile  hi  ebony hailing the negro tell marie to come here  she is in the palmgrove  ebony found his mistress and delivered his message  madame zeppa was a pretty little fair woman of french extraction  she had been a ladysmaid and having been born and brought up chiefly in england spoke english fluently though with a slightly foreign accent derived from her mother  missis said the negro in a low voice and with a mysterious look as he followed her out of the palmgrove massa him wants to go wid schooner  don let him go  why not ebony  kase i no likes him  you dont like the schooner  no de cappin ob de skooner  hims bad man for certin  please don let massa go  you know i never give master his orders returned madame with a light laugh  better if you did now an den muttered the negro in a tone however which rendered the advice not very distinct  the fair little woman received the box of figs graciously the captain and mate were invited to the abode of zeppa where they met the native missionary and soon after returned to their vessel to make preparations for departure  marie said zeppa that night as they with their boy sat down to rest after the labours of the day i expect to be away about three weeks with anything of a wind the schooner will land us on otava in two or three days  business wont detain me long and a large canoe well manned will bring orlando and me back to you in a week or so  it is the first time i shall have left you for so long since our wedding  you wont be anxious little woman  i would not be anxious if i were sure you went with good people returned marie with a slightly troubled look but are you sure of the captain  i am sure of nobody except you marie returned her husband with a smile that contained a dash of amusement in it  and me father said orlando assuming an injured look  well orley i cant say that i am quite sure of you you rascal returned his father playfully  that spice of mischief in your composition shakes me at times  however we will leave that question to another time  meanwhile what makes you doubt the captain marie  ebony seems to doubt him and i have great faith in ebonys judgment  so have i but he is not infallible  we should never get on in life if we gave way to groundless fears dear wife  besides have we not the promise lo i am with you alway  on the following afternoon a fresh breeze sprang up and the piraticallooking schooner bowing gracefully before it sailed across the now ruffled lagoon and stood out to sea while marie with the missionary and his wife and a crowd of natives stood at the end of the coral wharf waving farewell to zeppa and his son as long as their figures could be distinguished  after that they continued to gaze at the diminishing vessel until it melted like a little speck at the meetingplace of sea and sky  that night an event which had been long pending was precipitated  captain daniel had given way to his fierce temper so often during the voyage and had behaved with such cruel tyranny to his crew that they had resolved to stand it no longer  his harsh conduct to the mate in particular who was a favourite with the men had fostered the spirit of indignation and the mate himself being a man of no fixed principles although goodnatured enough when not roused had at last determined to side with the men  he was a man of fierce passions and had been roused by his superiors tyranny and insolence to almost uncontrollable fury but he had not at that time been guilty of absolute insubordination  when the vessels course had been laid that nightwhich chanced to be a friday as some of the crew afterwards rememberedand the cabin lamp had been lighted the captain sent for the mate who saw by his looks that a storm was brewing  what did you mean sir began the captain at once by that insolent reply you made to me on shore yesterday  the young man might have answered temperately if they had been alone but zeppa was lying on a locker reading and his son was also present and rosco knew that the captain meant to put him to shame before them his spirit fired  scoundrel he cried the measure of your iniquity is filled  you shall no longer command this schooner  thus far he got when the captain livid with rage sprang up to rush at him  zeppa also leaped up to aid in putting down what he clearly perceived was premeditated mutiny but the mate sprang out of the cabin and shutting the door with a bang locked it  at the same instant the man at the wheelknowing what had occurredclosed and fastened the cabin skylight  the captain threw himself several times with all his weight against the door but it opened inwards and could not be forced  there were two square windows in the stern of the schooner one of which was open  orlando perceived this sprang up clambered through it gained the deck unperceived and running down the companion stair past all the men rushed against the cabin door and burst it open  zeppa was endeavouring at the moment to wrench off the lock and was nearly thrown back  recovering he struck fiercely out at those who thronged the dark passage  oh father groaned orlando as he fell before the blow  with a terrible cry of consternation zeppa stooped to pick up his child he was felled with a handspike as he did so the crew then rushed into the cabin and the captain was overpowered and bound  overboard wi them all shouted one of the men  there were some among these villains who having once given the reins to their rage were capable of anything  these ready to act on the diabolical suggestion attempted to drag zeppa and the captain up the companion ladder but their great size and weight rendered the effort difficult  besides zeppas consciousness was returning and he struggled powerfully  it was otherwise with poor orlando  one of the ruffians easily raised the lads light frame and bore him to the deck next moment a sharp cry and splash were heard  zeppa understood it for he had seen his son carried away  with a wild shout he burst from those who held him and would certainly have gained the deck and leaped overboard had not a mutineer from behind felled him a second time  when rosco heard what had been done he ran furiously on deck but one glance at the dark sea as the schooner rushed swiftly over it sufficed to show him that the poor boys case was hopeless  but orleys case was not as hopeless as it seemed  the plunge revived him  accustomed to swim for hours at a time in these warm waters he found no difficulty in supporting himself  of course his progress was aimless for he could not see any distance around him but a friend had been raised up for him in that desperate hour  at the moment he had been tossed overboard a sailor with a touch of pity left in his breast had seized a lifebuoy and thrown it after him  orlando after swimming about for a few minutes struck against this buoy by chanceif we may venture to use that word in the circumstances  seizing the lifepreserver with an earnest thank god in his heart if not on his lips he clung to it and looked anxiously around  the sight was sufficiently appalling  thick darkness still brooded on the deep and nothing was visible save now and then the crest of a breaking wave as it passed close to him or rolling under him deluged his face with spray    chapter two  when antonio zeppa recovered consciousness he found himself lying on a mattress in the schooners hold bound bleeding and with a dull and dreadful sense of pain at his breast which at first he could not account for  ere long the sudden plash of a wave on the vessels side recalled his mind to his bereavement and a cryloud long and terriblearose from the vessels hold which caused even the stoutest and most reckless heart on board to quail  richard rosconow a pirate captainheard it as he sat alone in his cabin his elbows resting on the table and his white face buried in his hands  he did not repenthe could not repent at least so he said to himself while the fires kindled by a first great crime consumed him  men do not reach the profoundest depths of wickedness at one bound  the descent is always graduatedfor there are successive rounds to the ladder of sinbut it is sometimes awfully sudden  when young rosco left england he had committed only deeds which men are apt lightly to name the follies of youth  these follies however had proved to be terrible leaks through which streams of corruption had flowed in upon his soul  still he had no thought of becoming a reckless or heartless man and would have laughed to scorn any one who should have hinted that he would ever become an outlaw and a pirate  but oppression bore heavily on his hasty illdisciplined temper and now the lowest round of the ladder had been reached  even in this extremity he did not utterly give way  he would not become an outandout pirate  he would merely go forth as a plunderer to revenge himself on the world which had used him so ill  he would rob but he would not kill except of course in selfdefence or when men refused to give up what he demanded  he would temper retributive justice with mercy and would not suffer injury to women or children in short he would become a semihonourable highminded sort of pirate pursuing wealth without bloodshed  true in the sad case of poor orlando he had not managed to steer clear of murder but then that deed was done without his orders or knowledge  if his comrades in crime had agreed he would have preferred some sort of smuggling career but they would not listen to that so he had at last consented to hoist the black flag  while the wretched youth was endeavouring to delude himself and gather crumbs of comfort from such thoughts as these the awful cry from the ships hold again rang out and as his thoughts reverted to the bereaved father and the fair lighthearted little mother on ratinga island the deadly pallor that overspread his countenance was intensified  rising hastilywith what intent he himself hardly knewhe proceeded to the hold  it was broad day at the time and sufficient light penetrated the place to reveal the figure of antonio zeppa crouching on his mattress with his chin upon his knees his handsome face disfigured with the blood that had dried upon it and a wild fierce light gleaming in his eyes  he did not speak or move when rosco entered and sat down on the head of a cask near him  zeppa he said with intense earnestness as god shall be my judge i did not mean totothrowto do this to your boy  it was done without my knowledge  hah burst from the stricken father but nothing more while he continued to gaze in the pirate captains face  indeed it is true continued rosco hurriedly  i had no intention of letting murder be done  i would not even slay the captain who has used me so ill  i would give my life if i could alter it nowbut i cannot  hah gasped zeppa again still keeping his eyes fixed on roscos face  dont look at me that way pleaded the pirate as if i had done the deed  you know i didnt  i swear i didnt  if i had been there i would have saved orlando at the cost of  he was interrupted at this point by the repetition of the cry which had before reached him in the cabin but how much more awful did that despairing cry sound near at hand as it issued full deeptoned and strong from the chest of the herculean man  there was a difference in it also this timeit terminated in a wild fiendish fit of laughter which caused rosco to shrink back appalled for now he knew that he confronted a maniac  for some minutes the madman and the pirate sat gazing at each other in silent horror  then the latter rose hastily and turned to leave the hold  as he did so the madman sprang towards him but he was checked by the chains which bound him and fell heavily on the deck  returning to the cabin rosco went to a locker and took out a case bottle from which he poured half a tumbler of brandy and drank it then he summoned the man who had been appointed his second in command  redford he said assuming by a mighty effort of selfrestraint a calm tone and manner you told me once of a solitary island lying a long way to the south of the fiji group  dyou think you could lay our course for it  im sure i could sir but it is very much out of the way of commerce and  there is much sandalwood on it is there not asked rosco interrupting him  ay sir plenty of that an plenty of fierce natives too who will give us a warm reception  i would  so much the better returned the captain with a cynical smile again interrupting we may be able to obtain a load of valuable wood for nothing and get rid of our cowards at the same time  go lay our course forwhats the islands name  i dont know its right name sir but we call it sugarloaf island from the shape of one end of it  that will do  and hark ye friend when i give orders or ask questions in future dont venture to offer advice or raise objections  let the crew understand that we must be able to pass for lawful traders and that a load of sandalwood will answer our purpose well enough  it will be your wisdom also to bear in mind that discipline is as useful on board a free rover as on board a manofwar and that there is only one way to maintain it  the pirate captain pointed to a brace of pistols that lay on the table beside him and said go  redford went without uttering another word  his was one of those coarse natures which are ever ready to presume and take advantage when there is laxity in discipline but which are not difficult to subdue by a superior will  he forthwith spread the report that the new captain was a stiff un a fact which nearly all the men were rather glad than otherwise to hear  for some days after leaving ratinga a stiff breeze enabled the schoonerwhich had been renamed by its crew the free roverto proceed southward rapidly  then a profound calm succeeded and for a couple of days the vessel lay almost motionless on the sea  during all this time the poor maniac in her hold lay upon his bloodstained couch for no one daredat least no one caredto approach him  at meal times the cook pushed a plate of food within his reach  he usually took no notice of this until hunger constrained him to devour a little almost savagely  no word would he speak but moaned continually without intermission save when in a burst of uncontrollable anguish he gave vent to the terrible cry which so weighed on the spirits of the men that they suggested to each other the propriety of throwing the father overboard after the son  redfords report of his interview with the captain however prevented the suggestion being acted on  it is possible that the two tremendous blows which zeppa had received during the mutiny may have had something to do with his madness but there can be no doubt that the intense mutual affection which had subsisted between him and his only child and the sudden and awful manner of that childs end were of themselves sufficient to account for it  for orlando had been all that a father could wish loving gentle tender yet lionlike and courageous in action with a powerful frame like that of his father and a modest cheerful spirit like that of his mother  no wonder that both parents doted on him as their noblest terrestrial gift from god  and now thought the crushed man as he crouched on his mattress in the hold he is gonesnatched away before my eyes suddenly and for ever  it was when this thought recurred again and again that the cry of agony burst from him but it was invariably succeeded by the thought no not for ever  orlando is with the lord  we shall see him again marie and i when we reach the better land  and then zeppa would laugh lightly but the laugh would merge again into the bitter cry as the thought would recur persistentlygonegone for ever  oh it was pitiful to see the strong man thus reduced and reason dethroned and terrible were the pangs endured by the pirate chief as he heard and saw but he had now schooled himself to accept what he called his fate and was able to maintain a calm indifferent demeanour before his men  of course he never for a moment during all that time thought of crying to god for mercy for as long as a man continues to ascribe his sins and their consequences to fate he is a rampant and wilful besides being an unphilosophical rebel against his maker  at last one afternoon the peak of sugarloaf island was descried on the horizon close to where the sun was descending amid a world of golden clouds  which side is the best for landing on asked the captain of his mate  the southern end sir which is steep and uninhabited said redford  in half an hour they were under the shelter of the cliffs close to a creek at the inner end of which there was a morsel of flat beach beyond this lay a richly wooded piece of land which seemed to be connected with a gorge among the hills  lower the boat said rosco  have three men ready and when i call send them to the hold  he descended as he spoke and approached zeppa who looked at him with unmistakable ferocity  you are going on shore he said to the poor madman who seemed neither to comprehend nor to care for what he said  once again continued rosco after a pause i tell you that i had no hand in the death of your son  my men if they had their way would soon treat you as they treated him  they want to get rid of you so to save your life i must send you on shore  it is an islandinhabited i hope the natives will prove friendly to you  i hope you will get wellin time  do you understand what i say  zeppa neither spoke nor moved but continued to glare at the man whom he evidently regarded as his deadliest foe  a touch of pity seemed to influence the pirate captain for he added in a softer tone i would have taken you with me if it had been possible and landed you on ratinga  perhaps that may yet be done  at any rate i will return to this islandwe shall meet again  at last the madman spoke in a harsh grating toneif we meet again you shall die  i will do my best to avoid that fate returned rosco with a touch of sarcasm  ho lads come down  three powerful seamen who had stood at the hatchway awaiting the summons descended and at once laid hold of zeppa  to their surprise he made no resistance  to every one but the captain he behaved liked a lamb  having been placed in the bottom of the boat alongside with his hands still bound they shoved off and rosco taking the tiller steered for the little creek  the instant the keel touched the land two of the men jumped out and hauled the boat ashore  the others assisted zeppa to land  they led him to a grassy bank and bade him sit down  he obeyed meekly and sat there gazing at the ground as if unable to comprehend what was being done  rosco remained in the boat while a small box of biscuit was conveyed to the spot and left at the side of zeppa  then removing his bonds the men reembarked and returned to the schooner which soon left that part of the island far astern  while it receded the pirate captain kept his glass fixed on the wretched man whom he had thus forsaken  he saw that zeppa never once turned his head seaward but after gazing in a state of abstraction at the ground for some time rose and sauntered slowly inland  he did not appear to observe the small supply of provision left for his use  with his chin sunk upon his breast and his hands clasped behind him he appeared to wander aimlessly forward until his tall figure was lost to view among the palmgroves that fringed the bottom of the mountain  leaving him there we shall turn now to poor orlando who had been tossed so unceremoniously into the sea  probably the reader is aware that the water of the southern seas is in many parts so much warmer than that of our northern climes that people may remain in it for hours without being chilled  hence natives of the coral islands are almost amphibious and our young hero having spent much of his life among these islands could swim for the greater part of a day without becoming exhausted  when therefore he caught hold of the lifepreserver as stated in the last chapter he clung to it with some degree of confidence but by degrees the depressing influence of continued darkness began to tell upon him and he became less and less hopeful of deliverance  he bethought him of the great distance they had sailed from ratinga before the mutiny broke out and the utter impossibility of his being able to swim back  then he thought of sharks and a nervous tendency to draw up his legs and yell out affected him  but the thought of his father and of the probable fate that awaited him at length overbore all other considerations and threw the poor boy into such a state of despair that he clung to the lifepreserver for a long time in a state of semistupor  at last the day dawned faintly in the east and the glorious sun arose and orleys heart was cheered  from earliest infancy he had been taught to pray so you may be sure he did not fail at this crisis in his young life  but no answer was returned to his prayer until a great part of the weary day had passed and he had begun to look forward with dread to the approaching night  as evening advanced exhaustion began to creep over him and more than once he felt himself slipping from his support under the influence of sleep  the struggle to retain consciousness now became terrible  he fought the battle in many ways  sometimes he tried to shake himself up by shouting  then he again had recourse to prayer in a loud voice once he even attempted to sing but his heart failed him and at last he could do nothing but grasp the lifebuoy and cling with all the tenacity of despair  and oh what thoughts of his mother came over him then it seemed as if every loving act and look of hers was recalled to his mind  how he longed to clasp her once more in his arms and kiss her before he died  while these thoughts were gradually taking the form of a hazy dream he was rudely aroused by something grasping his hair  sharks of course leaped to his mind and he struggled round with a wild gurgling shriek for the grasp partially sank him  then he felt himself violently dragged upwards and his eyes encountered the dark face and glittering eyeballs of a savage  then was orleys cry of fear turned into a shout of joy for in that dark countenance he recognised the face of a friend  a canoe full of ratinga natives had nearly run him down  they had been absent on an expedition and were alike ignorant of the visit of the free rover and the departure of antonio zeppa  their astonishment at finding orlando in such a plight was only equalled by their curiosity to know how he had come there but they were compelled to exercise patience for the poor boy overcome by mingled joy and exhaustion fell back in a swoon almost as soon as he was hauled out of the water  need we describe the state into which poor madame zeppa was thrown when orlando returned to herthe strange mingling of grief and terrible anxiety about her husbands fate with grateful joy at the restoration of her son  we think not  ebony the faithful and sable servitor of the family got hold of orlando as soon as his poor mother would let him go and hurried him off to a certain nook in the neighbouring palmgrove where he was wont to retire at times for meditation  yous quite sure yous fadder was not shooted he began in gasping anxiety when he had forced the boy down on a grassy bank  i think not replied orley with a faint smile at the negros eagerness  but you must remember that i was almost unconscious from the blow i received and scarce knew what was done  but you no hear no shootin persisted ebony  no and if any shots had been fired i feel certain i should have heard and remembered them  good den ders a chance yous fadders alive for if de no hab shooted him at first de no hab de heart to shoot him arterwards  no hed smile away der wikitness de couldn do it  orlando was unable to derive much comfort from this sanguine view of the influence of his fathers smilebright and sweet though he knew it to beyet with the energy of youth he grasped at any straw of hope held out to him  all the more that ebonys views were emphatically backed up by the chiefs tomeo and buttchee both of whom asserted that zeppa had never failed in anything he had ever undertaken and that it was impossible he should fail now  thus encouraged orlando returned home to comfort his mother    chapter three  but orleys mother refused to be comforted  what she had heard or read of pirates induced her to believe that mercy must necessarily be entirely banished from their hearts and her husband she knew full well would sooner die than join them  therefore she argued in her despair antonio must have perished  but mother said orley in a soothing tone you must remember that rosco and his men are not regular pirates  i only heard them shout hoist the black flag when they seized me but that does not prove that they did hoist it or that rosco agreed to do so  they were only mutineers you see and not hardened villains  hardened enough when they threw you overboard my son returned poor little madame zeppa with a sob  true but that was in the hurry of the rising and without orders from rosco as far as i know  besides mother have you not often told me that god will never forsake his own children  surely then he will not forsake father  no oh no the good lord will never forsake him  he will certainly deliver his soul from sin and death but god sometimes sees fit to allow the bodies of his children to suffer and die  it may be so now  yes mother but also it may not be so now  let us take a hopeful view and do what we can to find outto findto  poor orlando broke down here laid his head on his little mothers shoulder and wept for his mind had suddenly run itself blank  what was there to find out what could they do  nothing absolutely nothing except pray and they did that fervently  then orley went out to consult again with his friends  alas there was no other outlet for their grief save prayer and consultation for action was in the circumstances impossible  bin tink tinkin horroble hard all last night  couldn sleep a wink said ebony one day some weeks after the return of orlando when according to custom he and the native missionary and his wife with the chiefs tomeo and buttchee assembled for a consultation in the palmgrove  what have you been thinking about asked orley  yous fadder ob course  of course repeated the boy but what have you been thinking about himanything new  not zackly noo returned the negro with a very earnest look but ole toughts turned in a noo drection  sit down tomeo an i will tell youan try to forgit yous hat if possble  its xtroarnar good lookin amost as much good lookin as yousself so you got no occashin to be always tinkin about it  we may remark here that both tomeo and buttchee understood a little of ebonys english though they could not speak a word  the reader will understand therefore that when we put words in their mouths we only give a free translation of their language  in like manner ebony understood a little of the ratinga tongue but could not speak much of it and waroonga who himself spoke uncommonly bad though fluent english interpreted when necessary  well you mus know said ebony dat jus before i goes to bed las night i heat a little too much supper  you doos that every night interrupted buttchee with a grin  ebony ignored the interruption and continued  so you see i dream berry badmos drefful dreams  yes  well what i dream was dis  i see massa zeppa forced by de pierits to walk de plank  whats that asked tomeo  waroonga looked at ebony for an explanation and then translated  when pirates want to kill people they sometimes tie up their eyes and bind their hands and make them walk along a plank stickin over the ships side till they fall off the end of it into the sea where they are left to drown  tomeo looked at buttchee with a grin and nodded as though he thought the mode of execution rather a good one then recollecting suddenly that any mode of slaying innocent men was inconsistent with his character as a convert to christianity he cast a glance of awful solemnity at waroonga and tried to look penitent  well hims walk de plank like a man continued ebony hims dood eberyting like a man  an wen hims topple into de sea hims give sitch a most awful wriggle dat his bonds busted  but hims berry sly was massa zeppaamazin sly  i tought him lie ons back zif him be dead jest move a leetle to look like drownin an wen he long way astern he slew round off wid de hanky fro hims eyes an larf to hisseff like one oclock  den he swumd to a island an git ashore and climb up de rocks an sit downanandats all  what be that all asked waroonga  dats all repeated the negro  i no dream no more arter dat cause i was woked by a fly what hab hoed up my nose an kep bumblin in it like steam inside ob a kittle  well ebony asked orlando what conclusions do you draw from that dream  i dint draw no kungklooshins from it cos i dunno what de are  nebber hab notin to do wid what i don understan  but what i was tink was dis in de days ob old some time after adam an eve was born a sartin king called fairho or some sitch name waroonga there knows all about him had a dream that siven swine came up  kine ebonynot swine interrupted the missionary with a goodhumoured smile which is all the same as cows  well den siven fat cows come up out ob a ribber an hoed slap at siven thin cowsmisrable skinny critters that  all wrong ebony again interrupted waroonga  its just the other way  the skinny ones went at the fat ones  well ob course you must be right returned the negro humbly though id have spected it was tother way  but i spose the skinny ones was so hungry that the fat ones hadnt a chance wid em  however it dont matter  what i was goin to say was that a good man called joseph went to fairho an splained all his dream to him  now if joseph could do dat why shouldnt waroonga splain my dream to me  because is not joseph ebony an youre not pharoah returned waroonga promptly  tomeo and buttchee turned looks of inquiry on ebony as if to say what dye say to that you nigger  but the nigger said nothing for some moments  he seemed not to have viewed the matter in that light  well i donno he said at last with a deep sigh i tought id get hold ob suthin when i kitch hold ob dat dream  but i do blieve myself dat part of it means dat zeppa hims git on an island anyhow  if my dear father got upon anything it must have been an island said orlando sadly  thats troo remarked mrs waroonga  keep your mouth shut my dalin  she referred to her brown baby which she placed with some violence on her knee  it is well to remark here that little zariffa had been supplied with a coalscuttle bonnet proportioned to her size made by her mother out of native straw and that she did not wear anything else in the way of costume  after ebonys dream had been thoroughly discussed in all its bearings and viewed in every possible point of relation to their great sorrow the council adjourned as usual to various duties about the flourishing little village and orlando went to lay the result before his mother who although she could not believe these deliberations would end in anything practical found it impossible nevertheless to resist the influence of so much faith and strong hopefulness so that she was somewhat comforted as it were in spite of herself  time flew by and upwards of three years elapsed without anything happening at ratinga island to throw a single ray of light on the fate of the lost man  during that period however much that was interesting and encouraging occurred to comfort the heart of the native missionary and the sorrowing marie zeppa  in the first place they received several visits from the missionvessel with small supplies of such luxuries as sugar tea and coffee for the body and for the spirit a few bundles of tracts and books printed in the native tongue among which you may be sure were many copies of the book of books the blessed bible  carpenters and smiths tools were also brought to them so that they not only carried on their housebuilding and other operations with greater ease than heretofore but even essayed the building of small boats with considerable success  on the occasion of these visits supplies of clothing were also left for the use of those converts who could be persuaded to put them on  but in these matters of taste waroonga was not so successful as he had been in spiritual things  after his first disastrous landing he had found no difficulty in persuading the natives to burn their false gods and put away their too numerous wivesreserving only one to each manbut when it was suggested that the usual bit of cloth round the loins was not quite sufficient for christians and that additional clothing was desirable they betrayed decided symptoms of a tendency to rebel  savages in all parts of the world are usually much influenced for good or evil by the example of their chiefs  those of ratinga were no exception to the general rule and the chiefs tomeo and buttchee did not encourage the putting on of clothes  in the matter of headdress they had indeed given in but when one day waroonga presented tomeo with a pair of what are called slopmade trousers and advised him to put them on slapping his own at the same time and asserting we trust truthfully that they were comfortable tomeo looked at them with an air of contempt and buttchee who was irreverent laughed  after much persuasion however and being goodnatured he consented to try  he got one leg in easily enough but when he attempted to put in the other not being accustomed to the feat he staggered and had to let the leg down  raising it a second time he made a successful plunge got the foot in lost his balance made a frantic effort to disengage his foot and fell to the ground  sit down my friend and try it again said waroonga encouragingly  our missionary was of a gentle loving disposition  his successes were in every case the result of suasion  he never sought to coerce men tomeo with childlike simplicity rebuked his own awkwardness and humbly seated his huge body on a bank for another effort  in this position he got his legs easily into the trousers and drew them on but when he stood up to complete the operation it was found that they were very much too small for him besides which he had put them on with the back to the front  ah my friend they do not fit said waroonga thinking it unnecessary to refer to the error  i will find a larger pair for you in the store but try this coat  it is the kind worn by the white man when he goes to see his friends  it will be much easier to put on i think  so saying waroonga produced a blue surtout with bright brass buttons  no said tomeo drawing himself up with dignity and putting the garment aside i do not require it  has not a coat of skin been given to me  i want no other  and truly the dark brown skin which fitted so perfectly to his muscular frametattooed as it was with many elegant devicesseemed to warrant his rejection of the illmade surtout  but in ratinga as elsewhere tastes differ  buttchees fancy was caught by the brass buttons and he volunteered to put on the coat although he had looked with scorn on the trousers  like his brother chief however he experienced considerable difficulty especially in distinguishing the difference between the left armhole and the breast pocket despite the able assistance of waroonga  at last he got the coat partially on and with a mighty heave forced it upon his broad shoulders  then he stood with arms awkwardly curved and extended uncertain what to do next  he was by no means properly into the garment and his look of solemn inquiry said as much to the missionary  try another heave my friend said waroonga in a tone of encouragement  buttchee tried with the result of a mysterious and incomprehensible noise at his back  what is that he said quickly with looks of alarm as he endeavoured to glance over his shoulder  i fear replied waroonga with some hesitation that the coat has burst  there could be no doubt whatever about that for a long strip of the chiefs back was visible as if a gusset of brown leather had been introduced into the blue coat from the waist to the collar  for a considerable time after this both chiefs declined further experiments in the clothing way but ultimately tomeo was induced to wear a striped flannel jersey and buttchee of his own accord adopted a scarlet flannel petticoat that had been given to his wife  thus was the ice of conservatism broken in the island of ratinga and liberal views prevailed thenceforward in the matter of costumewhether to the advancement of taste and decency remains to this day an open question as all liberal and conservative questions will probably remain till the crack of doom  one day to the inexpressible surprise and joy of the islanders a large vessel was seen to pass through the narrow opening in the coral reef and cast anchor in the lagoon  the excitement on ratinga was great for vessels rarely had occasion to visit the island although some of them probably south sea whalers were seen to pass it on the horizon two or three times a year  immediately four canoes full of natives put off to visit the stranger but on reaching her they were sternly told to keep off and the order was silently enforced by the protruding muzzle of a carronade and the forbidding aspect of several armed men who looked over the side  we are men of peace said waroonga who was in the foremost canoe and come as christian friends  we are men of war growled one of the men an dont want no friends christian or otherwise  we came to offer you hospitality returned the missionary in a remonstrative tone  an we came to take all the hospitality we want of you without waitin for the offer retorted the sailor so youd better go back to where you came from an keep yourselves quiet if ye dont want to be blowed out o the water  this was sufficient  with disappointed looks the natives turned their canoes shoreward and slowly paddled home  depend upon it this is another pirate said orlando when waroonga reported to him the result of his visit  what would you advise us to do asked waroonga  lest the reader should be surprised at this question we must remind him that orlando had in the course of these three years grown up almost to manhood  the southern blood in his veins and the nature of the climate in which he had been born and brought up may have had something to do with his early development but whatever the cause he had at the early age of eighteen become as tall and nearly as powerful as his father had been and so like to him in aspect and manner that the natives began to regard him with much of that respect and love which they had formerly entertained towards antonio  of course orlando had not the sprinkling of grey in his short black curly hair which had characterised the elder zeppa but he possessed enough of the black beard and moustache in a soft rudimental form to render the resemblance to what his sire had been very remarkable  his poor little mother left the management of all her outofdoor affairs with perfect confidence to her son  tomeo and buttchee also had begun to regard him as his fathers successor  i would advise you to do nothing said orley in reply to waroongas question beyond having all the fighting men of the village prepared for action and being ready at a moments notice to receive the strangers as friends if they choose to come as such  well then orley i will be ready for them as you tell to me if they comes in peace if not you must go and carry out your own advice for you is manager of all secular affairs here  in the afternoon a large boat full of men armed to the teeth put off from the side of the strange vessel which was barquerigged and rowed to the beach near the mouth of a small stream  evidently the object of the visit was to procure fresh water  having posted his men in ambush with orders to act in strict accordance with his signals orlando sauntered down alone and unarmed to the place where the sailors were filling their watercasks  is your captain here he asked quietly  the men who were seemingly a band of thorough ruffians looked at him in surprise but went on filling their casks  i am the captain said one stepping up to the youth with an insolent air  indeed said orlando with a look of surprise  yes indeed and let me tell you that we have no time to trouble ourselves wi you or yours but since youve put yourself in our power we make you stay here till weve done watering  i have no intention of leaving you replied orley seating himself on a rock with a pleasant smile  what dee say to kidnap the young buck suggested one of the men he might be useful  perhaps he might be troublesome remarked orlando but i would advise you to finish your work here in peace for i have a band of three hundred men up in the bush therenot ordinary savages let me tell you but men with the fear of god in their hearts and the courage of lions in their breastswho would think it an easy matter to sweep you all off the face of the earth  they are ready to act at my signalor at my fallso it will be your wisdom to behave yourselves  the quiet almost gentle manner in which this was said had a powerful effect on the men  without more words they completed the filling of the casks and then reembarking pushed off  it was obvious that they acted in haste  when they had gone about a couple of boatlengths from the beach one of the men rose up with a musket and orlando distinctly heard him say  shall i send a bullet into him  if you do the captain will skin you alive was the reply from one of the other men  the alternative did not seem agreeable to the first speaker for he laid down his musket and resumed his oar  soon after the boat reached her the sails of the stranger were spread and she glided slowly out of the lagoon    chapter four  let us waft ourselves away now over the sea in pursuit of the strange barque which had treated the good people of ratinga so cavalierly  richard rosco sits in the cabin of the vessel for it is he who commands her  he had taken her as a prize and finding her a good vessel in all respects had adopted her in preference to the old piraticallooking schooner  a seaman stands before him  it is impossible i tell you says rosco while a troubled expression crosses his features which have not improved since we saw him upwards of three years ago  the distance between the two islands is so great that it is not probable he traversed it in a canoe especially when we consider that he did not know the islands name or position and was raving mad when i put him ashore  that may be so captain says the sailor nevertheless i seed him with my own eyes an no mistake  didnt you say he was a man that nobody could mistake tall broad powerful handsome black curly hair short beard and moustache with sharp eyes and a pleasant smile  the same in every particularand just bordering on middle age answers the perplexed pirate  well as to age i cant say much about that returns the seaman he seemed to me more like a young man than a middleaged one but he had coolness and cheek enough for a hundred and fifty or any age you like  strange muttered rosco to himself paying no regard to the last observation i wish that i or mr redford had gone with you or some one who had seen him the last time we were here but i didnt want to be recognised then checking himselfwell you may go and send mr redford to me  i cannot account for zeppa turning up in this way he said when the mate entered  no more can i sir  do all the men agree in saying that he seems to be quite sane  all  indeed most of them seemed surprised when i asked the question you see what with death by sword shot and sickness theres not a man in the ship who ever saw him except yourself and me  the last of the old hands you know went with captain daniel when you sent him and the unwilling men away in the old schooner  i have no doubt myself from what they say that zeppa has got well again and managed to return home as sound and sane as you or i  if you and i were sane we should not be here thought the pirate captain but he did not give expression to the thought save by a contemptuous curl of his lip  well redford he said after a few seconds pause my chief reason for going to sugarloaf island is removed nevertheless we shall still go there for a fresh load of sandalwood and other things that will fetch a good price  i fear sir returned the mate after some hesitation that the crew will be apt to mutiny if you insist on going there  they are tired of this mixture of trade with freeroving and are anxious to sail in seas where we shall be more likely to fall in with something worth picking up  stop redford i want to hear no more  the crew shall go where i please as long as i command them and you may add that i will guarantee their being pleased with my present plan  there dont refer to this subject again  where did you say the british cruiser was last seen  bearing noreast sir hull downon our starboard quarter  i called you at once but she had changed her course to norwest and we lost sight of her  that will just suit us said rosco going into his private cabin and shutting the door  well might the pirate captain be perplexed at that time for he was surrounded by difficulties not the least of which was that his men were thoroughly dissatisfied with him and he with them  he did not find his crew sufficiently ready to go in for lucrative kidnapping of natives when the chance offered and they did not find their captain sufficiently ferocious and bloodthirsty when prizes came in their way nevertheless through the influence of utter recklessness contemptuous disregard of death and an indomitable will backed by wonderful capacity and aptitude in the use of fist sword and pistol he had up to this time held them in complete subjection  in his heart rosco had resolved to quit his comrades at the first favourable opportunity and with this intent had been making for one of the most outoftheway islands in the pacificthere to go and live among the natives and never more to see the faces of civilised men against whom he had sinned so grievously  his intentions were hastened by the fact that a british manofwar on the vancouver station hearing of his exploits had resolved to search for him  and this cruiser did in fact come across his track and gave chase but being a poor sailer was left behind just before the pirate had reached ratinga where as we have seen she put in for water  the discovery there made as he supposed that antonio zeppa had recovered his reason and returned home not only amazed and puzzled rosco but disconcerted part of his plan which was to find zeppa whose image had never ceased to trouble his conscience and if possible convey him to the neighbourhood of some port whence he could easily return to ratinga  it now struck him that since zeppa was no longer on sugarloaf island that spot would be as favourable a one as could be found for his purpose being far removed from the usual tracks of commerce  he would go there take to the mountains as zeppa had done before him leave his dissatisfied comrades to follow their own devices and crossing over to the other side of the island ingratiate himself as well as he could with the natives grow beard and moustache which he had hitherto shaved and pass himself off as a shipwrecked sailor should any vessel or cruiser touch there  and shipwrecked i am body soul and spirit he muttered bitterly as he sat in his cabin brooding over the past and future  leaving him there and thus we will return to ratinga the peaceful inhabitants of which were destined at this time to be tickled with several little shocks of more or less agreeable surprise  one of these shocks was the sudden disappearance of zariffa the native missionarys brown baby  it was an insignificant event in itself and is only mentioned because of its having led indirectly to events of greater importance  zariffa had by that time passed out of the condition of brownbabyhood  she had to her own intense delight been promoted to the condition of a decentlyclad little savage  in addition to the scuttle bonnet which was not quite so tremulous as that of her mother she now sported a blue flannel petticoat  this was deemed sufficient for her the climate being warm  zariffa was still however too young to take care of herself  great therefore was betsy waroongas alarm when she missed her one day from her little bed where she should have been sleeping  ebony cried betsy turning sharply round and glaring zariffas gone  quite dead exclaimed the negro aghast  not at all dead said betsy but gonegone hout of hers bed  dat no great misfortin missis returned ebony with a sigh of relief  its little you knows stoopid feller returned the native missionarys wife while her coalscuttle shook with imparted emotion zariffa never disbeyed me in hers life  shes lost  we must seek seek quick  the sympathetic negro became again anxious and looked hastily under the chairs and tables for the lost one while her mother opened and searched a corner cupboard that could not have held a child half her size  then the pair became more and more distracted as each excited the other and ran to the various outhouses shouting zariffa anxiously entreatingly despairing  they gathered natives as they ran hither and thither searching every nook and corner and burst at last in an excited crowd into the presence of waroonga himself who was in the act of detailing the history of joseph to a select class of scholars varying from seven to seventeen years of age  oh massa zariffas lost cried ebony  waroonga glanced quickly at his wife  the excessive agitation of her bonnet told its own tale  the missionary threw joseph overboard directly proclaimed a holiday and rushed out of the schoolhouse  no use to go home massa cried ebony wes sarch eberywhere dar no find her  has you been to the piggery demanded the anxious father who was well aware of his childs fondness for little squeakers  oh yes bin dar  i rousted out de ole sow for make sure zariffa no hides behind her  at this juncture orlando came up with a sack of cocoanuts on his back hearing what had occurred he took the matter in hand with his wonted energy  we must organise a regular search he said throwing down the sack and go to work at once for the day is far advanced and we can do little or nothing after dark  so saying he collected all the able men of the village divided them into bands gave them minute though hurried directions where they were to go and what signals they were to give in the event of the child being found and then heading one of the bands he joined eagerly in the search  but before going he advised betsy waroonga to keep his mother company as women could not be of much use in such work  no said mrs waroonga with decision we will go home an pray  right that will be better said orlando  you go back with her ebony and fetch my gun  i left it in waroongas house when i went in for a sack to hold the cocoanuts  it is behind the door  youll find me searching in the palmgrove  now boys away weve no time to lose  returning to her house with her sable attendant poor betsy rushed into her private apartment threw herself on her knees and half across her lowly bed in an agony of alarm  she was startled and horrified by a sharp though smothered cry while some living creature heaved under the bedclothes  instantly she swept them off and lo there lay zariffa safe and well though somewhat confused by her rude awaking and her mothers weight  yous keep up heart missis said the sympathetic ebony looking hastily into the room in passing wes sartin sure to find  he stopped  blazing amazement sat on his countenance for about six momentsa pause similar to that of an injured infant just preparing for a yellthen he exploded into a fit of laughter so uncontrollable that it seemed as if a hurricane had been suddenly let loose in the room insomuch that betsys remonstrances were quite unheard  oh missis he exclaimed at last wiping his eyes is agoin to bust  yes an ill help you to do it she replied impatiently seizing an old shoe and laying it on the negros bare back with a crack like a pistolshot  ebony strove to calm himself  go long you noisy feller an tell waroonga to stop the search  it was plain that ebony had not sufficiently relieved his feelings for his broad chest heaved and ominous sounds came out of his nose  ony tink said he dat you hoed down to say yous prayers on de berry top ob de babby  the thought was too much for him  he exploded again and rushing from the house ascended the hills and filled the groves as he went with hilarious melody  but he did not find orlando who had completed his search of the palmgrove and passed over the ridge that formed the summit of the island in that part  it was by no means the highest part but from it could be seen a large bay which lay on the side of the island opposite to the mission village  and here he beheld the cause of another of the little surprises with which we have said the people of ratinga were visited at that time  it was a stately manofwar with the union jack flying from her peak and her sails backed so as to check her way  a boat was being lowered from her side and orlando with his party hastened to the beach to meet it  the officer in command was evidently not aware that he had come to an island where the peaceful influences of the gospel of jesus prevailed for on landing he drew up his men who were all armed to receive either as friends or foes the party of natives who advanced towards him the officer was not a little surprised to observe that the natives were led by a white man who halted them when within about three hundred yards off and advanced alone and unarmed to the beach  i am happy to welcome you and offer hospitality said orlando taking off his cap  thanks good sir i accept your offer most gladly returned the officer holding out his hand all the more heartily that i had expected to meet with none but savages here  we are christians thank god said orlando  then this must be the island of ratinga of which we have heard so much of late  even so  but where then is your village your church asked the officer looking round  it is on the other side of the island  if you will take your ship round there you will find good anchorage and fresh water of which last if i may judge from the casks in your boat you are in search  the officer at once acted on this advice and orlando accompanied him on board to pilot the vessel round  on the way the captainfitzgeraldasked if any suspicious craft had been seen lately and on hearing that a barque flying british colours had put in there only a day or two before said that he had been sent out in chase of that barque as she was commanded by a celebrated and rather eccentric pirate named rosco  i know him well said orlando quickly he was mate of a schooner which called here between three and four years ago  it was commanded by a poor fellow named daniel who i fear was murdered by his crew alas  i have only too good reason to remember it  he then related the visit of the piraticallooking schooner to ratinga its departure with his father and himself on board the mutiny and all the other circumstances connected with that memorable event  and have you never heard of your father since then asked captain fitzgerald  never  i am almost forced to the conclusion that he must have been murdered by the mutineers for if he had escaped them he would surely long ere now have managed to find his way home  and yet i cannot help feeling that perhaps god may have spared his life and may yet restore him to us  it is perhaps cruel to encourage hopes which may be doomed to bitter disappointment returned the captain regarding orlandos sad face with a look of sympathy but it is by no means impossible that your father may be alive  listen  i too know something of this affair and will tell you all i know  captain daniel of the schooner whose crew mutinied was not murdered  this rosco seems to have had all through his career a strong tendency to mercy  so much so that his men have threatened his own life more than once  at the same time he possesses great power over them and has held them for many years under command we have heard of him more than once from persons whom he has set free after taking their vessels among others from captain daniel who turned up in vancouvers island  it seems that after you were thrown overboard and supposed to be drowned your poor father wentwentthat is to say his mind was unhinged owing no doubt to the combined effect of your supposed murder and the two terrible blows by which he was felled during the mutiny  my fathermad exclaimed orlando in a low horrified tone clasping his hands and gazing into captain fitzgeralds face  nay i did not say mad  it was a great shock you know and quite sufficient to account for temporary derangement  then rosco sailed away to a distant island where he put your father ashore and left him  what islanddid you hear its name asked orlando quickly  it is an almost unknown island not marked or named in any chart but it had been seen by one of the mutineers on one of his early voyages and named sugarloaf island from its shape  well after leaving the island rosco attacked and easily captured a large merchantman finding it both good and new he transhipped all that was worth retaining including arms and guns into this barque and took command then he assembled his men asked who were willing to follow him put those who were unwilling into the old schooner with captain daniel at their head and left them to sail where they pleased  they landed as i have said at vancouvers island  the pirate rosco and his barque the flame have become notorious since then both for daring and eccentricity and i have been ordered to get hold of them if possible now i mean to go to sugarloaf island because from various things i have heard of this scoundrel i think it not unlikely that he will go there  and you will let me go with you suddenly exclaimed orlando in a voice of earnest entreaty  i will my poor fellow returned the captain but dont be too sanguine and let me advise you to say nothing of all this to your mother  you are right  she must not knowat least not now  it will be the first time in my life i have had a secret from my mother but she must not know tilltill we return  that night there was great rejoicing in ratinga because of the recovery if we may so call it of zariffa and the visit of the british manofwar  in the midst of the rejoicings a huge lustrous pair of black eyes gazed earnestly into orlandos face and an enormously thick pair of red lips said i go too massaeh  well you may ebony if the captain will let you  he has already agreed to take the missionary and the chiefs tomeo and buttchee but mind not a whisper of our secret hope to any one  thus with the approval of madame zeppa and betsy waroonga these five representatives of ratinga embarked on board the british manofwar and left the island    chapter five  we left the poor madman antonio zeppa wandering aimlessly up into the mountains of sugarloaf island  whether it was the loss of his beloved orley alone that had turned his brain or that loss coupled with the injury to his head we cannot tell but certain it is that the outward and visible violence of his great sorrow seemed to depart from him after he had entered the rugged defiles of the mountain range  his mental malady appeared to take the form of simple indifference and inactivity sometimes he muttered to himself as he went slowly and wearily along but generally he was silent with his chin sunk upon his breast as he gazed upon the ground with lacklustre eyes  at other times he started and looked around him with a sharp inquiring almost timid glance but the gleam of memoryif such it wassoon passed away and his handsome face resumed the gentle almost childish look which had settled down on it  but never again did he give vent to the heartbroken cries and wails which had marked the first stage of his derangement  the mutterings to which we have referred were seldom coherent but the disjointed utterances sufficed to indicate the natural character of the man  as the ruling passion is said to become dominant in death so in this death of reason which appeared to have passed upon zeppa love of his wife and child and the natives of ratinga as well as profound reverence and love to his god became conspicuous in the broken sentences that occasionally dropped from his lips  at first he had been like some grand instrument thrown wildly out of tune and swept by a reckless hand  now he resembled the same instrument with the framework shattered the strings hanging loose and the music of discord as well as harmony gone for ever  oh it was sad inexpressibly sad to see the grand and good manthe image of himself yet not himself with bowed head and bent form the very personification of humilitywandering forth on that lonely island of the southern seas  after quitting the shore he continued slowly to ascend the mountain until he gained the summit  here seating himself on a rock he lifted his eyes and looked slowly around him  it was a glorious sight that met his unintelligent gaze  on the side which he had ascended the mountain sloped abruptly into the sea yet its precipices were not forbidding or gloomy for they were clothed with the luxuriant and lovely vegetation of those favoured regions  the rocks were fringed with grasses and wild flowers the cliffs were softened by palmated leaves and gorgeous shrubs  wild fruits in abundance grew on every side in short the land presented the appearance of a terrestrial paradise  on the other side of the range similar but softer scenery rolled away for several miles in easy slopes until it terminated in a plain the farther end of which was bounded by the white sands of the shore  around all lay the great sea like a transparent blue shield on which the sun glinted in myriad ripples of burnished gold  everywhere gods work was glorious but gods image in man was not there for poor zeppa looked upon it all with total indifference  the schooner was still visible from that lofty outlook like a snowflake on the sea but zeppa saw it or regarded it not  on the shore of the island furthest from the mountain the clustering huts of a native village could be seen but zeppa looked at it without a gleam of interest and passed it over as if it were a group of anthills  hunger however soon claimed attention  after remaining motionless for more than an hour he arose and plucked some fruit from a neighbouring tree  god is goodhas always been good to me and mine he murmured as he placed the fruit on the grass and sat down beside it  then clasping his hands and closing his eyes he asked a blessing on his food in the same words and tone which he had been wont to use when at home  after his hunger was appeased he again wandered about apparently without aim but as night began to descend he sought and found a slightly hollowed part of a cliff with an overhanging ledge  it was scarcely deep enough to be styled a cave but appeared to be a sufficient shelter in the maniacs eyes for he busied himself in gathering ferns and dried grass until he had made himself a comfortable couch at the inner end of it  before lying down he knelt clasped his hands and poured out his soul in fervent prayer  his words were now no longer incoherent and the burthen of his petition wasa blessing on the dear ones at home and forgiveness of all his sins through jesus christ  it seemed evident judging by his words that he had forgotten the recent past and imagined that orlando was still alive  then he lay down and fell asleep  thus days and weeks and months rolled on and still the madman wandered aimlessly among the mountain peaks  the savages at the other end of the island never molested him for having no occasion to clamber up these rocky heights they did not become aware of his existence until a considerable time had elapsed  his discovery at last was the result of a crime  one of the savages committed a theft in the native village and fled for refuge to the mountains  wapoota being a funny fellow was a favourite with his chief ongoloo and occupied a position somewhat analogous to the court jester of old  moreover he was often consulted in serious matters by his chiefin short was a sort of humorous prime minister  but he could not resist the tendency to steal and one day pilfered something or other from ongoloo who finally lost patience with him for he was an old offender  ongoloo though neither a warlike nor ferocious fellow vowed to cut out the heart and liver of wapoota and expose them to public gaze  disliking publicity after this fashion the thief fled purposing to abide in the mountains until his chiefs wrath should have evaporated  rambling one day in his mountain refuge the dishonest savage turned a jutting point of rock and suddenly stood face to face with zeppa  his jaw dropped his eyes glared his knees smote together and lemonyellow took the place of brownochre on his cheeks  it was an awkward place of meeting for the path if we may so style it was a mere ledge with a perpendicular cliff on one side a precipice on the other  and well might the savage by overcome with fear on such a spot with such a man before him for in addition to his commanding stature zeppa had now the wild appearance resulting from long untrimmed locks and a shaggy beard  both locks and beard had also changed from black to irongrey during these months of lonely wandering  his dress too had become much disordered and ragged so that altogether his appearance and fierce aspect were eminently fitted to strike terror to the heart of a more courageous man than wapoota who happened to be rather mild in disposition  after the first stare of astonishment he sank on his knees and held up his hands as if supplicating mercy  but he had nothing to fear from the maniac  my poor fellow said zeppa in english laying his hand on the natives head and patting it do not fear  i will not harm you  of course wapoota did not understand the words but he fully appreciated the action and the lemonyellow began to fade while the brownochre returned  without uttering another word zeppa took wapoota by the hand and led him to his cave where he set before him such fruits as remained over from his last meal and then sitting down gazed abstractedly on the ground  wapoota ate from fear of offending his host rather than hunger  when he had finished zeppa rose pointed to his couch at the inner part of the cave nodded to him with a kindly smile and left him  at first the savage seemed disposed to make off when zeppas back was turned but when he saw him slowly ascend the hill with his head bowed down he changed his mind made some significant grimaceswhich we will not attempt to explainand lay down to sleep  on his return wapoota tried to enter into conversation with his host but zeppa only smiled patted him gently on the head and shoulder and paid no further attention to him  the savage was somewhat overawed by such treatment  observing his host more closely it soon began to dawn upon him that he was in the power of a madman and some tinges of the lemonyellow reappeared but when he perceived that zeppa was not merely a harmless but an exceedingly gentle madman his confidence and the brownochre reasserted themselves  thus for several days the madman and the savage dwelt amicably together and slept side by side during the night but zeppa made it very apparent that he did not wish for his visitors society during the daytime and the visitor had the sense to let him wander forth alone  wapoota was mistaken when he calculated on the cooling of ongoloos wrath  that angry chief bent on the fulfilment of his anatomical vow set forth with a small party of picked men to explore the sugarloaf in quest of the runaway  he found him one day gathering fruits for zeppas supperfor wapoota had already become a sort of attached friday to this unfortunate crusoe  on beholding his countrymen the thiefs visage underwent a series of remarkable changes for he knew that escape was impossible and the expression of his chiefs face forbade him to hope for mercy  i have found you mine enemy growled ongolooof course in the native tongue  mercy exclaimed wapoota in a piteous tone  mercy no longer dwells in my breast returned the chief  in proof of the truth of this assertion he ordered his men to seize and bind wapoota and proceed at once with the execution of his cruel purpose  the unfortunate wretch unable to face the appalling prospect gave vent to a series of terrible shrieks and struggled fiercely while they bound him  but in vain would he have struggled if his cries for mercy had not reached other ears than those of his countrymen  not far from the spot where the thief had been captured zeppa chanced to be sitting idly toying with the branch of a tree which he had fashioned into a rude staff wherewith to climb the mountain more easily  when the first shriek ran among the cliffs it seemed to startle the maniac out of the depressing lethargy under which he had laboured so long  he sprang up and listened with dilated eyes and partly open mouth  again and again the shrieks rang out and were echoed from cliff to cliff  as a tigress bounds to the rescue of her young so sprang zeppa down the hillside in the direction of the cries  he came suddenly to the edge of a cliff which overlooked the scene and beheld a savage just about to plunge a knife into wapootas breast  zeppa gave vent to a tremendous roar which terminated in a wild laugh then he wrenched a mass of rock from the cliffs and hurled it down  the height was greater than any sane man would have ventured to leap even to save his life but the maniac gave no time to thought  he followed the mass of rock with another wild laugh and next moment stood in the midst of the savage group  these men were no cowards  they were ongoloos picked warriors and would have scorned to fly before a single foe however large or fierce  but when they saw plainly that zeppa was a white man and a maniac they turned with one consent and fled as if a visitant from the nether realms had assailed them  zeppa did not follow  all his sudden wrath vanished with the enemy  he turned calmly to the prostrate man cut his bonds and set him free then without saying a word he patted him on the shoulder and wandered listlessly away with his head dropped as of old  you may be sure that wapoota did not hesitate to make good use of his freedom  he fled on the wingsor legsof fear to the most inaccessible recesses of the mountains from which he did not emerge till night had enshrouded land and sea  then he crept stealthily back to zeppas cave and laid himself quietly down beside his friend  the inherent tendency of zeppas nature was towards peace and goodwill even in his madness and misery his spirit trickled if it did not run in the customary direction  his dethroned reason began occasionally to make fitful efforts after some plan which it sought to evolve  but before the plan could be arranged much less carried out the dull sense of a leaden grief overwhelmed it again and he relapsed into the old condition of quiet apathy  chance however brought about that which the enfeebled intellect could not compass  one daywhether inadvertently or not we cannot tellzeppa wandered down in the direction of the native settlement  that same day ongoloo wandered towards the mountain and the two men suddenly met so close to each other that there was no possibility of escape to either  but sooth to say there was no thought of escape in the breast of either  ongoloo being a brave savage was ashamed of having given way to panic at his first meeting with the madman  besides he carried his huge warclub while his opponent was absolutely unarmedhaving forgotten to take his usual staff with him that day  as for zeppa he had never at any time feared the face of man and in his then condition would have faced man or fiend with equal indifference  but the sight of the savage chief seemed to recall something to his mind  he stood with his arms crossed and an expression of perplexity on his countenance while ongoloo assumed an attitude of defence  suddenly a beaming smile overspread zeppas face  we have already said that his smile had fascination in it  the effect on the savage was to paralyse him for the moment  zeppa advanced took ongoloos face between both hands and placing his nose against that of the chief gently rubbed it  for the benefit of the ignorant we may explain that this is the usual salutation of friendship among some of the south sea islanders  ongoloo returned the rub and dropped his club  he was obviously glad of this peaceful termination to the rencontre  then for the first time it occurred to zeppa to use the language of ratinga  the chief evidently understood it  god is love said zeppa solemnly pointing upward with his finger god forgives  you will forgive and so be like god  the chief was completely overawed by zeppas grandeur and gentleness he had never before seen the two qualities combined  zeppa took him by the hand as he had previously taken wapoota and led him up into the mountains  the chief submitted meekly as if he thought a being from the better world were guiding him  on reaching the cave they found wapoota arranging the suppertableif we may so express it for he had been in the habit of doing this for some time past about sunset at which time his protector had invariably returned homealas it was a poor home  to say that wapoota was transfixed or petrified on beholding ongoloo would not convey the full idea of his condition  it is useless to say that he glared that his knees smote or that lemonyellow supplanted brownochre on his visage  words can do much but they cannot describe the state of that savage on that occasion  the readers imagination is much more likely to do justice to the situation  to that we leave it  but who or what language shall describe the state of mind into which both ongoloo and wapoota were thrown when zeppa having brought them close to each other grasped them firmly by their necks and rubbed their noses forcibly together  there was no resisting the smile with which this was dune  the chief and the thief first glanced at each other then at their captor and then they laughedabsolutely roaredafter which they rubbed noses of their own accord and made it up  we may remark in passing that ongoloo was not sorry for the reconciliation because wapoota had become necessary to him both in council and during relaxation and of late he had come to feel lowspirited for want of his humourist  but both of them were much concerned to observe that after this reconciliation the reconciler relapsed into his pensive mood and refused to be interested in anything  they tried in vain to rouse him from his strange apathywhich neither of them could at all understand  next day ongoloo took occasion to give him the slip and returned to his village  zeppa cared nothing for that  he did not even ask wapoota what had become of him  at this time a new idea occurred to wapoota who had been ordered by his chief to induce zeppa to visit the native village  it struck him that as he had been led so he might lead  therefore one morning he waited until zeppa had finished breakfast and when he rose as was his wont to go off for the day wapoota took him gently by the hand and led him forth  to his surpriseand comfort for he had had strong misgivings zeppa submitted  he did not seem to think that the act was peculiar  wapoota led him quietly and slowly down the mountain side and so by degrees right into the native village where ongoloo was of course prepared to meet and welcome him  he was received by the head men of the tribe with deep respect and conducted to a tent which had been prepared for him where wapoota who had constituted himself his servantor lieutenantmade him comfortable for the night  zeppa at first expressed some surprise at all the fuss that was made regarding him but soon ceased to trouble himself about the matter and gradually relapsed into his old condition  he was content to remain with the natives though he did not cease his lonely wanderings among the hills absenting himself for days at a time but always returning sooner or later to the tent that had been provided for him in the village  now in sugarloaf island there was a tribe that had for years past been at war with the tribe into whose hands zeppa had thus fallen and not long after the events just narrated it chanced that the ratura tribe as it was named resolved to have another brush with their old enemies the subjects of ongoloo  what they did and how they did it shall be seen in another chapter    chapter six  after zeppa had remained a short time in his new quarters he began to take an interest in the children of his savage friends  at first the mothers of the village were alarmed when they saw their little ones in his strong arms playing with his beard which had by that time grown long and shaggy as well as grey like his curly locks but soon perceiving that the children had nothing to fear from the strange white man they gave themselves no further concern on the subject  if zeppa had been in his right mind when the savages first found him it is probable that they would have hunted him down and slain him without remorsefor it is well known that many of the south sea islanders regard shipwrecked persons as victims who have no claim on their hospitality but are a sort of windfall to be killed and devoured their treatment of zeppa therefore must have been owing to some feeling of respect or awe inspired by his obvious insanity coupled no doubt with his commanding size and presence as well as his singular conduct on the occasion of their first meeting  whatever the reason it is certain that the natives amongst whom the poor madmans lot had thus been cast treated him in an exceptional manner and with an amount of respect that almost amounted to reverence at first ongoloo made a slight attempt to ascertain where his guest had come from and what was his previous history but as zeppa always met such inquiries with one of his sweetest smiles and with no verbal reply whatever the chief felt unusually perplexed dropped the subject and began to regard the madman as a species of demigod  of course no one else dared to question him so that ever afterwards he remained in the eyes of his entertainers as a great mystery  by degrees zeppa became intimately acquainted with the little boys and girls of the village and took much pleasure in watching them at play they soon found out that he was fond of them and might have become rather troublesome in their attentions to him if he had been a busy man but as he had nothing whatever to do except follow his own inclinations and as his inclinations led him to sympathise with childhood he was never ruffled by their familiarities or by their wild doings around his tent  he even suffered a few of the very smallest of the brown troop to take liberties with him and pull his beard  one brown mite in particulara female baby of the smallest conceivable dimensions and the wildest possible spiritbecame an immense favourite with him  her name was lippy or some sound which that combination of letters produces  lippys mother a largeeyed goodlooking young woman with insufficient clothingat least in the estimate of a ratingaitewas transfixed the first time she saw her little one practise her familiarities on their demigod  zeppa was lying on his back at the time in front of his hut when lippy prowled cautiously towards him like a very small and sly kitten about to pounce on a very huge dog  she sprang just as her mother caught sight of her and was on his broad chest in a moment  the mother was as we have said transfixed with alarm  the human kitten seized zeppa by the beard and laughed immoderately  zeppa replied with a gentle smilehe never laughed out nowand remained quite still  having finished her laugh lippy drew herself forward until she was close to her human dogs chin  at this point her mother would have rushed to the rescue but she was still paralysed  having reached the chin lippy became more audacious stretched forth one of her little hands and seized zeppas nose  still he did not move but when the little brown kitten proceeded to thrust a thumb into one of his eyes he roused himself seized the child in his powerful hands and raised her high above his head then lowering her until her little mouth was within reach he kissed her  this sufficed to relieve the mothers fears so she retired quietly from the scene  she was not so easily quieted however some weeks later when she beheld zeppa after amusing himself one day with lippy for half an hour start up place her on his shoulder and stalk off towards the mountains  he absented himself for three days on that occasion lippys mother at first became anxious then terrified then desperate she roused ongoloo to such a pitch that he at last called a council of war  some of the head men were for immediate pursuit of the madman others were of opinion that the little brat was not worth so much trouble a few wretches even expressed the opinion that they were well rid of herthere being already too many female babies in the community  while the conflict of opinions was at its fiercest zeppa stalked into the midst of them with lippy on his shoulder looked round with a benignant expression of countenance delivered the child to her mother and went off to his hut without uttering a word  the council immediately dissolved itself and retired humiliated  it was during one of zeppas occasional absences that the ratura tribe of natives as before mentioned decided to have another brush with the mountainmen as they styled their foes  we are not sure that the word used in the ratura language was the exact counterpart of the words brush and scrimmage in ours but it meant the same thing namely the cutting of a number of throats or the battering in of a number of human skulls unnecessarily  of course there was a casus belli  there always is among savage as well as civilised nations and it is a curious coincidence that the reasons given for the necessity for war are about as comprehensible among the civilised as the savage  of course among civilised nations these reasons for war are said to be always good  christians you know could not kill each other without good reasons but is it not strange that among educated people the reasons given for going to war are often very much the reverse of clear  the origin of the war which was about to be revived besides being involved in the mists of antiquity was somewhat shrouded in the clouds of confusion  cleared of these clouds and delivered from those mists it would have been obviously a justnay even a holy warso both parties said for they both wanted to fight  unfortunately no living man could clear away the clouds or mists nevertheless as they all saw plainly the exceeding righteousness of the war they could not in honour in justice or in common sense do otherwise than go at it  at some remote period of antiquityprobably soon after the dispersion at babelit was said that the mountainmen had said to the raturans that it had been reported to them that a rumour had gone abroad that they the men of ratura were casting covetous eyes on the summit of their mountain  the raturans replied that it had never entered into their heads either to covet or to look at the summit of their mountain but that if they had any doubts on the subject they might send over a deputation to meet a ratura deputation and hold a palaver to clear the matter up  the deputations were sent  they met  they palavered for about halfanhour with an air of sententious sincerity then the leading chief of the mountaineer deputation cracked the crown of the leading chief of the raturan deputation and the two deputations spent the remainder of that day in fighting  reinforcements came up on both sides  the skirmish became a pitched battle  blood was shed lavishly heads were broken beyond repair and women coming to the help of the men with the baskets of stones were slain in considerable numbers as well as little children who had an inconvenient but not uncommon habit of getting in the way of the combatants  at last the raturans were driven into the impregnable swamps that bordered part of their country their villages and crops were burned and those of their women and children who had not escaped to the swamps were carried into slavery while the aged of both sexes were slaughtered in cold blood  it was a complete victory  we are inclined to think that the mountainmen called it a glorious victory  judging from the worlds history they probably did and the mountain women ever afterwards were wont to tell their little ones of the prowess of their forefathersof the skulls battered in and other deeds of heroism donein that just and reasonable war  as centuries rolled on the old story came to be repeated again and over again with slight variations to suit the varying ages  in particular it came to be well understood and asserted that that unconquerable desire of the raturans to take possession of the mountaintop was growing apace and had to be jealously watched and curbed  in one of the centurieswe are not sure whichthe raturan savages made some advances into their swampy grounds and began to improve them  this region lay very remote from the mountainmens villages but as it approached the mountain base in a roundabout manner and as the mountaintops could be distinctly seen from the region although wellnigh impassable swamps still lay between the reclaimed lands and the mountain base these advances were regarded as another casus belli and another war was waged with practically the same results damage to everybody concerned and good to no one  thus was the game kept up until the chief ongoloo began to strut his little hour upon the stage of time  there are always men savage as well as civilised in every region and age who march in advance of their fellows either because of intellectual capacity or moral rectitude or both  ongoloo was one of these  he did not believe in war at any price  he thought it probable that god lived in a state of peace and argued that what was best for the creator must naturally be best for the creature  he therefore tried to introduce a peacepolicy into sugarloaf island his efforts were not successful  the warparty was too strong for him at last he felt constrained to give in to the force of public opinion and agreed to hold an unarmed palaver with the men of ratura  the waratanyprice party would have preferred an armed palaver but they were overruled  the raturans chanced at this time to be in somewhat depressed circumstances owing to a sickness which had carried off many of their best warriors and left their lands partly waste so that their finances if we may so express it were in a bad condition  now is our chancenow or never thought the warparty and pushed matters to extremity  on the day appointed for the palaver one of the most pugnacious of the mountainmen got leave to open the deliberations  youre a lowminded sneaking son of an ignorant father he said to the spokesman of the raturans  youre another retorted his foe  having disposed of these preliminary compliments the speakers paused glared and breathed hard  of course we give the nearest equivalent in english that we can find for the vernacular used  you and your greedy forefathers resumed the mountainman have always kept your false eyes on our mountaintop and you are looking at it still  thats a lie returned the man of ratura with savage simplicity  had they been armed it is probable that the palaver would have closed abruptly at this point  seeing that the relations between the parties were strained almost to the breakingpoint one of the less warlike among the ratura chiefs caught his own spokesman by the nape of the neck and hurled him back among his comrades  we have not o valiant men of the mountain he said in a gentle tone looked upon your hilltops with desire  we only wish to improve our swamps increase our sweetpotato grounds and live at peace  that is not true retorted the fiery mountainman and we must have a promise from you that you will let the swamps alone and not advance one step nearer to the top of our mountain  but the swamps are not yours objected the other  no matterthey are not yours  they are neutral ground and must not be touched  well we will not touch them said the peaceful raturan  this reply disconcerted the fiery mountaineer for he was anxious to fight  but that is not enough he resumed as a bright idea struck him you must promise not even to look at our mountain  the man of ratura reflecting how ill able his tribe was to go to war just then agreed not even to look at the mountain  more than that resumed the mountaineer you must not even wink at it  we will not even wink at it replied his foe  still further continued the warlike mountaineer in sheer desperation you must not even think of it  we will not think of it answered the accommodating man of ratura  bah you may goyou peaceloving cowards said the disappointed mountaineer turning on his heel in bitter disappointment  yes you may goin peace said ongoloo with sententious gravity waving his band grandly to the retiring men of ratura and walking off with an air of profound solemnity though he could not help laughingin his arm somewhere as he had not a sleeve to do it in  but the raturans did not go in peace  they went away with bitter animosity in their hearts and some of them resolved to have a brush with their old foes come what might  savages do not as a rule go through the formality of declaring war by withdrawing ambassadors  they are much more prone to begin war with that deceptive act styled a surprise  smarting under the taunts of their foes the raturans resolved to make an attack on the enemys village that very night but ongoloo was more than a match for them  suspecting their intentions he stalked them when the shades of evening fell heard all their plans while concealed among the long grass and then hastening home collected his warriors  it chanced that zeppa had returned from one of his rambles at the time and was lying in his hut  will you come out with us and fight demanded ongoloo entering abruptly  the mention of fighting seemed to stir some chord which jarred in zeppas mind for he shook his head and frowned  it is possible that if the savage had explained how matters stood the poor madman might have consented but the chief had not the time perhaps not the will for that  turning quickly round therefore he went off as abruptly as he had entered  zeppa cared nothing for that  indeed he soon forgot the circumstance and feeling tired lay down to sleep  meanwhile ongoloo marched away with a body of picked men to station himself in a narrow pass through which he knew that the invading foe would have to enter  he was hugely disgusted to be thus compelled to fight after he had congratulated himself on having brought the recent palaver to so peaceful an issue  he resolved however only to give his enemies a serious fright for he knew full well that if blood should flow the old warspirit would return and the ancient suspicion and hatred be revived and intensified  arranging his plans therefore with this end in view he resolved to take that peaceful though thieving humorist wapoota into his secret councils  summoning him after the ambush had been properly arranged and the men placed he saidcome here you villain  wapoota knew that ongoloo was not displeased with him by the nature of his address  he therefore followed without anxiety to a retired spot among the bushcovered rocks  you can screech wapoota  yes chief answered the exthief in some surprise i can screech like a parrot the size of a whale  that will do  and you love peace like me wapoota and hate bloodshed though you love thieving  true chief returned the other modestly  well then listenand if you tell any one what i say to you i will squeeze the eyes out of your head punch the teeth from your jaws and extract the oil from your backbone  wapoota thought that this was pretty strong for a man who had just declared his hatred of bloodshed but he said nothing  you know the rock something in shape like your own nose at the foot of this pass said ongoloo  i know it chief  well go there hide yourself and get ready for a screech  when you see the ratura dogs come in sight give it outonceonly onceand if you dont screech well ill teach you how to do it better afterwards wait then till you hear and see me and my men come rushing down the track and then screech a second time  only once mind but let it be long and strong  you understand  nowaway  like a bolt from a crossbow wapoota sped  he had not been in hiding two minutes when the ratura party came stealthily towards the rock before mentioned  wapoota gathered himself up for a supreme effort  the head of the enemys column appeared in viewthen there burst as if from the bosom of silent night a yell such as no earthly parrot ever uttered or whale conceived  the very blood in the veins of all stood still  their limbs refused to move  away over the rolling plain went the horrid sound till it gained the mountain where after being buffeted from cliff to crag it finally died out far up among the rocky heights  a device of the ratura dogs to frighten us growled ongoloo to those nearest him  come follow me and remember not a sound till i shout  the whole party sprang up and followed their chief at full gallop down the pass  the still petrified raturans heard the sound of rushing feet when wapoota saw the dark forms of his comrades appear he filled his chest and opened his mouth and the awful skirl arose once again as if to pollute the nightair  then ongoloo roared  with mingled surprise and ferocity his men took up the strain as they rushed towards the now dimly visible foe  savage nerves could stand no more  the raturans turned and fled as one man  they descended the pass as they had never before descended it they coursed over the plains like greyhounds they passed through their own villages like a whirlwind drew most of the inhabitants after them like the living tail of a mad comet and only stopped when they fell exhausted on the damp ground in the remotest depths of their own dismal swamps    chapter seven  strange to say the anger of the raturans was not assuaged by the rebuff which they received at that time  they took counsel again and resolved to wait till the suspicions of the mountainmen had been allayed and then attack them when off their guard  meanwhile zeppa who did not at all concern himself with these matters took it into his head one day that he would teach his little favourite lippy to sing  being a religious man he naturally selected hymns as the foundation of his teaching  at first he found it rather uphill work for lippy happened to be gifted with a strong sense of the ludicrous so that when he took her on his kneethe day on which the idea occurred to himopened his mouth and gave forth the first notes of a hymn in a fine sonorous bass voice the child gazed at him for a few moments in openeyed wonder and then burst into an uncontrollable fit of openmouthed laughter  poor zeppa till that day since his mental breakdown the idea of singing had never once occurred to him and this reception of his first attempt to teach disconcerted him  he stopped abruptly and gazed at the child with a perplexed expression  this gaze was evidently regarded by lippy as an additional touch of humour for she went off into renewed explosions of delight and the lesson had to be given up for that time zeppa was gifted however with patient perseverance in a remarkable degree  he renewed his efforts but changed his plan  from that time forward he took to humming hymns in a low sweet voice as if for his own amusement  in a short time he had the satisfaction of hearing lippy attempt of her own accord to sing one of the hymns that had taken her fancy  she went wrong in one or two notes however which gave zeppa the opportunity of putting her right  he took her on his knee and told her in her own tongue to try it again  listen this is the way he said opening his mouth to give an example but the first note had scarcely begun to sound when lippy thrust her brown fist into his mouth and told him to stop  she would sing it herself  accordingly she began in a sweet tiny little voice and her teacher gazed at her with intense pleasure depicted on his handsome face until she reached the note where she had formerly gone wrong  nonot so sing thus he said giving the right notes  the pupil took it up at once and thus the singing lessons were fairly begun  but the matter did not rest here for lippy proud of her new acquirement soon began to exhibit her powers to her little companions and ere long a few of the smallest of these ventured to creep into zeppas hut while the daily lesson was going on  gradually they grew bolder and joined in the exercise  zeppa took pleasure in helping them and at last permitted as many as could crowd into his hut to do so  those who could not get inside sat on the ground outside and as the hut was open in front the gathering soon increased  thus insensibly without a welldefined intention or effort on the part of any one the praise of god and the sweet name of jesus ascended to heaven from that heathen village  the assembling of these children for their lesson brought powerfully to zeppas mind one day the meetings of the ratinga people for worship and the appropriateness of beginning with prayer occurred to him accordingly that morning just as he was about to commence the hymns he clasped his hands raised his eyes and briefly asked gods blessing on the work  profound astonishment kept the little ones quiet and before they had time to recover the prayer was over  zeppas mode of terminating the assembly was characteristic  he did not like to order the children away much less to put them out of his hut and the little creatures being fond of the teacher were prone to remain too long  when therefore he thought it time to close he simply rose up and took himself off leaving his congregation to disperse when and how it pleased  sometimes on these occasions he would remain away for perhaps two or three days having totally forgotten the singing class to the great disappointment of the children  one night while he was thus absent the men of ratura delivered the attack which they had long meditated  it was an unusually dark and still night such a night as tends almost irresistibly to quiet and subdue wayward spirits and induces man to think of his creator  such a night as is apt to fill the guilty conscience with unresting fears as though it felt the near approach of that avenging sword which sooner or later it must meet  nevertheless unmoved by its influencesexcept in so far as it suited their dark designsthe raturans chose it for the fell purpose of invading their neighbours lands and exterminating their ancient foes for driven to desperation by the taunts and scorn of the mountainmen they felt that nothing short of extermination would suffice  and they were right  extermination of the sinners or the sins was indeed their only chance of peace  not knowing the gospel method of blotting out the latter their one resource lay in obliterating the former  in the dead of nightthat darkest hour when deeds of villainy and violence are usually donethe raturan chief once more assembled his men from all quarters of the rolling plains and the dismal swamps until the entire force of the tribe was under his command  leaving the aged men and boys to protect the women and children those darkskinned warriors marched away to battlenot with the flaunting banners and martial music of civilised man but with the profound silence and the stealthy tread of the savage  though the work in hand was the same the means to the end were different we will therefore describe them  had it been a daylight battle to which they went forth their women and boys would have followed with reserve ammunition in the shape of baskets full of stones and spare javelins but being a night attack the fighting men went aloneeach armed with a heavy club a light spear and a stone knife or hatchet  arrived at the pass where they had met with such a singular repulse on a former occasion the main body was halted and scouts were sent out in advance to see that all was clear  then the plan of attack was formed one detachment was to approach the enemys village on the right another was to go round to the left while the main body was to advance in front  there is a proverb relating to the plans of men as well as mice which receives verification in every land and time  its truth received corroboration at this time on sugarloaf island  on that same night it chanced that the chief ongoloo was unable to sleep  he sent for his primeministerialjester and one of his chiefs to whom he proposed a ramble  the chief and jester professed themselves charmed with the proposal although each had been roused from a pleasant slumber  in the course of the ramble they came unexpectedly on one of the raturan scouts whom they temporarily extinguished with a club  ongoloo became at once alive to the situation and took instant action  wapoota he said in an excited whisper run to the rear of the foe go swiftly like the sea bird  when you get there yell shrieklike likeyou know how  as you did last time  change your ground at each yellso they will think you a host  fear not to be captured  your death is nothing  away  a kick facilitated wapootas flight and the two chiefs returned at speed to rouse the sleeping camp  wapoota performed his part noblyand without being captured for he did not agree with ongoloo as to the unimportance of his own death  at the unexpected outcry in the rear the raturans halted and held a hasty council of war  let us go back and fight them said one  no use they are evil spiritsnot men said another  some agreed with the formersome with the latter  while we waste time here said the leading chief the mountain dogs will get ready for us  come  forward  the chief was right  ongoloos ruse caused delay so that when the raturans reached the village they found armed men ready to receive them these they attacked with great courage and waged a somewhat scrambling fight until daylight enabled each party to concentrate its forces  meanwhile at the first alarm the women and children of the village had been sent off to the mountains for safety  among the fugitives were lippy and her mother  these happened to meet with the enemys detachment which had been sent to assault the village on the left  the women scattered and fled  the savage warriors pursued and several were taken among them lippy and her mother who were promptly despatched to the rear  those of the broken band that escaped continued their flight to the hills  they had not gone far when they met zeppa returning from one of his rambles  his surprise on hearing that the village had been attacked was great and his anxiety considerable  although he had refused to go out to war with his entertainers he felt no disposition to stand idly by when they were attacked  disordered though his mind was he could make a clear distinction between aggressive war and selfdefence  and where is lippy he asked glancing round on the terrified faces  she is caught and carried awaywith her mother  what exclaimed zeppa with a flash of his bright eyes that told of natural rage mingling with the fires of insanity  the women did not wait for more  they ran away from him in terror  but zeppa had heard enough  turning his face towards the village he sped over the ground at a pace that soon brought him in sight of the combatants who seemed to be swaying to and fronow here now thereas the tide of battle flowed and victory leaned sometimes to one side sometimes to the other  zeppa was unarmed  as he drew near he was observed by both parties to stop abruptly in his career and wrench out of the ground a stake that had been meant for the cornerpost of a newlybegun hut  it resembled the great club of hercules rather than a weapon of modern man  whirling it like a feather round his head the maniac rushed on  he was thoroughly roused  a feeling of desperate anxiety coupled with a sense of horrible injustice had set his spirit in a blaze  his great size which became more apparent as he advanced his flashing eyes compressed lips and the wild flowing of his uncut hair and beard gave him altogether an aspect so terrible that his foes trembled while his friends rejoiced and when at last he uttered a roar like a mad bull and launched himself into the thickest of the fight the raturans could not stand it but turned and fled in a body under the impression that he was more than human  he was too fleet for them however  overtaking a flying knot he brought the the cornerpost down on the mass and three warriors were levelled with the ground  then hurling the mighty club away as if it were a mere hindrance to him he ran straight at the leader of the raturans who being head and shoulders above his fellows seemed a suitable foe to single out  before reaching him however his attention was arrested by a cry from some one in the midst of the enemy in front  it was the voice of wapoota who was trying to break his way through the flying foe to his own people  fortunately zeppa recognised the voice and darted towards his friend who was hard pressed at the time by a crowd of opponents  one roar from the maniac sent these flying like chaff before the wind it must be added however for the credit of the men of ratura that ongoloo and his warriors had backed up their new leader gallantly  when wapoota saw his deliverer he ran to him panting and said  come with methis waylippy is here  that was sufficient  zeppa became submissive like a child while the jester taking him by the hand ran with him at racing speed in the direction of the raturan villages towards which the child and her mother were being led by the party which had captured them  this was briefly explained to zeppa by wapoota who had chanced to encounter the party when returning from his yelling mission if we may so express it  the race was a long one but neither the madman nor his friend flagged until they overtook the party  it consisted of about thirty warriors but if it had been thirty hundred it would have made no difference in the effect of zeppas roar and aspect as he rushed upon them with obviously awful intentions though without arms  in fact the latter circumstance tended rather to increase the fears of the superstitious natives  they fled as one man at the first sight of the maniac and lippy was recovered  instantly zeppas ferocity vanished and the tenderest of smiles rippled over his face as he took the child in his arms and kissed her  but wapoota did not feel quite so easy for in their mad race they had outstripped the flying enemy bands of whom were constantly passing them in their flight before the mountainmen  his anxieties however were groundless for no sooner did any of the raturans set eyes on zeppa than with howls of consternation they diverged at a tangent like hunted hares and coursed away homeward on the wings of terror  as on former occasions of conquest the mountainmen pursued the flying host into their swamps but they did not as in former times return to slay the aged and carry the women and children into captivity  to the surprise of all his followers and the anger of not a few ongoloo commanded his men to return to their village and leave the raturans alone  one of his chiefs who showed a disposition to resist his authority he promptly knocked down whereupon the rest became obedient and went quietly home  on reaching the village zeppa went straight to his hut with lippy on his shoulder  apparently he had forgotten all about the recent fight for without even waiting to take food or rest he sat down and began to give his little friend a singing lesson  with the air of a little princess who felt that she was only receiving her due the child accepted the attention  her young companions attracted by the sweet sounds soon flocked to the old place of rendezvous and when the last of the straggling warriors returned from the field of battle they found the singing class going full swing as if nothing had happened  but when the wounded and the dead were brought in other sounds began to arisesounds of wailing and woe which soon drowned the hymns of praise  as soon as zeppa became fully alive to this fact he ceased singing and went about trying to comfort those who wept but from his perplexed air and the frequency with which he paused in his wanderings to and fro and passed his hand across his brow as if to clear away some misty clouds that rested there it was evident that his shattered intellect had taken in a very imperfect impression of what had occurred  as if to get rid of this beclouded state he started off that evening at a quick walk towards his favourite haunts among the hills  no one ever followed him on these occasions  the natives regarded his person as in some measure sacred and would have deemed it not only dangerous but insolent to go up among the rocky heights when the madman was known to be there  once indeed wapoota with that presumptuous temerity which is a characteristic of fools in general ventured on the strength of old acquaintance to follow him and even went towards the well known cave where he had found refuge and protection in the day of his distress but zeppa had either forgotten his former intercourse with the jester or intended to repudiate the connection for he did not receive him kindly  on the way up wapoota who felt somewhat timorous about the visit had made up his mind as to the best mode of address with which to approach his friend  he had decided that although he was not particularly youthful the language and manner of a respectful son to a revered father would best befit the occasion  accordingly when he reached the cave and saw zeppa busy beside his fire with a cocoanut he assumed a stooping attitude of profound respect and drew near  zeppa looked up with a frown as if annoyed at the intrusion  your unworthy son began wapoota comes to  but he got no further  he could not well have hit upon a more unfortunate phrase  my unworthy son shouted zeppa leaping up while unearthly fires seemed to shoot from his distended eyes  my son son  ha haaaa  the horrified intruder heard the terminal yell and saw the maniac bound over the fire towards him but he saw and heard no more for his limbs became suddenly endued with something like electric vitality  he turned and shot over a small precipice as if flung from an ancient catapult what he alighted on he did not know still less did he care  it was sufficiently soft to prevent death  another awful cry echoed and reechoed from the heights above and intensified the electric battery within him  he went down the slopes regardless of gradient at a pace that might have left even zeppa behind if he had followed but zeppa did not follow  when wapoota went over the precipice and disappeared zeppa halted and stood erect gazing with a questioning aspect at the sky and drawing his hand slowly across his brows with that wearied and puzzled aspect which had become characteristic  returning after a few minutes to his cave he reseated himself quietly beside his fire and with his usual placid expression devoted himself earnestly to his cocoanut  that was the first and last occasion on which the poor madman experienced intrusion from the natives in his mountain retreat    chapter eight  let us return now to our miserable and halfhearted pirate far out upon the raging sea  it must not be supposed that the pacific ocean is always peaceful  no there are days and nights when its winds howl and its billows roar and heave and fume with all the violence and fury of any other terrestrial sea  on one such night the pirates barque was tossed like a cork on the pacifics heaving bosom while the shrieking winds played as it were fiendishly with the fluttering shreds of sails which they had previously blown to ribbons  richard rosco stood beside the weatherbulwarks holding on to one of the mizzen backstays  his mate redford assisted the man at the wheel  upwards of three years of roscos rule had subdued redford to the condition of a hypocritical and sly but by no means a submissive savage  one or two spurts at the commencement of their career had satisfied the mate as well as the men that the only way to overcome rosco was to take his life and as redford had not sufficient courage and the men no desire to do that they pursued their evil courses in comparative harmony  nevertheless the pirate captain knew well that the savage redford was more acceptable to the pirates than himself so he determined to carry out intentions which had been simmering in his brain for some time and rid the pirate crew of his presence  we will sight the island tomorrow afternoon sir if this holds said the mate  i know it answered rosco  there is no good anchorage around it continued the mate  so you have told me before returned the captain but it matters not we shall not anchor  not anchor repeated redford in surprise  i understood that we were to land there to ship sandalwood  the crew thought so too and im quite sure  wellgo onwhat are you sure of  oh nothingonly sure that captain rosco understands his own intentions best  rosco made no reply and nothing further passed between the inharmonious pair at that time  next day the gale abated and as redford had predicted sugarloaf island was sighted in the afternoon  running close in under the shelter of the mountain the barque was hoveto and a boat lowered  the crew will take arms with them i suppose sir asked the mate  of course though there will not be occasion for them as there are no natives at this part of the island  i merely wish to ascend the hill to reconnoitre  you will go with me  put your pistols in your belt and fetch my rifle  we may get some fresh meat among the hills  breechloading rifles had just come into fashion at that time and the pirate captain had possessed himself of a doublebarrelled one with which he became wonderfully expert  this weapon was put into the boat with a large pouch full of cartridges  no comments were made in regard to this the pirates having been accustomed to see their commander land in various places for a days shooting the result of which was usually an acceptable addition of fresh food to their larder  remain by the boat lads till we return said rosco leaping out when the keel grated on the shore  come with me redford  the mate obeyed following his commander towards the same ravine where about four years before they had seen poor zeppa disappear among the recesses of the mountain  redford felt a little surprise and more than a little discomfort at the peculiar conduct of his captain but he comforted himself with the thought that if he should attempt any violence there was a brace of pistols in his belt and a cutlass at his side  he even for a moment meditated using the pistols when he looked at roscos broad back but he knew that some of the men in the boat had a sort of sneaking fondness for their captain and refrainedat least till he should get out of sight of the boat and into the shelter of the woods where his actions could not be seen and any account of the affair might be coloured to suit his convenience  richard rosco divined pretty well what was passing in his mates mind he also knew that as long as they were in sight of the boat his enemy would not dare to injure him he therefore threw his rifle carelessly over his shoulder and walked with the most easy air of nonchalance over the strip of level land that lay between the sea and the forest that fringed the mountain base  on the instant of entering the mouth of the ravine however he wheeled suddenly round and said  now redford you will lead the way and i will direct you  the mate was startled and his right hand moved as if by involuntary impulse toward the handle of a pistol  instantly the muzzle of the captains rifle was pointed at his breast  drop your hand he said sternly  another such threat and i will shoot you with as much indifference as i would a sneaking dog  now go on and do as i bid you  redford gave in at once  he was at roscos mercy  without a word he passed on in advance and ascended the ravine with a quick steady step to say the truth he knew well that while his commander on the one hand would not threaten what he did not mean to perform on the other hand he would never shed human blood needlessly  he therefore felt less troubled than might have been expected  they soon reached a small eminence or rocky plateau from which was obtained a splendid view of the sea with the barque floating like a large albatross on its surface  from that point the boat could also be clearly seen and every step of the path by which they had reached the eminence  now redford said rosco throwing his rifle into the hollow of his left arm so as to bring the muzzle full on the mates chest while with the forefinger of his right hand he lightly touched the triggers draw your pistols from your belt and be very careful how you do it very carefulfor if even by chance you touch hammer or trigger you are a dead man  there was something of banter in roscos manner yet this was associated with an air and tone of such calm decision that the mate felt curiously uncomfortable  he obeyed orders however promptly and stood with a pistol in each hand  it must have been a tantalising position for had they been cocked he could have blown out roscos brains in a moment indeed he was sorely tempted to break the halfcock catch on the chance of one or both going off but his commanders eye and muzzle forbade it  drop them said rosco suddenly  if they had been redhot irons the mate could scarcely have let them go more quickly  it almost seemed as if his guilty desire had passed into the weapons and intensified the laws of gravitationthey came to the rock with such a clatter  that will do  now two paces stepback march  splendid  why redford i had no idea you were so well up in your drill said rosco stepping to the spot beside the pistols which the mate had just vacated  you are fit to act fugleman to the british army  now clasp your hands behind your back and dont unclasp them till i give you leave  its a new piece of drill but not difficult to learn  the cowed pirate was too much alarmed to be amused by this last sally he stood sulkily it is true but anxiously awaiting further orders  look here redford continued the pirate captain  i want to prove to you that the distance from this spot to the boat is about five hundred yards  you see that gull on the water  it is about the same distance off as the boatwell  he sighted his rifle for five hundred yards took a rapid aim fired and the gull leaping its own height out of the water fell back dead  oh dont start my fine fellow you forget the other barrel  the reminder was in time to check an unwise impulse on the mates part  now continued rosco assuming a more serious tone i have brought you here for a last conversation  you have long desired to command that vessel and i have long desired to resign the command  we shall both have our desires gratified this day  i intend to take up my abode here you are free to go where you pleasebut not to come here again  lay my words to heart now and let me advise you to impress them on your crew if you ever venture to come to this island again i promise you to shoot every man that puts his foot upon the shore and to shoot all that follow as long as my ammunition lasts  and you see i have brought a pretty large bag of it on shore which i do not mean to waste on gulls or anything else  i mean to keep it entirely for your benefit my worthy friendso after this warning you will please yourself and take your own course  now go down to the boat row straight back to your ship tell your crew whatever you choose as to our interview and go where you please  but bear in mind that my rifle will cover you during every step that you take from this spot down to the beach ay and after you have left the beach too until you are safe on board remember also that the rifle is sighted for one thousand yards and that the barque is not much farther off than that  go  the last word was uttered in such a tone that redford instantly turned and without even a word of reply retraced his steps to the shore then he promptly embarked and the men promptly shoved off while rosco sat on the rocky eminence quietly watching them  no words did redford speak to his wondering men except such as were needed to direct the boat  on gaining the vessel he sprang up the side ordered all sail to be set and the guns to be loaded  when the vessel had increased her distance a few hundred yards from the shore he brought her broadside to bear on the land and then having carefully laid the guns gave the word to fire  the hull of the pirate vessel was instantly enveloped in a snowy curtain of smoke and next moment the echoes of the hills were rudely startled by a thunderous crash while a dozen or more iron balls burst like bombshells on the cliffs immediately above the spot where rosco sat sending showers of rock in all direction and driving the seamews in shrieking terror from their nests  a mere waste of ammunition murmured rosco with a contemptuous curl of his lip as he rose  but the next may be better aimed so ill bid you goodbye redford  descending into the ravine he was soon safe from the iron messengers of death of which the enraged redford sent another group ashore before finally bidding the island farewell  now it so happened that zeppa was ascending the sugarloaf mountain on its other side when all this cannonading was going on  he was naturally surprised at such unwonted sounds and remembering that cannon implied ships and that ships were necessary to deliverance from his enforced exile he naturally hastened his steps and experienced an unusual degree of excitement  when he reached his favourite outlooka ledge of flat land on the southern face of the hill partially covered with busheshe saw the pirate vessel sailing away from the island and the smoke of her two broadsides rising like two snowy cloudlets into the blue sky  at first an expression of disappointment flitted across zeppas countenance but it quickly passed leaving the usual air of childlike submission behind he sat down on a ledge of rock and gazed long and wistfully at the retreating vessel  then casting his eyes upwards to the blue vault he gave way to an impulse which had been growing upon him for some timehe began to pray aloud  it was while he was engaged in this act of devotion that richard rosco came upon the scene  at the first sound of the madmans deep voice the pirate stopped and listened with a feeling of superstitious dread which seemed to check the very action of his heartfor at the moment a few bushes concealed his old enemy from his sight  stepping cautiously forward he could see through the interlacing boughs without himself being seen and then the blood forsook his visage and his limbs trembled as if he had been a paralysed old man  could the man before him in tattered garments with the dishevelled mass of flowing curly irongrey hair with the long heavy beard and moustache the hollow cheeks and the wonderfully solemn eyescould that be zeppa  it seemed impossible yet there was no mistaking the well known and still handsome features or the massive sinewy frame still less was it possible to doubt the deep sonorous voice  but thenzeppa had been seen on ratinga island and the description given of him by those who had seen him had been so exact that rosco had never doubted his return home and recovery of reason  whatever he thought or felt however the pirates whole being was soon absorbed in the madmans prayer  it was simple like himself  he asked for permission to return home and made a humble confession of sin from the tenor of it there could be no doubt that poor zeppa had come to regard his exile as a direct punishment from god  then the prayer changed to a petition for blessings on his wife and son and the deep voice became deeper and full of tenderness  the pirate experienced a shock of surprisewas the son then still alive  and if so how came zeppa to know  he could not know it  the man before him must either be the creature of his own disordered fancy or a real visitant from the world of spirits  as these thoughts coursed like lightning through the pirates brain he was suddenly startled by the sound of his own name  and rosco said the madman still looking steadily up into the sky while a dark frown slowly gathered on his browoh  god curseno no no  forgive me lord and forgive him and save him from his sins  he stopped abruptly here and looked confused  the mention of the pirate and his sins seemed to remind the poor father that his son had been murdered and yet somehow he had fancied him alive and had been praying for him  he could not understand it at all the old look of mingled perplexity and patient submission was beginning again to steal over his face and his hand was in the familiar act of passing over the troubled brow when zeppas eyes alighted on roscos countenance  it would be difficult to say which at that moment most resembled a maniac  the sight of his enemy did more perhaps to restore zeppa to a spurious kind of sanity than anything that had occurred since the fatal day of his bereavement and called up an expression of fierce indignation to his countenance  all memory of his previous prayer vanished and he glared for a moment at the pirate with intense fury  at the same time rosco stood with blanched cheeks intense horror in his eyes his lower jaw dropped and his whole frame as it were transfixed  the inaction of both was however but momentary  the madman sprang up clutched the heavy staff he was wont to use in climbing the hills and rushed impetuously but without word or cry at his foe  the pirate brave though he undoubtedly was lost all selfcontrol and fled in abject terror  fortunately the first part of the descent from the spot was unobstructed for in the then condition of their feelings both men would probably have flung themselves over any precipice that had lain in their way  a few moments however sufficed to restore enough of selfpossession to the pirate to enable him to direct his course with some intelligence  he naturally followed the path by which he had ascended and soon gained the beach closely followed by zeppa  in speed the two men were at the time well matched for any advantage that zeppa had in point of size and strength was counterbalanced by the youth and superstitious terror of rosco  at first indeed the madman gained on his foe but as the impetuosity of his first dash abated the pirates courage returned and warming to the race he held his ground  like hare and greyhound they coursed along the level patch of ground that lay on that side of the island until they came in sight of the swampy land covered with low but dense wood which bounded the lands of the raturans  dismay overwhelmed the pirate at first sight of it  then hope rebounded into his soul and he put on a spurt which carried him considerably ahead of his pursuer  he reached the edge of the swampland and dashed into its dark recesses  he had barely entered it a few yards when he plunged into water up to the neck  the heavy root of a tree chanced to hang over him  drawing himself close beneath it he remained quite still  it was his bestindeed his onlychance  next moment zeppa plunged headlong into another part of the same halfhidden pool  arising like some shaggy monster of the swamp with weeds and slimy plants trailing from his locks he paused a moment as if to make sure of his direction before resuming the chase  at that moment he was completely in the power of the pirate for his broad back was not more than a few feet from the screen of roots and tendrils by which rosco was partially hidden  the temptation was strong  the pirate drew the keen knife that always hung at his girdle but a feeling of pity induced him to hesitate  the delay sufficed to save zeppas life  next moment he seized an overhanging branch drew himself out of the swamp and sped on his way but having lost sight of his enemy he soon paused and looked round with indecision  it must have been a dream he muttered and began to retrace his steps with an air of humiliation as if half ashamed of having given way to such excitement  from his hidingplace the pirate saw him pass and watched him out of sight  then clambering quickly out of the stagnant pool he pushed deeper and deeper into the recesses of the morass regardless of every danger except that of falling into the madmans hands    chapter nine  who shall tell or who shall understand the thoughts of richard rosco the expirate as he wandered lost yet regardless in that dismal swamp  the human spirit is essentially galvanic  it jumps like a grasshopper bounds like a kangaroo  the greatest of men can only restrain it in a slight degree  the small men either have exasperating trouble with it or make no attempt to curb it at all  it is a rebellious spirit  the best of books tells us that greater is he that ruleth it than he that taketh a city  think of that youngster whoever you are who readeth this  think of the conquerors of the world  think of the great alexander whose might was so tremendous that he subjugated kingdoms and spent his life in doing little else  think of napoleon the great whose armies ravaged europe from the atlantic to asia who even beganthough he failed to finishthe conquest of africa who made kings as you might make pasteboard men and filled the civilised world with fear as well as with blood and gravesall for his own glorification  think of these and other great men and reflect that it is written he who rules his own spirit is greater than they  yes the human spirit is difficult to deal with and uncomfortably explosive  at least so richard rosco found it when towards the close of the day on which his enemy chased him into the dismal swamp he sat down on a gnarled root and began to reflect  his spirit jumped almost out of him with contempt when he thought that for the first time in his life he had fled in abject terror from the face of man  he could not conceal that from himself despite the excuse suggested by pridethat he had half believed zeppa to be an apparition what even if that were true  had he not boastfully said more than once that he would defy the foul fiend himself if he should attempt to thwart him  then his spirit bounded into a region of disappointed rage when he thought of the lost opportunity of stabbing his enemy to the heart after that unbidden and in spite of him it dropped into an abyss of something like fierce despair when he recalled the past surveyed the present and forecast the future  truly if hell ever does begin to men on earth it began that day to the pirate as he sat in the twilight on the gnarled root with one of his feet dangling in the slimy water his hands clasped so tight that the knuckles stood out white and his eyes gazing upwards with an expression that seemed the very embodiment of woe  then his spirit lost its spring and he began to crawl in memory on the shores of other days  he thought of the days when comparatively innocent he rambled on the sunny hills of old england played and did mischief with comrades formed friendships and fought battles and knew what it was to experience good impulses understood the joy of giving way to these as well as the depression consequent on resisting them and recalled the time when he regarded his mother as the supreme judge in every case of difficultythe only comforter in every time of sorrow  at this point his spirit grovelled like a crushed worm in the stagnant pool of his despair for he had no hope  he had sinned every opportunity away  he had defied god and man and nothing was left to him apparently save a fearful lookingfor of judgment  as he bent over the pool he saw his own distorted visage dimly reflected therein and the thought occurredwhy not end it all at once  five minutes at the utmost and all will be over  the pirate was a physically brave man beyond his fellows  he had courage to carry the idea into effect butafter death the judgment  where had he heard these words  they were strange to him but they were not new  those who are trained in the knowledge of gods word are not as a general rule moved in an extraordinary degree by quotations from it  it is often otherwise with those who have had little of it instilled into them in youth and none in later years  that which may seem to a christian but a familiar part of the old old story sometimes becomes to hundreds and thousands of human beings a startling revelation  it was so to the pirate on this occasion  the idea of judgment took such a hold of him that he shrank from death with far more fear than he ever had with courage faced it in days gone by  trembling terrified abject he sat there incapable of consecutive thought or intelligent action  at last the gloom which had been slowly deepening over the swamp sank into absolute blackness and the chills of night which were particularly sharp in such places began to tell upon him  but he did not dare to move lest he should fall into the swamp  slowly he extended himself on the root wound his arms and fingers convulsively among leaves and branches and held on like a drowning man  an aguefit seemed to have seized him for he trembled violently in every limb and as his exhausted spirit was about to lose itself in sleep or as it seemed to him in death he gave vent to a subdued cry god be merciful to me a sinner  rest such as it was refreshed the pirate and when the grey dawn struggling through the dense foliage awoke him he rose up with a feeling of submissiveness which seemed somehow to restore his energy  he was without purpose however for he knew nothing of his surroundings and of course could form no idea of what was best to be done  in these circumstances he rose with a strange sensation of helplessness and wandered straight before him  and oh how beautiful were the scenes presented to his vision everything in this world is relative  that which is hideous at one time is lovely at another  in the night the evening or at the grey dawn the swamp was indeed dismal in the extreme but when the morning advanced towards noon all that was changed as if magically by the action of the sun  black repulsive waters reflected patches of the bright blue sky and every leaf and spray and parasite and tendril that grew in the world above was faithfully mirrored in the world below vistas of gnarled roots and graceful stems and drooping boughs were seen on right and left before and behind extending as if into infinite space while innumerable insects engaged in the business of their brief existence were filling the region with miniature melodies  but richard rosco saw it not  at least it made no sensible impression on him  his mental retina was capable of receiving only two pictures the concentrated accumulation of past sinthe terrible anticipation of future retribution  between these two present danger and suffering were wellnigh forgotten  towards noon however the sense of hunger began to oppress him  he allayed it with a few wild berries  then fatigue began to tell for walking from root to root sometimes on short stretches of solid land sometimes over soft mud often kneedeep in water was very exhausting at last he came to what appeared to be the end of the swamp and here he discovered a small patch of cultivated ground  the discovery awoke him to the necessity of caution but he was awakened too late for already had one of the raturan natives observed him advancing out of the swamp  instantly he gave the alarm that a white face was approaching  of course the appearance of one suggested a scout and the speedy approach of a host  horrified to see a supposed enemy come from a region which they had hitherto deemed their sure refuge the few natives who dwelt there flew to arms and ran to meet the advancing foe  the pirate was not just then in a mood to resist  he had no weapon and no spirit left  he therefore suffered himself to be taken prisoner without a struggle satisfied apparently to know that the madman was not one of those into whose hands he had fallen  great was the rejoicing among the raturans when the prisoner was brought in for they were still smarting under the humiliation of their defeat and knew well that their discomfiture had been largely owing to the influence of white faces  true they did not fall into the mistake of supposing that rosco was the awful giant who had chased and belaboured them so unmercifully with a long stake but they at once concluded that he was a comrade of zeppaperhaps one of a band who had joined their foes  besides whether he were a comrade or not was a matter of small moment  sufficient for them that his face was white that he belonged to a race which in the person of zeppa had wrought them evil and that he was now in their power  of course the raturans had not during all these years remained in ignorance of the existence of zeppa  they had heard of his dwelling in the mountain soon after he had visited the village of their enemies and had also become aware of the fact that the white man was a madman and a giant but more than this they did not know because of their feud preventing interchange of visits or of news between the tribes  their imaginations therefore having full swing had clothed zeppa in some of the supposed attributes of a demigod  these attributes however the same imaginations quickly exchanged for those of a demidevil when at last they saw zeppa in the flesh and were put to flight by him  his size indeed had rather fallen short of their expectation for sixty feet had been the average estimate but his fury and aspect had come quite up to the mark and the fact that not a man of the tribe had dared to stand before him was sufficient to convince a set of superstitious savages that he was a real devil in human guise  to have secured one of his minor comrades therefore was a splendid and unlookedfor piece of good fortune which they resolved to make the most of by burning the pirate alive  little did the wretched man think when they conducted him to a hut in the middle of their village and supplied him with meat and drink that this was a preliminary ceremony to the terrible end they purposed to make of him  it is true he did not feel easy in his mind for despite this touch of hospitality his captors regarded him with looks of undisguised hatred  there was something of the feline spirit in these raturan savages  as the cat plays with the mouse before killing it so did they amuse themselves with the pirate before putting him to the final torture which was to terminate his life  and well was it for rosco that they did so for the delay thus caused was the means of saving his lifethough he did not come out of the dread ordeal scathless  they began with a dancea wardance it is to be presumedat all events it involved the flourishing of clubs and spears the formation of hideous faces and the perpetration of frightful grimaces with bounds and yells enough to warrant the conclusion that the dance was not one of peace  richard rosco formed the centre of that dancethe sun as it were of the system round which the dusky host revolved  but he did not join in the celebration for he was bound firmly to a stake set up in the ground and could not move hand or foot  at first the warriors of the tribe moved round the pirate in a circle stamping time slowly with their feet while the women and children stood in a larger circle marking time with hands and voices  presently the dance grew more furious and ultimately attained to a pitch of wild violence which is quite indescribable  at the height of the paroxysm a warrior would ever and anon dart out from the circle with whirling club and bring it down as if on the prisoners skull but would turn it aside so deftly that it just grazed his ear and fell with a dull thud on the ground  other warriors made at him with their spears which they thrust with lightning speed at his naked breast but checked them just as they touched the skin  two or three of these last were so inexpert that they pricked the skin slightly and blood began to trickle down but these clumsy warriors were instantly kicked from the circle of dancers and compelled to take their place among the women and children  when they had exhausted themselves with the dance the warriors sat down to feast upon viands which had in the meanwhile been preparing for them and while they feasted they taunted their prisoner with cowardice and told him in graphic language of the horrors that yet awaited him  fortunately for the miserable manwho was left bound to the stake during the feasthe did not understand a word of what was said  he had been stripped of all clothing save a pair of short breeches reaching a little below the knee and his naked feet rested on a curious piece of basketwork  this last would have been too slight to bear his weight if he had not been almost suspended by the cords that bound him to the stake  rosco was very pale  he felt that his doom was fixed but his native courage did not forsake him  he braced himself to meet his fate like a man and resolved to shut his eyes when next they began to dance round him so that he should not shrink from the blow or thrust which he felt sure would ere long end his illspent life  but the time seemed to him terribly long and while he hung there his mind began to recall the gloomy past  perhaps it was a refinement of cruelty on the part of the savages that they gave him time to think so that his courage might be reduced or overcome  if so they were mistaken in their plan  the pirate showed no unusual sign of fear  once he attempted to pray but he found that almost impossible  wearied at length with waiting the savages arose and began to put fagots and other combustibles under the wickerbasket on which the pirate stood  then indeed was roscos courage tried nearly to the uttermost and when he saw the fire actually applied he uttered a cry of help help so loud and terrible that his enemies fell back for a moment as if appalled  and help came from a quarter that rosco little expected  but to explain this we must return to zeppa  we have said that he gave up the chase of the pirate under the impression that the whole affair was a dream but on returning to his cave he found that he could not rest  old associations and memories had been too violently aroused and after spending a sleepless night he rose up determined to resume the chase which he had abandoned  he returned to the spot where he had lost sight of his enemy in the swamp and after a brief examination of the place advanced in as straight a line as he could through the tangled and interlacing boughs  naturally he followed the trail of the pirate for the difficulties or peculiar formations of the ground which had influenced the latter in his course also affected zeppa much in the same way  thus it came to pass that when the raturans were about to burn their prisoner alive the madman was close to their village  but zeppa did not think of the raturans  he had never seen or heard of them except on the occasion of their attack on the mountainmen  his sole desire was to be revenged on the slayer of his boy  and even in this matter the poor maniac was still greatly perplexed for his christian principles and his naturally gentle spirit forbade revenge on the one hand while on the other a sense of justice told him that murder should not go unpunished or the murderer remain at large so that it required the absolute sight of rosco before his eyes to rouse him to the pitch of fury necessary to hold him to the execution of his purpose  it was while he was advancing slowly and puzzling his brain over these considerations that roscos cry for help rang out  zeppa recognised the voice and a dark frown settled on his countenance as he stopped to listen  then an appalling yell filled his ears  it was repeated again and again as the kindling flames licked round the pirates naked feet causing him to writhe in mortal agony  instantly zeppa was stirred to action  he replied with a tremendous shout  well did the raturans know that shout  with caught breath and blanched faces they turned towards the direction whence it came and they saw the madman bounding towards them with streaming locks and glaring eyes  a single look sufficed  the entire population of the village turned and fled  next moment zeppa rushed up to the stake and kicked the firebrands from beneath the poor victim who was by that time almost insensible from agony and smoke  drawing his knife zeppa cut the cords and lifting the pirate in his arms laid him on the ground  the madman was terribly excited  he had been drenched from frequent immersions in the swamp besides being much exhausted by his long and difficult walk or rather scramble after a sleepless night and this sudden meeting with his worst enemy in such awful circumstances seemed to have produced an access of insanity so that the pirate felt uncertain whether he had not been delivered from a horrible fate to fall into one perhaps not less terrible  as he lay there on his back scorched tormented with thirst and helpless he watched with fearful anxiety each motion of the madman for some moments zeppa seemed undecided  he stood with heaving chest expanding nostrils and flashing eyes gazing after the flying crew of natives  then he turned sharply on the unhappy man who lay at his feet  get up he said fiercely and follow me  i cannot get up zeppa replied the pirate in a faint voice  dont you see my feet are burnt  god help me  he ended with a deep groan and the ferocity at once left zeppas countenance but the wild light did not leave his eyes nor did he become less excited in his actions  come i will carry you he said  stooping down quickly he raised the pirate in his arms as if he had been a child and bore him away  avoiding the swamp he proceeded in the direction of the mountain by another routea route which ran so near to ongoloos village that the raturans never ventured to use it  he passed the village without having been observed and began to toil slowly up the steep ascent panting as he went for his mighty strength had been overtaxed and his helpless burden was heavy  lay me down and rest yourself said rosco with a groan that he could not suppress for his scorched lower limbs caused him unutterable anguish and beads of perspiration stood upon his brow while a deadly pallor overspread his face  zeppa spoke no word in reply  he did indeed look at the speaker once uneasily but took no notice of his request  thus clasping his enemy to his breast he ascended the steep hill struggling and stumbling upwards as if with some fixed and stern purpose in view until at last he gained the shelter of his mountain cave    chapter ten  we change the scene once more and transport our readers over the ocean waves to a noble ship which is breasting those waves right gallantly it is hms furious  in a retired part of the ships cabin there are two savage nobles who do not take things quite as gallantly as the ship herself  these are our friends tomeo and buttchee of ratinga  each is seated on the cabin floor with his back against the bulkhead an expression of woebegone desolation on his visage his black legs apart and a ships bucket between them  it were bad taste to be too particular as to details here  on quitting ratinga tomeo and his brother chief had said that nothing would rejoice their hearts so much as to go to sea  their wish was gratified and not long afterwards they said that nothing could rejoice their hearts so much as to get back to land  such is the contradictoriness of human nature  there was a stiffish breeze blowing as one of the manofwarsmen expressed it and a nasty sea onhe did not say on what  there must have been something nasty also on tomeos stomach from the violent way in which he sought to get rid of it at timeswithout success  oh  buttchee my brother said tomeo of course in his native tongue many years have passed over my head a few white streaks begin toto he paused abruptly and eyed the bucket as if with an intention  to appear he continued with a short sigh also i have seen many wars and suffered much from many wounds as youyouhayou know buttchee my brother but of all the  he became silent againsuddenly  why does my brother ppause asked buttchee in a meek voiceas of one who had suffered severely in lifes pilgrimage  there was no occasion for tomeo to offer a verbal reply  after a time buttchee raised his head and wiped his eyes in which were many tearsbut not of sorrow  tomeo said he was it worth our while to forsake wives and children and church and hymns and taro fields and home for ththis  we did not leave for this replied tomeo with some acerbity for he experienced a temporary sensation of feeling better at the moment we left all for the sake of assisting our friends inthere it comes it  he said no more and both chiefs relapsed into silencegazing the while at the buckets with undue interest  they were interrupted by the sudden entrance of ebony  come you yallercheeked chiefs yous die if you no make a heffort come on deck breeve de fresh air  git up a happetite  go in for salt pork plum duff and lopscouse an youll git well fore you kin say jack rubinson  tomeo and buttchee looked up at the jovial negro and smiledimbecile smiles they were  we cannot move said tomeo and buttchee together because wew together they ceased giving the reasonit was not necessary  oh dear said ebony opening his great eyes to their widest  you no kin lib long at dat rate  better die on deck if you mus die more heasy for you to breeve up dar an more comfrable to fro you overboard wen yous got it over  with this cheering remark the worthy negro seizing the chiefs each by a hand half constrained half assisted them to rise and helped them to stagger to the quarterdeck where they were greeted by orlando captain fitzgerald waroonga and the missionary  come thats right cried the captain shaking the two melancholy chiefs by the hand glad to see you plucking up courage  tell them mr zeppa that we shall probably be at sugarloaf island tomorrow or next day  the two unfortunates were visibly cheered by the assurance  to do them justice they had not quite given way to seasickness until then for the weather had been moderately calm but the nasty sea and stiff breeze had proved too much for them  are you sure we shall find the island so soon asked orlando of the captain in a low earnest tone for the poor youths excitement and anxiety deepened as they drew near to the place where his father might possibly be foundat the same time a strange shrinking dread of what they might find made him almost wish for delay  i am not sure of course returned the captain but if my information is correct there is every probability that we shall find it tomorrow  i hopes we shall remarked waroonga  it would be a grand blessing if the lord will gif us the island and your father in same day  mos too good to be true observed ebony who was a privileged individual on board owing very much to his goodhumoured eccentricity but surely you not specs de niggers to tumbil down at yous feet all at wance massa waroonga  oh no not at once  the day of miracle have pass returned the missionary  we mus use the means and then has we not the promise that our work shall not be in vain  next day about noon the sugarloaf mountain rose out of the sea like a great pillar of hope to orlando as well as to the missionary  captain fitzgerald sailed close in sweeping the mountain side with his telescope as he advanced until close under the cliffs when he layto and held a consultation with his passengers  i see no habitations of any kind he said nor any sign of the presence of man but i have heard that the native villages lie at the lower side of the island  now the question is whether would it suit your purposes best to land an armed party here and cross over to the villages or to sail round the island drop anchor in the most convenient bay and land a party there  orlando to whom this was more directly addressed turned to the missionary  what think you waroonga  you know native thought and feeling best  i would not land armed party at all answered waroonga  but cappin fitzgald know his own business most  what he thinks  my business and yours are so mingled returned the captain that i look to you for advice  my chief duty is to obtain information as to the whereabouts of the pirate vessel and i expect that such information will be got more readily through you waroonga than any one else for besides being able to speak the native language you can probably approach the savages more easily than i can  they are not savages returned waroonga quietly they are gods ignorant children  i have seen worse men than south sea islanders with white faces an soft clothin who had not the excuse of ignorance  nay my good sir said the captain we will not quarrel about terms whatever else these ignorant children may be i know that they are brave and warlike and i shall gladly listen to your advice as to landing  if you wish to go to them in peace do not go to them with arms said waroonga  surely you would not advise me to send an unarmed party among armed savchildren returned the captain with a look of surprise while orlando regarded his friend with mingled amusement and curiosity  no  you best send no party at all  jis go round the island put down angker an leave the rest to me  but what do you propose to do asked the captain  swum to shore with bibil  orlando laughed for he now understood the missionarys plan and in a few words described the method by which waroonga had subdued the natives of ratinga  you see by this plan he continued nothing is presented to the natives which they will be tempted to steal and if they are very warlike or fierce waroongas refusal to fight reduces them to a state of quiet readiness to hear which is all that we want  waroongas tongue does the rest  with gods holy spirit and the word interposed the missionary  true that is understood said orlando  that is not always understood returned waroonga  the plan does not seem to me a very good one said captain fitzgerald thoughtfully  i can have no doubt that it has succeeded in time past and may probably succeed again but you cannot expect that the natives even if disposed to be peaceful will accept your message at once  it may take weeks perhaps months before you get them to believe the gospel so as to permit of my men going ashore unarmed and in the meantime while you are engaged in this effort what am i to be doing  wait gods time answered waroonga simply  but time presses  the pirate vessel whereever it may be is escaping me said the captain unable to repress a smile  however i will at all events let you make the trial and await the result reminding you however that you will run considerable risk and that you must be prepared to accept the consequences of your rather reckless proceedings  i hope waroonga said orlando when the captain left them to give orders as to the course of the ship that you will let me share this risk with you  it will be wiser not  you are a strong man an sometimes fierce to behold  they will want to fight you then up go your blood an you will want to fight them  no indeed i wont said orlando earnestly  i will promise to go in the spirit of a missionary  you know how anxious i am to get news of my dear father  how could you expect me to remain idle on board this vessel when my soul is so troubled  you may depend on me waroonga  i will do exactly as you bid me and will place myself peaceably in the power of nativesleaving the result as you advise to god  the young mans tone was so earnest and withal so humble that waroonga could not help acceding to his request  well well said captain fitzgerald when he heard of it you seem both to be bent on making martyrs of yourselves but i will offer no opposition  all i can say is that i shall have my guns in readiness and if i see anything like foul play ill bombard the place and land an armed force to do what i can for you  soon the frigate came in sight of ongoloos village ran close in brought up in a sheltered bay and lowered a boat while the natives crowded the beach in vast numbers uttering fierce cries brandishing clubs and spears and making other warlike demonstrationsfor these poor people had been more than once visited by socalled merchant shipsthe crews of which had carried off some of them by force  we will not let a living man touch our shore said ongoloo to wapoota who chanced to be near his leader when he marshalled his men  oh yes we will chief replied the brown humorist  we will let some of them touch it and then we will take them up carefully and have them baked  a longpig supper will do us good  the rest of them we will drive back to their big canoe  by the term longpig wapoota referred to the resemblance that a naked white man when prepared for roasting bears to an ordinary pig  a grim smile lit up ongoloos swarthy visage as he replied  yes we will permit a few fat ones to land  the rest shall die for white men are thieves  they deceived us last time  they shall never deceive us again  as this remark might have been meant for a covert reference to his own thievish tendencies wapoota restrained his somewhat ghastly humour while the chief continued his arrangements for repelling the invaders  meanwhile these invaders were getting into the boat  what yous not goin widout me exclaimed ebony as one of the sailors thrust him aside from the gangway  i fear we are said orlando as he was about to descend the vessels side  it was as much as i could do to get waroonga to agree to let me go with him  but dis yar nigger kin die in a good cause as well as you massa said ebony in a tone of entreaty so earnest that the men standing near could not help laughing  now then make haste sang out the officer in charge of the boat  orlando descended and the negro turning away with a deeply injured expression walked majestically to the stern to watch the boat  waroonga had prepared himself for the enterprise by stripping off every article of clothing save a linen cloth round his loins and he carried nothing whatever with him except a small copy of gods word printed in the language of the islanders  this as the boat drew near to shore he fastened on his head among the bushy curls of his crisp black hair as in a nest  orlando had clothed himself in a pair of patched old canvas trousers and a much worn unattractive cotton shirt  stop now said the missionary when the boat was about five or six hundred yards from the beach  are you ready  ready said orlando  then come  he dropped quietly over the side and swam towards the shore  orlando following his example was alongside of him in a few seconds  both men were expert and rapid swimmers  the natives watched them in absolute silence and openmouthed surprise  a few minutes sufficed to carry the swimmers to the beach  have your rifles handy lads said the officer in charge of the boat to his men  stand by said the captain of the furious to the men at the guns  but these precautions were unnecessary for when the swimmers landed and walked up the beach they were seen by the manofwarsmen to shake hands with the chief of the savages and after what appeared to be a brief palaver to rub noses with him  then the entire host turned and led the visitors towards the village  with a heart almost bursting from the combined effects of disappointment humiliation and grief poor ebony stood at the stern of the manofwar his arms crossed upon his brawny chest and his great eyes swimming in irrepressible tears a monstrous bead of which would every now and then overflow its banks and roll down his sable cheek  suddenly the heartstricken negro clasped his hands together bowed his head and dropped into the sea  the captain who had seen him take the plunge leaped to the stern and saw him rise from the water blow like a grampus and strike out for land with the steady vigour of a gigantic frog  pick him up shouted the captain to the boat which was by that time returning to the ship  ay ay sir was the prompt reply  the boat was making straight for the negro and he for it  neither diverged from the straight course  two of you in the bow there get ready to haul him in said the officer  two sturdy sailors drew in their oars got up and leaned over the bow with outstretched arms  ebony looked at them bestowed on them a tremendous grin and went down with the oily ease of a northern seal  when next seen he was full a hundred yards astern of the boat still heading steadily for the shore  let him go shouted the captain  ay ay sir replied the obedient officer  and ebony went  meanwhile our missionary having told the wondering savages that he brought them good news was conducted with his companion to ongoloos hut  but it was plain that the good news referred to and even waroonga himself had not nearly so great an effect on them as the sight of orlando at whom they gazed with an expression half of fear and half of awe which surprised him exceedingly  your story is not new to us said ongoloo addressing the missionary but gazing at orlando it comes to us like an old song  how so exclaimed waroonga has any one been here before with the grand and sweet story of jesus and his love  the reply of the savage chief was strangely anticipated and checked at that moment by a burst of childish voices singing one of the beautiful hymns with which the inhabitants of ratinga had long been familiar  as the voices swelled in a chorus which distance softened into fairylike strains the missionary and his companion sat entranced and bewildered while the natives looked pleased and appeared to enjoy their perplexity  our little ones said ongoloo after a few minutes pause are amusing themselves with singing  they often do that  as he spoke the party were startled and surprised by the sudden appearance of ebony who quietly stalked into the circle and seated himself beside the missionary with the guilty yet defiant air of a man who knows that he has done wrong but is resolved at all hazards to have his way  considering the turn that affairs had taken neither orlando nor waroonga were sorry to see him  this is a friend said the latter in explanation laying his hand on the negros shoulder  but tell me chief we are impatient for to know where learned you that song  from one who is mad replied the chief still gazing earnestly at orlando  mad repeated the youth starting up and trembling with excitementhow know you that  whowhere is he  ask him waroonga  the explanation that followed left no doubt on orlandos mind that his father was bereft of reason and wandering in the neighbouring mountain  if there had been any doubt it would have been swept away by the chief who quietly said the madman is your father  how does he know that waroonga  i know because there is no difference between you except years and  he did not finish the sentence but touched his forehead solemnly with his finger  does he dwell alone in the mountains asked orlando  yes alone  he lets no one approach him answered ongoloo  now waroonga said orlando our prayers have been heard andat least partlyanswered  but we must proceed with caution  you must return on board and tell captain fitzgerald that i go to search for my father alone  wid the help ob dis yar nigger interposed ebony  tell him on no account to send men in search of me continued orlando paying no attention to the interruption and in the meantime you know how to explain my purpose to the natives  adieu  rising quickly he left the assembly and followed modestly but closely by the unconquerable negro set off with rapid strides towards the mountains    chapter eleven  when zeppa as related in a previous chapter staggered up the mountain side with richard rosco in his arms his great strength was all but exhausted and it was with the utmost difficulty that he succeeded at last before nightfall in laying his burden on the couch in his cave  then for the first time he seemed to have difficulty in deciding what to do  now at last the pirate was in his powerhe could do to him what he pleased  as he thought thus he turned a look of fierce indignation upon him  but even as he gazed the look faded and was replaced by one of pity for he could not help seeing that the wretched man was suffering intolerable anguish though no murmur escaped from his tightlycompressed lips  slay me in gods name kill me at once zeppa he gasped and put me out of torment  poor man poor rosco returned the madman in a gentle voice i thought to have punished thee but god wills it otherwise  he said no more but rose hastily and went into the bush  returning in a few moments with a bundle of herbs he gathered some sticks and kindled a fire  a large earthenware pot stood close to the side of the caves entrancea clumsy thing made by himself of some sort of clay this he filled with water put the herbs in and set it on the fire soon he had a poultice spread on a broad leaf which when it was cold he applied to one of the pirates dreadfully burnt feet  then he spread another poultice with which he treated the other foot  what the remedy was that zeppa made use of on this occasion is best known to himself we can throw no light on the subject  neither can we say whether the application was or was not in accordance with the practice of the faculty but certain it is that roscos sufferings were immediately assuaged and he soon fell into a tranquil sleep  not so the madman who sat watching by his couch  poor zeppas physical sufferings and exertion had proved too much for him the strain on his shattered nerves had been too severe and a burning fever was now raging within him so that the delirium consequent on disease began to mingle so to speak with his insanity  he felt that something unusual was going on within him  he tried to restrain himself and chain down his wandering surging thoughts but the more he sought to hold himself down the more did a demonwho seemed to have been especially appointed for the purposecast his mental fastenings adrift  at last he took it into his head that the slumbering pirate had bewitched him  as this idea gained ground and the internal fires increased the old ideas of revenge returned and he drew the knife which hung at his belt gazing furtively at the sleeper as he did so  but the better nature within the man maintained a fierce conflict with the worse  he murdered my sonmy darling orley murmured the madman as he felt the keen edge and point of his knife and crept towards the sleeper while a fitful flicker of the dying fire betrayed the awful light that seemed to blaze in his eyes  he carried me from my home  he left marie to die in hopeless grief  ha ha ha  oh god keep me backback from this  the noise awoke rosco who sat up and gazed at zeppa in horror for he saw at a glance that a fit of his madness must have seized him  zeppa he exclaimed raising himself with difficulty on both hands and gazing sternly in the madmans face  ha exclaimed the latter suddenly throwing his knife on the ground within roscos reach see i scorn to take advantage of your unarmed condition  take that and defend yourself  i will content myself with this  he caught up the heavy staff which he was in the habit of carrying with him in his mountain rambles  at the same instant rosco seized the knife and flung it far into the bush  see  i am still unarmed he said  true but you are not the less guilty rosco and you must die  it is my duty to kill you  he advanced with the staff upraised  stay  let us consider before you strike  are you not a selfappointed executioner  the question was well put  the madman lowered the staff to consider instantly the pirate made a plunge at and caught it  zeppa strove to wrench it from his grasp but the pirate felt that his life might depend on his retaining hold and in his extremity was endued with almost supernatural strength  in the fierce struggles that ensued the embers of the fire were scattered and the spot reduced to almost total darkness  during the unequal conflict the pirate who could only get upon his knees was swept and hurled from side to side but still he grasped the staff with vicelike power to his breast  even in that fearful moment the idea which had already occurred to him of humouring his antagonist gained force  he suddenly loosed his hold  zeppa staggered backward recovered himself sprang forward and aimed a fearful blow at his adversary who suddenly fell flat down  the staff passed harmlessly over him and was shattered to pieces on the side of the cave  ha ha laughed the pirate lightly as he sat up again you see zeppa that providence is against you  how else could i a helpless cripple have held my own against you  and see the very weapon you meant to use is broken to pieces  come now delay this execution for a little and let us talk together about this death which you think is due  there is much to be said about death you know and i should like to get to understand it better before i experience it  there is reason in that rosco said zeppa sitting down on the ground by the side of the pirate and leaning his back against the rock  you have much need to consider death for after death comes the judgment and none of us can escape that  true zeppa and i should not like to face that just now for i am not fit to die although as you truly say i deserve death  i have no hesitation in admitting that returned the pirate with some bitterness i deserve to die body and soul and after all i dont see why i should seek so earnestly to delay the righteous doom  right rosco right you talk sense now the doom is well deserved why then try to prevent me any longer from inflicting it when you know it is my duty to do so  because continued the pirate who felt that to maintain the conflict even with words was too much for his exhausted strength because i have heard that god is merciful  merciful echoed zeppa  of course he is  have you not heard that his mercy is so great that he has provided a way of escape for sinners through faith in his own dear son  it does not however seem to be a way of escape for me said the pirate letting himself sink back on his couch with a weary sigh  yes it is yes it is exclaimed zeppa eagerly as he got upon the familiar theme the offer is to the chief of sinners whosoever will turn ye turn ye for why will ye die  tell me about it said rosco faintly as the other paused  zeppa had delayed a moment in order to think for his disordered mind had been turned into a muchloved channel that of preaching the gospel to inquiring sinners  for many years he had been training himself in the knowledge of the scriptures and being possessed of a good memory he had got large portions of it by heart  gathering together the embers of the scattered fire he sat down again and gazing thoughtfully at the flickering flames began to point out the way of salvation to the pirate  sleepirresistible sleepgradually overcame the latter still the former went on repeating long passages of gods word  at last he put a question and not receiving an answer looked earnestly into the face of his enemy  ah poor man  he sleeps  god cannot wish me to slay him until i have made him understand the gospel  i will delaytill tomorrow  before the morrow came zeppa had wandered forth among the cliffs and gorges of his wild home with the everincreasing fires of fever raging in his veins  sometimes his madness took the form of wildest fury and grasping some bush or sapling that might chance to be near he would struggle with it as with a fiend until utter exhaustion caused him to fall prostrate on the ground where he would lie until partial rest and internal fire gave him strength again to rise  at other times he would run up and down the bills like a greyhound bounding from rock to rock and across chasms where one false step would have sent him headlong to destruction  frequently he ran down to the beach and plunged into the sea where he would swim about aimlessly until exhaustion sent him to the shore where he would fall down as at other times and restif such repose could be so styled  thus he continued fighting for his life for several days  during that time richard rosco lay in the cave almost starving  at first he had found several cocoanuts the hard shells of which had been broken by zeppa and appeased his hunger with these but when they were consumed he sought about the cave for food in vain  fortunately he found a large earthenware potevidently a homemade onenearly full of water so that he was spared the agony of thirst as well as hunger  when he had scraped the shells of the cocoanuts perfectly clean the pirate tried to crawl forth on hands and knees to search for food his feet being in such a state that it was not possible for him to stand much less to walk  but zeppa had long ago cleared away all the wild fruits that grew in the neighbourhood of his cave so that he found nothing save a few wild berries  still in his condition even these were of the utmost value they helped to keep him alive  another night passed and the day came  he crept forth once more but was so weakened by suffering and want that he could not extend his explorations so far as before and was compelled to return without having tasted a mouthful taking a long draught of water he lay down as he firmly believed to die  and as he lay there his life rose up before him as an avenging angel and the image of his dead mother returned with a reproachful yet an appealing look in her eyes  he tried to banish the one and to turn his thoughts from the other but failed and at last in an agony of remorse shouted the single word guilty  it seemed as if the cry had called zeppa from the world of spiritsto which rosco believed he had fledfor a few minutes afterwards the madman approached his mountainhome with the blood still boiling in his veins  apparently he had forgotten all about the pirate for he was startled on beholding him  what still there  i thought i had killed you  i wish you had zeppa  it would have been more merciful than leaving me to die of hunger here  are you prepared to die now  yes but for gods sake give me something to eat first  after that i care not what you do to me  miserable man death is sufficient for you  i have neither command nor desire to torture  you shall have food immediately  so saying zeppa reentered the bush  in less than halfanhour he returned with several cocoanuts and other fruits of which rosco partook with an avidity that told its own tale  now said zeppa rising when rosco had finished have you had enough  no said the pirate quickly not half enough  go like a good fellow and fetch me more  zeppa rose at once and went away  while he was gone the fear of being murdered again took possession of rosco  he felt that his last hour was approaching and in order to avoid his doom if possible crawled away among the bushes and tried to hide himself  he was terribly weak however and had not got fifty yards away when he fell down utterly exhausted  he heard zeppa return to the cave and listened with beating heart  hallo where are you cried the madman  then receiving no answer he burst into a long loud fit of laughter which seemed to freeze the very marrow in the pirates bones  ha ha he shouted again and again i knew you were a dream i felt sure of itha ha and now this proves it  and im glad you were a dream for i did not want to kill you rosco though i thought it my duty to do so  it was a dreamthank god it was all a dream  zeppa did not end again with wild laughter but betook himself to earnest importunate prayer during which rosco crept by slow degrees farther and farther away until he could no longer hear the sound of his enemys voice  now it was while this latter scene had been enacting that orlando and the faithful negro set out on their search into the mountain  at first they did not speak and ebony not feeling sure how his young master relished his company kept discreetly a pace or two in rear after they had crossed the plain however and begun to scale the steep sides of the hills his tendency towards conversation could not be restrained  does you tink massa orley that hims be you fadder  i think so ebony indeed i feel almost sure of it  thus encouraged the negro ranged up alongside  an does you tink hims mad  i hope not  i pray not but i fear that he  hims got leettle out ob sorts said the sympathetic ebony suggesting a milder state of things  as orlando did not appear to derive much consolation from the suggestion ebony held his tongue for a few minutes  presently his attention was attracted to a sound in the underwood near them  hist  massa orley  i hear someting  so do i ebony said the youth pausing for a moment to listen it must be some sort of bird for there can be no wild animals left by the natives in so small an island  as he spoke something like a low moan was heard  the negros mouth opened and the whites of his great eyes seemed to dilate  if it am a bird massa hims got a mos awful voice  mus have cotched a drefful cold  the groan was repeated as he spoke and immediately after they observed a large sluggishlooking animal advancing through the underwood  what a pity wes not got a gun whispered ebony  if wes only had a spear or a pitchfork its besser than nuffin  lucky that you have nothing of the sort else youd commit murder said orlando advancing  dont you seeit is a man  the supposed animal started as the youth spoke and rose on his knees with a terribly haggard and anxious look  richard rosco exclaimed orley who recognised the pirate at the first glance  but rosco did not reply  he too had recognised orley despite the change in his size and appearance and believed him to be a visitant from the other world an idea which was fostered by the further supposition that ebony was the devil keeping him company  orlando soon relieved him however  the aspect of the pirate so haggard and worn out as he crawled on his hands and knees was so dreadful that a flood of pity rushed into his bosom  my poor fellow he said going forward and laying his hand gently on his shoulder this is indeed a most unexpected most amazing sight how came you here  then you were not drowned gasped the pirate instead of answering the question  no thank god  i was not drowned said orley with a sad smile  but again i ask how came you here  never mind me said rosco hurriedly but go to your father  my father  do you know then where he is cried orlando with sudden excitement  yes  he is up therenot far off  i have just escaped from him  he is bent on taking my life  he saved me from the savages  he is mad with feverand stands terribly in need of help  bewildered beyond expression by these contradictory statements orlando made no attempt to understand but exclaimed  can you guide us to him  you see returned the pirate sadly i cannot even rise to my feet the savages were burning me alive when your father came to my rescue the flesh is dropping from the bones  i cannot help you  kin you git on my back asked ebony  yous a good lift but is awful strong  i will try returned rosco but you will have to protect me from zeppa if he sees me for he is bent on taking my life  he thinks that you were drownedas indeed so did ithe time that you were thrown overboard without my knowledgemind that without my knowledgeand your father in his madness thinks he is commissioned by god to avenge your death  perhaps when he sees you alive he may change his mind but there is no depending on one who is delirious with fever  he will probably still be in the cave when we reach it  we will protect you  get up quickly and show us the way to the cave  in a moment the stout negro had the pirate on his broad shoulders and under his guidance mounted the slightlymarked path that led to zeppas retreat  no words were spoken by the way  orlando was too full of anxious anticipation to speak  the negro was too heavily weighted to care about conversation just then and rosco suffered so severely from the rough motions of his black steed that he was fain to purse his lips tightly to prevent a cry of pain  on reaching the neighbourhood of the cave the pirate whispered to ebony to set him down  you will come in sight of the place the moment you turn round yonder cliff  it is better that i should remain here till the meeting is over i hear no sound but doubtless zeppa is lying down by this time  the negro set his burden on the ground and rosco crept slowly into the bush to hide while the others hurried forward in the direction pointed out to them    chapter twelve  no sooner had orlando and the negro passed round the cliff to which rosco had directed them than they beheld a sight which was well calculated to fill them with anxiety and alarm for there stood zeppa panting and wrestling with one of the fiends that were in the habit of assailing him  the fiend on this occasion was familiar enough to himthe stout branch of a tree which overhung his cave but which his delirious brain had transformed into a living foe  no shout or cry issued from the poor mans compressed lips  he engaged in the deadly struggle with that silent resolve of purpose which was natural to him  the disease under which he laboured had probably reached its climax for he swayed to and fro in his futile efforts to wrench off the limb with a degree of energy that seemed more than human  his partially naked limbs showed the knotted muscles standing out rigidly his teeth were clenched and exposed his bloodshot eyes glared the long curling and matted hair of his head and beard was flying about in wild disorder and his labouring chest heaved as he fiercely silently and hopelessly struggled  oh it was a terrible picture to be presented thus suddenly to the gaze of a loving son  stay where you are ebony  i must meet him alone whispered orlando  then hastening forward with outstretched arms he exclaimed  father  instantly zeppa let go his supposed enemy and turned round  the change in his aspect was as wonderful as it was sudden  the old loving gentle expression overspread his features and the wild fire seemed to die out of his eyes as he held out both hands  ah once more my son he said in the tenderest of tones  come to me  this is kind of you orley to return so soon again i had not expected you for a long time  sit down beside me and lay your head upon my kneesoi like to have you that way for i see you better  oh fatherdear father said orlando but the words were choked in his throat and tears welled from his eyes  yes orley said zeppa with a startled look of joyful surprise while he turned his head a little to one side as if listening in expectancy speak again dear boy speak again  i have often seen you since you went to the spiritland but have never heard you speak till today speak once more dear boy  but orley could not speak  he could only hide his face in his fathers bosom and sob aloud  nay dont cry lad you never did that before  what do you mean that is unmanly  not like what my courageous boy was wont to be  and you have grown so much since last i saw you  why youve even got a beard  who ever heard of a bearded man sobbing like a child  and now i look at you closely i see that you have grown wonderfully tall  it is very strangebut all things seem strange since i came here  only in all the many visits you have paid me i have never seen you changed till today  you have always come to me in the old boyish form  very very strange  but orley my boy and here zeppas voice became intensely earnest and pleading you wont leave me again will you surely they can well spare you from the spiritworld for a timejust a little while  it would fill my heart with such joy and gratitude  and im your father orley surely i have a right to youmore right than the angels havehavent i and then it would give such joy if you came back to your dear mother whom i have not seen for so longso very long  i will never leave you father never cried orlando throwing his arms round zeppas neck and embracing him passionately  nay then you are going to leave me cried zeppa with sudden alarm as he clasped orlando to him with an iron grip  you always embrace me when you are about to vanish out of my sight  but you shall not escape me this time  i have got you tighter than i ever had you before and no fiend shall separate us now  no fiend he repeated in a shout glaring at a spot in the bushes where ebony unable to restrain his feelings had unwittingly come into sight  suddenly changing his purpose zeppa let go his son and sprang like a tiger on the supposed fiend  ebony went down before him like a bulrush before the hurricane but unlike it he did not rise again  the madman had pinned him to the earth and was compressing his throat with both hands  it required all the united strength of his son and the negro to loosen his grasp and even that would not have sufficed had not the terrible flame which had burned so long died out  it seemed to have been suddenly extinguished by this last burst of fury for zeppa fell back as helpless as an infant in their hands  indeed he lay so still with his eyes closed that orlando trembled with fear lest he should be dying  now ebony said he taking the negro apart when they had made the exhausted man as comfortable as possible on his rude couch in the cave you run down to the ship and fetch the doctor here without delay  i will be able to manage him easily when alone  run as you never ran before  dont let any soul come here except the doctor and yourself tell the captain i have found himthrough gods mercybut that he is very ill and must be carefully kept from excitement and that in the meantime nobody is to disturb us  the doctor will of course fetch physic and tell him to bring his surgical instruments also for if i mistake not poor rosco needs his attention  do you bring up as much in the way of provisions as you can carry and one or two blankets  and harkee make no mention of the pirate to any one  away  during the delivery of this message the negro listened eagerly and stood quite motionless like a black statue with the exception of his glittering eyes  yes massa he said at its conclusion and almost literally vanished from the scene  orlando then turned to his father  the worn out man still lay perfectly quiet with closed eyes and countenance so pale that the dread of approaching death again seized on the son  the breathing was however slow and regular and what appeared to be a slight degree of moisture lay on the brow  the fact that the sick man slept soon became apparent and when orlando had assured himself of this he arose left the cave with careful tread and glided rather than walked back to the place where the pirate had been left  there he still lay apparently much exhausted  we have found him thank god said orlando seating himself on a bank and i would fain hope that the worst is over for he sleeps  but poor fellow you seem to be in a bad case  can i do aught to relieve you  nothing replied rosco with a weary sigh  i have sent for a surgeon  a surgeon repeated the pirate with a startled look then there must be a manofwar off the coast for south sea traders are not used to carry surgeons  ah  i forgot  you naturally dont wish to see any one connected with a manofwar  yes there is one here  i came in her  but you can see this surgeon without his knowing who or what you are  it will be sufficient for him to know that you are an unfortunate sailor who had fallen into the hands of the savages  yes exclaimed rosco grasping eagerly at the idea and thats just what i am  moreover i ran away from my ship  butbutdo you not feel it your duty to give me up  what i shall feel it my duty to do ultimately is not a matter for present consideration  just now you require surgical assistance  but how did you come here and what do you mean by saying that you ran away from your ship  rosco in reply gave a brief but connected narrative of his career during the past three years in which he made no attempt to exculpate himself but on the contrary confessed his guilt and admitted his desert of death  yet i shrink from death he said in conclusion  is it not strange that i who have faced death so often with perfect indifference should draw back from it now with something like fear  a great writer replied orlando whom my father used to read to me at home says that conscience makes cowards of us all  and a still greater authority says that the wicked flee when no man pursueth  you are safe here roscoat all events for the present  but you must not go near the cave again  rest where you are and i will search for some place where you may remain concealed till you are well  i shall return quickly  leaving the pirate where he lay orlando returned to his father and finding that he still slept went off to search for a cave  he soon found a small one in the cliffs suitable for his purpose thither he carried the pirate laid him tenderly on a couch of branches and leaves put food and water within his reach and left him with a feeling of comfort and of contentment at heart that he had not experienced for many years  that night the surgeon of the furious ascended to the mountain cave his approach was made known to orlando as he watched at the sick mans side by the appearance of ebonys great eyes glittering at him over the bushes that encircled the caves mouth  no wonder that poor zeppa had mistaken him for a demon  holding up a finger of caution orlando glided towards him seized his arm and after leading him to a safe distance asked in a low voice  well have you brought the doctor  ho yis massa an i bring tomeo and buttchee too  didnt i tell you to let no one else come near us said orlando in a tone of vexation  dats true massa but i no kin stop dem  so soon as dey hear dat antonio zeppa am found sick in de mountains dey swore dey mus go see him  i say dat you say no  dey say dey not care  i say me knock em bofe down  dey say dey turn me hinside hout if i dont ole my tongue what could dis yar nigger do  deys too much for me  so dey follered and here dey am wid de doctor waiting about two hunrd yards down dere for leave to come  but i say massa deys good sort o fellers after alldo whatever you tells em  good for go messages praps an save dis yar niggers poor legs  ebony made the latter suggestion with a grin so broad that in the darkness his face became almost luminous with teeth and gums  well i suppose we must make the most of the circumstances said orlando  come lead me to them  it was found that though the strong affection of the two chiefs for zeppa had made them rebellious in the matter of visiting the spot the same affection and their regard for orlando rendered them submissive as lambs and willing to do absolutely whatever they were told  orlando therefore had no difficulty in prevailing on them to delay their visit to his father till the following day  meanwhile he caused them to encamp in a narrow pass close at hand and the better to reconcile them to their lot imposed upon them the duty of mounting guard each alternate couple of hours during the night  he will do well said the doctor after examining the patient  this sleep is life to him  i will give him something when he awakes but the awaking must be left to nature  whether he recovers his reason after what he has passed through remains to be seen  you say he has been wandering for some time here in a state of insanity  how came that about  it is a long and sad story doctor said orlando evading the question and i have not time to tell it now for i want you to visit another patient  another patient repeated the surgeon in surprise ah one of the natives i suppose  no a white man  he is a sailor who ran away from his ship and was caught by the natives and tortured  come then let us go and see the poor fellow at once  does he live far from here  close at hand answered orlando as he led the way and perhaps doctor it would be well not to question the poor man at present as to his being here and in such a plight  he seems very weak and ill  when the surgeon had examined roscos feet he led orlando aside  it is a bad case he said both legs must be amputated below the knee if the mans life is to be saved  must it be done now  immediately  can you assist me  i have assisted at amateur operations before now said orlando and at all events you can count on the firmness of my nerves and on blind obedience  but stayi must speak to him first alone  rosco said the youth as he knelt by the pirates couch your sins have been severely punished and your endurance sorely tried  not more than i deserve orlando  but i grieve to tell you that your courage must be still further tried the doctor says that both feet must be amputated  a frown gathered on the pirates face and he compressed his lips for a few moments  and the alternative he asked  is death  again there was a brief pause  then he said slowly almost bitterly  oh death you have hovered over my head pretty steadily of late  it is a question whether i had not better let you come on and end these weary struggles rather than become a hopeless cripple in the prime of life  why should i fear death now more than before  have you any hope of eternal life rosco  how can i tell  what do i know about eternal life  then you are not prepared to die and let me earnestly assure you that there is something well worth living for though at present you do notyou cannot know it  enough  let it be as the doctor advises said the pirate in a tone of resignation  that night the operation was successfully performed and the unfortunate man was afterwards carefully tended by ebony  next day tomeo and buttchee were told that their old friend zeppa could not yet be seen but that he required many little comforts from the furious which must be brought up with as little delay as possible that was sufficient  forgetting themselves in their anxiety to aid their friend these affectionate warriors went off on their mission and were soon out of sight  when zeppa awoke at last with a deep sigh it was still dark  this was fortunate for he could not see whose hand administered the physic and was too listless and weak to inquire  it was bright day when he awoke the second time and looked up inquiringly in his sons face  what are you still there orley he said faintly while the habitual sweet expression stole over his pale features though it was quickly followed by the perplexed look  but how comes this change  you look so much older than you are dear boy  would god that i could cease this dreaming  you are not dreaming now father  i am indeed orley  you have been ill and delirious but thanks be to god are getting well again  what exclaimed the invalid has it been all a dream then  were you not thrown into the sea by mutineers and have i not been wandering for months or years on a desert island  but then if these things be all dreams he added opening his eyes wide and fixing them intently on orlandos face how comes it that i still dream the change in you you are orley yet not orley  how is that  yes all that is true dear dear father said the youth gently clasping one of the helpless hands that lay crossed on zeppas broad chest i was thrown overboard by the mutineers years ago but thank god i was not drowned and you have been wandering here ininvery ill for years but thank god again you are better and i have been mercifully sent to deliver you  i cant believe it orley for i have so often seen you and you have so often given me the slipyet there does seem something very real about you just nowvery real though so changedyet it is the same voice and you never spoke to me before in my dreamsexcept once yes i think it was once that you spoke  i remember it well for the sound sent such a thrill to my heart  oh  god forbid that it should again fade away as it has done so often  it will not fade father  the time you speak of was only yesterday when i found you  you have been sleeping since and a doctor is attending you  a doctor where did he come from  at that moment ebony approached with some food in a tin pan  the invalid observed him at once  ebony can that be you  whywhenoh my poor brain feels so light it seems as if a puff of wind would blow it away  i must have been very ill  zeppa spoke feebly and closed his eyes from which one or two tears issuedblessed tearsthe first he had shed for many a day  his reason is restored whispered the doctor in orlandos ear but he must be left to rest  orlandos heart was too full to find relief through the lips  i cannot understand it at all resumed zeppa reopening his eyes least of all can i understand you orley but my hope is in god  i would sleep now but you must not let go my hand  orlando held it tighter one word more  your dear mother  is welland longs to see you  a profound longdrawn sigh followed as if an insupportable burden had been removed from the wearied soul and zeppa sank into a sleep so peaceful that it seemed as if the spirit had forsaken the worn out frame  but a steady gentle heaving of the chest told that life was still there  during the hours that followed orlando sat quite motionless like a statue firmly grasping his fathers hand    chapter thirteen  a few days after the discovery of zeppa by his son a trading vessel chanced to touch at the island the captain of which no sooner saw the british manofwar than he lowered his gig went aboard in a state of great excitement and told how that just two days before he had been chased by a pirate in latitude soandso and longitude something else  a messenger was immediately sent in hot haste to sugarloaf mountain to summon orlando  im sorry to be obliged to leave you in such a hurry said captain fitzgerald as they were about to part but duty calls and i must obey  i promise you however either to return here or to send your missionvessel for you if it be available  rest assured that you shall not be altogether forsaken  having uttered these words of consolation the captain spread his sails and departed leaving orlando and his father waroonga tomeo buttchee ebony and rosco on sugarloaf island  several days after this waroonga entered the hut of ongoloo and sat down  the chief was amusing himself at the time by watching his prime minister wapoota playing with little lippy who had become a favourite at the palace since zeppa had begun to take notice of her  i would palaver with the chief said the missionary  let lippy be gone said the chief  wapoota rolled the brown child unceremoniously out of the hut and composed his humorous features into an expression of solemnity  my brother continued the missionary has agreed to become a christian and burn his idols  yes replied ongoloo with an emphatic nod for he was a man of decision  i like to hear what you tell me  i feel that i am full of naughtiness  i felt that before you came here  i have done things that i knew to be wrong because i have been miserable after doing themyet when in passion i have done them again  i have wondered why i was miserable  now i know you tell me the great father was whispering to my spirit  it must be true  i have resisted him and he made me miserable  i deserve it  i deserve to die  when any of my men dare to resist me i kill them  i have dared to resist the great father yet he has not killed me  why not you tell me he is full of love and mercy even to his rebels  i believe it  you say he sent his son jesus to die for me and to deliver me from my sins  it is well i accept this saviourand all my people shall accept him  my brothers voice makes me glad returned waroonga but while you can accept this saviour for yourself it is not possible to force other people to do so  not possible cried the despotic chief with vehemence  do you not know that i can force my people to do whatever i pleaseat least i can kill them if they refuse  you cannot do that and at the same time be a christian  but resumed ongoloo with a look of so to speak fierce perplexity i can at all events make them burn their idols  true but that would only make them hate you in their hearts and perhaps worship their idols more earnestly in secret  no my brother there is but one weapon given to christians but that is a sharp and powerful weapon  it is called love we must win others to christ by voice and example we may not drive them  it is not permitted  it is not possible  the chief cast his frowning eyes on the ground and so remained for some time while the missionary silently prayed  it was a critical moment the man so long accustomed to despotic power could not easily bring his mind to understand the process of winning men  he did indeed know how to win the love of his wives and childrenfor he was naturally of an affectionate disposition but as to winning the obedience of warriors or slavesthe thing was preposterous  yet he had sagacity enough to perceive that while he could compel the obedience of the bodyor kill ithe could not compel the obedience of the soul  how can i he said at last with a touch of indignation still in his tone i a chief and a descendant of chiefs stoop to ask to beg my slaves to become christians  it may not be i can only command them  woh exclaimed wapoota unable to restrain his approval of the sentiment  you cannot even command yourself ongoloo to be a christian  how then can you command others  it is the great father who has put it into your heart to wish to be a christian  if you will now take his plan you will succeed  if you refuse and try your own plan you shall fail  stay cried the chief suddenly laying such a powerful grasp on waroongas shoulder that he winced did you not say that part of his plan is the forgiveness of enemies  i did  must i then forgive the raturans if i become a christian  even so  then it is impossible  what forgive the men whose forefathers have tried to rob my forefathers of their mountain since our nation first sprang into being  forgive the men who have for ages fought with our fathers and tried to make slaves of our women and childrenthough they always failed because they are cowardly dogs  forgive the raturans never  impossible  with man this is impossible  with the great father all things are possible  leave your heart in his hands ongoloo dont refuse his offer to save you from an unforgiving spirit as well as from other sins and that which to you seems impossible will soon become easy  nonever reiterated the chief with decision as he cut further conversation short by rising and stalking out of the hut closely followed by the sympathetic wapoota  waroonga was not much depressed by this failure  he knew that truth would prevail in time and did not expect that the natural enmity of man would be overcome at the very first sound of the gospel  he was therefore agreeably surprised when on the afternoon of that same day ongoloo entered the hut which had been set apart for him and the two ratinga chiefs and said  come brother i have called a council of my warriors  come you shall see the working of the great father  the missionary rose at once and went after the chief with much curiosity accompanied by tomeo and buttchee zeppa and his son with ebony and the pirate being still in the mountains  ongoloo led them to the top of a small hill on which a sacred hut or temple stood  here the prisoners of war used to be slaughtered and here the orgies of heathen worship were wont to be practised  an immense crowd of nativesindeed the entire tribe except the sick and infirmcrowned the hill  this however was no new sight to the missionary and conveyed no hint of what was pending  the crowd stood in two orderly circlesthe inner one consisting of the warriors the outer of the women and children  both fell back to let the chief and his party pass  as the templehut was open at one side its interior with the horrible instruments of execution and torture as well as skulls bones and other ghastly evidences of former murder was exposed to view  on the centre of the floor lay a little pile of rudely carved pieces of timber with some loose cocoanut fibre beneath them  a small fire burned on something that resembled an altar in front of the hut  the chief standing close to this fire cleared his throat and began an address with the words men warriors women and children listen and they did listen with such rapt attention that it seemed as if not only ears but eyes mouths limbs and muscles were engaged in the listening act for this mode of addresscondescending as it did to women and childrenwas quite new to them and portended something unusual  since these men came here continued the chief pointing to waroonga and his friends we have heard many wonderful things that have made us think  before they came we heard some of the same wonderful things from the great white man whose head is light but whose heart is wise and good  i have made up my mind now to become a christian  my warriors my women my children need not be told what that is  they have all got ears and have heard  i have assembled you here to see my gods burned he pointed to the pile in the temple and i ask all who are willing to join me in making this fire a big one  i cannot compel your souls i could compel your bodies but i will not  he looked round very fiercely as he said this as though he still had half a mind to kill one or two men to prove his point and those who stood nearest to him moved uneasily as though they more than half expected him to do some mischief but the fierce look quickly passed away and he went on in gentle measured tones  waroonga tells me that the book of the great father says those who become christians must love each other therefore we must no more hate or quarrel or fight or killnot even our enemies  there was evident surprise on every face and a good deal of decided shaking of heads as if such demands were outrageous  moreover it is expected of christians that they shall not revenge themselves but suffer wrong patiently  the eyebrows rose higher at this  still more it is demanded that we shall forgive our enemies  if we become christians we must open our arms wide and take the raturans to our hearts  this was a climax as ongoloo evidently intended for he paused a long time while loud expressions of dissent and defiance were heard on all sides though it was not easy to see who uttered them  now warriors women and children here i ama christianwho will join me  i will exclaimed wapoota stepping forward with several idols in his arms which he tossed contemptuously into the temple  there was a general smile of incredulity among the warriors for wapoota was well known to be a timeserver nevertheless they were mistaken for the jester was in earnest this time  immediately after that an old whiteheaded warrior bent nearly double with infirmity and years came forward and acted as wapoota had done then turning to the people he addressed them in a weak trembling voice  there was a great silence for this was the patriarch of the tribe had been a lionlike man in his youth and was greatly respected  i join the christians he said slowly  have i not lived and fought for longvery long  yes yes from many voices  and what good has come of it demanded the patriarch  have not the men of the mountain fought with the men of the swamp since the mountain and the swamp came from the hand of the great father  a pause and again yes yes from many voices and what good has come of it here is the mountain yonder is the swamp as they were from the beginning and what the better are we that the swamp has been flooded and the mountain drenched with the blood of our fathers  hatred has been tried from the beginning of time and has failed  let us now my children try love as the great father counsels us to do  a murmur of decided applause followed the old mans speech and ongoloo seizing him by both shoulders gazed earnestly into his withered face had they been frenchmen these two would no doubt have kissed each others cheeks if englishmen they might have shaken hands warmly being polynesian savages they rubbed noses  under the influence of this affectionate act a number of the warriors ran off fetched their gods and threw them on the temple floor  then ongoloo seizing a brand from the fire thrust it into the loose cocoanut fibre and set the pile in a blaze  quickly the flames leaped into the temple thatch and set the whole structure on fire  as the fire roared and leaped waroonga with tomeo and buttchee started a hymn  it chanced to be one which zeppa had already taught the people who at once took it up and sent forth such a shout of praise as had never before echoed among the palmgroves of that island  it confirmed the waverers and thus under the influence of sympathy the whole tribe came that day to be of one mind  the sweet strains rolling over the plains and uplands reached the cliffs at last and struck faintly on the ears of a small group assembled in a mountain cave  the group consisted of zeppa and his son ebony and the pirate  it sounds marvellously like a hymn said orlando listening  ah dear boy it is one i taught the natives when i stayed with them said zeppa but it never reached so far as this before  poor zeppa was in his right mind again but oh how weak and wan and thin the raging fever had left him  rosco who was also reduced to a mere shadow of his former self listened to the faint sound with a troubled expression for it carried him back to the days of innocence when he sang it at his mothers knee  dats oncommon strange said ebony  nebber heard de sound come so far before  hope de scoundrils no got hold ob grog  shame on you ebony to suspect such a thing said orlando  you would be better employed getting things ready for tomorrows journey than casting imputations on our hospitable friends  dars noting to git ready massa returned the negro  eberytings prepared to start arter breakfust  thats well and i am sure the change to the seashore will do you good father as well as rosco  youve both been too long here  the cave is not as dry as one could wishand then youll be cheered by the sound of children playing round you  yes it will be pleasant to have lippy running out and in again said zeppa  they did not converse much for the strength of both zeppa and rosco had been so reduced that they could not even sit up long without exhaustion but orlando kept up their spirits by prattling away on every subject that came into his mindand especially of the island of ratinga  while they were thus engaged they heard the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps and next moment tomeo and buttchee bounded over the bushes glaring and panting from the rate at which they had raced up the hill to tell the wonderful news  eberyting bunt exclaimed ebony whose eyes and teeth showed so much white that his face seemed absolutely to sparkle  everything  idols and temple repeated the two chiefs in the ratinga tongue and in the same breath  an nebber gwine to fight no more asked ebony with a grin that might be more correctly described as a split from ear to ear  never more replied the chiefs  next morning the two invalids were tenderly conveyed on litters down the mountain side and over the plain and before the afternoon had passed away they found a pleasant temporary restingplace in the now christian village    chapter fourteen  the slopes and knolls and palmfringed cliffs of ratinga were tipped with gold by the western sun one evening as he declined towards his bed in the pacific when marie zeppa wandered with betsy waroonga and her brown little daughter zariffa towards the strip of bright sand in front of the village  the two matrons besides being filled with somewhat similar anxieties as to absent ones were naturally sympathetic and frequently sought each others company  the lively anglofrench woman whose vivacity was not altogether subdued even by the dark cloud that hung over her husbands fate took special pleasure in the sedate earnest temperament of her native missionary friend whose difficulty in understanding a joke coupled with her inability to control her laughter when after painful explanation she did manage to comprehend one was a source of much interestan undercurrent as it were of quiet amusement  betsy said marie as they walked slowly along their naked feet just laved by the rippling sea why do you persist in wearing that absurd bonnet  if you would only let me cut four inches off the crown and six off the front it would be much more becoming  do let me theres a dear  you know i was accustomed to cutting and shaping when in england  but what for the use asked betsy turning her large brown eyes solemnly on her companion  it no seems too big to me  besides when brudder gubbins give him to me he  who is brudder gubbins asked marie with a look of smiling surprise  oh you know  the minstergubbinswhat come to the missionstation just afore me an waroonga left for ratinga  oh  i see the reverend mr gubbinswell what did he say about the bonnet  wat did he say ah he say much morn i kin remember an he

mean betsy  well praps it was that  anyhow i put it on an he looked at me so earnest an ses with a sigh betsy ses he it minds me o my grandmother an she was a good old soulbrought me up betsy she did  wear it for her sake an mine  i make a present of it to you  ah  betsy said marie the reverend gubbins must be a wag i suspect  wats a wag marie  dont you know what a wag is  oh yis i know  when leetil bird sit on a stone an shake hims tail ive heerd you an orley say it wagbut misser gubbins he got no tail to wagso how can he wag it  i didnt say he wagged it betsy returned marie repressing a laugh butyoull never get to understand what a wag means so i wont try to explain  look  zariffa is venturesome  youd better call her back  zariffa was indeed venturesome  clad in a white flannel petticoat and a miniature coalscuttle she was at that moment wading so deep into the clear sea that she had to raise the little garment as high as her brown bosom to keep it out of the water and with all her efforts she was unsuccessful for with that natural tendency of childhood to forget and neglect what cannot be seen she had allowed the rearpart of the petticoat to drop into the sea  this however occasioned little or no anxiety to betsy waroonga for she was not an anxious mother but when raising her eyes a little higher she beheld the tip of the backfin of a shark describing lively circles in the water as if it had scented the tender morsel and were searching for it her easy indifference vanished  she gave vent to a yell and made a bound that told eloquently of the savage beneath the missionary and in another instant was up to the knees in the water with the coalscuttle quivering violently  seizing zariffa she squeezed her almost to the bursting point against her palpitating breast while the shark headed seaward in bitter disappointment  dont go so deep agin ziffa said the mother with a gasp as she set her little one down on the sand  no musser said the obedient child and she kept on the landward side of her parent thereafter with demonstrative care  it may be remarked here that owing to waroongas love for and admiration of white men zariffas native tongue was englishbroken of course to the pattern of her parents  it was a narrow escape betsy said marie solemnised by the incident  yes thank the lord replied the other continuing to gaze out to sea long after the cause of her alarm had disappeared  oh  marie she added with a sigh when will the dear men come home  the question drove all the playful humour out of poor marie and her eyes filled with sudden tears  when indeed  oh  betsy my man will never come  for orley and the others i have little fear but my antonio  poor marie could say no more  her nature was as quickly though not as easily provoked to deep sorrow as to gaiety  she covered her face with her hands  as she did so the eyes of betsy which had for some time been fixed on the horizon opened to their widest and her countenance assumed a look so deeply solemn that it might have lent a touch of dignity even to the coalscuttle bonnet if it had not bordered just a little too closely on the ridiculous  ho  marie she exclaimed in a whisper so deep that her friend looked up with a startled air see looka sip  a shipwhere said the other turning her eager gaze on the horizon but she was not so quicksighted as her companion and when at length she succeeded in fixing the object with her eyes she pronounced it a gull  no snot a gulla sip retorted betsy  ask zariffa  her eyes are better than ours suggested marie  kumeer ziffa shouted betsy  zariffa came and at the first glance exclaimed  a sip  the news spread in a moment for other and sharper eyes in the village had already observed the sail and ere long the beach was crowded with natives  by that time most of the ratingans had adopted more or less chiefly less of european costume so that the aspect of the crowd was anything but savage  it is true there were large proportions of brown humanity presented to viewsuch as arms legs necks and chests but these were picturesquely interspersed with striped cotton drawers duck trousers gay guernseys red and blue flannel petticoats numerous caps and straw hats as well as a few coalscuttlesthough none of the latter could match that of betsy waroonga for size and tremulosity  but there were other signs of civilisation there besides costume for in addition to the neat huts and gardens and whitewashed church there was a sound issuing from the pointed spire which was anything but suggestive of the south sea savage  it was the church bella small one to be sure but sweetly tonedwhich was being rung violently to call in all the fighting men from the woods and fields around for at that time the ratingans had to be prepared for the reception of foes as well as friends  a trusty chief had been placed in charge of the village by tomeo before he left  this man now disposed his warriors in commanding positions as they came trooping in obedient to the call and bade them keep out of sight and watch his signals from the beach  but now let us see what vessel it was that caused such commotion in ratinga  she was a brig with nothing particularly striking in her rig or appointmentsa mere trading vessel  but on her bulwarks at the bow and on the heel of the bowsprit was gathered a group that well deserves notice for there foremost of all and towering above the others stood antonio zeppa holding on to a forestay and gazing with intensity and fixedness at the speck of land which had just been sighted  beside him and not less absorbed stood his valiant and amiable son while around in various attitudes sat or stood the chiefs tomeo and buttchee rosco and ebony ongoloo and wapoota and little lippy with her mother  but the native missionary was not there  he had positively refused to quit the desert which had so unexpectedly and suddenly begun to blossom as the rose and had remained to water the ground until his friends should send for him  the chief and prime minister of the mountainmen were there because being largeminded they wished to travel and see the world and lippy was there because zeppa liked her while the mother was there because she liked lippy and refused to be parted from her  great was the change which had come over zeppa during his convalescence the wild locks and beard had been cut and trimmed the ragged garments had been replaced by a suit belonging to orley and the air of wild despair alternating with vacant simplicity which characterised him in his days of madness had given place to the old sedate sweet look of gentle gravity  it is true the grey hairs had increased in number and there was a look or rather an effect of suffering in the fine face which nothing could remove but much of the muscular vigour and the erect gait had been regained during those months when he had been so carefully and untiringly nursed by his son on sugarloaf island  it was not so with the expirate  poor rosco was a broken man  the shock to his frame from the partial burning and the subsequent amputation of his feet had been so great that a return to anything like vigour seemed out of the question  but there was that in the expression of his faded face and in the light of his sunken eye which carried home the conviction that the ruin of his body had been the saving of his soul  i cannot tell you orley how thankful i am said zeppa that this trader happened to touch at the island  as i grew stronger my anxiety to return home became more and more intense and to say truth i had begun to fear that captain fitzgerald had forgotten us altogether  no fear of that father  the captain is sure to keep his promise  he will either return as he said or send some vessel to look after us what are you gazing at ebony  de steepil massa  look cried the negro his whole face quivering with excitement and the whites of his eyes unusually obtrusive as he pointed to the evergrowing line of land on the horizon you see him glippering like fire  i do see something glittering said orlando shading his eyes with his hand yes it must be the steeple of the church father  look it was not there when you left us  well soon see the houses now  thank god murmured zeppa in a deep tremulous voice  can you see it rosco said orley  the pirate turned his eyes languidly in the direction pointed out  i see the land he said faintly and i join your father in thanking god for thatbutbut it is not home to me  come friend said zeppa laying his hand gently on the poor mans shoulder say not so  it shall be home to you yet please god  if he has blotted out the past in the cleansing blood of the lamb what is man that he should remember it  cheer up rosco you shall find a home and a welcome in ratinga  always returning good for evil zeppa said rosco in a more cheerful voice  i think it is this tremendous weakness that crushes my spirits but comeill try to cheer up as you advise  dats right massa cried ebony in an encouraging tone an jus look at the glipperin steepil  hell do yous heart goodsometing like de fire in de wilderness to de jipshins  to the israelites you mean said orley  ah yisde izlrights to be sure  i misremembered  ho look dars de housetops now an the pine grove whar we was use to hold palaver bout you massa arter you was lost anyisdats de houseyous own house  you see de wife lookin out o winder bery soon  i knows it by de pigsty close longside whar de big grumper sow libs dat ziffas so fond o playin wid  ho  lippy come

forsake de ole sow  ho but i forgityou no understan english  hereupon ebony began to translate his information as he best could into the language of the little creature in which effort he was not very successful being an indifferent linguist  meanwhile the vessel gradually neared the island stood into the lagoon and finally dropped anchor  a boat was at once lowered and made for the shore  and oh how intensely and intently did those in the boat and those on the shore gaze at each other as the space between them diminished  they not look like enemies said betsy in subdued tones  and i dont think they are armed returned marie with palpitating heart but i cannot yet make out the facesonly they seem to be white some of them  yis an some of ems brown  thuson the shore  in the boat  now den massa you sees heran ha ha dars betsy  id know her mong a tousind  you sees de bonnittumblin about like a jollyboat in a high sea an ziffa too wid de leetil bonnit all de same shape kin you no see her  zeppa protested rather anxiously that he could not see them and no wonder for just then his eyes were blinded by tears which no amount of wiping sufficed to clear away  at that moment a shriek was heard on shore and betsy was seen to spring we are afraid to say how many feet into the air  dar shes reconised us now exclaimed ebony with delight and it was evident that he was right for betsy continued to caper upon the sands in a manner that could only be the result of joy or insanity while the coalscuttle beat tempestuously about her head like an enraged balloon  another moment and a signal from the chief brought the ambushed christian warriors pouring down to the shore to see the longlost and loved ones reunited while ebony ran about in a state of frantic excitement weeping copiously and embracing every one who came in his way  but who shall describe the agony of disappointment endured by poor betsy when she found that waroonga was not among them the droop of the spirits the collapse of the coalscuttle  language is impotent  we leave it to imagination merely remarking that she soon recovered on the faith of the happiness which was yet in store for her    chapter fifteen  and now once again we find ourselves in the palmgrove of ratinga island  it is a fine autumn afternoon  the air is still as regards motion but thrilling with the melody of merry human voices as the natives labour in the fields and alive with the twittering of birds as they make love quarrel and make it up again in the bushes  now and then a hilarious laugh bursts from a group of children or a hymn rises from some grateful heart for as yet there is no secular music in ratinga  in the lagoon lies a manofwar its sails neatly furled and its trim rigging dark hull and taper spars perfectly reproduced in the clear water  as the sun sank lower towards the west our friend ebony might have been seen slowly climbing the side of one of the neighbouring hills with richard rosco the expirate on his back  set me down now my friend said rosco you are far too good to me and let me know what it is you have to say to me  you have quite roused my curiosity by your nods and mysterious manner  out with it now whatever it is  the negro had placed rosco in such a position on a ledge of rock that he could see the lagoon and the ship at anchor  the expirate had by that time recovered some of his former strength and although there rested on his countenance an air of profound sadness there mingled with it a hue of returning health which none who saw him land had expected to see again  but the care of gentle hands and the power of gladsome emotions had wrought miraculously on the man body and soul  is heerd massa an cappin fizzroy talkin about you said the negro crossing his arms on his chest and regarding his questioner with a somewhat quizzical expression  ha  i thought so  i am wanted eh  well yis yous wanted but yous not getted yetso far as i knows  ah  ebony returned rosco shaking his head i have long expected it and now i am prepared to meet my deserved fate like a mani may humbly say a christian man thanks to god the saviour and zeppa the instrument  but tell me what did the commander of the manofwar say  what did he say  well is tell you  fust he hoed into massas house an shook hands with missis also wid missis waroonga wot happined to be wid her an hims so frindly dat he nigh shookt de bonnit off her head den dey talk bout good many tings an after a while de cappin turn full on massa an say  is told missr zeppa dat yous got dat willain rosco de pirit here  ho you should hab see poor massas face how it grow long i most tink it also grow a leetil pale an missis she give a squeak what she couldnt help an betsy she giv a groan an jump up slap on hers bonnit back to de front an begin to clar out but de cappin jump up an stop her  many apologies ses de hipperkrit for stoppin a lady but i dont want any alarm given  you know dat de pirits life am forfitid to his country so ob course youll gib him up  and what said zeppa to that asked rosco eagerly  is just agoin to tell you massa  you see is in de back kishen at de time an hear ebery word  well ses massa awful slow an unwillin like i cannot deny that rosco is in the island but i do assure you sir that he is quite unable to do any furder mischief to any one foran massa stop all of a suddint  well ses de cappin why you not go on  has you a description of him he asked  oh yes ses de cappin drawin out a paper an readin it  de bery ting as like you it was as two pease even to de small mole on side ob yous nose but it say noting bout yous feet  clarly he nebber heerd ob dat an massa he notice dat seems to me for he ses well cappin fizzerald it may be your duty to seize dis pirit and deliber him up to justice but its no duty ob mine to help you  oh as to dat ses de cappin ill easily find him widout your assistance  i have a party of men with me and no one knows or even suspects de reason ob my visit  but all of you who now hear me mus promise not to say a word about this matter till my search is over  i believe you to be an honourable christian man zeppa who cannot break his word may these ladies be relied on  dey may ses massa in a voice ob woe dat amost made me cry  so wen i hear dat i tinks to myself oh you british hipperkrit yous not so clebber as you tinks for ebonys got to windard ob you an wid dat i slips out ob do back winder an run to yous cottage an ask if youd like to have a ride on my back as usual an you say yis an now yous here an i dessay de cappins lookin for you  it is very kind of you ebony said rosco with a deep sigh and a shake of the head very kind both of you and zeppa but your efforts cannot now avail me  just consider  if the description of me possessed by captain fitzgerald is as faithful and minute as you say the mere absence of my feet could not deceive him  besides when i am found if the commander of the manofwar asks me my name i will not deny it i will give myself up  but if you do dey will hang you said ebony in a somewhat exasperated tone  even so  it is my fateand deserved  but it would be murder to hang a innercent man whats bin reformed an dont mean for to do no more mischiefnot ony so but cant  i fear you wont get the broken law to look at it in that light ebony  broken law what does i care for de broken law  but tell me massa hab you make up yous mind to gib youself up  i have returned rosco sadly  quite sure an sartin  quite returned rosco with a faint smile at the poor negros persistency  well den you come an hab a last ride on my back  surely you no kin refuse so small a favour to dis yar black hoss wats carried you so of in afore you die  of course not my poor fellow but to what purposeof what use will it be to delay matters  it will only prolong the captains search needlessly  oh nebber mind  ders good lot o huts in de place to keep de hipperkrit goin  plenty ob time for a last leetil ride  besides i want you to see a place i diskiver not long agomost koorious place you nebber see  come along then said rosco thinking it right to humour one who had been more like a brother than a servant to him during his long illness stoop down  now then heave  in a twinkling rosco was on the back of his black horse which carried him a considerable distance in among the hills  ah  ebony said the rider at last i feel sure you are deceiving methat you hope to conceal me here but it is of no use i tell you for i wont remain concealed  no massa i not deceive you  i bring you here to show you de stronary place i hab diskiver an ax you what you tink ob him  well show it me quickly and then let us hasten home  without replying the negro clambered up a somewhat steep and rugged path which brought them to the base of a low precipice which was partially fringed with bushes  pushing one of these aside he entered a small cavern not much larger than a sentrybox which seemed to have no outlet but ebony placing his right foot on a projection of rock just large enough to receive it raised himself upwards so as to place his left foot on another projection which enabled him to get on what appeared to be a shelf of rock  rising up he entered another cavern  a strange place truly but very dark said rosco does it extend far  youll see jus now muttered the negro obtaining a light by means of flint and steel with which he kindled a torch  you see is bin splorin here before an got tings ready  so saying he carried rosco through several winding passages until he gained a cavern so large and high that the torch was unable to reveal either its extent or its roof  wonderful why did you not tell us of this place before ebony  cause i ony just diskiver him bout a week past  i tink him splendid place for hide our wimen an childers in if wes iver tacked by savages  see i even make some few preparationsgot straw in de corner for lie onsoon git meat an drink if hims required  very suitable indeed but if you have brought me here to hide as i still suspect my poor fellow you have troubled yourself in vain for my mind is made up  dats berry sad massa berry sad returned ebony with a deep sigh but you no object sit on de straw for a bit an let me rest  dere now yous growin heavier every day massa  i stick de torch here for light  look here you see i hab a few tings  dis is one bit ob rope wid a loop on him  and what may that be for asked rosco with some curiosity  for tie up our enemies when wes catch dem  dis way you understan  as he spoke ebony passed the loop over roscos shoulders and drew it tight so as to render his arms powerless and before the latter realised what he was about his legs were also securely bound  surely you do not mean to keep me here by force cried rosco angrily  is much afraid massa dats zactly what i mean  come come ebony you have carried this jest far enough  unbind me  berry sorry to disoblige you massa but dats impossible just now  i command you sir to undo this rope cried rosco fiercely  deres a good deal ob de ole ring about dat sar but yous not a pirit cappen now an i aint one ob de pirit crew  rosco saw at once the absurdity of giving way to anger and restrained himself  but you cannot restrain my voice ebony he continued and i promise you that i will shout till i am heard  shout away massa much as you please  bust yous lungs if you like for yous in de bowls ob de hill here  rosco felt that he was in the negros powers and remained silent  is berry sorry to leave you tied up said ebony rising to quit the place but when men is foolish like leetil boys dey must be treat de same  de straw will keep you comfrable  i darent leave de torch but ill soon send you food by a sure messenger and come back myself soon as iver i can  stay ebony im at your mercy and as no good can come of my remaining bound i must give in  will you unbind me if i promise to remain quiet  wid pleasure said the negro cheerfully as his glistening teeth showed themselves  you promise to wait here till i come for you  i promise  an you promise not to shout  i do  in a moment the rope was cast off and rosco was free  then ebony bidding him keep up his heart glided out of the cavern and left him in profound darkness  captain fitzgerald searched the island high and low far and wide without success being guided during the search chiefly by ebony  that wily negro on returning to the village found that the search had already begun  the captain had taken care that no one save those to whom he had already spoken should know what or who he was searching for so that the pirate might not be prematurely alarmed  great therefore was his surprise when he was accosted by the negro and asked in a mysterious manner to step aside with him out of earshot of the sailors who assisted him  what have you got to say to me my man he asked when they had gone a few yards into the palmgrove  yous lookin for the pirit said ebony in a hoarse whisper and with a superhumanly intelligent gaze  why how came you to know that asked the captain somewhat perplexed and thrown off his guard  ho ho laughed ebony in a subdued voice how i comes to know dat eh  i come to knows many tings by putting dis an dat togider  yous cappen ob manobwar  well you no comes here for notting  well rosco de pirit de horroble scoundril hims lib here  ob course you come for look for him  hofficers ob de brish navy got notting else to do but kotch an hang sitch varmints  eh  is right  well no returned captain fitzgerald laughing not altogether right as to the duties of officers of the british navy  however youre right as to my object and i see that this pirate is no friend of yours  no friend oh nonot at all  hims far more nor dat  i lub him as a brudder said the negro with intense energy  captain fitzgerald laughed again for he supposed that the negro spoke ironically and ebony extended his thick lips from ear to ear because he foresaw and intended that the captain would fall into that mistake  now you lose no time in sarch for him said ebony an dis yar nigger will show you de way  do my fine fellow and when we find him ill not forget your services  yous berry good amost too good said ebony with an affectionate look at his new employer  so as we have said the village and island were searched high and low without success  at last while the searching party was standing baffled on the shore farthest from the village captain fitzgerald stopped abruptly and looking zeppa in the face exclaimed strange is it not and the island so small comparatively  quite unaccountable answered zeppa who with his son had at last joined in the search out of sheer anxiety as to roscos fate  most perplexing said orlando  most amazin murmured ebony with a look of disappointment that baffles description  suddenly the negro pointed to the beach exclaiming oh  i knows it now  look dare  you see two small canoes  dere wor tree canoes dare yisterday  de tird wan am dare now  look  they all looked eagerly at the horizon where a tiny speck was seen  it might have been a gull or an albatross  impossible said zeppa  where could he hope to escape to in that directionno island within a thousand miles  a desprit man doos anyting massa  well  i shall soon find out for the wind blows in that direction said the captain wheeling about and returning to his ship  soon the sails were spread the anchor weighed the coral reef passed and the good ship was leaping merrily over the sea in pursuit of the pirate while ebony was seated on the straw beside rosco expanding his mouth to an extent that it had never reached before and causing the cavern to ring with uproarious laughter    chapter sixteen  it need scarcely be said that the manofwar did not overtake the pirates canoe  she cruised about for some days in the hope of falling in with it  then her course was altered and she was steered once more for ratinga  but the elements seemed to league with ebony in this matter for ere she sighted the island there burst upon her one of those tremendous hurricanes with which the southern seas are at times disturbed  so fierce was the tempest that the good ship was obliged to present her stern to the howling blast and scud before it under bare poles  when the wind abated captain fitzgerald found himself so far from the scene of his recent visit and so pressed for time as well as with the claims of other dutiespossibly according to ebony the capturing and hanging of other piratesthat he resolved to postpone his visit until a more convenient season  the convenient season never came  captain fitzgerald returned home to die and with him died the memory of rosco the pirateat least as far as public interest in his capture and punishment was concernedfor some of the captains papers were mislaid and lost and among them the personal description of the pirate and the account of his various misdeeds  but rosco himself did not die  he lived to prove the genuine nature of his conversion and to assist waroonga in his good work  as it is just possible that some reader may doubt the probabilityperhaps even the possibilityof such a change we recommend him to meditate on the fact that saul of tarsus the persecutor became paul the loving apostle of the lord  one morning not long after the events just narrated zeppa came to roscos hut with a bundle under his arm  he was followed by marie betsy zariffa and lippy with her mother  by that time lippy had been provided with a bonnet similar to that of her friend ziffa and her mother had been induced to mount a flannel petticoat which she wore tied round her neck or her waist as her fancy or her forgetfulness inclined her  the party had accompanied zeppa to observe the effect of this bundle on rosco  that worthy was seated on a low couch constructed specially for him by ebony  he was busy reading  welcome friends all he said with a look of surprise at the deputationlike visit  we have come to present you with a little gift rosco said zeppa unrolling the bundle and holding up to view a couple of curious machines  wooden legs exclaimed rosco with something between a gasp and a laugh  thats what they are rosco  we have been grieved to see you creeping about in such a helpless fashion and dependent on ebony or some other strongbacked fellow when you wanted to go any distance so orlando and i have put our heads together and produced a pair of legs  while he was speaking the onlookers gazed in openeyedandmouthed expectancy for they did not feel quite sure how their footless friend would receive the gift  it is kind very kind of you he said on recovering from his surprise but how am i to fix them on theres no hole to shove the ends of my poor legs into  oh you dont shove your legs into them at all said zeppa youve only got to go on your knees into themsee this part will fit your knees pretty wellthen you strap them on make them fast and away you go  lets try them  to the delight of the women and children rosco was quite as eager to try on the legs as they were to see him do it  the bare idea of being once more able to walk quite excited the poor man and his hands trembled as he tried to assist his friend in fixing them  keep your hands away altogether said zeppa you only delay me there now theyre as tight as two masts  hold on to me while i raise you up  at that moment tomeo buttchee ebony ongoloo wapoota and orlando came upon the scene  what a shame father cried the latter to begin without letting us know  ah  orley im sorry you have found us at it  marie and i had planned giving you a surprise by making rosco walk up to you  never mind cried rosco impatiently just set me on my pins and ill soon walk into him  now then hoist away  orley and his father each seized an arm and next moment rosco stood up  now den don hurry himhurrah cried ebony giving a cheer of encouragement  have a care friends dont let me go said rosco anxiously clutching his supporters necks with a convulsive grasp  ill never do it zeppa  i feel that if you quit me for an instant i shall go down like a shot  no fear  here cut him a staff ebony said zeppa thatll be equal to three legs you know and even a stool can stand alone with three legs  the staff was cut and handed to the learner who planting it firmly on the ground before him leaned on it and exclaimed let go in tones which instantly suggested the anchor to his friends  the order was obeyed and the expirate stood swaying to and fro and smiling with almost childlike delight  presently he became solemn lifted one leg and set it down again with marvellous rapidity  then he lifted the other leg with the same result  then he lifted the staff but had to replace it smartly to prevent falling forward  i fear i can only do duty as a motionless tripod he said rather anxiously  nebber fear massaoh  look out  the latter exclamation was caused by rosco falling backwards to prevent which catastrophe he made a wild flourish with his arms and a sweep with his staff which just grazed the negros cheek  zeppa however caught him in his arms and set him up again  now then try once more he said encouragingly  rosco tried and in the course of halfanhour managed with many a stagger and upheaval of the arms and staff to advance about eight or ten yards  at this point however he chanced to place the end of the right leg on a soft spot of ground  down it went instantly to the knee and over went the learner on his side snapping the leg short off in the fall  it would be difficult to paint the general disappointment at this sudden collapse of the experiment  a united groan burst from the party including the patient for it at once became apparent that a man with a wooden legto say nothing of twocould only walk on a hard beaten path and as there were few such in the island roscos chance of a long ramble seemed to vanish  but zeppa and his son were not men to be easily beaten  they set to work to construct feet for the legs which should be broad enough to support their friend on softish ground and these were so arranged with a sort of ballandsocket joint that the feet could be moved up and down  in theory this worked admirably in practice it failed for after a staggering step or two the toes having been once raised refused to go down and thus was produced the curious effect of a man stumping about on his heels  to overcome this difficulty the heels of the feet were made to project almost as much behind as the toes did in front somewhat after the pattern of ebonys pedal arrangements as rosco remarked when they were being fitted on for another trial  at last by dint of perseverance the wooden legs were perfected and rosco reacquired the art of walking to such perfection that he was to be seen almost at all times and in all weathers stumping about the village his chief difficulty being that when he chanced to fall which he often did he was obliged either to get some one to help him up or to crawl home for being unable to get his knees to the ground when the legs were on he was obliged to unstrap them if no one was within hail  now during all this time betsy waroonga remained quite inconsolable about her husband  but my dear you know he is quite safe her friend marie zeppa would say to her for he is doing the masters work among christian men  i knows that betsy would reply an im comforted a leetle when i think so but what for not zeppa git a canoe ready an take me to him a missionary not worth nothing without hees wife  marie sympathised heartily with this sentiment but pointed out that it was too long and dangerous a voyage to be undertaken in a canoe and that it was probable the mission ship would revisit ratinga ere long in which case the voyage could be undertaken in comfort and safety  but betsy did not believe in the danger of a canoe voyage nor in the speedy arrival of the mission ship  in fact she believed in nothing at that time save in her own grief and the hardness of her case  she shook her head and the effect on the coalscuttle which had now become quite palsied with age and hard service was something amazing insomuch that maries sympathy merged irresistibly into mirth  the good womans want of faith however received a rebuke not many weeks later  she was hastening one afternoon to an outlying field to gather vegetables in company with zariffa who had by that time grown into a goodlysized girl  the pace induced silence also considerable agitation in both bonnets when they had cleared the village and reached roscos hut near the entrance to the palmgrove they went up to the open door and looked in but no one was there  hes hoed out to walk observed zariffa with a light laugh awful fond o walkin since he got the ooden legs  what was you want with him asked betsy as they resumed their walk  want to ask bout the bibil lesson for tomorrow  some things me no can understan an rosco great at the bibil now  yes murmured betsy with a nod theres many things in the bibil not easy to understand  takes a deal o study ziffa to make him out your father always say that  but roscos fussrate at splainin of em  fussrateso your father say  him was born for a misnary  at that moment a cry was heard in the distance  they had been ascending a winding path leading to the field to which they were bound  sounds like man in distress said betsy breaking into a run with that eager alacrity which usually characterises the sympathetic  zariffa replied not but followed her mother  the cry was repeated and at once recognised as being uttered by the man who was born for a misnary but had mistaken his profession when he became a pirate when they reached the spot whence it had apparently issued the misnary or expirate was nowhere to be seen  hooroo whar is you shouted betsy looking round  here cried a halfsmothered voice from somewhere in the earth  oh look exclaimed zariffa in a sort of squeal as she ran towards a spot where two strange plants seemed to have sprung up  roscos legs said betsy aghast  and she was right  the venturesome man had with his accustomed hardihood attempted that day to scale the mountain side and had fallen into a hole by the side of the track from which he could by no means extricate himself because of its being a tightish fit his head being down and his legs were in the air  oh betsy pull me out lass  im halfchoked already gasped the unfortunate man  but betsy could not move him much less pull him out although heartily assisted by her daughter  run ziffa run an fetch men  ziffa ran like a hunted deer so anxious was she for the deliverance of her bible instructor  on turning sharp round a bend in the track she plunged into the bosom of ebony  ho hi busted i am why whats de matter ziffa you travel like a cannonball  as he spoke zeppa and his son who had been walking behind ebony came up  the panting child only replied roscoqueek and ran before them to the fatal spot  need we say that in a few moments the born misnary was drawn like a cork out of a bottle and set down right end up  then they carried him to a clear space whence the sea was visible condoling with him as they went but here all thought of the accident and of everything else was banished for the moment by the sight of a ship on the horizon  it turned out to be the missionvessel with supplies and with a young native missionary or biblereader and thus in a few days not only betsy waroonga but ongoloo and wapoota with lippy and her mother and orlando were enabled to return to sugarloaf island  the joy of the sugarlovians at the return of their chiefs and friends is not to be described for despite the assurances of waroonga they had begun to grow uneasy  neither is it possible to describe the condition of the coalscuttle bonnet after it had been crushed in the reckless embrace of betsys spouse nor the delight of the uncles aunts brothers cousins nieces and nephews of lippy when they got her safe back again though awfully disguised by the miniature coalscuttle and flaming petticoat  by that time the mountainmen and the raturans had rubbed noses intermingled intermarried broken bows and spears buried the warhatchet and otherwise made up their minds like sane creatures to dwell in peace for savages come to this condition sometimescivilised nations never do  great therefore was their satisfaction when their mourning at the prospect of losing waroonga was turned into joy by the decision of the young native teacher who volunteered to take his place and remain with them as their permanent instructor in the way of righteousness  a dance was proposed by some of the chiefs as an appropriate way of expressing their joy and getting rid of superfluous energy but as their only dance was a wardance it was thought better to celebrate the occasion by a grand feast which being preceded by gameswrestling jumping and running etceteraserved the purpose equally wellif not better  thus was an island won from heathenism in those far off southern seas  and now what shall we say in conclusion  time and space would fail us were we to continue the history of ratinga island down to the present time  we can only add that waroonga and betsy returned home that a stalwart son of tomeo went in after years to sugarloaf island and carried off lippy as his bride along with her mother that a handsome son of ongoloo took revenge by carrying zariffa away from ratinga without her mother that regular and frequent intercourse was set up between the two islands by means of a little schooner that ebony stuck to his master and mistress through thick and thin to a good old age that orlando went to england studied medicine and returned again to ratinga with a fair daughter of that favoured land that wapootas morals improved by degrees that buttchee became more reconciled to european dress as he grew older and that the inhabitants of the two islands generally became wiser and happierthough of course not perfectthrough the benign influence of that gospel which teaches man to do to others as he would have others do to him  time as usual continued to work his marvellous changes as the years flew by but of all the transformations he wrought none was so striking as that produced in two men of ratinga who daily sat down side by side in front of their cottage by the sea to watch a host of children of all ages sizes and complexions which gambolled merrily on the sands  these men were old and somewhat feeble with hair like the driven snow but their gentle expressions and ready smiles told of eternal youth within  as the one sat with his colossal frame still erect though spare talking softly to his comrade and the other sat slightly bent with eyes gazing sometimes at the children and sometimes at his wooden toes how difficult how almost impossible to believe that in former days the one had been the madman and the other the pirate
