  part i  the city  chapter i   captain lew golden would have saved any foreign observer a great deal of trouble in studying america he was an almost perfect type of the petty smalltown middleclass lawyer he lived in panama pennsylvania he had never been captain of anything except the crescent volunteer fire company but he owned the title because he collected rents wrote insurance and meddled with lawsuits  he carried a quite visible mustachecomb and wore a collar but no tie on warm days he appeared on the street in his shirtsleeves and discussed the comparative temperatures of the past thirty years with doctor smith and the mansion house busdriver he never used the word beauty except in reference to a setter dogbeauty of words or music of faith or rebellion did not exist for him he rather fancied large ambitious banal redandgold sunsets but he merely glanced at them as he straggled home and remarked that they were nice he believed that all parisians artists millionaires and socialists were immoral his entire system of theology was comprised in the bible which he never read and the methodist church which he rarely attended and he desired no system of economics beyond the current platform of the republican party he was aimlessly industrious crotchety but kind and almost quixotically honest  he believed that panama pennsylvania was good enough for anybody  this last opinion was not shared by his wife nor by his daughter una  mrs golden was one of the women who aspire just enough to be vaguely discontented not enough to make them toil at the acquisition of understanding and knowledge she had floated into a comfortable semibelief in a semichristian science and she read novels with a conviction that she would have been a romantic person if she hadnt married mr goldennot but what hes a fine man and very bright and all but he hasnt got much imagination or any well romance  she wrote poetry about spring and neighborhood births and captain golden admired it so actively that he read it aloud to callers she attended all the meetings of the panama study club and desired to learn french though she never went beyond borrowing a french grammar from the episcopalian rector and learning one conjugation but in the pioneer suffrage movement she took no partshe didnt think it was quite ladylike  she was a poor cook and her house always smelled stuffy but she liked to have flowers about she was pretty of face frail of body genuinely gracious of manner she really did like people liked to give cookies to the neighborhood boys andif you werent impatient with her slacknessyou found her a wistful and touching figure in her slight youthfulness and in the ambition to be a romantic personage a marie antoinette or a mrs grover cleveland which ambition she still retained at fiftyfive  she was in appearance the ideal wife and mothersympathetic forgiving brightlipped as a may morning she never demanded she merely suggested her desires and if they were refused let her lips droop in a manner which only a brute could withstand  she plaintively admired her efficient daughter una  una golden was a good little womannot pretty not noisy not particularly articulate but instinctively on the inside of things naturally able to size up people and affairs she had common sense and unkindled passion she was a matteroffact idealist with a healthy womans simple longing for love and life at twentyfour una had half a dozen times fancied herself in love she had been embraced at a dance and felt the stirring of a desire for surrender but always a native shrewdness had kept her from agonizing over these affairs  she was notand will not bea misunderstood genius an undeveloped artist an embryonic leader in feminism nor an ugly duckling who would put on a georgette hat and captivate the theatrical world she was an untrained ambitious thoroughly commonplace smalltown girl but she was a natural executive and she secretly controlled the golden household kept captain golden from eating with his knife and her mother from becoming drugged with too much reading of poppyflavored novels  she wanted to learn learn anything but the goldens were too respectable to permit her to have a job and too poor to permit her to go to college from the age of seventeen when she had graduated from the high schoolin white ribbons and heavy new boots and tight new organdyto twentythree she had kept house and gone to gossipparties and unmethodically read books from the town librarywalter scott richard le gallienne harriet beecher stowe mrs humphry ward how to know the birds my year in the holy land home needlework sartor resartus and ships that pass in the night her residue of knowledge from reading them was a disbelief in panama pennsylvania  she was likely never to be anything more amazing than a mother and wife who would entertain the honiton embroidery circle twice a year  yet potentially una golden was as glowing as any princess of balladry she was waiting for the fairy prince though he seemed likely to be nothing more decorative than a salesman in a brown derby she was fluid indeterminate as a moving cloud  although una golden had neither piquant prettiness nor grave handsomeness her soft littleness made people call her puss and want to cuddle her as a child cuddles a kitten if you noted una at all when you met her you first noted her gentle face her finetextured hair of faded gold and her rimless eyeglasses with a gold chain over her ear these glasses made a businesslike center to her face you felt that without them she would have been too childish her mouth was as kind as her spirited eyes but it drooped her body was so femininely soft that you regarded her as rather plump but for all her curving hips and the thick ankles which she considered common she was rather anemic her cheeks were round not rosy but clear and soft her lips a pale pink her chin was plucky and undimpled it was usually spotted with one or two unimportant eruptions which she kept so well covered with powder that they were never noticeable no one ever thought of them except una herself to whom they were tragic blemishes which she timorously examined in the mirror every time she went to wash her hands she knew that they were the result of the indigestible golden family meals she tried to take comfort by noticing their prevalence among other girls but they kept startling her anew she would secretly touch them with a worried forefinger and wonder whether men were able to see anything else in her face  you remembered her best as she hurried through the street in her tan mackintosh with its yellow velveteen collar turned high up and one of those modest round hats to which she was addicted for then you were aware only of the palegold hair fluffing round her schoolmistress eyeglasses her gentle air of respectability and her undistinguished littleness  she trusted in the village ideal of virginal vacuousness as the type of beauty which most captivated men though every year she was more shrewdly doubtful of the divine superiority of these men that a womans business in life was to remain respectable and to secure a man and consequent security was her unmeditated faithtill in 1905 when una was twentyfour years old her father died   § 2  captain golden left to wife and daughter a good name a number of debts and eleven hundred dollars in lodge insurance the funeral was scarcely over before neighborsthe furniture man the grocer the polite old homeopathic doctorbegan to come in with bland sympathy and large bills when the debts were all cleared away the goldens had only six hundred dollars and no income beyond the good name all rightminded persons agree that a good name is precious beyond rubies but una would have preferred less honor and more rubies  she was so engaged in comforting her mother that she scarcely grieved for her father she took charge of everythingmoney house bills  mrs golden had been overwhelmed by a realization that however slack and shallow captain golden had been he had adored her and encouraged her in her gentility her pawing at culture with an emerging sincerity mrs golden mourned him now missed his gossipy presenceand at the same time she was alive to the distinction it added to her slim gracefulness to wear black and look wan she sobbed on unas shoulder she said that she was lonely and una sturdily comforted her and looked for work  one of the most familiar human combinations in the world is that of unemployed daughter and widowed mother a thousand times you have seen the jobless daughter devoting all of her curiosity all of her youth to a widowed mother of small pleasantries a small income and a shabby security thirty comes and thirtyfive the daughter ages steadily at forty she is as old as her unwithering mother sweet she is and pathetically hopeful of being a pianist or a nurse never quite reconciled to spinsterhood though she often laughs about it often by her insistence that she is an old maid she makes the thought of her barren age embarrassing to others the mother is sweet too and wants to keep in touch with her daughters interests only her daughter has no interests had the daughter revolted at eighteen had she stubbornly insisted that mother either accompany her to parties or be content to stay alone had she acquired interests she might have meant something in the new generation but the time for revolt passes however much the daughter may long to seem young among younger women the mother is usually unconscious of her selfishness she would be unspeakably horrified if some brutal soul told her that she was a vampire chance chance and waste rule them both and the world passes by while the mother has her games of cards with daughter and deems herself unselfish because now and then she lets daughter join a party only to hasten back to mother and even wonders why daughter doesnt take an interest in girls her own age that ugly couple on the porch of the applesauce and washpitcher boardinghousethe mother a mute dwarfish punchinello and the daughter a drab woman of forty with a mole a wart a silence that charming mother of white hair and real lace with the wellgroomed daughter that comfortable mother at home and daughter in an office but with no suitors no ambition beyond the one at home they are all examples of the motheranddaughter phenomenon that most touching most destructive example of selfless unselfishness which robs all the generations to come because mother has never been trained to endure the long long thoughts of solitude because she sees nothing by herself and within herself hears no diverting voice  there were many such mothers and daughters in panama if they were wealthy daughter collected rents and saw lawyers and belonged to a club and tried to keep youthful at parties if middleclass daughter taught school almost invariably if poor mother did the washing and daughter collected it so it was marked down for una that she should be a teacher  not that she wanted to be a teacher after graduating from high school she had spent two miserable terms of teaching in the small white district school four miles out on the bethlehem road she hated the drive out and back the airless room and the foul outbuildings the shy stupid staring children the jolly little arithmetical problems about wallpaper piles of lumber the amount of time that notoriously inefficient workmen will take to do a certain piece of work una was honest enough to know that she was not an honest teacher that she neither loved masses of other peoples children nor had any ideals of developing the new generation but she had to make money of course she would teach  when she talked over affairs with her tearful mother mrs golden always ended by suggesting i wonder if perhaps you couldnt go back to schoolteaching again everybody said you were so successful and maybe i could get some needlework to do i do want to help so much  mrs golden did apparently really want to help but she never suggested anything besides teaching and she went on recklessly investing in the nicest mourning meantime una tried to find other work in panama  seen from a balloon panama is merely a mole on the long hillslopes but to una its few straggly streets were a whole cosmos she knew somebody in every single house she knew just where the succotash the cakeboxes the clotheslines were kept in each of the grocerystores and on market saturdays she could wait on herself she summed up the whole town and its possibilities and she wondered what opportunities the world out beyond panama had for her she recalled two trips to philadelphia and one to harrisburg she made out a list of openings with such methodical exactness as she devoted to keeping the dwindling lodge insurance from disappearing altogether hers was no poetic outreach like that of the young genius who wants to be off for bohemia it was a question of earning money in the least tedious way una was facing the feminist problem without knowing what the word feminist meant  this was her list of fair fields of fruitful labor  she couldand probably wouldteach in some hencoop of pedagogy  she could marry but no one seemed to want her except old henry carson the widower with catarrh and three children who called on her and her mother once in two weeks and would propose whenever she encouraged him to this she knew scientifically she had only to sit beside him on the sofa let her hand drop down beside his but she positively and ungratefully didnt want to marry henry and listen to his hawking and his grumbling for the rest of her life sooner or later one of the boys might propose but in a small town it was all a gamble there werent so very many desirable young menmost of the energetic ones went off to philadelphia and new york true that jennie mctevish had been married at thirtyone when everybody had thought she was hopelessly an old maid yet here was birdie mayberry unmarried at thirtyfour no one could ever understand why for she had been the prettiest and jolliest girl in town una crossed blessed matrimony off the list as a commercial prospect  she could go off and study music law medicine elocution or any of that amazing hodgepodge of pursuits which are permitted to smalltown women but she really couldnt afford to do any of these and besides she had no talent for music of a higher grade than sousa and victor herbert she was afraid of lawyers blood made her sick and her voice was too quiet for the noble art of elocution as practised by several satinwaisted semiartistic ladies who gave readings of enoch arden and evangeline before the panama study circle and the panama annual chautauqua  she could have a job selling drygoods behind the counter in the hub store but that meant loss of caste  she could teach dancingbut she couldnt dance particularly well and that was all that she could do  she had tried to find work as officewoman for dr mayberry the dentist in the office of the panama woodturning company in the postoffice as lofty enthroned cashier for the hub store painting placecards and making fancywork for the art needlework exchange  the job behind the counter in the hub store was the only one offered her  if i were only a boy sighed una i could go to work in the hardwarestore or on the railroad or anywhere and not lose respectability oh i hate being a woman   § 3  una had been trying to persuade her fathers oldtime rival squire updegraff the realestate and insurance man that her experience with captain golden would make her a perfect treasure in the office squire updegraff had leaped up at her entrance and blared well well and how is the little girl making it he had set out a chair for her and held her hand but he knew that her only experience with her fathers affairs had been an effort to balance captain goldens accountbooks which were works of genius in so far as they were composed according to the inspirational method so there was nothing very serious in their elaborate discussion of giving una a job  it was her last hope in panama she went disconsolately down the short street between the twostory buildings and the rows of hitched lumberwagons nellie page the town belle tripping by in canvas sneakers and a large red hairribbon shouted at her and charlie martindale of the first national bank nodded to her but these exquisites were too young for her they danced too well and laughed too easily the person who stopped her for a long curbstone conference about the weather while most of the town observed and gossiped was the fateful henry carson the village sun was unusually blank and hard on henrys bald spot today heavens she cried to herself in almost hysterical protest would she have to marry henry  miss mattie pugh drove by returning from district school miss mattie had taught at clarks crossing for seventeen years had grown meek and meager and hopeless heavens thought una would she have to be shut into the fetid barn of a small school unless she married henry  i wont be genteel ill work in the hub or any place first una declared while she trudged homea pleasant inconspicuous fluffyhaired young woman undramatic as a field daisya cataract of protest poured through her all the rest of her life she would have to meet that doddering old mr mosely who was unavoidably bearing down on her now and be held by him in long meaningless talks and there was nothing amusing to do she was so frightfully bored she suddenly hated the town hated every evening she would have to spend there reading newspapers and playing cards with her mother and dreading a call from mr henry carson  she wantedwanted some one to love to talk with why had she discouraged the beautiful charlie martindale the time he had tried to kiss her at a dance charlie was fatuous but he was young and she wanted yes yes that was it she wanted youth she who was herself so young and she would grow old here unless some one one of these godlike young men condescended to recognize her grow old among these streets like piles of lumber  she charged into the small white ambling golden house with its peculiar smell of stale lamb gravy and on the old broken couchwhere her father had snored all through every bright sunday afternoonshe sobbed feebly  she raised her head to consider a noise overheadthe faint domestic thunder of a sewingmachine shaking the walls with its rhythm the machine stopped she heard the noise of scissors dropped on the floorthe most stuffily domestic sound in the world the airless house was crushing her she sprang upand then she sat down again there was no place to which she could flee henry carson and the district school were menacing her and meantime she had to find out what her mother was sewingwhether she had again been wasting money in buying mourning  poor poor little mother working away happy up there and ive got to go and scold you una agonized oh i want to earn money i want to earn real money for you  she saw a quadrangle of white on the table behind a book she pounced on it it was a letter from mrs sessions and una scratched it open excitedly  mr and mrs albert sessions of panama had gone to new york mr sessions was in machinery they liked new york they lived in a flat and went to theaters mrs sessions was a pillowy soul whom una trusted  why dont you wrote mrs sessions if you dont find the kind of work you want in panama think about coming up to new york and taking stenography there are lots of chances here for secretaries etc  una carefully laid down the letter she went over and straightened her mothers red wool slippers she wanted to postpone for an exquisite throbbing moment the joy of announcing to herself that she had made a decision  she would go to new york become a stenographer a secretary to a corporation president a rich woman free responsible  the fact of making this revolutionary decision so quickly gave her a feeling of power of already being a business woman  she galloped upstairs to the room where her mother was driving the sewingmachine  mumsie she cried were going to new york im going to learn to be a business woman and the little mother will be all dressed in satin and silks and dine on whatisit and peaches and creamthe poem dont come out right but oh my little mother were going out adventuring we are  she plunged down beside her mother burrowed her head in her mothers lap kissed that hand whose skin was like thinnest wrinkly tissuepaper  why my little daughter what is it has some one sent for us is it the letter from emma sessions what did she say in it  she suggested it but we are going up independent  but can we afford to i would like the draymas and artgalleries and all  we will afford to well gamble for once     chapter ii   una golden had never realized how ugly and petty were the streets of panama till that evening when she walked down for the mail spurning the very dust on the sidewalksand there was plenty to spurn an old mansion of towers and scalloped shingles brokenshuttered now and unpainted with a row of brick stores marching up on its once leisurely lawn the townhall a square wooden barn with a sagging upper porch from which the mayor would presumably have made proclamations had there ever been anything in panama to proclaim about staring loafers in front of the girard house to una there was no romance in the sick mansion no kindly democracy in the village street no bare freedom in the hills beyond she was not much to blame she was a creature of action to whom this constricted town had denied all action except sweeping  she felt so strong nowshe had expected a struggle in persuading her mother to go to new york but acquiescence had been easy una had an exultant joy a little youthful and cruel in meeting old henry carson and telling him that she was going away that she didnt know for how long maybe for always so hopelessly did he stroke his lean brown neck which was never quite cleanshaven that she tried to be kind to him she promised to write but she felt when she had left him as though she had just been released from prison to live with him to give him the right to claw at her with those desiccated handsshe imagined it with a vividness which shocked her all the while she was listening to his halting regrets  a dry dusty september wind whirled down the village street it choked her  there would be no dusty winds in new york but only mellow breezes over marble palaces of efficient business no henry carsons but slim alert business men young of eye and light of tongue   § 2  una golden had expected to thrill to her first sight of the new york skyline crossing on the ferry in midafternoon but it was so much like all the postcard views of it so stolidly devoid of any surprises that she merely remarked oh yes there it is thats where ill be and turned to tuck her mother into a ferry seat and count the suitcases and assure her that there was no danger of pickpockets though as the ferry sidled along the land passed an english liner and came close enough to the shore so that she could see the people who actually lived in the state of blessedness called new york una suddenly hugged her mother and cried oh little mother were going to live here and do things togethereverything  the familiar faces of mr and mrs albert sessions were awaiting them at the end of the long cavernous walk from the ferryboat and new york immediately became a blur of cabs cobblestones bales of cotton long vistas of very dirty streets high buildings surface cars elevateds shop windows that seemed dark and foreign and everywhere such a rush of people as made her feel insecure cling to the sessionses and try to ward off the dizziness of the swirl of new impressions she was daunted for a moment but she rejoiced in the conviction that she was going to like this madness of multiform energy  the sessionses lived in a flat on amsterdam avenue near ninetysixth street they all went up from cortlandt street in the subway which was still new and miraculous in 1905 for five minutes una was terrified by the jam of people the blind roar through tunneled darkness the sense of being powerlessly hurled forward in a mass of ungovernable steel but nothing particularly fatal happened and she grew proud to be part of this black energy and contentedly swung by a strap  when they reached the sessionses flat and fell upon the gossip of panama pennsylvania una was absentmindedexcept when the sessionses teased her about henry carson and charlie martindale the rest of the time curled up on a blackwalnut couch which she had known for years in panama and which looked plaintively rustic here in new york una gave herself up to impressions of the city the voices of many children down on amsterdam avenue the shriek of a flatwheeled surface car the sturdy pound of trucks horns of automobiles the separate sounds scarcely distinguishable in a whirr which seemed visible as a thick grayyellow dustcloud  her mother went to lie down the sessionses after an elaborate explanation of why they did not keep a maid began to get dinner and una stole out to see new york by herself  it all seemed different at once more real and not so jumbled together now that she used her own eyes instead of the guidance of that knowing old city bird mr albert sessions  amsterdam avenue was even in the dusk of early autumn disappointing in its walls of yellow flatbuildings cluttered with fireescapes the first stories all devoted to the same sort of shops over and over againdelicatessens laundries barbershops saloons groceries lunchrooms she ventured down a sidestreet toward a furnaceglow of sunset west end avenue was imposing to her in its solid brick and graystone houses and pavements milky in the waning light then came a block of expensive apartments she was finding the city of golden rewards frivolous curtains hung at windows in a huge apartmenthouse hall she glimpsed a negro attendant in a green uniform with a monkeycap and closeset rows of brass buttons she had a hint of palmsor what looked like palms of marble and mahogany and tiling and a flash of people in evening dress in her plain sensible suit una tramped past she was unenvious because she was going to have all these things soon  out of a rather stodgy vision of silk opera wraps and suitors who were like floorwalkers she came suddenly out on riverside drive and the splendor of the city  a dull city of straightfront unvaried streets is new york but she aspires in her skyscrapers she dreams a garden dream of georgian days in gramercy park and on riverside drive she bares her exquisite breast and wantons in beauty here she is sophisticated yet eager comparable to paris and vienna and here una exulted  down a polished roadway that reflected every light rolled smart motors with gay people in the sort of clothes she had studied in advertisements the driveway was bordered with mist wreathing among the shrubs above una shouldered the tremendous façades of goldcorniced apartmenthouses across the imperial hudson everything was enchanted by the long smoky afterglow against which the silhouettes of dome and tower and factory chimney stood out like an orient city  oh i want all thisits mine an apartment up therea big broad windowseat and look out on all this oh dear god she was unconsciously praying to her vague panama wesley methodist church god who gave you things if you were good i will work for all this and for the little mother dear mother thats never had a chance  in the step of the slightly stolid girl there was a new lightness a new ecstasy in walking rapidly through the stirring new york air as she turned back to the sessionses flat   § 3  later when the streets fell into order and became normal una could never quite identify the vaudeville theater to which the sessionses took them that evening the goldandivory walls of the lobby seemed to rise immeasurably to a ceiling flashing with frescoes of light lovers in blue and fluffy white mincing steps and ardent kisses and flaunting draperies they climbed a tremendous arching stairway of marble upon which her low shoes clattered with a pleasant sound they passed niches hung with heavy curtains of plumcolored velvet framing the sly peep of plaster fauns and came out on a balcony stretching as wide as the sea at twilight looking down on thousands of people in the orchestra below up at a vast golden dome lighted by glowing spheres hung with diamonds forward at a towering proscenic arch above which slim nude goddesses in basrelief floated in a languor which obsessed her set free the bare brown laughing nymph that hides in every stiff una in semimourning  nothing so diverting as that program has ever been witnessed the funny men with their solemn mockbattles their extravagance in dress their galloping wit made her laugh till she wanted them to stop the singers were bellvoiced the dancers graceful as clouds and just touched with a beguiling naughtiness and in the playlet there was a chill intensity that made her shudder when the husband accused the wife whom he suspected oh so absurdly as una indignantly assured herself  the entertainment was pure magic untouched by human clumsiness rare and spellbound as a stilly afternoon in oak woods by a lake  they went to a marvelous café and mr sessions astounded them by the urbanity with which he hurried captains and waiters and busboys and ordered lobster and coffee and pretended that he was going to be wicked and have wine and cigarettes  months afterward when she was going to vaudeville by herself una tried to identify the theater of wizardry but she never could the sessionses couldnt remember which theater it was they thought it was the pitt but surely they must have been mistaken for the pitt was a shanty daubed with grotesque nudes rambling and pretentious with shockingly amateurish programs and afterward on the occasion or two when they went out to dinner with the sessionses it seemed to una that mr sessions was provincial in restaurants too deprecatingly friendly with the waiters too hesitating about choosing dinner   § 4  whiteside and schleusners college of commerce where una learned the art of business occupied only five shabby rooms of crepuscular windows and perpetually dusty corners and hard glistening wallpaint in a converted but not sanctified old dwellinghouse on west eighteenth street the faculty were six mr whiteside an elaborate pomposity who smoothed his concrete brow as though he had a headache and took obvious pride in being able to draw birds with spencerian strokes mr schleusner who was small and vulgar and déclassé and really knew something about business a shabby man like a brokendown bookkeeper silent and diligent and afraid a towering man with a red face who kept licking his lips with a small red triangle of tongue and taught englishcommercial college englishin a bombastic voice of finicky correctness and always smelled of cigar smoke an active young jewish newyorker of wonderful black hair elfin face tilted hat and smart clothes who did something on the side in real estate finally a thin widow who was so busy and matteroffact that she was no more individualized than a streetcar any one of them was considered competent to teach any line and among them they ground out instruction in shorthand typewriting bookkeeping english grammar spelling composition with a special view to the construction of deceptive epistles and commercial geography once or twice a week languagemasters from a linguistic mill down the street were had in to chatter the more vulgar phrases of french german and spanish  a cluttered wheezy omnibus of a school but in it una rode to spacious and beautiful hours of learning it was even more to her than is the artschool to the yearner who has always believed that she has a talent for painting for the yearner has even as a child been able to draw and daub and revel in the results while for una this was the first time in her life when her labor seemed to count for something her schoolteaching had been a mere timefiller now she was at once the responsible head of the house and a seer of the future  most of the girls in the school learned nothing but shorthand and typewriting but to these una added english grammar spelling and lettercomposition after breakfast at the little flat which she had taken with her mother she fled to the school she drove into her books she delighted in the pleasure of her weary teachers when she snapped out a quick answer to questions or typed a page correctly or was able to remember the shorthand symbol for a difficult word like psychologize  her belief in the sacredness of the game was boundless     chapter iii   except for the young man in the bank the new young man in the hardwarestore and the proprietors of the new broadway clothing shop una had known most of the gallants in panama pennsylvania from knickerbocker days she remembered their bony boyish knees and their schoolday whippings too well to be romantic about them but in the commercial college she was suddenly associated with seventy entirely new and interesting males so brief were the courses so irregular the classifications that there was no spirit of seniority to keep her out of things and una with her fever of learning her instinctive common sense about doing things in the easiest way stood out among the girl students the young men did not buzz about her as they did about the slim diabolic stareyed girl from brooklyn in her tempting lowcut blouses or the intense curlyheaded boyish brown jew girl or the ardent dancers and gigglers but unas selfsufficient eagerness gave a fervor to her blue eyes and a tilt to her commonplace chin which made her almost pretty and the young men liked to consult her about things she was really more prominent here in a school of one hundred and seventy than in her panama high school with its enrolment of seventy  panama pennsylvania had never regarded una as a particularly capable young woman dozens of others were more masterful at trimming the christmas tree for wesley methodist church preparing for the annual picnic of the art needlework coterie arranging a surprise donation party for the methodist pastor even spring housecleaning but she had been well spoken of as a marketer a cook a neighbor who would take care of your baby while you went visitingbecause these tasks had seemed worth while to her she was more practical than either panama or herself believed all these years she had without knowing that she was philosophizing without knowing that there was a worldwide inquiry into womans place been trying to find work that needed her her fathers death had freed her had permitted her to toil for her mother cherish her be regarded as useful instantlystill without learning that there was such a principle as feminismshe had become a feminist demanding the world and all the fullness thereof as her field of labor  and now in this fumbling school she was beginning to feel the theory of efficiency the ideal of big business  for business that one necessary field of activity to which the egotistic arts and sciences and theologies and military puerilities are but servants that longdespised and always valiant effort to unify the labor of the world is at last beginning to be something more than dirty smithing no longer does the business man thank the better classes for permitting him to make and distribute bread and motorcars and books no longer does he crawl to the church to buy pardon for usury business is being recognizedand is recognizing itselfas ruler of the world  with this consciousness of power it is reforming its old petty halfhearted ways its idea of manufacture as a filthy sort of tinkering of distribution as chance peddling and squalid shopkeeping it is feverishly seeking efficiency in its machinery but like all monarchies it must fail unless it becomes noble of heart so long as capital and labor are divided so long as the making of munitions or injurious food is regarded as business so long as big business believes that it exists merely to enrich a few of the lucky or the well born or the nervously active it will not be efficient but deficient but the vision of an efficiency so broad that it can be kindly and sure is growingis discernible at once in the scientific business man and the courageous laborunionist  that vision una golden feebly comprehended where she first beheld it cannot be said certainly not in the lectures of her teachers humorless and unvisioned grinds who droned that by divine edict letters must end with a yours truly one space to the left of the middle of the page who sniffed at cardledgers as newfangled nonsense and at their most inspired croaked out such platitudes as look out for the pennies and the pounds will look out for themselves or the man who fails is the man who watches the clock  nor was the vision of the inspired big business that shall be to be found in the books over which una laboredthe flat marooncovered dusty commercial geography the arid book of phrases and rulesofthethumb called fishs commercial english the manual of touchtypewriting or the shorthand primer that with its grotesque symbols and numbered exercises and yellow pages dogeared by many owners looked like an oldfashioned arabic grammar headachily perused in some divinityschool library  her vision of it all must have come partly from the eager talk of a few of the studentsthe girl who wasnt ever going to give up her job even if she did marry the man who saw a future in these motion pictures the shaggyhaired zealot who talked about profitsharing which was a bold radicalism back in 1905 almost as subversive of office discipline as believing in unions partly it came from the new sorts of business magazines for the man who didnt like his fathers insist i guess i can run my business without any outside interference but sought everywhere for systems and charts and new markets and the scientific mind   § 2  while her power of faith and vision was satisfied by the largeness of the city and by her chance to work there was quickening in una a shy indefinable inner life of tenderness and desire for love she did not admit it but she observed the young men about her with an interest that was as diverting as her ambition  at first they awed her by their number and their strangeness but when she seemed to be quite their equal in this school of the timorously clerical she began to look at them leveleyed a busy commonplace softarmed pleasant good little thing she was glancing at them through eyeglasses attached to a gold chain over her ear not much impressed now slightly ashamed by the delight she took in winning their attention by brilliant recitations she decided that most of them were earnestminded but intelligent serfs not much stronger than the girls who were taking stenography for want of anything better to do they sprawled and looked vacuous as they worked in rows in the big studyhall with its hard blue walls showing the marks of two removed partitions its old iron fireplace stuffed with rubbers and overshoes and crayonboxes as a provincial una disliked the many jews among them and put down their fervor for any sort of learning to acquisitiveness the rest she came to despise for the clumsy slowness with which they learned even the simplest lessons and to all of them shewho was going to be rich and powerful directly she was good for one hundred words a minute at stenographyfelt disdainfully superior because they were likely to be poor the rest of their lives  in a twilight walk on washington heights a walk of such vigor and happy absorption with new problems as she had never known in panama she caught herself being contemptuous about their frayed poverty with a sharp emotional sincerity she rebuked herself for such sordidness mocked herself for assuming that she was already rich  even out of this mass of clerklings emerged two or three who were interesting sam weintraub a young active redheaded slimwaisted jew who was born in brooklyn he smoked large cigars with an air knew how to wear his clothes and told about playing tennis at the prospect athletic club he would be a smart secretary or confidential clerk some day una was certain he would own a car and be seen in evening clothes and even larger cigars at aftertheater suppers she was rather in awe of his sophistication he was the only man who made her feel like a freshman  j j todd a reticent hesitating hardworking man of thirty from chatham on cape cod it was he who in noontime arguments grimly advocated profitsharing which sam weintraub debonairly dismissed as socialistic  and most appealing to her enthusiastic young sanford hunt inarticulate but longing for a chance to attach himself to some master weintraub and todd had desks on either side of her they had that great romantic virtue propinquity but sanford hunt she had noticed in his corner across the room because he glanced about with such boyish loneliness  sanford hunt helped her find a rubber in the highschoollike coatroom on a rainy day when the girls were giggling and the tremendous swells of the institution were whooping and slapping one another on the back and acting as much as possible like their ideal of college menan ideal presumably derived from motion pictures and college playlets in vaudeville una saw j j todd gawping at her but not offering to help while a foreshortened sanford groped along the floor under the dusty line of coats for her missing left rubber sanford came up with the rubber smiled like a nice boy and walked with her to the subway  he didnt need much encouragement to tell his ambitions he was twentyonethree years younger than herself he was a semiorphan born in newark had worked up from officeboy to clerk in the office of a huge jersey city paint company had saved money to take a commercial course was going back to the paint company and hoped to be officemanager there he had a conviction that the finest man in the world was mr claude lowry president of the lowry paint company the next finest mr ernest lowry vicepresident and general manager the next mr julius schwirtz one of the two city salesmenmr schwirtz having occupied a desk next to his own for two yearsand that the best paint on the market today is lowrys lasting paintsimply no getting around it  in the fiveminute walk over to the eighteenth street station of the subway sanford had lastingly impressed una by his devotion to the job eager and faithful as the glory that a young subaltern takes in his regiment she agreed with him that the dour j j todd was crazy in his theories about profitsharing and selling stocks to employees while she was with young sanford una found herself concurring that the bosses know so much better about all those thingsgee whiz theyve had so much more experiencebesides you cant expect them to give away all their profits to please these walking delegates or a cape cod farmer like todd all these theories dont do a fellow any good what he wants is to stick on a job and make good  though in keeping with the general schoolboyishness of the institution the studyroom supervisors tried to prevent conversation there was always a current of whispering and low talk and sam weintraub gave una daily reports of the tennis the dances the dinners at the prospect athletic club her evident awe of his urban amusements pleased him he told his former idol the slim blond giggler that she was altogether too fresh for a bronx kid and he basked in unas admiration through him she had a revelation of the new york in which people actually were born which they took casually as she did panama  she tried consciously to become a real newyorker herself after lunchher homemade lunch of sandwiches and an applewhich she ate in the buzzing gossiping studyhall at noonhour she explored the city sometimes sanford hunt begged to go with her once todd stalked along and embarrassed her by being indignant over an antisocialist orator in madison square once on fifth avenue she met sam weintraub and he nonchalantly pointed out in a passing motor a man whom he declared to be john d rockefeller  even at lunchhour una could not come to much understanding with the girls of the commercial college they seemed alternately thirdrate stenographers and very haughty urbanites who knew all about fellows and shows and glad rags except for goodnatured squarerigged miss moynihan and the oldish anxious industrious miss ingalls who like una came from a small town and the adorably pretty little miss moore whom you couldnt help loving una saw the girls of the school only in a mass  it was sam weintraub j j todd and sanford hunt whom una watched and liked and of whom she thought when the school authorities pompously invited them all to a dance early in november   § 3  the excitement the giggles the discussions of girdles and slippers and hairwaving and men which filled the studyhall at noon and the coatroom at closing hour was like midnight silence compared with the tumult in unas breast when she tried to make herself believe that either her blue satin evening dress or her whiteandpink frock of novelty crêpe was attractive enough for the occasion the crêpe was the older but she had worn the blue satin so much that now the crêpe suddenly seemed the newer the less soiled after discussions with her mother which involved much holding up of the crêpe and the tracing of imaginary diagrams with a forefinger she decided to put a new velvet girdle and new sleeve ruffles on the crêpe and then she said it will have to do  very different is the dressing of the girl who isnt quite pretty nor at all rich from the luxurious joy which the beautiful woman takes in her new toilettes instead of the faint shivery wonder as to whether men will realize how exquisitely the line of a new bodice accentuates the molding of her neck the unpretty girl hopes that no one will observe how unevenly her dress hangs how pointed and red and rough are her elbows how clumsily waved her hair i dont think anybody will notice she sighs and is contemptuously conscious of her own stolid straight healthy waist while her mother flutters about and pretends to believe that she is curved like a houri like helen of troy like isolde at eighteen  una was touched by her mothers sincere eagerness in trying to make her pretty poor little mother it had been hard on her to sit alone all day in a city flat with no panama neighbors to drop in on her no meeting of the panama study club and with una bringing home her books to work aloof all evening  the day before the dance j j todd dourly asked her if he might call for her and take her home una accepted hesitatingly as she did so she unconsciously glanced at the decorative sam weintraub who was rocking on his toes and flirting with miss moore the kittenish belle of the school  she must have worried for fifteen minutes over the question of whether she was going to wear a hat or a scarf trying to remember the best social precedents of panama as laid down by mrs dr smith trying to recall new york women as she had once or twice seen them in the evening on broadway finally she jerked a paleblue chiffon scarf over her mildly pretty hair pulled on her new long white kid gloves noted miserably that the gloves did not quite cover her pebbly elbows and snapped at her fussing mother oh it doesnt matter im a perfect sight anyway so whats the use of worrying  her mother looked so hurt and bewildered that una pulled her down into a chair and kneeling on the floor with her arms about her crooned oh im just nervous mumsie dear working so hard and all ill have the best time now youve made me so pretty for the dance clasped thus an intense brooding affection holding them and seeming to fill the shabby sittingroom they waited for the coming of her tristan her chevalier the flatfooted j j todd  they heard todd shamble along the hall they wriggled with concealed laughter and held each other tighter when he stopped at the door of the flat and blew his nervous nose in a tremendous blast more vulgar possibly than the trumpetry which heralded the arrival of lancelot at a château but on the whole quite as effective  she set out with him observing his pitiful homecleaned black sacksuit and homeshined expansive black boots and readymade tie while he talked easily and was merely rude about dances and clothes and the weather  in the studyhall which had been cleared of all seats except for a fringe along the walls and was unevenly hung with school flags and patriotic bunting una found the emptyheaded timeservers the little folk to whom she was so superior in the classroom brooklyn jews used to sidestreet dancehalls bronx girls who went to the bartenders ball and the dinner and grand ball of the clamchowder twenty they laughed and talked and dancedall three at oncewith an ease which dismayed her  to una golden of panama the waltz and the twostep were solemn affairs she could make her feet go in a onetwothree triangle with approximate accuracy if she didnt take any liberties with them she was relieved to find that todd danced with a heavy accuracy which kept her from stumbling but their performance was solemn and joyless while by her skipped sam weintraub in evening clothes with black velvet collar and cuffs swinging and making fantastic dips with the lovely miss moore who cuddled into his arms and swayed to his swing  lets cut out the next said todd and she consented though sanford hunt came boyishly blushingly up to ask her for a dance she was intensely aware that she was a wallflower in a row with the anxious miss ingalls and the elderly frump miss fisle sam weintraub seemed to avoid her and though she tried to persuade herself that his greasy curly red hair and his pride of evening clothes and sharp face were blatantly jewish she knew that she admired his atmosphere of gorgeousness and was in despair at being shut out of it she even feared that sanford hunt hadnt really wanted to dance with her and she wilfully ignored his frequent glances of friendliness and his efforts to introduce her and his lady friend she was silent and hard while poor todd trying not to be a radical and lecture on singletax or municipal ownership attempted to be airy about the theater which meant the one show he had seen since he had come to new york  from vague dissatisfaction she drifted into an active resentment at being shut out of the world of pretty things of clinging gowns and graceful movement and fragrant rooms while todd was taking her home she was saying to herself over and over nope its just as bad as parties at panama never really enjoyed em im out of it ill stick to my work oh drat it   § 4  blindly in a daily growing faith in her commercial future she shut out the awkward gaieties of the school ignored todd and sanford hunt and sam weintraub made no effort to cultivate the adorable miss moores rather flattering friendliness for her she was like a girl grind in a coeducational college who determines to head the class and to that devotes all of a sexless energy  only una was not sexless though she hadnt the dancinggirls oblivious delight in pleasure though her energetic common sense and willingness to serve had turned into a durable plodding una was alive normal desirous of love as the flowerfaced girl grind of the college so often is not to the vast confusion of numerous ardent young gentlemen  she could not long forbid herself an interest in sanford hunt and sam weintraub she even idealized todd as a humble hero a selfmade and honest man which he was though una considered herself highly charitable to him  sweet to hereven when he told her that he was engaged even when it was evident that he regarded her as an older sister or as a very young and understanding auntwas sanford hunts liking why do you like meif you do she demanded one lunchhour when he had brought her a bar of milkchocolate  oh i dunno youre so darn honest and you got so much more sense than this bunch of bronx totties gee theyll make bum stenogs i know ive worked in an office theyll keep their gum and a lookingglass in the upper righthand drawer of their typewriter desks and the old man will call them down eleventy times a day and theyll marry the shippingclerk first time he sneaks out from behind a box but you got sense and somehowgee i never know how to express thingsglad im taking this english composition stuffoh you just seem to understand a guy i never liked that yid weintraub till you made me see how darn clever and nice he really is even if he does wear spats  sanford told her often that he wished she was going to come over to the lowry paint company to work when she finished he had entered the college before her he would be through somewhat earlier he was going back to the paint company and would try to find an opening for her there he wanted her to meet mr julius edward schwirtz the manhattan salesman of the company  when mr schwirtz was in that part of town interviewing the departmentstore buyers he called up sanford hunt and sanford insisted that she come out to lunch with schwirtz and himself and his girl she went shyly  sanfords sweetheart proved to be as clean and sweet as himself but mute smiling instead of speaking inclined to admire every one without much discrimination sanford was very proud very eager as host and his boyish admiration of all his guests gave a certain charm to the corner of the crude german sausageandschnitzel restaurant where they lunched una worked at making the party as successful as possible and was cordial to mr julius edward schwirtz the paint salesman  mr schwirtz was forty or fortyone a redfaced clippedmustached derbyhatted average citizen he was ungrammatical and jocose he panted a good deal and gurgled his soup his nails were raggededged his stupid brown tie uneven and there were signs of a growing grossness and fatty unwieldiness about his neck his shoulders his waist but he was affable he quietly helped sanford in ordering lunch to the great economy of embarrassment he was smilingly ready to explain to una how a paint company office was run what chances there were for a girl he seemed to know his business he didnt gossip and his heavy coarselipped smile was almost sweet when he said to una makes a hardcased old widower like me pretty lonely to see this nice kid and girly here eh wish i had some children like them myself  he wasnt vastly different from henry carson this mr schwirtz but he had a mechanical city smartness in his manner and a jocular energy which the stringynecked henry quite lacked  because she liked to be with sanford hunt hoped to get from mr julius edward schwirtz still more of the feeling of how actual business men do business she hoped for another lunch  but a crisis unexpected and alarming came to interrupt her happy progress to a knowledge of herself and men   § 5  the goldens had owned no property in panama pennsylvania they had rented their house captain lew golden who was so urgent in advising others to purchase real estatewith a small justifiable commission to himselfhad never quite found time to decide on his own realestate investments when they had come to new york una and her mother had given up the house and sold the heavier furniture the big beds the stove the rest of the furniture they had brought to the city and installed in a little flat way up on 148th street  her mother was una declared so absolutely the lady that it was a crying shame to think of her immured here in their elevatorless tenement this new clean barren building of yellow brick its face broken out with fireescapes it had narrow halls stairs of slate treads and iron rails and cheap wooden doorways which had begun to warp the minute the structure was finishedand sold the brightgreen burlap wallcovering in the hallways had faded in less than a year to the color of dry grass the janitor grew tired every now and then he had been markedly diligent at first but he was already giving up the task of keeping the building clean it was one of and typical of a mile of yellow brick tenements it was named after an african orchid of great loveliness and it was filled with clerks motormen probationer policemen and enormously prolific women in dressingsacques  the goldens had three rooms and bath a small linoleous gasstove kitchen a bedroom with standing wardrobe iron bed and just one graceful piece of furnitureunas dressingtable a room pervasively feminine in its scent and in the little piles of lingerie which mrs golden affected more not less as she grew older the livingroom with stiff brown woolen brocade chairs transplanted from their panama home a red plush sofa two large oakframed biblical picturesthe weddingfeast at cana and solomon in his temple this livingroom had never been changed since the day of their moving in una repeatedly coveted the german colorprints she saw in shop windows but she had to economize  she planned that when she should succeed they would have such an apartment of white enamel and glass doors and mahogany as she saw described in the womens magazines she realized mentally that her mother must be lonely in the long hours of waiting for her return but she who was busy all day could never feel emotionally how great was that loneliness and she expected her mother to be satisfied with the future  quite suddenly a couple of weeks after the dance when they were talking about the looming topicwhat kind of work una would be able to get when she should have completed schoolher mother fell violently aweeping sobbed oh una baby i want to go home im so lonely herejust nobody but you and the sessionses cant we go back to panama you dont seem to really know what you are going to do  why mother  una loved her mother yet she felt a grim disgust rather than pity just when she had been working so hard and for her mother as much as for herself she stalked over to the table severely rearranged the magazines slammed down a newspaper and turned angrily why cant you see i cant give up my work now  couldnt you get something to do in panama dearie  you know perfectly well that i tried  but maybe now with your college course and alleven if it took a little longer to get something there wed be right among the folks we know  mother cant you understand that we have only a little over three hundred dollars now if we moved again and everything we wouldnt have two hundred dollars to live on havent you any sense of finances  you must not talk to me that way my daughter  a slim fine figure of hurtdignity mrs golden left the room lay down in the bedroom her face away from the door where una stood in perplexity una ran to her kissed her shoulder begged for forgiveness her mother patted her cheek and sobbed oh it doesnt matter in a tone so forlorn and lonely that it did matter terribly the sadness of it tortured una while she was realizing that her mother had lost all practical comprehension of the details of life was become a child trusting everything to her daughter yet retaining a power of suffering such as no child can know  it had been easy to bring her mother here to start a career both of them had preconceived a life of gaiety and beauty of charming people and pictures and concerts but all those graces were behind a dusty wall of shorthand and typewriting unas struggle in coming to new york had just begun  gently arbitrary dearer than ever to una in her helpless longing for kindly neighbors and the familiar places mrs golden went on hoping that she could persuade una to go back to panama she never seemed to realize that their capital wasnt increasing as time passed sometimes impatient at her obtuseness sometimes passionate with comprehending tenderness una devoted herself to her and mr schwirtz and sanford hunt and sam weintraub and todd faded she treasured her mothers happiness at their christmas dinner with the sessionses she encouraged the sessionses to come up to the flat as often as they could and she lulled her mother to a tolerable calm boredom before it was convenient to think of men again her schoolwork was over  the commercial college had a graduation once a month on january 15 1906 una finished her course regretfully said goodby to sam weintraub and to sanford hunt who had graduated in middecember but had come back for class commencement and at the last moment she hesitated so long over j j todds hints about calling some day that he was discouraged and turned away una glanced about the studyhallthe first place where she had ever been taken seriously as a workerand marched off to her first battle in the war of business     chapter iv   sanford hunt telephoned to una that he and mr julius edward schwirtzwhom he called eddiehad done their best to find an opening for her in the office of the lowry paint company but that there was no chance  the commercial college gave her the names of several possible employers but they all wanted approximate perfection at approximately nothing a week after ten days of panicstricken waiting at the employment office of a typewriter company and answering want advertisements the typewriter people sent her to the office of the motor and gas gazette a weekly magazine for the trade in this atmosphere of the literature of lubricating oil and drop forgings and body enamels as an eightdollaraweek copyist una first beheld the drama and romance of the office world   § 2  there is plenty of romance in business fine large meaningless general terms like romance and business can always be related they take the place of thinking and are highly useful to optimists and lecturers  but in the world of business there is a bewildered new muse of romance who is clad not in silvery tissue of dreams but in a neat blue suit that wont grow too shiny under the sleeves  adventure now with una in the world of business of offices and jobs and tired ordinary people who know such reality of romance as your masquerading earl your shoddy broadway actress or your rosily amorous dairymaid could never imagine the youths of poetry and of the modern motorcar fiction make a long diversion of love while the sleezycoated officeman who surprises a look of humanness in the weary eyes of the officewoman knows that he must compress all the wonder of madness into five minutes because the chief is prowling about glancing meaningly at the little signs that declare your time is your employers money dont steal it  a world is this whose noblest vista is composed of desks and typewriters filingcases and insurance calendars telephones and the bald heads of men who believe dreams to be idiotic here no galleon breasts the skyline no explorer in evening clothes makes love to an heiress here ride no rollicking cowboys nor heroes of the great european war it is a world whose crises you cannot comprehend unless you have learned that the difference between a 2a pencil and a 2b pencil is at least equal to the contrast between london and tibet unless you understand why a normally selfcontrolled young woman may have a week of tragic discomfort because she is using a billingmachine instead of her ordinary correspondence typewriter the shifting of the watercooler from the front office to the packingroom may be an epochal event to a copyist who apparently has no human existence beyond bending over a clacking typewriter who seems to have no home no family no loves in whom all pride and wonder of life and all transforming drama seem to be satisfied by the possession of a new vnecked blouse the moving of the watercooler may mean that she must now pass the sentinel officemanager that therefore she no longer dares break the incredible monotony by expeditions to get glasses of water as a consequence she gives up the office and marries unhappily  a vast competent largely useless cosmos of offices it spends much energy in causing advertisements of beer and chewinggum and union suits and potcleansers to spread over the whole landscape it marches out ponderous battalions to sell a brass pin it evokes shoes that are uncomfortable hideous and perishable and touchingly hopes that all women will aid the cause of good business by wearing them it turns noble valleys into fields for pickles it compels men whom it has never seen to toil in distant factories and produce useless wares which are never actually brought into the office but which it nevertheless sells to the heathen in the solomon islands in exchange for commodities whose very names it does not know and in order to perform this miracle of transmutation it keeps stenographers so busy that they change from dewy girls into tightlipped spinsters before they discover life  the reason for it all nobody who is actually engaged in it can tell you except the bosses who believe that these sacred rites of composing dull letters and solemnly filing them away are observed in order that they may buy the large automobiles in which they do not have time to take the air efficiency of production they have learned efficiency of life they still consider an effeminate hobby  an unreasonable world sacrificing birdsong and tranquil dusk and high golden noons to selling junkyet it rules us and life lives there the office is filled with thrills of love and distrust and ambition each alley between desks quivers with secret romance as ceaselessly as a battletrench or a lane in normandy   § 3  unas first view of the motor and gas gazette was of an overwhelming mass of desks and files and books and a confusing spying crowd of strange people among whom the only safe familiar persons were miss moynihan the goodnatured solid block of girl whom she had known at the commercial college and mr s herbert ross the advertisingmanager who had hired her mr ross was a poet of business a squat nervous little man whose hair was cut in a dutch bang straight across his forehead and who always wore a black bow tie and semiclerical black clothes he had eyed una amusedly asked her what was her reaction to green and crimson posters and given her a little book by himself r u a timeclock mr man which in large and tremendously black type related two stories about the youth of carnegie and strongly advocated industry correspondence schools and expensive advertising when una entered the office as a copyist mr s herbert ross turned her over to the officemanager and thereafter ignored her but whenever she saw him in pompous conference with editors and advertisers she felt proudly that she knew him  the commercial college had trained her to work with a number of people as she was now to do in the office but in the seriousness and savage continuity of its toil the office was very different there was no letup she couldnt shirk for a day or two as she had done at the commercial college it was not so much that she was afraid of losing her job as that she came to see herself as part of a chain the others beyond were waiting for her she mustnt hold them up that was her first impression of the office system that and the insignificance of herself in the presence of the officehierarchymanager above manager and the mysterious owner beyond all she was alone once she transgressed they would crush her they had no personal interest in her none of them except her classmate miss moynihan who smiled at her and went out to lunch with her  they two did not dare to sit over parcels of lunch with the curious other girls before fifteencent lunches of baked apples greasy napoleons and cups of coffee at a cheap restaurant miss moynihan and she talked about the officemanager the editors the strain of copying all day and they united in lyric hatred of the lieutenant of the girls a satiric young woman who was a wonderful hater una had regarded miss moynihan as thick and stupid but not when she had thought of falling in love with charlie martindale at a dance at panama not in her most fervid hours of comforting her mother had she been so closely in sympathy with any human being as she was with miss moynihan when they went over and over the problems of office politics office favorites office rules office customs  the customs were simple certain hours for arrival for lunch for leaving womens retiringroom embarrassedly discovered to be on the right behind the big safe watercooler in the center of the stenographers room but the office prejudices the taboos could not be guessed they offered you every possible chance of queering yourself miss moynihan on her very first day discovered perspiringly that you must never mention the gazettes rival the internal combustion news the gazettes attitude was that the news did not existexcept when the gazette wanted the plate of an advertisement which the news was to forward you mustnt chew gum in the office you were to ask favors of the lieutenant not of the officemanager and you mustnt be friendly with mr bush of the circulation department nor with miss caldwell the filingclerk why they were taboo una never knew it was an office convention they seemed pleasant and proper people enough  she was initiated into the science of office supplies in the commercial college the authorities had provided stenographers notebooks and pencils and the representatives of typewriter companies had given lectures on cleaning and oiling typewriters putting in new ribbons adjusting tensionwheels but una had not realized how many tools she had to know  desks filingcabinets mimeographs addingmachines card indexes desk calendars telephoneextensions adjustable desklights wire correspondencebaskets erasers carbon paper typebrushes dustrags wastebaskets pencils hard and soft black and blue and red pens penpoints backingsheets notebooks paperclips mucilage paste stationery the halfdozen sorts of envelopes and letterheads  tools were these as important in her trade as the masthead and black flag the cutlasses and crimson sashes the gold doubloons and damsels fair of pirate fiction or the cheese and cream old horses and slumberous lanes of rustic comedy as important and perhaps to be deemed as romantic some day witness the rhapsodic advertisements of filingcabinets that are built like battleships of carbonpaper that is magicinked and satinsmooth  not as priest or soldier or judge does youth seek honor today but as a man of offices the business subaltern charming and gallant as the junglegallopers of kipling drills files not of troops but of correspondence the artist plays the keys not of pianos but of typewriters desks not decks courts of officebuildings not of palacesthese are the stuff of our latterday drama not through wolfhaunted forests nor purple cañons but through tiled hallways and elevators move our heroes of today  and our heroine is important not because she is an amazon or a ramona but because she is representative of some millions of women in business and because in a vague but undiscouraged way she keeps on inquiring what women in business can do to make human their existence of loveless routine   § 4  una spent much of her time in copying over and overa hundred times two hundred timesformletters soliciting advertising letters too personal in appearance to be multigraphed she had lists of manufacturers of motorcar accessories of makers of lubricating oils of distributors of ballbearings and speedometers and springs and carburetors and compositions for waterproofing automobile tops  sometimes she was requisitioned by the editorial department to copy in form legible for the printer the rough items sent in by outsiders for publication in the gazette una like most people of panama had believed that there was something artistic about the office of any publication one would see editorswonderful men like grand dukes prone to lunch with the president but there was nothing artistic about the editorial office of the gazetteseveral young men in shirtsleeves and green celluloid eyeshades very slangy and pipesmelly and an older man with unpressed trousers and ragged mustache nor was there anything literary in the things that una copied for the editorial department just painfully handwritten accounts of the meeting of the southeastern iowa autodealers association or boasts about the increased sales of roadeater tires a page originally smartly typed but cut and marked up by the editors  lists and letters and items over and over sitting at her typewriter till her shoulderblades ached and she had to shut her eyes to the blur of the keys the racket of office noises all day the threeoclock hour when she felt that she simply could not endure the mill till five oclock no interest in anything she wrote then the blessed hour of release the stretching of cramped legs and the blind creeping to the subway the crush in the train and home to comfort the mother who had been lonely all day  such was unas routine in these early months of 1906 after the novelty of the first week it was all rigidly the same except that distinct personalities began to emerge from the mass  especially the personality of walter babson   § 5  out of the mist of strange faces blurred hordes of people who swaggered up the office aisle so knowingly and grinned at her when she asked questions individualities began to take form  miss moynihan the jewish stenographer with the laughing lips and hot eyes the four superior older girls in a corner the still more superior girl lieutenant and the officemanager who was the least superior of all the telephonegirl the officeboys mr s herbert ross and his assistant the managing editor a motor magnate whose connection was mysterious the owner a courteous silent glancing man who was reported to be hard and stingy  other people still remained unidentifiable to her but the office appeared smaller and less formidable in a month out of each nine square feet of floor space in the office a novel might have been made the tale of the managing editors neurotic wife the tragedy of chubby hubbard the stupid young editor who had been a college football star then an automobile racer then a failure and indeed there was a whole novel a story told and retold in the girls gossip about each of the men before whom they were so demure but it was walter babson whom the girls most discussed and in whom una found the most interest  on her first day in the office she had been startled by an astounding young man who had come flying past her desk with his coat off his figured waistcoat half open his red fourinhand tie askew under a rolling soft collar he had dashed up to the officemanager and demanded say say nat got that kokomobile description copied for me yet heh gawd youre slow got a cigarette he went off puffing out cigarette smoke shaking his head and audibly muttering slow bunch werry he seemed to be of unas own age or perhaps a year oldera slender young man with hornrimmed eyeglasses curly black hair and a trickle of black mustache his sleeves were rolled up to his elbow and una had a secret shamed shivering thrill in the contrast of the deadwhite skin of his thin forearms with the long thick soft black hairs matted over them they seemed at once feminine and acidly male  crazy idiot she observed apparently describing herself and the nervous young man together but she knew that she wanted to see him again  she discovered that he was prone to such violent appearances that his name was walter babson that he was one of the three desk editors under the managing editor that the stenographers and officeboys alternately disapproved of him because he went on sprees and borrowed money from anybody in sight and adored him because he was democratically frank with them he was at once a hero clown prodigal son and preacher of honesty it was variously said that he was a socialist an anarchist and a believer in an american monarchy which he was reported as declaring would give some color to this flatfaced province of a country it was related that he had been fresh even to the owner and had escaped discharge only by being the quickest worker in the office the best handy man at turning motor statistics into lively newsstories una saw that he liked to stand about bawling to the quizzical s herbert ross that this is a hell of a shop to work inrotten pay and no esprit de corps id quit and freelance if i could break in with fiction but a rotten bunch of logrollers have got the inside track with all the magazines and bookpublishers  ever try to write any fiction una once heard s herbert retort  no but lord any fool could write better stuff than they publish its all a freezeout game editors just accept stuff by their friends  in one week una heard walter babson make approximately the same assertions to three different men and to whoever in the open office might care to listen and profit thereby then apparently he ceased to hear the call of literature and he snorted at s herbert rosss stodgy assistant that he was a wageslave and a fool not to form a clerks union in a week or two he was literary again he dashed down to the officemanager poked a sheet of copypaper at him and yelped say nat read that and tell me just what you think of it im going to put some literary flavor into the gasbag even if it does explode it looksee ive taken a boost for the kells karburetorrotten lying boost it is tooand turned it into this running verse read it like prose pleasant and easy to digest especially beneficial to children and s herbert souse sherbert souse i mean he rapidly read an amazing lyric beginning motorists you hadnt better monkey with the carburetor all the racers all the swells have equipped their cars with kells we are privileged to announce what will give the trade a jounce that the floats have been improved like all motorists would have loved  he broke off and shouted punk last line but ill fix it up say thatll get em all going eh say i bet the kells people use it in billboard ads all over the country and maybe sign my name ads why say it takes a literary guy to write ads not a fatheaded commercialist like s charlie hoss  two days later una heard babson come out and lament that the managing editor didnt like his masterpiece and was going to use the kells karburetor kompanys original writeup thats what you get when you try to give the gasbag some literary flavordont appreciate it  she would rather have despised him except that he stopped by the officeboys bench to pull their hair and tell them to read english dictionaries and when miss moynihan looked dejected babson demanded of her whats trouble girlie anybody i can lick for you glad to fire the owner or anything havent met you yet but my name is roosevelt and im the new janitor with a hundred other chuckling idiocies till miss moynihan was happy again una warmed to his friendliness like that of a tailwagging little yellow pup  and always she craved the touch of his dark blunt nervous hands whenever he lighted a cigarette she was startled by his masculine way of putting out the match and jerking it away from him in one abrupt motion she had never studied male mannerisms before to miss golden of panama men had always been the boys  all this time walter babson had never spoken to her     chapter v   the officemanager came casually up to unas desk and said you havent taken any dictation yet have you  no but with urgent eagerness id likeim quite fast in stenography  well mr babson in the editorial department wants to give some dictation and you might try  una was so excited that she called herself a silly little fool she seized her untouched notebook her pencils sharpened like lances and tried to appear a very mouse of modesty as she marched down the office to take her first real dictation to begin her triumphant career and to have walter babson the beloved fool speak to her  it was a cold shock to have to stand waiting behind babson while he rummaged in his rolltop desk and apparently tried to pull out his hair he looked back at her and blurted oh you miss golden they said youd take some dictation chase those blueprints off that chair and sit down be ready in a sec  while she sat on the edge of the chair babson yanked out drawers plunged his wriggling hands into folders thrashed through a pile of papers and letters that overflowed a wire basket and even hauled a dictionary down from the top of the desk and hopefully peered inside the front cover all the time he kept up comment at which una smiled doubtfully not quite sure whether it was meant for her or not  now what the doggone doggonishness did i ever do with those doggone notes anyway i ask you in the here they nope  at last he found inside a book on motor fuels the wad of copypaper on which he had scrawled notes with a broad soft pencil and he began to dictate a short article on aircooling una was terrified lest she be unable to keep up but she had read recent numbers of the gazette thoroughly she had practised the symbols for motor technologies and she was not troubled by being watched indeed babson seemed to have enough to do in keeping his restless spirit from performing the dismaying feat of leaping straight out of his body he leaned back in his revolving deskchair with a complaining squawk from the spring he closed his eyes put his fingers together piously then seized the chairarms and held them while he cocked one eye open and squinted at a large alarmclock on the desk he sighed profoundly bent forward gazed at his ankle and reached forward to scratch it all this time he was dictating now rapidly now gurgling and grunting while he paused to find a word  dont be so nervous una wanted to scream at him and she wanted to add you didnt ask my permission when he absently fumbled in a cigarettebox  she didnt like walter babson after all  but he stopped after a rhapsody on the divine merits of an aircooling system clawed his billowing black hair and sighed sounds improbable dont it must be true though its going to appear in the gazette and thats the motordealers bible if you dont believe it read the blurbs we publish about ourselves then he solemnly winked at her and went on dictating  when he had finished he demanded ever take any dictation in this office before  no sir  ever take any motor dictation at all  no sir  then youd better read that back to me your immejit bossthe officemanageris all right but the secretary of the company is always pussyfooting around and if youre ever having any trouble with your stuff when old plushears is in sight keep on typing fast no matter what you put down now read me the dope  it was approximately correct he nodded and good work little girl he said youll get along all right you get my dictation better than that agitated antelope miss harman does right now thats all   § 2  so far as anything connected with walter babson could be regular una became his regular stenographer besides keeping up her copying he was always rushing out apologizing for troubling her sitting on the edge of her desk dictating a short letter and advising her to try his latest brand of health food which this spring was bran biscuitsprobably combined with highballs and too much coffee the other stenographers winked at him and he teased them about their coiffures and imaginary sweethearts for three days the womens coatroom boiled with giggles over babsons declaration that miss macthrostle was engaged to a burglar and was taking a correspondence course in engraving in order to decorate her poor dear husbands tools with birds and poetic mottoes  babson was less jocular with una than with the bouncing girls who were natives of harlem but he smiled at her as though they were understanding friends and once he said but quietly rather respectfully you have nice hairsoft she lay awake to croon that to herself though she denied that she was in love with this eccentric waster  always babson kept up his ejaculations and fidgeting he often accused himself of shiftlessness and begged her to make sure that he dictated certain matter before he escaped for the evening come in and bother the life out of me come in every halfhour he would say when she did come in he would crow and chuckle nope i refuse to be tempted yet i am a busy man but maybe ill give you those verbal jewels of great price on your next visitation oh thou in the vocativesome latin scholar eh keep it up kid good work maybe youll keep me from being fired  usually he gave her the dictation before he went but not always and once he disappeared for four dayson a drunk everybody said in excited office gossip  during babsons desertion the managing editor called una in and demanded did mr babson give you some copy about the manning wind shield no will you take a look in his desk for his notes about it  while una was fumbling for the notes she did not expect to find she went through all the agony of the little shawled foreign wife for the husband who has been arrested  ive got to help you she said to his desk to his bag of bull durham to his alarmclockeven to a rather shocking collection of pictures of chorusgirls and diaphanouslyclad dancers which was pasted inside the double drawer on the right side of the desk in her great surge of emotion she noticed these posturing hussies far less than she did a little volume of rosetti or the overshoes whose worn toes suddenly revealed to her that walter babson the editor was not richwas not perhaps so very much better paid than herself  she did not find the notes she had to go to the managing editor trembling all her good little heart wild with pain the editors brows made a v at her report and he grunted well  for two days till walter babson returned she never failed to look up when the outer door of the office opened  she found herself immensely interested in trying to discover from her low plane as copyist just what sort of a position walter babson occupied up among the select souls nor was it very difficult the editors stenographer may not appreciate all the subtleties of his wit and the refinements of his manner may leave her cold but she does hear things she hears the big chiefs complaints  una discovered that the owner and the managing editor did not regard walter babson as a permanent prop of the institution that they would keep him at his present salary of twentyfive dollars a week only till some one happened in who would do the same work for less money his prose was clever but irregular he wasnt always to be depended upon for grammar in everything he was unstable yet the owners secretary reported the owner as saying that some day if babson married the right woman he would settle down and make good  una did not dare to make private reservations regarding what the right woman ought to mean in this case but she burned at the thought of walter babsons marrying and for an instant she saw quite clearly the film of soft dark hair that grew just below his sharp cheekbone but she forgot the sweetness of the vision in scorn of herself for even thinking of marriage with a weakling scorn of herself for aspiring to marry a man who regarded her as only a dull stenographer and a maternal anxiety over him that was untouched by passion  babson returned to the office immaculate a thin fiery soul but he was closeted with the secretary of the company for an hour and when he came out his step was slow he called for una and dictated articles in a quiet voice with no jesting his hand was unsteady he smoked cigarettes constantly and his eye was an unwholesome yellow  she said to him suddenly a few days later mr babson id be glad if i could take care of any papers or anything for you  thanks you might stick these chassis sketches away some place right now  so she was given the chance to keep his desk straight he turned to her for everything  he said to her abruptly one dreary late afternoon of april when she felt immensely languid and unambitious youre going to succeedunless you marry some dub but theres one rule for successmind you i dont follow it myself i cant but its a grand old hunch if you want to get on always be ready to occupy the job just ahead of you onlywhat the devil is the job just ahead of a stenog ive been thinking of you and wondering what is it  honestly mr babson i dont know here anyway unless its lieutenant of the girls  welloh thats just mifflebusiness that kind of a job well youd better learn to express yourself anyway some time you women folks will come into your own with both feet whenever you get the chance take my notes and try to write a better spiel from them than i do that wont be hard i guess  i dont know why you are so modest mr babson every girl in the office thinks you write better than any of the other editors  yuhbut they dont know they think that just because i chuck em under the chin i cant do this technical stuff oh lord what an evening itll be i suppose ill go to a show nice lonely city what you come from here  from pennsylvania  got any folks  my mother is here with me  thats nice ill take her and you to some bum twobit vaudeville show some night if youd like got to show my gratitude to you for standing my general slovenliness lord nice eveningdine at a rôtisserie with a newspaper for companion wellg night and g luck  una surprised her mother when they were vivisecting the weather after dinner by suddenly crying all over the sofa cushions  she knew all of walter babsons life from those two or three sentences of his   § 3  françois villons america has aplenty an astonishing number of americans with the literary itch do contrive to make a living out of that affliction they write motionpicture scenarios and fiction for the magazines that still regard detective stories as the zenith of original art they gather in womanscented flats to discuss sex or in hardvoiced groups to play poker they seem to find in the creation of literature very little besides a way of evading regular office hours below this stratum of people so successful that one sometimes sees their names in print is the yearning band of young men who want to write just to writenot to write anything in particular not to express any definite thought but to be literary to be bohemian to dance with slim young authoresses of easy morals and be jolly dogs and free souls some of them are dramatists with unacted dramas some of them do free verse which is just as free as the productions of regular licensed poets some of them do short storiesstriking rather biological very destructive of conventions some of them are ever so handy at all forms they are perennial candidates for any job as bookreviewer dramatic critic or manuscriptreader since they have the naïve belief that these occupations require neither toil nor training and enable one to write on the side meanwhile they make their livings as subeditors on trade journals as charityworkers or as assistants to illiterate literary agents  to this slum of literature walter babson belonged he felt that he was an author though none of his poetry had ever been accepted and though he had never got beyond the first chapter of any of his novels nor the first act of any of his plays which concerned authors who roughly resembled walter babson  he was distinguished from his fellows by the fact that each year he grew more aware that he hadnt even a dim candle of talent that he was illplanned and unpurposed that he would have to settle down to the ordinary gray limbo of jobs and officesas soon as he could get control of his chaotic desires literally he hated himself at times hated his own egotism his treacherous appetite for drink and women and sloth his imitative attempts at literature but no one knew how bitterly he despised himself in lonely walks in the rain in savage pacing about his furnished room to others he seemed vigorously conceited cocksure noisily ready to blame the world for his own failures  walter babson was born in kansas his father was a farmer and horsedoctor a heavy drinker an eccentric who joined every radical political movement in a country school just such a one as una had taught then in high school in a nearby town walter had won all the prizes for essays and debating and had learned a good deal about shakespeare and cæsar and george washington also he had learned a good deal about drinking beer smoking manfully and tempting the giggling girls who hung about the deepot he ran away from high school and in the most glorious years of his life worked his way down the mississippi and up the rio grande up to alaska and down to costa rica a butt and jester for hoboes sailors longshoremen miners cowpunchers lunchroom owners and proprietors of small newspapers he learned to stick type and run a press he returned to kansas and worked on a country newspaper studying poetry and collegeentrance requirements in the evening he had at this time the not entirely novel idea that he ought to be able to make a lot of good fiction out of all his experiences actually he had no experiences because he had no instinct for beauty the proof is that he read quite solemnly and reverently a vile little periodical for wouldbe authors which reduced authorship to a way of earning ones living by supplying editors with cheap but ingenious items to fill space it put literature on a level with keeping a fiveandtencent store but walter conned its pompous trade journal discussions as to whether the name and address of the author should be typed on the left or the right side of the first page of a manuscript its lively little symposia by such successful marketgardeners of literature as mamie stuyvesant blupp and bill brown and dr j f fitzneff on the inspiring subject of whether it paid better to do filler verse for cheap magazines or long verse for the big magazines at the end this almost madly idealistic journal gave a list of wants of editors the editor of lingerie and laughter wanted short snappy stuff with a kick in it especially good yarns about models grisettes etc wanderlust was in the market for stories with a punch that appealed to every redblooded american nothing about psychology problems europe or love wanted the plymouth rock fancier announced that it could use a good lively rural poem every week must be clean and original  pathos there was in all of this the infinitely little men and women daring to buy and sell short snappy stuff in this somber and terribly beautiful world of balzac and wells and turgenieff and pathos there was in that wasted year when walter babson sought to climb from the gossiping little prairie town to the grandeur of great capitals by learning to be an efficient manufacturer of good lively rural poems he neglected even his collegeentrance books the ruskin whose clots of gilt might have trained him to look for real gold and the stilted burke who might have given him a vision of empires and races and social destinies and for his pathetic treachery he wasnt even rewarded his clubfooted verses were always returned with printed rejection slips  when at last he barely slid into jonathan edwards college iowa walter was already becoming discouraged already getting the habit of blaming the gods capitalists editors his father the owner of the country newspaper on which he had been working for everything that went wrong he yammered destructive theories which would have been as obnoxious to a genuine fighting revolutionist as they were sacrilegious to his hardfisted earnest rustic classmates in jonathan edwards for walter was not protesting against social injustice the slavery of rubbergatherers in the putumayo and of sweatshopworkers in new york did not exist for him he was protesting because at the age of twenty his name was not appearing in large flattering capitals on the covers of magazines  yet he was rather amusing he helped plodding classmates with their assignments and he was an active participant in all worthy movements to raise hellas they admirably described it by the end of his freshman year he had given up all attempts to be a poet and to extract nourishment from the college classes which were as hard and unpalatable as dried codfish he got drunk he vented his energy in noisy meetings with itinerant filles de joie who were as provincial and rustic as bewildered and unfortunate as the wild country boys who in them found their only outlet for youths madness walter was abruptly expelled from college by the one man in the college whom he respectedthe saintly president who had dreams of a new harvard on the prairies  so walter babson found himself at twentyone an outcast he declaimedthough no one would believe himthat all the gentle souls he had ever encountered were weak all the virile souls vicious or suspicious  he drifted he doubted himself and all the more noisily asserted his talent and the injustice of the world he looked clean and energetic and desirous but he had nothing on which to focus he became an active but careless reporter on newspapers in wichita des moines kansas city st louis seattle los angeles san francisco between times he sold realestate and insurance and sets of travel books for he had no pride of journalism he wanted to keep going and keep interested and make money and spend it he wanted to express himself without trying to find out what his self was  it must be understood that for all his vices walter was essentially clean and kindly he rushed into everything the bad with the good he was not rotten with heavy hopelessness though he was an outcast from his home he was never a pariah not walter but the smug devilish cities which took their revenues from saloonkeeping were to blame when he turned from the intolerable dullness of their streets to the excitement of alcohol in the saloons and brothels which they made so much more amusing than their churches and parlors  everywhere in the western newspaper circles walter heard stories of californians who had gone east and become geniuses the minute they crossed the hudson walter also went east and crossed the hudson but he did not become a genius if there had been an attic to starve in he would have starved in one but as new york has nothing so picturesque he starved in furnished rooms instead while he wrote special stories for sunday newspapers and collected jokes for a syndicated humorous column he was glad to become managing editor though he himself was the only editor he had to manage of a magazine for stampcollectors he wrote some advertisements for a broadway dealer in automobile accessories read half a dozen books on motors and brazenly demanded his present position on the motor and gas gazette  he was as far from the rarified air of bohemia he really believed that sort of thing as he had been in kansas except that he knew one man who made five thousand dollars a year by writing stories about lumberjacks miners cowpunchers and young ladies of quite astounding courage he was twentyseven years old when he met una golden he still read omar khayyam he had a vague plan of going into real estate there ought he felt to be money in writing realestate advertisements  he kept falling in love with stenographers and waitresses with actresses whom he never met he was never satisfied he didnt at all know what he wanted but he wanted something stronger than himself  he was desperately lonelya humorous figure who had dared to aspire beyond the manurepiles of his fathers farm therefore a young man to be ridiculed and in his tragic loneliness he waited for the day when he should find any love any labor that should want him enough to seek him and demand that he sacrifice himself   § 4  it was unas first city spring  save in the squares where the bourgeoning trees made greenlighted spaces for noontime lovers there was no change no blossomy stir in asphalt and cement and brick and steel yet everything was changed between the cornices twenty stories above the pavement you could see a slit of softer sky and there was a peculiar radiance in just the light itself whether it lay along the park turf or made its way down an airwell to rest on a stolid wall of yellow brick the river breeze flowing so persuasively through streets which had been stormed by dusty gales bore happiness grindorgans made music for ragged dancing children and old brick buildings smelled warm peanutwagons came out with a long shrill whine locusts of the spring  in the office even the most hustling of the great ones became human they talked of suburban gardens and of motoring out to country clubs for tennis they smiled more readily and shamelessly said i certainly got the spring fever for fair today and twice did s herbert ross go off to play golf all afternoon the stenographer who commutedalways there is one girl in the office who commutesbrought spring in the form of pussywillows and appleblossoms and was noisily envied  the windows were open now and usually some one was speculatively looking down to the life on the pavement eight stories below at noonhour the younger girls of the office strolled along the sidewalk in threes and fours bareheaded their arms about one another their springtime lane an irregular course between boxes in front of loftbuildings or they ate their boxandpapernapkin lunches on the fireescape that wound down into the court they gigglingly drew their skirts about their ankles and flirted with young porters and packers who leaned from windows across the court una sat with them and wished that she could flirt like the daughters of new york she listened eagerly to their talk of gathering violets in van cortlandt park and tramping on the palisades she noted an increased number of excited confidences to the effect that he says to me and i says to him and say gee honest tess hes a swell fellow she caught herself wanting to tramp the palisades withwith the walter babson who didnt even know her first name  when she left the flat these mornings she forgot her lonely mother instantly in the treacherous magic of the tender sky and wanted to run away to steal the blue and silver day for her own but it was gone when she reached the officeno silver and blue day was here but on goldenoak desk and oakandfrostedglass semipartitions the same light as in the winter sometimes if she got out early a stilly afterglow of amber and turquoise brought back the spring but all day long she merely saw signs that otherwhere for other people spring did exist and she wistfully trusted in it as she watched and helped walter babson  she was conscious that she was working more intimately with him as a comrade now not as clerk with executive there had been no one illuminating moment of understanding he was impersonal with her but each day their relationship was less of a mechanical routine more of a personal friendship she felt that he really depended on her steady carefulness she knew that through the wild tangle of his impulsiveness she saw a desire to be noble   § 5  he came clattering down the aisle of desks to her one may afternoon and begged say miss golden im stuck i got to get out some publicity on the governors goodroads article were going to publish want to send it out to forty papers in advance and i cant get only a dozen proofs and its got to go off tonight can you make me some copies you can use onionskin paper and carbon em and make anyway five copies at a whack but probly youd have to stay late got anything on tonight could you do it could you do it could you  surely  well heres the stuff just singlespace that introductory spiel at the top will you  una rudely turned out of her typewriter a formletter which she was writing for s herbert ross and began to type walters publicity her shoulders bent her eyes intent oblivious to the steady stream of gossip which flowed from stenographer to stenographer no matter how busy they were he needed her she would have stayed till midnight while the keys burred under her fingers she was unconsciously telling herself a story of how she would be working half the night with the office still and shadowy of how a deadwhite face would peer through the window near her desk difficult of accomplishment as the window was eight stories up in air of how she was to be pursued by a man on the way home and how when she got there her mother would say i just dont see how you could neglect me like this all evening all the while she felt herself in touch with large affairsan article by the governor of the state these very sheets that she was typing to go to famous newspapers to the thundering presses of which she had read in fiction urgency affairs anddoing something for walter babson  she was still typing swiftly at fivethirty the closing hour the article was long she had at least two hours of work ahead miss moynihan came stockily to say goodnight the other stenographers fluttered out to the elevators their corner became oppressively quiet the officemanager gently puttered about bade her goodnight drifted away s herbert ross boomed out of his office explaining the theory of advertising to a gasoleny man in a pinchecked suit as they waddled to the elevator the telephonegirl hurried back to connect up a last call frowned while she waited yanked out the plug and scuttled awaya creamy roeeyed girl pretty and unhappy at her harassing job of connecting nervous talkers all day four men editors and advertisingmen shouldered out bawling over a rather feeble joke about bills desire for a drink and their willingness to help him slay the boozeevil una was conscious that they had gone that walls of silence were closing about her clacking typewriter and that walter babson had not gone that he was sharing with her this whispering forsaken office  presently he came rambling out of the editorialroom  he had taken off his grotesque great hornrimmed glasses his eyes were mutinous in his dark melancholy face he drew a hand over them and shook his head una was aware of all this in one glance poor tired boy she thought  he sat on the top of the nearest desk hugged his knee rocked back and forth and said much left miss golden  i think ill be through in about two hours  oh lord i cant let you stay that late  it doesnt matter really ill be glad i havent had to stay late much  for quite the first time he stared straight at her saw her as a human being she was desperately hoping that her hair was smooth and that there wasnt any blue from the typewriter ribbon daubed on her cheeks he ceased his rocking appraised her a part of her brain was wondering what he would do a part longing to smile temptingly at him a part coldly commanding you will not be a little foolhe isnt interested in you and you wont try to make him be either  why you look as fagged as i feel he said i suppose im as bad as the rest i kick like a steer when the old man shoves some extra work on me and then i pass the buck and make you stay late say tell you what well do very sweet to her was his we and his intimacy of tone ill start copying too im quite considerable at machinepounding myself and we can get the thing done and mailed by sixthirty or so and then ill buy you a handsome dinner at childss gosh ill even blow you to a piece of pie and ill shoot you up home by quarter to eight great stuff gimme a copy of the drool meanwhile youll have a whole hour for worried maiden thoughts over going out to eat with the bad crazy wally babson  his smile was a caress her breath caught she smiled back at him fearfully then he was gone in the editorial office was heard the banging of his heavy old typewriterit was an office joke walters hammering of the threshingmachine  she began to type again with mechanical rapidity not consciously seeing the copy so distraught was she as she murmured oh i oughtnt to go out with him but i will what nonsense why shouldnt i have dinner with him oh i mustntim a typist and hes a boss but i will  glancing down the quiet stretches of the office to the windows looking to westward she saw that the sky was a delicate primrose in a loftbuilding rearing out of the low structures between her and the north river lights were springing out and shewho ought to have known that they marked weary latestaying people like herself fancied that they were the lights of restaurants for gay lovers she dismissed her problem forgot the mother who was waiting with a demand for all of unas youth and settled down to a happy excitement in the prospect of going out with walter of knowing him of feeling again that smile  he came prancing out with his copies of the article before she had finished some copyist eh he cried say hustle and finish gee ive been smoking cigarettes today till my mouth tastes like a fishmarket want to eat and forget my troubles  with her excitement dulled to a matteroffact hungriness she trotted beside him to a restaurant one of the string of vance eatingplaces a foodmill which tried to achieve originality by the use of imitation rafters a platerack aligned with landscape plates and varnished black tables for four instead of the long marble tables which crowded the patrons together in most places of the sort walter verbosely called her attention to the mottoes painted on the wood the individual table lights in pink shades just forget the eats miss golden and you can imagine youre in a regular restaurant gosh this place ought to reconcile you to dining with the crazy babson i cant imagine a liaison in a place where coffee costs five cents  he sounded boisterous but he took her coat so languidly he slid so loosely into his chair that she burned with desire to soothe away his office weariness she forgot all reserve she burst out why do you call yourself crazy just because you have more energy than anybody else in the office  no he said grimly snatching at the menu because i havent any purpose in the scheme of things  una told herself that she was pleased to see how the scrawny waitress purred at walter when he gave his order actually she was feeling resentfully that no sawvoiced galumphing amazon of a waitress could appreciate walters smile  in a vance eatingplace ordering a dinner and getting approximately what you order is not a delicate epicurean art but a matter of business and not till an enormous platter of vances special ham and eggs country style was slammed down between them and catsup worcestershire sauce napkins more rolls water and another fork severally demanded of the darting waitress did walter seem to remember that this was a romantic dinner with a strange girl not a deal in foodsupplies  his wavering black eyes searched her face she was agitatedly aware that her skin was broken out in a small red spot beside her lips but she hoped that he would find her forehead clear her mouth a flower he suddenly nodded as though he had grown used to her and found her comfortable while his wreathing hands picked fantastically at a roll and made crosses with lumps of sugar his questions probed at that hidden soul which she herself had never found it was the first time that any one had demanded her formula of life and in her struggle to express herself she rose into a frankness which panama circles of courtship did not regard as proper to young women  whats your ambition he blurted going to just plug along and not get anywhere  no im not but its hard women arent trusted in business and you cant count without responsibility all i can do is keep looking  go out for suffrage feminism so on  i dont know anything about them most women dont know anything about themabout anything  huh most people dont wouldnt have officegrinding if people did know anything how much training have you had  oh public school high school commercial college  where  panama pennsylvania  i know about like my own school in kansasthe highschool principal would have been an undertaker if hed had more capital gee principal and capitalmight make a real cunning pun out of that if i worked over it a little i know go to church  whywhy yes of course  which god do you favor at presentunitarian or catholic or christian science or seventhday advent  why its the same  now dont spring that its the same god stuff on me it isnt the same god that simply hones for candles and music in an episcopal church and gives the plymouth brotherhood a private copyright revelation that organs and candles are wicked  youre terribly sacrilegious  you dont believe any such thing or else youd lam mesame as they used to do in the crusades you dont really care a hang  no i really dont care she was amazed to hear herself admit  of course im terribly crude and vulgar but then what else can you be in dealing with a bunch of churches that havent half the size or beauty of farmers red barns and yet the dubs go on asserting that they believe the church is gods house if i were god id sure object to being worse housed than the cattle but gosh lets pass that up if i started in on what i think of almost anythingchurches or schools or this lying advertising gameid yelp all night and you could always answer me that im merely a neurotic failure while the big guns that i jump on own motorcars he stopped his rapid tirade chucked a lump of sugar at an interrogative cat which was making the round of the tables scowled and suddenly fired at her  what do you think of me  youre the kindest person i ever met  huh kind good to my mother  perhaps youve made the office happy for me i really admire you i spose im terribly unladylike to tell you  gee whiz he marveled got an admirer and i always thought you were an uncommonly levelheaded girl shows how you can fool em  he smiled at her directly rather forlornly proud of her praise  regardless of other tables he thrust his arm across and with the side of his hand touched the side of hers for a second dejectedly he said but why do you like me ive good intentions im willing to pinch tolstois laurels right off his grave and orate like william jennings bryan and theres a million yearners like me there aint a hallbedroom boy in new york that wouldnt like to be a genius  i like you because you have fire mr babson do you  walter  how premature you are  walter  youll be calling me una next and think how shocked the girls will be  oh no ive quite decided to call you goldie sounds nice and sentimental but for heavens sake go on telling me why you like me that isnt a hackneyed subject  oh ive never known anybody with fire except maybe s herbert ross and hehe  he blobs around  yes something like that i dont know whether you are ever going to do anything with your fire but you do have it mr babson  ill probably get fired with it say do you read omar  in nothing do the inarticulate million hallroom boys who want to be geniuses the ordinary unshaved not overbathed ungrammatical young men of any american city so nearly transcend provincialism as in an enthusiasm over their favorite minor cynic elbert hubbard or john kendrick bangs or in walter babsons case mr fitzgeralds variations on omar una had read omar as a pretty poem about roses and murmurous courts but read him she had and such was walters delight in that fact that he immediately endowed her with his own ability to enjoy cynicism he jabbed at the menu with a fork and glowed and shouted say isnt it great that quatrain about take the cash and let the credit go  while una beamed and enjoyed her boys youthful enthusiasm mother of the race ancient tribal woman medieval chatelaine she was just now kin to all the women who in any age have clapped their hands to their mens boasting  she agreed with him that all these guys that pride themselves on being gentlemenlike in english novelsare jus the same as the dubs you see in ordinary life  and that it was not too severe an indictment to refer to the advertisingmanager as s herbert louse  and that the woman feeding by herself over at that corner table looks mysterious somehow gee there must be a tragedy in her life  but her gratification in being admitted to his enthusiasms was only a background for her flare when he boldly caught up her white paw and muttered tired little hand that has to work so hard  she couldnt move she was afraid to look at him clattering restaurant and smell of roast pork and people about her all dissolved in her agitation she shook her head violently to awaken herself heard herself say calmly its terribly late dont you think it is and knew that she was arising but she moved beside him down the street in languor wondering in every cell of her etherealized body whether he would touch her hand again what he would do not till they neared the subway station did she woman the protector noting his slow step and dragging voice rouse herself to say oh dont come up in the subway im used to it really  my dear goldie you arent used to anything in real life gee i said that snappily and it dont mean a thing he gleefully pointed out he seized her arm which prickled to the touch of his fingers rushed her down the subway steps and while he bought their tickets they smiled at each other  several times on the way up he told her that it was a pleasure to have some one who could appreciate his honesttgod opinions of the managing editor and s herbert frost  the subway plunging through unvaried darkness levitated them from the district of dark loftbuildings and theaterbound taxicabs to a farout broadway softened with trees and brightened with small apartmenthouses and little shops they could see a great feathery space of vernal darkness down over the hudson at the end of a street steelbound nature seemed reaching for them wherever in a vacant lot she could get free and send out quickening odors of fresh garden soil  almost country said walter  an urgent daring look came into his eyes under the lightcluster he stopped took her arm there was an edge of spring madness in his voice as he demanded wouldnt you like to run away with me tonight feel this breeze on your lipsits simply plumbfull of mystery wouldnt you like to run away and wed tramp the palisades till dawn and go to sleep with the may sun glaring down the hudson wouldnt you like to wouldnt you  she was conscious that though his head was passionately thrown back his faunlike eyes stared into hers and that his thin lips arched terribly she wanted to say yes actually una golden of panama and the gazette office speculated for a tenth of a second whether she couldnt go madnessriverflow and darkness and the stars but she said no im afraid we couldnt possibly  no he said slowly of courseof course i didnt mean we could butgoldie little goldie that wants to live and rule things wouldnt you like to go wouldnt you  yes you hurt my arm so oh dont we must  her low cry was an appeal to him to save them from springs scornful lusty demand every throbbing nerve in her seemed to appeal to him and it was not relief but gratitude that she felt when he said tenderly poor kid which way come they walked soberly toward the golden flat and soberly he mused poor kids both of us trying to be good slaves in an office when we want to smash things youll be a queenyoull grab the throne same as you grab papers offn my desk and maybe youll let me be court jester  why do you say illoh be a queen do you mean literally in business an executive  hadnt thought just what it did imply but i suppose its that  but why why im simply one of a million stenographers  oh well you arent satisfied to take things just as theyre handed to you most people are and they stick in a rut and wonder who put them there all this success business is a mysterylisten to how successful men trip themselves up and fall all over their foolish faces when they try to explain to a bunch of nice clean young clerks how they stole their success but i know youll get it because you arent satisfied easilyyou take my work and do it and yet youre willing to work in one corner till its time to jump thats my failingi aint willing to stick  iperhaps heres the flat  lord he cried we got to walk a block farther and back  well  they were stealing onward toward the breeze from the river before she had finished her well  think of wasting this hypnotizing evening talking of successword that means a big house in yonkers when weve become friends goldie little goldie business of souls grabbing for each other friendsat least tonight havent we dear havent we  oh i hope so she whispered  he drew her hand into his pocket and clasped it there she looked shyly down strange that her hand should not be visible when she could feel its palm flame against his she let it snuggle there secure mr walter babson was not a young man with bad prospects or good prospects he was love incarnate in magic warm flesh and his hand was the hand of love she was conscious of his hardstarched cuff pressing against her bare arma mans cuff under the rough surface of his mans coatsleeve  he brought her back to the vestibule of the flat for a moment he held both her arms at the elbow and looked at her while with a panic fear she wondered why she could not movewondered if he were going to kiss her  he withdrew his hands sighed goodnight goldie i wont be lonely tonight and turned abruptly away  through all of mrs goldens long sobbing queries as to why una had left her alone all evening una was patient for she knew that she had ahead of her a quiet moment when she would stand alone with the god of love and pray to him to keep her boy her mad boy walter  while she heard her voice crisply explaining why you see mother dear i simply had to get some work done for the office una was telling herself some day he will kiss me and im not sorry he didnt tonightnot now any more im not its so strangei like to have him touch me and i simply never could stand other men touching me i wonder if hes excited now too i wonder what hes doing oh im glad glad i loved his hands     chapter vi   i never thought a nice girl could be in love with a man who is bad and i spose walter is bad kind of but maybe hell become good  so una simpleheartedly reflected on her way to the subway next morning she could not picture what he would do now that it was hard dry day again and all the world panted through dusty streets and she recklessly didnt care for walter was not hard and dry and dusty and she was going to see him again sometimes she was timorous about seeing him because he had read the longing in her face had known her soul with its garments thrown away but timorous or not she had to see him she would never let him go now that he had made her care for him  walter was not in sight when she entered the offices and she was instantly swept into the routine not clasping hands beguiled her but lists to copy typing errors to erase and the irritating adjustment of a shiftkey which fiendishly kept falling for two hours she did not see him  about tenthirty she was aware that he was prosaically strolling toward her  hundreds of times in secret maiden speculations about love the girl una had surmised that it would be embarrassing to meet a man the morning after you had yielded to his caress it had been perplexingone of those mysteries of love over which virgins brood between chapters of novels of which they diffidently whisper to other girls when young married friends are amazingly going to have a baby but she found it natural to smile up at walter in this varnished daytime office neither of them admitted their madness of meeting hands  he merely stooped over her desk and said sketchily mornin little goldie  then for hours he seemed to avoid her she was afraid most of all afraid of her own desire to go to him and wail that he was avoiding her  at three oclock when the office tribe accept with naïve gratitude any excuse to talk to stop and tell one another a new joke to rush to the window and critically view a parade una saw that walter was beginning to hover near her she was angry that he did not come straight to her he did not seem quite to know whether he wanted her or not but her face was calm above her typing while she watched him peer at her over the shoulder of s herbert ross to whom he was talking he drew nearer to her he examined a poster she was oblivious of him she was conscious that he was trying to find an excuse to say something without openly admitting to the everspying row of stenographers that he was interested in her he wambled up to her at last and asked for a letter she had filed for him she knew from the casuallooking drop of his eyes that he was peering at the triangle of her clearskinned throat and for his peeping uneasiness she rather despised him she could fancy herself shouting at him oh stop fidgeting make up your mind whether you like me or not and hurry up about it i dont care now  in which secret defiance she was able to luxuriatesince he was still in the office not gone from her forevertill five oclock when the detached young men of offices are wont to face another evening of lonely irrelevancy and desperately begin to reach for companionship  at that hour walter rushed up and begged goldie you must come out with me this evening  im sorry but its so late  oh i know gee if you knew how ive been thinking about you all day ive been wondering if i ought to im no good blooming waster i told myself and i wondered if i had any right to try to make you care but oh you must come goldie  unas pride steeled her a woman can forgive any vice of man more readily than she can forgive his not loving her so unhesitatingly that he will demand her without stopping to think of his vices refusal to sacrifice the beloved is not a virtue in youth  una said clearly i am sorry but i cant possibly this evening  wellwish you could he sighed  as he moved away una reveled in having refused his halfhearted invitation but already she was aware that she would regret it she was shaken with womans fiercely possessive clinging to love  the light on one side of her desk was shut off by the bulky presence of miss moynihan she whispered huskily say miss golden you want to watch out for that babson fellow he acts like he was stuck on you say listen everybody says hes a bad one say listen honest they say hed compromise a lady jus soon as not  why i dont know what you mean  oh no like fun you donthim rubbering at you all day and pussyfooting around  why youre perfectly crazy he was merely asking me about some papers  oh yes sure lemme tell you a lady cant be none too careful about her reputation with one of them skinny dark devils like a dago snooping around  why youre absolutely ridiculous besides how do you know mr babson is bad has he ever hurt anybody in the office  no but they say  they say  now dont you go and get peeved after you and me been such good friends miss golden i dont know that this babson fellow ever done anything worse than eat crackerjack at south beach but i was just telling you what they all sayhow he drinks and goes with a lot of totties and all butbut hes all right if you say so andhonest t gawd miss golden listen honest i wouldnt knock him for nothing if i thought he was your fellow and in admiration and him an editor gee  una tried to see herself as a princess forgiving her honest servitor but as a matter of fact she was plain angry that her romance should be dragged into the nastiness of office gossip she resented being a stenographer one who couldnt withdraw into a place for dreams and she fierily defended walter in her mind throbbed with a big sweet pity for her nervous aspiring boy whose quest for splendor made him seem wild to the fools about them  when just at fivethirty walter charged up to her again she met him with a smile of unrestrained intimacy  if youre going to be home at all this evening let me come up just for fifteen minutes he demanded  yes she said breathlessly oh i oughtnt to butcome up at nine   § 2  una had always mechanically liked children had ejaculated oh the pink little darling over each neighborhood infant had pictured children of her own but never till that night had the desire to feel her own babys head against her breast been a passion after dinner she sat on the stoop of her apartmenthouse watching the children at play between motors on the street  oh it would be wonderful to have a babya boy like walter must have beento nurse and pet and cry over she declared as she watched a baby of faint brown ringletshair that would be black like walters later she chided herself for being so bold so unpanamanian but she was proud to know that she could long for the pressure of a babys lips the brickwalled street echoed with jagged cries of children tired women in mussed waists poked their red steamy necks out of windows the sky was a blur of gray and lest she forget the job unas left wrist ached from typing yet she heard the rustle of spring and her spirit swelled with thankfulness as she felt her life to be not a haphazard series of days but a divine progress  walter was comingtonight  she was conscious of her mother upstairs from her place of meditation she had to crawl up the many steps to the flat and answer at least twenty questions as to what she had been doing of walters coming she could say nothing she could not admit her interest in a man she did not know  at a quarter to nine she ventured to say ever so casually i feel sort of headachy i think ill run down and sit on the steps again and get a little fresh air  lets have a little walk id like some fresh air too said mrs golden brightly  whyohto tell the truth i wanted to think over some office business  oh of course my dear if i am in the way mrs golden sighed and trailed pitifully off into the bedroom  una followed her and wanted to comfort her but she could say nothing because she was palpitating over walters coming the fifteen minutes of his stay might hold any splendor  she could not change her clothes her mother was in the bedroom sobbing  all the way down the four flights of stairs she wanted to flee back to her mother it was with a cold impatience that she finally saw walter approach the house ten minutes late he was so grotesque in his frantic puffing hurry he was no longer the brilliant mr babson but a moist young man who hemmed and sputtered geecouldnt find clean collarhustled m head offjust missed subway expresscouldnt make itwhew im hot  it doesnt matter she condescended  he dropped on the step just below her and mopped his forehead neither of them could say anything he took off his hornrimmed eyeglasses carefully inserted the point of a pencil through the loop swung them in a buzzing circle and started to put them on again  oh keep them off she snapped you look so highbrow with them  yyuh why ssure  she felt very superior  he feverishly ran a finger along the upper rim of his left ear sprang up stooped to take her hand glared into her eyes till she shrankand then a nailcleaner a common tencent file fell out of his inner pocket and clinked on the stone step  oh damn he groaned  i really think it is going to rain she said  they both laughed  he plumped down beside her uncomfortably wedged between her and the rail he caught her hand intertwined their fingers so savagely that her knuckles hurt look here he commanded you dont really think its going to rain any such a darn thing ive come fourteen billion hot miles up here for just fifteen minutesyes and you wanted to see me yourself too and now you want to talk about the history of recent rains  in the bittersweet spell of his clasp she was oblivious of street children sky she tried to withdraw her hand but he squeezed her fingers the more closely and their two hands dropped on her thin knee which tingled to the impact  butbut what did you want to see me about her superiority was burnt away  he answered her hesitation with a trembling demand i cant talk to you here cant we go some place come walk toward the river  oh i darent really walter my mother feels soso fidgety tonight and i must go back to her by and by  but would you like to go with me  yes  then thats all that matters  perhapsperhaps we could go up on the roof here for just a few minutes then i must send you home  hooray come on  he boldly lifted her to her feet followed her up the stairs on the last dark flight near the roof he threw both arms about her and kissed her she was amazed that she did not want to kiss him back that his abandon did not stir her even while she was shocked and afraid he kissed again and she gave way to his kiss her cold mouth grew desirous  she broke away with shocked prideshocked most of all at herself that she let him kiss her thus  you quiver so to my kiss he whispered in awe  i dont she denied it just doesnt mean anything  it does and you know it does i had to kiss you oh sweetheart sweetheart we are both so lonely kiss me  no no she held him away from her  yes i tell you  she encircled his neck with her arm laid her cheek beside his chin rejoiced boundlessly in the man roughness of his chin of his coatsleeve the man scent of himscent of tobacco and soap and hair she opened her lips to his slowly she drew her arm from about his neck his arm from about her waist  walter she mourned i did want you but you must be good to menot kiss me like thatnot now anyway when im lonely for you and cant resist you oh it wasnt wrong was it when we needed each other so it wasnt wrong was it  oh nono  but notnot againnot for a long while i want you to respect me maybe it wasnt wrong dear but it was terribly dangerous come lets stand out in the cool air on the roof for a while and then you must go home  they came out on the flat graveled roof round which all the glory of the city was blazing and hand in hand in a confidence delicately happy now stood worshiping the spring  dear he said i feel as though i were a robber who had gone crashing right through the hedge around your soul and then after that come out in a gardenthe sweetest coolest garden i will try to be good to youand for you he kissed her fingertips  yes you did break through at first it was just a kiss and theoh it was the kiss and there wasnt anything else oh do let me live in the little garden still  trust me dear  i will trust you come i must go down now  can i come to see you  yes  goldie listen he said as they came downstairs to her hallway any time youd like to marry mei dont advise it i guess id have good intentions but be a darn poor hand at putting up shelvesbut any time youd like to marry me or any of those nice conventional things just lemme know will you not that it matters much what matters is i want to kiss you goodnight  no what matters is im not going to let you not tonight goodnight dear  she scampered down the hall she tiptoed into the livingroom and for an hour she brooded felt faint and ashamed at her bold response to his kiss yet wanted to feel his sharpridged lips again sometimes in a bitter frankness she told herself that walter had never even thought of marriage till their kiss had fired him she swore to herself that she would not give all her heart to love that she would hold him off and make him value her precious little store of purity and tenderness but passion and worry together were lost in a prayer for him she knelt by the window till her own individuality was merged with that of the citys million lovers   § 3  like sickness and war the office grind absorbs all personal desires love and ambition and wisdom it turns to its own purposes every day una and walter saw each other their hands touched as he gave her papers to file there was affection in his voice when he dictated and once outside the office door he kissed her yet their love was kept suspended they could not tease each other and flirt raucously like the telephonegirl and the elevatorstarter  every day he begged her to go to dinner with him to let him call at the flat and after a week she permitted him to come   § 4  at dinner when una told her mother that a young gentleman at the officein fact mr babson the editor whose dictation she tookwas going to call that evening mrs golden looked pleased and said isnt that nice why you never told mother he was interested in you  well of course we kind of work together  i do hope hes a nice respectful young man not one of these city people that flirt and drink cocktails and heaven knows what all  why uhim sure youll like him everybody says hes the cleverest fellow in the shop  office dear not shop is he does he get a big salary  why mums im sure i havent the slightest idea how should i know  well i just asked will you put on your pinkandwhite crêpe  dont you think the brown silk would be better  why una i want you to look your prettiest you must make all the impression you can  well perhaps id better una said demurely  despite her provincial training mrs golden had a much better instinct for dress than her sturdy daughter so long as she was not left at home alone her mild selfishness did not make her want to interfere with unas interests she ahd and ohd over the torn border of unas crêpe dress and mended it with quick pussylike movements of her fingers she tried to arrange unas hair so that its pale golden texture would shine in broad loose undulations and she was as excited as una when they heard walters bouncing steps in the hall his nervous tap at the door his fumbling for a pushbutton  una dashed wildly to the bedroom for a last nosepowdering a last glance at her hair and nails and slowly paraded to the door to let him in while mrs golden stood primly with folded hands like a cabinet photograph of 1885  so the irregular walter came into a decidedly regular atmosphere and had to act like a pureminded young editor  they conversedlord how they conversed mrs golden respectably desired to know mr babsons opinions on the weather newyorkers her little girl unas work fashionable city ministers the practical value of motorcars and the dietetic value of beansthe large white beans not the small brown onesshe had grown both varieties in her garden at home panama pennsylvania when mr golden captain golden he was usually called was aliveand had mr babson ever had a garden or seen panama and was una really attending to her duties  all the while mrs goldens canary trilled approval of the conversation  una listened numbed while walter kept doing absurd things with his facepinched his lips and tapped his teeth and rubbed his jaw as though he needed a shave he took off his eyeglasses to wipe them and tied his thin legs in a knot and all the while said yes theres certainly a great deal to that  at a quarter to ten mrs golden rose indulged in a little kitten yawn behind her silvery hand and said well i think i must be off to bed i find these may days so languid dont you mr babson spring fever i just cant seem to get enough sleep now you mustnt stay up too late una dear  the bedroom door had not closed before walter had darted from his chair picked una up his hands pressing tight about her knees and shoulders kissed her and set her down beside him on the couch  wasnt i good huh wasnt i good huh wasnt i now who says wally babson aint a good parlorpup huh oh you old darling you were twice as agonized as me  and that was all he saidin words between them was a secret a greater feeling of unfettered intimacy because together they had been polite to mothertragic pitiful mother who had been enjoying herself so much without knowing that she was in the way that intimacy needed no words to express it hands and cheeks and lips spoke more truly they were children of emotion young and crude and ignorant groping for life and love all the world new to them despite their sorrows and waiting they were clerklings not lords of love and life but all the more easily did they yield to longing for happiness between them was the battle of desire and timidityand not all the desire was his not hers all the timidity she fancied sometimes that he was as much afraid as was she of debasing their shy seeking into unveiled passion yet his was the initiative always she panted and wondered what he would do next feared and wondered and rebukedand desired  he abruptly drew her head to his shoulder smoothed her hair she felt his fingers again communicate to her every nerve a tingling electric force she felt his lips quest along her cheek and discover the soft little spot just behind her ear she followed the restless course of his hands across her shoulders down her arm lingeringly over her hand his hand seemed to her to have an existence quite apart from him to have a mysterious existence of its own in silence they rested there she kept wondering if his shoulder had not been made just for her cheek with little shivers she realized that this was his shoulder walters a mans as the rough cloth prickled her skin silent they were and for a time secure but she kept speculating as to what he would dare to do nextand she fancied that he was speculating about precisely the same thing  he drew a catching breath and suddenly her lips were opening to his  oh you mustntyou promised she moaned when she was able to draw back her head  again he kissed her quickly then released her and began to talk rapidly ofnothing apropos of offices and theaters and the tides of spring he was really telling her that powerful though his restless curiosity was greatly though their poor little city bodies craved each other yet he did respect her she scarce listened for at first she was bemused by two thoughts she was inquiring sorrowfully whether it was only her body that stirred himwhether he found any spark in her honest little mind and for her second thought she was considering in an injured way that this was not love as she had read of it in novels i didnt know just what it would bebut i didnt think it would be like this she declared  love as depicted in such american novels by literary pastors and matrons of perfect purity as had sifted into the panama public library was an affair of astounding rescues from extreme peril of highly proper walks in lanes of laudable industry on the part of the hero and of not more than three kissesone on the brow one on the cheek and in the very last paragraph of the book one daringly but reverently deposited upon the lips these young heroes and heroines never thought about bodies at all except when they had been deceived in a field of asterisks so to una there was the worldold shock at the earthiness of loveand the penetrating joy of that earthiness if real love was so much more vulgar than she had supposed yet also it was so much more overwhelming that she was glad to be a fleshandblood lover bruised and bewildered and estranged from herself instead of a polite murmurer  gradually she was drawn back into a real communion with him when he damned the human race for serfs fighting in a dungeon warring for land for flags for titles and calling themselves kings walter took the same theories of socialism singletax unionism which j j todd of chatham had hacked out in commercialcollege days and he made them bleed and yawp and be hotly human for the first timewalter was giving her so many of those first times of lifeuna realized how strong is the demand of the undermen for a conscious and scientific justice she denied that stenographers could ever form a union but she could not answer his acerb why not  it was not in the patiently marching una to be a creative thinker yet she did hunger for selfmastery and ardently was she following the erratic gibes at civilization with which young walter showed his delight in having an audience when the brown homely golden family clock struck eleven  heavens she cried you must run home at once goodnight dear  he rose obediently nor did their lips demand each other again  her mother awoke to yawn he is a very polite young man but i dont think he is solid enough for you dearie if he comes again do remind me to show him the kodaks of your father like i promised  then una began to ponder the problem which is so weighty to girls of the citywhere she could see her lover since the parks were impolite and her own home obtrusively dull to him  whether walter was a peril or not whether or not his love was angry and red and full of hurts yet she knew that it was more to her than her mother or her conventions or her ambitious little job thus gladly confessing she fell asleep and a new office day began for always the office claims one again the moment that the evenings freedom is over     chapter vii   these children of the city where there is no place for lovemaking for discovering and testing each others hidden beings ran off together in the scanted parties of the ambitious poor walter was extravagant financially as he was mentally but he had many debts some conscience and a smallness of salary she was pleased by the smallest diversions however and found luxury in a bowl of chopsuey he took her to an italian restaurant and pointed out supposititious artists they had gallery seats for a maude adams play at which she cried and laughed wholeheartedly and held his hand all through her first real tea was with himin panama one spoke of ladies afternoon tea not of tea she was awed by his new walkingstick and the new knowledge of cinnamon toast which he displayed for her she admired too the bored way he swung his stick as they sauntered into and out of the lobbies of the great hotels  the first flowers from a real florists which she had ever received except for a bunch of carnations from henry carson at panama highschool commencement came from walterlongstemmed roses in damp paper and a florists box with walters card inside  and perhaps the first time that she had ever really seen spring felt the intense light of sky and cloud and fresh greenery as her own was on a sunday just before the fragrant first of june when walter and she slipped away from her mother and walked in central park shabby but unconscious  she explored with him too felt adventurous in quite respectable japanese and greek and syrian restaurants  but her mother waited for her at home and the job the office the desk demanded all her energy  had they seen each other less frequently perhaps walter would have let dreams serve for real kisses and have been satisfied but he saw her a hundred times a dayand yet their love progressed so little the propinquity of the office tantalized them and mrs golden kept them apart   § 2  the woman who had aspired and been idle while captain golden had toiled for her who had mourned and been idle while una had planned for her and who had always been a compound of selfishness and love was more and more accustomed to taking her daughters youth to feed her comfort and her canarya bird of atrophied voice and uncleanly habit  if this were the history of the people who wait at home instead of the history of the warriors rich credit would be given to mrs golden for enduring the long lonely days listening for unas step a proud patient woman with nothing to do all day but pick at a little housework and read her eyes out and wish that she could run in and be neighborly with the indifferent urbanites who formed about her a wall of ice yet so confused are human purposes that this good woman who adored her daughter also sapped her daughters vigor as the office loomed behind all of unas desires so behind the office in turn was ever the shadowy thought of the appealing figure there at home and toward her mother una was very compassionate  yes and so was her mother  mrs golden liked to sit soft and read stories of young love partly by nature and partly because she had learned that thus she could best obtain her wishes she was gentle as a wellfilled cat and delicate as a tulle scarf she was admiringly adhesive to una as she had been to captain golden and she managed the new master of the house just as she had managed the former one she listened to dictates pleasantly was perfectly charmed at suggestions that she do anything and then gracefully forgot  mrs golden was a mistress of graceful forgetting almost never did she remember to do anything she didnt want to do she did not lie about it she really and quite beautifully did forget  una hurrying off to the office every morning agonized with the effort to be on time always had to stop and prepare a written list of the things her mother was to do otherwise bespelled by the magazine stories which she kept forgetting and innocently rereading mrs golden would forget the marketing forget to put the potatoes on to boil forget to scrub the bathroom and she often contrived to lose the written list and searched for it with trembling lips but no vast persistence  una bringing home the palsying weariness of the days drudgery would find a cheery welcomeand the work not done no vegetables for dinner no fresh boricacid solution prepared for washing her stinging eyes  nor could una herself get the work immediately out of the way because her mother was sure to be lonely to need comforting before una could devote herself to anything else or even wash away the sticky office grime mrs golden would have been shocked into a stroke could she have known that while una was greeting her she was muttering within herself i do wish i could brush my teeth first  if una was distraught desirous of disappearing in order to get hold of herself mrs golden would sigh dear have i done something to make you angry in any case whether una was silent or vexed with her the mother would manage to be hurt but brave sweetly distressed but never quite tearful and una would have to kiss her pat her hair before she could escape and begin to get dinner with her mother helping always ready to do anything that unas doggedly tired mind might suggest but never suggesting novelties herself  after dinner mrs golden was always ready to do whatever una wishedto play cribbage or read aloud or go for a walknot a long walk she was so delicate you know but a nice little walk with her dear dear daughter for such amusements she was ready to give up all her own favorite evening diversionsnamely playing solitaire and reading and taking nice little walks but she did not like to have una go out and leave her nor have naughty naughty men like walter take una to the theater as though they wanted to steal the dear daughter away and she wore unas few good frocks and forgot to freshen them in time for una to wear them otherwise mrs golden had the unselfishness of a saint on a marble pillar  una it is true sometimes voiced her irritation over her mothers forgetfulness and her subsequent pathos but for that bitterness she always blamed herself with horror remembered each cutting word she had said to the little mother saint as in still hours when they sat clasped like lovers she tremblingly called her   § 3  mrs goldens demand of una for herself had never been obvious till it clashed with walters demand  una and walter talked it over but they seemed mutely to agree after the evening of mrs golden and conversation that it was merely balking for him to call at the flat nor did una and mrs golden discuss why mr babson did not come again or whether una was seeing him una was accustomed to say only that she would be away this evening but over the teapot she quoted walters opinions on omar agnosticism motor magazines pipesmoking staten island and the himalayas and it was evident that she was often with him  mrs goldens method of opposition was very simple whenever una announced that she was going out her mothers bright birdlike eyes filmed over she sighed and hesitated shall i be alone all eveningafter all day too una felt like a brute she tried to get her mother to go to the sessionses flat more often to make new friends but mrs golden had lost all her adaptability she clung to una and to her old furniture as the only recognizable parts of her world often una felt forced to refuse walters invitations always she refused to walk with him on the long splendid saturday afternoons of freedom nor would she let him come and sit on the roof with her lest her mother see them in the hall and be hurt  so it came to pass that only in public did she meet walter he showed his resentment by inviting her out less and less by telling her less and less frankly his ambitions and his daily dabs at becoming a great man apparently he was rather interested in a flourfaced actress at his boardinghouse  never now did he speak of marriage the one time when he had spoken of it una had been so sure of their happiness that she had thought no more of that formality than had his reckless self but now she yearned to have him propose in the most stupid conventional pinkromance fashion why cant we be married she fancied herself saying to him but she never dared say it aloud  often he was abstracted when he was with her in the office or out always he was kindly but the kindliness seemed artificial she could not read his thoughts now that she had no handclasp to guide her  on a hot quivering afternoon of early july walter came to her desk at closinghour and said abruptly look youve simply got to come out with me this evening well dine at a little place at the foot of the palisades i cant stand seeing you so little i wont ask you again you arent fair  oh i dont mean to be unfair  will you come will you  his voice glared regardless of the office folk about them he put his hand over hers she was sure that miss moynihan was bulkily watching them she dared not take time to think  yes she said i will go   § 4  it was a beergarden frequented by yachtless german yachtsmen in shirtsleeves boatingcaps and mustaches like muffs but to una it was europe and the banks of the rhine that restaurant below the palisades where she dined with walter  a placid hour it was as dusk grew deeper and more fragrant and they leaned over the terrace rail to meditate on the lights springing out like laughing jests incarnatereflected lights of steamers paddling with singing excursionists up the hudson to the storied hills of rip van winkle imperial sweeps of fire that outlined the mighty city across the river  walter was at peace he spared her his swart intensity he shyly quoted tennyson and bounced with cynicisms about sherbert souse and the gasbag he brought happiness to her instead of the agitation of his kisses  she was not an office machine now but one with the village lovers of poetry as her jobexhaustion found relief in the magic of the hour in the ancient music of the river in breezes which brought old tales down from the catskills  she would have been content to sit there for hours listening to the twilight absently pleating the coarse tablecloth trying to sip the saline claret which he insisted on their drinking she wanted nothing more and she had so manoeuvered their chairs that the left side of her face the better side was toward him  but walter grew restless he stared at the german yachtsmen at their children who ate lumps of sugar dipped in claret and their wives who drank beer he commented needlessly on a cat which prowled along the terrace rail he touched unas foot with his and suddenly condemned himself for not having been able to bring her to a better restaurant he volubly pointed out that their roast chicken had been petrifiedvile restaurant very vile food  why i love it here she protested im perfectly happy to be just like this  as she turned to him with a smile that told all her tenderness she noted how his eyes kept stealing from the riverside to her and back again how his hands trembled as he clapped two thick glass saltshakers together a current of uneasiness darted between them  he sprang up oh i cant sit still he said come on lets walk down along the river  oh cant we just sit here and be quiet she pleaded but he rubbed his chin and shook his head and sputtered oh rats you cant see the river now that theyve turned on the electric lights here come on besides itll be cooler right by the river  she felt a menace the darkness beyond them was no longer dreaming but terrorfilled she wanted to refuse but he was so fretfully demanding that she could only obey him  up on the crest of the palisades is an amusement park and suburbs and crowded paths and across the river is new york in a solid mass of apartmenthouses but between palisades and river at the foot of the cliffs is an unfrequented path which still keeps some of the wildness it had when it was a warpath of the indians it climbs ridges twists among rocks dips into damp hollows widens out into tiny bowlinggreens for hendrik hudsons fairy men by night it is ghostly and beside it the river whispers strange tragedies  along this path the city children crept unspeaking save when his two hands clasping her waist to guide her down a rocky descent were clamorous  where a bare sand jetty ran from the path out into the rivers broad current walter stopped and whispered i wish we could go swimming  i wish we couldits quite warm she said prosaically  but river and dark woods and breeze overhead seemed to whisper to herwhisper whisper all the shrouded night aquiver with low eager whispers she shivered to find herself imagining the unimaginablethat she might throw off her stodgy office clothes her dull cloth skirt and neat blouse and go swimming beside him revel in giving herself up to the utter frankness of cool water laving her bare flesh  she closed her mind she did not condemn herself for wanting to bathe as mother eve had bathed naked and unafraid she did not condemn herselfbut neither did she excuse she was simply afraid she dared not try to make new standards she took refuge in the old standards of the good little una though all about her called the enticing voices of night and the river yet she listened for the tried counsel voices of the plain panama streets and the busy office  while she struggled walter stood with his arm fitted about her shoulder letting the pregnant silence speak till again he insisted why couldnt we go swimming then with all the cruelly urgent lovers of the days of hungry poetry were going to let youth go by and never dare to be mad time will get uswell be oldit will be too late to enjoy being mad his lyric cry dropped to a smallboy excuse besides it wouldnt hurt come on think of plunging in  no no no no she cried and ran from him up the jetty back to the path she was not afraid of him because she was so much more afraid of herself  he followed sullenly as the path led them farther and farther she stopped on a rise and found herself able to say calmly dont you think wed better go back now  maybe we ought to but sit down here  he hunched up his knees rested his elbows on them and said abstractedly apparently talking to himself as much as to her  im sorry ive been so grouchy coming down the path but i dont apologize for wanting us to go swimming civilization the worlds officemanager tells us to work like fiends all day and be lonely and respectable all evening and not even marry till were thirty because we cant afford to thats all right for them as likes to become nice varnished desks but not for me im going to hunger and thirst and satisfy my appetiteseven if it makes me selfish as the devil id rather be that than be a branstuffed automaton thats never human enough to hunger but of course youre naturally a puritan and always will be one no matter what you do youre a good sort id trust you to the limityoure sincere and you want to grow but memy wanderjahr isnt over yet maybe some time well again i admire you butif i werent a little mad id go literally mad madmad  he suddenly undid the first button of her blouse and kissed her neck harshly while she watched him in a maze he abruptly fastened the button again sprang up stared out at the wraithfilled darkness over the river while his voice droned on as though it were a third person speaking  i suppose theres a million cases a year in new york of crazy young chaps making violent love to decent girls and withdrawing because they have some hidden decency themselves im ashamed that im one of themme im as bad as a nice little y m c a boyi bow to conventions too lordy the fact that im so oldfashioned as even to talk about conventions in this age of shaw and dannunzio shows that im still a smalltown districtschool radical im really as midvictorian as you are in knowledge only im modern by instinct and the combination will always keep me halfbaked i suppose i dont know what i want from life and if i did i wouldnt know how to get it im a middle western farmer and yet i regard myself about half the time as an oxford man with a training in paris youre lucky girl you have a definite ambitioneither to be married and have babies or to boss an office whatever i did id spoil youat least i would till i found myselffound out what i wanted lord how i hope i do find myself some day  poor boy she suddenly interrupted its all right come well go home and try to be good  wonderful there speaks the american woman perfectly you think im just chattering you cant understand that i was never so desperately in earnest in my life well to come down to cases specification ai couldnt marry you because we havent either of us got any moneyaside from my not having found myself yet ditto bwe cant play just because you are a puritan and im a typical intellectual climber same cive actually been offered a decent job in the advertising department of a motorcar company in omaha and now i think ill take it  and that was all that he really had to say just that last sentence though for more than an hour they discussed themselves and their uncharted world walter trying to be honest yet to leave with her a better impression of himself una trying to keep him with her it was hard for her to understand that walter really meant all he said  but like him she was frank  there are times in any perplexed love when the lovers revel in bringing out just those problems and demands and complaints which they have most carefully concealed at such a time of mutual confession if the lovers are honest and tender there is none of the abrasive hostility of a vulgar quarrel but the kindliness of the review need not imply that it is profitable often it ends as it began with the wail what can we do but so much alike are all the tribe of lovers that the debaters never fail to stop now and then to congratulate themselves on being so frank  thus una and walter after a careful survey of the facts that he was too restless that she was too panamanian and too much mothered after much argument as to what he had meant when he had said this and what she had thought he meant when he had said that and whether he could ever have been so inconsiderate as to have said the other and frequent admiration of themselves for their openmindedness the questing lovers were of the same purpose as at the beginning of their inquiry he still felt the urge to take up his pilgrimage again to let the decent job and omaha carry him another stage in his search for the shrouded gods of his nebulous faith and she still begged for a chance to love to be needed still declared that he was merely running away from himself  they had quite talked themselves out before he sighed i dont dare to look and see what time it is come well have to go  they swung arms together shyly as they stumbled back over the path she couldnt believe that he really would go off to the west of which she was so ignorant but she felt as though she were staggering into a darkness blinder and ever more blind  when she got home she found her mother awake very angry over unas staying out till after midnight and very wordy about the fact that that nice clean young man mr j j todd of chatham and of the commercial college had come to call that evening una made little answer to her through her still and sacred agony she could scarce hear her mothers petulant whining   § 5  next morning at the office walter abruptly asked her to come out into the hall told her that he was leaving without notice that afternoon he could never bear to delay once he had started out on the long trail he said not looking at her he hastily kissed her and darted back into the office she did not see him again till at fivethirty he gave noisy farewell to all the adoring stenographers and officeboys and ironical congratulations to his disapproving chiefs he stopped at her desk hesitated noticeably then said goodby goldie and passed on she stared hypnotized as for the last time walter went bouncing out of the office   § 6  a week later j j todd called on her again he was touching in his description of his faithful labor for the charity organization society but she felt dead she could not get herself to show approval it was his last call   § 7  walter wrote to her on the traina jumbled rhapsody on missing her honest companionship then a lively description of his new chief at omaha a lonely letter on a barren evening saying that there was nothing to say a note about a new project of going to alaska she did not hear from him again   § 8  for weeks she missed him so tragically that she found herself muttering over and over now i shant ever have a baby that would be a little image of him  when she thought of the shy games and silly lovewords she had lavished she was ashamed and wondered if they had made her seem a fool to him  but presently in the weeks unchanging routine she found an untroubled peace and in mastering her work she had more comfort than ever in his clamorous summons  at home she tried not merely to keep her mother from being lonely but actually to make her happy to coax her to break into the formidable city she arranged summerevening picnics with the sessionses  she persuaded them to hold one of these picnics at the foot of the palisades during it she disappeared for nearly half an hour she sat alone by the river suddenly with a feverish wrench she bared her breast then shook her head angrily rearranged her blouse went back to the group and was unusually gay though all the while she kept her left hand on her breast as though it pained her  she had been with the gazette for only a little over six months and she was granted only a weeks vacation this she spent with her mother at panama in parties with old neighbors she found sweetness and on a motortrip with henry carson and his fiancée a young widow she let the fleeting sunflecked land absorb her soul  at the office una was transferred to s herbert rosss department upon walters leaving she sometimes took s herberts majestic flowing dictation she tried not merely to obey his instructions but also to discover his unvoiced wishes her wage was raised from eight dollars a week to ten she again determined to be a real business woman she read a small manual on advertising  but no one in the gazette office believed that a woman could bear responsibilities not even s herbert ross with his aphorisms for stenographers his prose poems about the ecstatic joy of running a typewriter nine hours a day which appeared in large juicylooking type in business magazines  she became bored mechanical somewhat hopeless she planned to find a better job and resign in which frame of mind she was rather contemptuous of the gazette office and it was an unforgettable shock suddenly to be discharged  ross called her in on a winter afternoon told her that he had orders from the owner to reduce the force because of a change of policy and that though he was sorry he would have to let her go because she was one of the most recent additions he assured her royally that he had been pleased by her work that he would be glad to give her the best kind of a recommendand if the situation loosens up again id be tickled to death to have you drop in and see me just between us i think the owner will regret this tightwad policy  but mr s herbert ross continued to go out to lunch with the owner and una went through all the agony of not being wanted even in the prison she hated no matter what the reason being discharged is the final insult in an office and it made her timid as she began wildly to seek a new job     chapter viii   in novels and plays architects usually are delicate young men who wear silky vandyke beards play the piano and do a good deal with pictures and rugs they leap with desire to erect charming cottages for the poor and to win prize contests for the jackson county courthouse they always have good taste they are perfectly mad about simplicity and gracefulness but from the number of flatfaced houses and threetoned wooden churches still being erected it may be deduced that somewhere there are architects who are not enervated by too much good taste  mr troy wilkins architect with an office in the septimus building was a commuter he wore a derby and a clipped mustache and took interest in cameras playerpianos phonographs small motorcars speedometers tires patent nicotineless pipes jolly tobacco for jimmypipes tennisrackets correspondence courses safetyrazors optimism theodore roosevelt pocket flashlights rubber heels and all other welladvertised wares he was a conservative republican and a congregationalist and on his desk he kept three silverframed photographsone of his wife and two children one of his dog rover and one of his architectural masterpiece the mansion of peter b reardon the copper king of montana  mr troy wilkins lamented the passing of the solid and expensive stone residences of the nineties but he kept up to date and he had added ideals about halftimbered villas doorway settles garages and sleepingporches to his repertoire he didnt however as he often said believe in bungalows any more than he believed in these labor unions   § 2  una golden had been the chief of mr troy wilkinss two stenographers for seven months nowmidsummer of 1907 when she was twentysix she had climbed to thirteen dollars a week the few hundred dollars which she had received from captain goldens insurance were gone and her mother and she had to make a science of savingeconomize on milk on bread on laundry on toothpaste but that didnt really matter because una never went out except for walks and movingpicture shows with her mother she had no need no want of clothes to impress suitors she had four worn letters from walter babson which she reread every week or two she had her mother and always her job   § 3  una an errandboy and a young eastside jewish stenographer named bessie kraker made up the office force of troy wilkins the office was on the eighth floor of the septimus building which is a lean jerrybuilt flashingly pretentious cement structure with cracking walls and dirty tiled hallways  the smeary redgold paint which hides the imperfect ironwork of its elevators does not hide the fact that they groan like lost souls and tremble and jerk and threaten to fall the septimus building is typical of at least one half of a large city it was run up by a speculative builder for a quick turnover it is semifireproof but more semi than fireproof it stands on nassau street between two portly stone buildings that try to squeeze this lanky impostor to death but there is more cheerful whistling in its hallways than in the halls of its disapproving neighbors near it is city hall park and newspaper row wall street and the lordly stock exchange but aside from a few dull and honest tenants like mr troy wilkins the septimus building is filled with offices of flybynight companiesshifty promoters miningconcerns beautyparlors for petty brokers sampleshoe shops discreet lawyers and advertising dentists seven desks in one large room make up the entire headquarters of eleven international corporations which possess as capital eleven hundred and thirty dollars much embossed stationeryand the seven desks these modest capitalists do not lease their quarters by the year they are doing very well if they pay rent for each of four successive months but also they do not complain about repairs they are not fussy about demanding a certificate of moral perfection from the janitor they speak cheerily to elevatorboys and slink off into saloons not all of them keep yom kippur they all talk of being broadminded  mr wilkinss office was small and agitated it consisted of two rooms and an insignificant entryhall in which last was a watercooler a postal scale a pile of newspapers and a morose officeboy who drew copies of gibson girls all day long on stray pieces of wrappingpaper and confided to una at least once a week that he wanted to take a correspondence course in windowdressing in one of the two rooms mr wilkins cautiously made drawings at a long table or looked surprised over correspondence at a small oldfashioned desk or puffed and scratched as he planned formletters to save his steadily waning business  in the other room there were the correspondencefiles and the desks of una the chief stenographer and of slangy eastside bessie kraker who conscientiously copied formletters including all errors in them and couldnt as wilkins complainingly pointed out be trusted with dictation which included any words more difficult than sincerely  from their window the two girls could see the windows of an office across the street about once a month an interesting curlyhaired youth leaned out of one of the windows opposite otherwise there was no view   § 4  twelve oclock the hour at which most of the offices closed on saturday in summer was excitedly approaching the officewomen throughout the septimus building who had been showing off their holiday frocks all morning were hastily finishing letters or rushing to the womens washrooms to discuss with one another the hang of new skirts all morning bessie kraker had kept up a monologue beginning say listen miss golden say gee i was goin down to south beach with my gentleman friend this afternoon and say what dyou think the piker had to go and get stuck for hes got to work all afternoon i dont carei dont care im going to coney island with sadie and i bet you we pick up some fellows and do the light fantastic till one g m oh you sad sea waves i bet sadie and me make em sad  but well be straight said bessie half an hour later apropos of nothing but gee its fierce to not have any good times without you take a risk but gee my dad would kill me if i went wrong he reads the talmud all the time and hates goys but gee i cant stand it all the time being a mollycoddle i wisht i was a boy id be a aviator  bessie had a proud new blouse with a deep v the edges of which gaped a bit and suggested that by ingenuity one could see more than was evident at first troy wilkins while pretending to be absentmindedly fussing about a correspondencefile that morning had forgotten that he was much married and had peered at the v una knew it and the sordidness of that curiosity so embarrassed her that she stopped typing to clutch at the throat of her own highnecked blouse her heart throbbing she wanted to run away she had a vague desire to help bessie who purred at poor good mr wilkins and winked at una and chewed gum enjoyably who was brave and hardy and perfectly able to care for herselfan organism modified by the ghetto to the life which still bewildered una  mr wilkins went home at 1117 after giving them enough work to last till noon the officeboy chattily disappeared two minutes later while bessie went two minutes after that her delay was due to the adjustment of her huge straw hat piled with pink roses and tufts of blue malines  una stayed till twelve her ambition had solidified into an unreasoning conscientiousness  with bessie gone the office was so quiet that she hesitated to typewrite lest they sneak up on herthey who dwell in silent offices as they dwell beneath a small boys bed at night the hush was intimidating her slightest movement echoed she stopped the sharply tapping machine after every few words to listen  at twelve she put on her hat with two jabs of the hatpins and hastened to the elevator exulting in freedom the elevator was crowded with girls in new white frocks voluble about their afternoons plans one of them carried a wicker suitcase she was she announced starting on her two weeks vacation there would be some boys and she was going to have a peach of a time  una and her mother had again spent a week of june in panama and she now recalled the bright free mornings and lingering wonderful twilights  she had no place to go this holiday afternoon and she longed to join a noisy excited party of walter babson she did not think she stubbornly determined to snatch this time of freedom why of course she asserted she could play by herself quite happily with a spurious gaiety she patted her small black handbag she skipped across to the sixth avenue elevated and went up to the departmentstore district she made elaborate plans for the great adventure of shopping bessie kraker had insisted with the nonchalant shrillness of eighteen that una had ought to wear more color and una had found in the fashion section of a womans magazine the suggestion for exactly the thinga modest attractive frock of brown with smart touches of orangeand economical she had the dress plannedribbonbelt half brown and half orange a collar edged with orange cuffs slashed with it  there were a score of mild matteroffact unas on the same elevated train with her in their black hats and black jackets and black skirts and white waists with one hint of coquetry in a whitelace jabot or a whitelace veil faces slightly sallow or channeled with care but eyes that longed to flare with love women whom life didnt want except to type its letters about invoices of rubber heels women who would have given their salvation for the chance to sacrifice themselves for love and there was one man on that elevated train a wellbathed man with cynical eyes who read a little book with a florid gold cover all about clytemnestra because he was certain that modern cities have no fine romance no high tragedy that you must go back to the greeks for real feeling he often aphorized frightfully hackneyed to say womans place is in the home but really you know these women going to offices vulgarizing all their fine womanliness and this shrieking sisterhood going in for suffrage and lord knows what give me the reticences of the harem rather than one of these officewomen with gumchewing vacuities none of them clever enough to be tragic he was ever so whimsical about the way in which the suffrage movement had cheated him of the chance to find a grande amoureuse he sat opposite una in the train and solemnly read his golden book he did not see una watch with shy desire every movement of a baby that was talking to its mother in some unknown dialect of babyland he was feeling deep sensations about clytemnestras misfortunesthough he controlled his features in the most gentlemanly manner and rose composedly at his station letting a wellbred glance of pity fall upon the gumchewers  una found a marvelously clean new restaurant on sixth avenue with lace curtains at the window and between the curtains a red geranium in a pot covered with redcrêpe paper tied with green ribbon a new place she was tired of the office the elevated the flat on 148th street the restaurants where she tediously had her weekday lunches she entered the new restaurant briskly swinging her black bag the place had personalitythe white enameled tables were set diagonally and clothed with strips of japanese toweling una smiled at a lively photograph of two bunnies in a basket with a sensation of freedom and novelty she ordered coffee chicken patty and cocoanut layercake  but the patty and the cake were very much like the hundreds of other patties and cakes which she had consumed during the past two years and the people about her were of the horde of lonely workers who make up half of new york the holiday enchantment dissolved she might as well be going back to the office grind after lunch she brooded while outside in that seething summer street the pageant of life passed by and no voice summoned her men and girls and motors people who laughed and waged commerce for the reward of lovethey passed her by life passed her by a spectator untouched by joy or noble tragedy a woman desperately hungry for life  she beganbut not bitterly she was a good little thing you knowto make the old familiar summary she had no lover no friend no future walterhe might be dead or married her mother and the office between them left her no time to seek lover or friend or success she was a prisoner of affection and conscience  she rose and paid her check she did not glance at the picture of the bunnies in a basket she passed out heavily a woman of sterile sorrow   § 5  una recovered her holiday by going shopping an aisleman in the dressgoods department a magnificent creature in a braided morningcoat directed her to the counter she asked for spoke eloquently of woolen voiles picked up her bag and remarked yes we do manage to keep it cool here even on the hottest days a shopgirl laughed with her she stole into one of the elevators and though she really should have gone home to her mother she went into the music department where among lattices wreathed with newly dusted roses she listened to waltzes and twosteps played by a redhaired girl who was chewing gum and talking to a man while she played the music roused una to plan a wild dissipation she would pretend that she had a sweetheart that with him she was aroving  una was not highly successful in her makebelieve she could not picture the imaginary man who walked beside her she refused to permit him to resemble walter babson and he refused to resemble anybody else but she was throbbingly sure he was there as she entered a drugstore and bought a berline bonbon a confection guaranteed to increase the chronic nervous indigestion from which stenographers suffer her shadow lover tried to hold her hand she snatched it away and blushed she fancied that a matron at the next tiny table was watching her silly play reflected in the enormous mirror behind the marble sodacounter the lover vanished as she left the drugstore una was pretending that she was still pretending but found it difficult to feel so very exhilarated  she permitted herself to go to a motionpicture show she looked over all the posters in front of the theater and a trainwreck a seaside lovescene a detective drama all invited her  a man in the seat in front of her in the theater nestled toward his sweetheart and harshly muttered oh you old honey in the red light from the globe marking an exit she saw his huge red hand with its thicket of little golden hairs creep toward the hand of the girl  una longed for a lovescene on the motionpicture screen  the old slow familiar pain of congestion in the back of her neck came back but she forgot the pain when the lovescene did appear in a picture of a lake shore with a hotel porch the flat sheen of photographed water rushing boats and a young hero with wavy black hair who dived for the lady and bore her out when she fell out of a reasonably safe boat the actors wet white flannels clung tight about his massive legs he threw back his head with masculine arrogance then kissed the lady una was dizzy with that kiss she was shrinking before walters lips again she could feel her respectable typewriterhardened fingers stroke the actors swarthy virile jaw she gasped with the vividness of the feeling she was shocked at herself told herself she was not being nice looked guiltily about but passionately she called for the presence of her vague imaginary lover  oh my dear my dear my dear she whispered with a terrible cloistered sweetnesswhispered to love itself  deliberately ignoring the mother who waited at home she determined to spend a riotous evening going to a real theater a real play that is if she could get a fiftycent seat  she could not  its been exciting running away even if i cant go to the theater una comforted herself ill go down to lady sessionss this evening ill pack mother off to bed ill take the sessionses up some icecream and well have a jolly time mother wont care if i go or maybe shell come with meknowing all the while that her mother would not come and decidedly would care if una deserted her  however negligible her mother seemed from downtown she loomed gigantic as una approached their flat and assured herself that she was glad to be returning to the dear one  the flat was on the fifth floor  it was a dizzying climbparticularly on this hot afternoon   § 6  as una began to trudge up the flatsounding slate treads she discovered that her head was aching as though some one were pinching the top of her eyeballs each time she moved her head the pain came in a perceptible wave the hallway reeked with that smell of onions and fried fish which had arrived with the first tenants children were dragging noisy objects about the halls as the throb grew sharper during the centuries it took her to climb the first three flights of stairs una realized how hot she was how the clammy coolness of the hall was penetrated by stabs of street heat which entered through the sunhaloed windows at the stair landings  una knocked at the door of her flat with that light cheery tapping of her nails like a fairy tattoo which usually brought her mother running to let her in she was conscious almost with a physical sensation of her mother wanted to hold her close and in the ecstasy of that caress squeeze the office weariness from her soul the little mother saintshe was coming nowshe was hurrying  but the little mother was not hurrying there was no response to unas knock as una stooped in the dimness of the hallway to search in her bag for her latchkey the pain pulsed through the top of her head again she opened the door and her longing for the embrace of her mother disappeared in healthy anger  the livingroom was in disorder her mother had not touched it all dayhad gone off and left it  this is a little too much una said grimly  the only signs of life were mrs goldens pack of cards for solitaire her worn brown morrischair and accretions of the cheap magazines with prettygirl covers which mrs golden ransacked for lovestories mrs golden had been reading all the evening before and pages of newspapers were crumpled in her chair not one of them picked up the couch where una had slept because it had been too hot for the two of them in a double bed was still an eruption of bedclothesthe pillow wadded up the sheets dragging out across the unswept floor the room represented discomfort highly respectable povertyand cleaning which una had to do before she could rest  she sat down on the couch and groaned to have to come home to this i simply cant trust mother she hasnt done onesinglething not one single thing and if it were only the first time but its every day pretty nearly shes been asleep all day and then gone for a walk oh yes of course shell come back and say shed forgotten this was saturday and id be home early oh of course  from the bedroom came a cough then another una tried to keep her soft little heart in its temporary state of hardness long enough to have some effect on household discipline huh she grunted got a cold again if shed only stay outdoors a little  she stalked to the door of the bedroom the blind was down the window closed the room stifling and filled with a yellow unwholesome glimmer from the bed her mothers voice changed from its usual ring to a croak that was crepuscular as the creepy room wheezed thatyoudeary i gotsummercoldso sorryleave work undone  if you would only keep your windows open my dear mother  una marched to the window snapped up the blind banged up the sash and left the room  i really cant see why was all she added she did not look at her mother  she slapped the livingroom into order as though the disordered bedclothes and newspapers were bad children she put the potatoes on to boil she loosened her tight collar and sat down to read the comic strips the beauty hints and the daily instalment of the husbandandwife serial in her evening paper una had nibbled at shakespeare tennyson longfellow and vanity fair in her highschool days but none of these had satisfied her so deeply as did the serials hint of sex and husband she was absorbed by it yet all the while she was irritably conscious of her mothers coughhacking soresounding throatcatching una was certain that this was merely one of the frequent imaginary ailments of her mother who was capable of believing that she had cancer every time she was bitten by a mosquito but this incessant crackling made una jumpily anxious  she reached these words in the serial i cannot forget amy that whatever i am my good old mother made me with her untiring care and the gentle words she spoke to me when worried and harassed with doubt  una threw down the paper rushed into the bedroom crouched beside her mother crying oh my mother sweetheart youre just everything to me and kissed her forehead  the forehead was damp and cold like a cellar wall una sat bolt up in horror her mothers face had a dusky flush her lips were livid as clotted blood her arms were stiff hard to the touch her breathing rapid and agitated like a frightened panting was interrupted just then by a cough like the rattling of stiff heavy paper which left on her purple lips a little colorless liquid  mother mother my little motheryoure sick youre really sick and i didnt know and i spoke so harshly oh what is it what is it mother dear  badcold mrs golden whispered i started coughing last nighti closed the dooryou didnt hear me you were in the other room another cough wheezed dismally shook her gurgled in her yellow deeplined neck ccould i havewindow closed now  no im going to be your nurse just an awfully cranky old nurse and so scientific and you must have fresh air her voice broke oh and me sleeping away from you ill never do it again i dont know what i would do if anything happened to you do you feel any headache dear  nonotnot so much as side pains mehere  mrs goldens words labored like a steamer in heavy seas the throbbing of her heart shook them like the throb of the engines she put her hand to her right side shakily with effort it lay there yellow against the white muslin of her nightgown then fell heavily to the bed like a dead thing una trembled with fear as her mother continued my pulseits so fastso hard breathingside pain  ill put on an ice compress and then ill go and get a doctor  mrs golden tried to sit up oh no no no not a doctor not a doctor she croaked doctor smyth will be busy  well ill have him come when hes through  oh no no cant afford  why  andthey scare you sohed pretend i had pneumonia like sams sisterhed frighten me soi just have a summer cold iill be all right tomorrow deary oh no no please dont please dont get a doctor cant afford itcant  pneumonia at the word which brought the sterile bitterness of winter into this fetid august room una was in a rigor of fear yet galvanized with belief in her mothers bravery my brave brave little mother she thought  not till una had promised that she would not summon the doctor was her mother quieted though una made the promise with reservations she relieved the pain in her mothers side with ice compressesthe ice chipped from the pitiful little cake in their tiny icebox she freshened pillows she smoothed sheets she made hot broth and bathed her mothers shoulders with tepid water and rubbed her temples with menthol but the fever increased and at times mrs golden broke through her shallow slumber with meaningless sentences like the beginning of delirium  at midnight she was panting more and more rapidlythree times as fast as normal breathing she was sunk in a stupor and una brooding by the bed a crouched figure of mute tragedy in the low light grew more and more apprehensive as her mother seemed to be borne away from her una started up she would risk her mothers displeasure and bring the doctor just then even doctor smyth of the neighborhood practice and obstetrical habits seemed a miracleworker  she had to go four blocks to the nearest drugstore that would be open at this time of night and there telephone the doctor  she was aware that it was raining for the fireescape outside shone wet in the light from a window across the narrow court she discovered she had left mackintosh and umbrella at the office stopping only to set out a clean towel a spoon and a glass on the chair by the bed una put on the old sweater which she secretly wore under her cheap thin jacket in winter she lumbered wearily downstairs she prayed confusedly that god would give her back her headache and in reward make her mother well  she was downstairs at the heavy grilled door rain was pouring a light six stories up in the apartmenthouse across the street seemed infinitely distant and lonely curtained from her by the rain water splashed in the street and gurgled in the gutters it did not belong to the city as it would have belonged to brown woods or prairie it was violent here shocking and terrible it took distinct effort for una to wade out into it  the modern city subway asphalt a wireless message winging overhead and una golden an officewoman in eyeglasses yet sickness and rain and night were abroad and it was a clumsily wrapped peasant woman bentshouldered and heavily breathing who trudged unprotected through the dark sidestreets as though she were creeping along moorland paths her thought was dulled to everything but physical discomfort and the illness which menaced the beloved womans eternal agony for the sick of her family had transformed the trim smoothness of the officewomans face into wrinkles that were tragic and ruggedly beautiful   § 7  again una climbed the endless stairs to her flat she unconsciously counted the beat of the weary regular rhythm which her feet made on the slate treads and the landingsone two three four five six seven landing turn andone two three four five six sevenover and over at the foot of the last flight she suddenly believed that her mother needed her this instant she broke the regular thumping rhythm of her climb dashed up cried out at the seconds wasted in unlocking the door she tiptoed into the bedroomand found her mother just as she had left her in unas low groan of gladness there was all the worlds selfsacrifice all the fidelity to a cause or to a love but as she sat unmoving she came to feel that her mother was not there her being was not in this wreck upon the bed  in an hour the doctor soothed his way into the flat he was afraid there might be just a little touch of pneumonia with breezy fatherliness which inspirited una he spoke of the possible presence of pneumococcus of doing magic things with romers serum of trusting in god of the rain of cold baths and digitalin he patted unas head and cheerily promised to return at dawn he yawned and smiled at himself he looked as roundly fuzzily sleepy as a bunny rabbit but in the quiet forlorn room of night and illness he radiated trust in himself una said to herself he certainly must know what he is talking about  she was sure that the danger was over she did not go to bed however she sat stiffly in the bedroom and planned amusements for her mother she would work harder earn more money they would move to a cottage in the suburbs where they would have chickens and roses and a kitten and her mother would find neighborly people again  five days after late on a bright cool afternoon when all the flats about them were thinking of dinner her mother died   § 8  there was a certain madness in unas grief her agony was a big simple uncontrollable emotion like the fanaticism of a crusaderalarming it was not to be reckoned with and beautiful as a storm yet it was no more morbid than the little fits of rage with which a schoolteacher relieves her cramped spirit for the first time she had the excuse to exercise her full power of emotion  una evoked an image of her mother as one who had been altogether good understanding clever and unfortunate she regretted every moment she had spent away from herremembered with scorn that she had planned to go to the theater the preceding saturday instead of sanctifying the time in the nirvana of the beloveds presence repented with writhing agony having spoken harshly about neglected household duties  she even contrived to find it a virtue in her mother that she had so often forgotten the daily tasksher mind had been too fine for such things una retraced their life but she remembered everything only as one remembers under the sway of music  if i could just have another hour just one hour with her and feel her hands on my eyes again  on the night before the funeral she refused to let even mrs sessions stay with her she did not want to share her mothers shadowy presence with any one  she lay on the floor beside the bed where her mother was stately in death it was her last chance to talk to her  mother  mother  dont you hear me its una calling cant you answer me this one last time oh mother think mother dear i cant ever hear your voice again if you dont speak to me now dont you remember how we went home to panama our last vacation dont you remember how happy we were down at the lake little mother you havent forgotten have you even if you dont answer you know im watching by you dont you see im kissing your hand oh you did want me to sleep near you again this last night oh my god oh my god the last night i shall ever spend with her the very last last night  all night long the thin voice came from the little whiteclad figure so insignificant in the dimness now lying motionless on the comforter she had spread beside the bed and talking in a tone of ordinary conversation that was uncanny in this room of invisible whisperers now leaping up to kiss the dead hand in a panic lest it should already be gone  the funeral filled the house with intruders the drive to the cemetery was irritating she wanted to leap out of the carriage at first she concentrated on the cushion beside her till she thought of nothing in the world but the faded bottlegreen upholstery and a ridiculous drift of dust in the tufting but some one was talking to her it was awkward mr sessions for shrewd mrs sessions had the genius to keep still he kept stammering the most absurd platitudes about how happy her mother must be in a heaven regarding which he did not seem to have very recent or definite knowledge she was annoyed not comforted she wanted to break away to find her mothers presence again in that sacred place where she had so recently lived and spoken  yet when una returned to the flat something was gone she tried to concentrate on thought about immortality she found that she had absolutely no facts upon which to base her thought the hundreds of good sound orthodox sermons she had heard gave her nothing but vague pictures of an eternal church supper somewhere in the cloudsnothing blankly and terribly nothing that answered her bewildered wonder as to what had become of the spirit which had been there and now was gone  in the midst of her mingling of longing and doubt she realized that she was hungry and she rather regretted having refused mrs sessionss invitation to dinner she moved slowly about the kitchen  the rheumatic old canary hobbled along the floor of his cage and tried to sing at that una wept she never will hear poor dickie sing again  instantly she rememberedas clearly as though she were actually listening to the voice and wordsthat her mother had burst out drat that bird it does seem as if every time i try to take a nap he just tries to wake me up una laughed grimly hastily she reproved herself oh but mother didnt mean  but in memory of that healthily vexed voice it seemed less wicked to take notice of food and after a reasonable dinner she put on her kimono and bedroom slippers carefully arranged the pillows on the couch and lay among them meditating on her future  for half an hour she was afire with an eager thought why cant i really make a success of business now that i can entirely devote myself to it theres womenin real estate and lawyers and magazine editorssome of them make ten thousand a year  so una golden ceased to live a smalltown life in new york so she became a genuine part of the world of offices took thought and tried to conquer this new way of citydwelling  maybe i can find out if theres anything in lifenowbesides working for t w till im scrapped like an old machine she pondered how i hate letters about twofamily houses in flatbush  she dug her knuckles into her forehead in the effort to visualize the problem of the hopeless women in industry  she was an average young woman on a job she thought in terms of money and offices yet she was one with all the men and women young and old who were creating a new age she was nothing in herself yet as the molecule of water belongs to the ocean so una golden humbly belonged to the leaven who however confusedly were beginning to demand why since we have machinery science courage need we go on tolerating war and poverty and caste and uncouthness and all that sheer clumsiness     part ii  the office  chapter ix   the effect of grief is commonly reputed to be noble but mostly it is a sterile nobility witness the widows who drape their musty weeds over all the living witness the mother of a son killed in war who urges her sons comrades to bring mourning to the mothers of all the sons on the other side  grief is a paralyzing poison it broke down unas resistance to the cares of the office hers was no wholesome labor in which she could find sacred forgetfulness it was the round of unessentials which all officewomen know so desperately well she bruised herself by shrinking from those hourly insults to her intelligence and outside the office her most absorbing comfort was in the luxury of mourningpassion in black even to the blackedged faceveil though she was human enough to realize that with her fair hair she looked rather well in mourning and shrewd enough to get it on credit at excellent terms  she was in the office all day being as curtly exact as she could but in the evening she sat alone in her flat and feared the city  sometimes she rushed down to the sessionses flat but the good people bored her with their assumption that she was panting to know all the news from panama she had drifted so far away from the town that the sixth assertion that it was a great pity kitty wilson was going to marry that worthless clark boy aroused no interest in her she was still more bored by their phonograph on which they played over and over the same twenty records she would make quick unconvincing excuses about having to hurry away their slippered stupidity was a desecration of her mothers memory  her halfhysterical fear of the citys power was increased by her daily encounter with the clamorous streets crowded elevators frantic lunchrooms and most of all the experience of the subway  amazing incredible the subway and the fact that human beings could become used to it consent to spend an hour in it daily there was a heroic side to this spectacle of steel trains clanging at forty miles an hour beneath twentystory buildings the engineers had done their work well made a great thought in steel and cement and then the business men and bureaucrats had made the great thought a curse there was in the subway all the romance which storytelling youth goes seeking trains crammed with an inconceivable complexity of peoplemarquises of the holy roman empire jewish factory hands speculators from wyoming iowa dairymen quarreling italian lovers with their dramatic tales their flux of every human emotion under the city mask but however striking these dramatic characters may be to the occasional spectator they figure merely as an odor a confusion to the permanent serf of the subway a long underground station a catacomb with a cement platform this was the chief feature of the city vista to the tired girl who waited there each morning a clean space but damp stale like the corridor to a prisonas indeed it was since through it each morning una entered the days business life  then the train approaching filling the tunnel like a piston smashing into a cylinder the shoving rush to get aboard a crush that was ruffling and fatiguing to a man but to a woman was horror  una stood with a hulking man pressing as close to her side as he dared and a dapper clerkling squeezed against her breast above her head to represent the citys culture and graciousness there were advertisements of soap stockings and collars at curves the wheels ground with a long savage whine the train heeled and she was flung into the arms of the grinning clerk who held her tight she who must never be so unladylike as to enter a pollingplace had breathed into her very mouth the clerklings virile electoral odor of cigarettes and onions and decayed teeth  a very good thing the subway it did make una quiver with the beginnings of rebellious thought as no suave preacher could ever have done almost hysterically she resented this daily indignity which smeared her clean cool womanhood with a grease of noise and smell and human contact  as was the subway so were her noons of elbowing to get impure food in restaurants  for reward she was permitted to work all day with troy wilkins and for heavens and green earth she had a chair and a desk  but the human organism which can modify itself to arctic cold and indian heat to incessant labor or the long enervation of luxury learns to endure unwilling dressing lonely breakfast the subway dull work lunch sleepiness after lunch the hopelessness of three oclock the bosss illtempers then the subway again and a lonely flat with no love no creative work and at last a long sleep so that she might be fresh for such another round of delight so went the days yet all through them she found amusement laughed now and then and proved the heroism as well as the unthinking servility of the human race   § 2  the need of feeling that there were people near to her urged una to sell her furniture and move from the flat to a boardinghouse  she avoided mrs sessionss advice she was sure that mrs sessions would bustle about and find her a respectable place where she would have to be cheery she didnt want to be cheery she wanted to think she even bought a serious magazine with articles not that she read it  but she was afraid to be alone any more anyway she would explore the city  of the many new yorks she had found only morningside park central park riverside drive the shopping district the restaurants and theaters which walter had discovered to her a few downtown office streets and her own arid region of flats she did not know the proliferating east side the factories the endless semisuburban stretchesnor fifth avenue her mother and mrs sessions had inculcated in her the earnest idea that most parts of new york werent quite nice in over two years in the city she had never seen a millionaire nor a criminal she knew the picturesqueness neither of wealth nor of pariah poverty  she did not look like an adventurer when at a saturday noon of october she left the officeslight kindly rather timid with her pale hair and schoolteacher eyeglasses and clear cheeks set off by comely mourning but she was seizing new york she said over and over why i can go and live any place i want to and maybe ill meet some folks who are simply fascinating she wasnt very definite about these fascinating folks but they implied girls to play with andshe hesitatedand decidedly men men different from walter who would touch her hand in courtly reverence  she poked through strange streets she carried an assortment of rooms and board clippings from the wantad page of a newspaper and obediently followed their hints about finding the perfect place she resolutely did not stop at places not advertised in the paper though nearly every house in some quarters had a sign room to rent una still had faith in the veracity of whatever appeared in the public prints as compared with what she dared see for herself  the advertisements led her into a dozen parts of the city frequented by roomers the lonely gray detached people who dwell in other peoples houses  it was not so splendid a quest as she had hoped it was too sharp a revelation of the cannonfood of the city the people who had never been trained and who had lost heart it was scarcely possible to tell one street from another to remember whether she was on sixteenth street or twentysixth always the same rows of redbrick or brownstone houses all alike the monotony broken only by infrequent warehouses or loftbuildings always the same doubtful mounting of stone steps the same searching for a bell the same waiting the same slatternly suspicious landlady the same evil hallway with a brown hatrack a steelengraving with one corner stained with yellow a carpet worn through to the flooring in a large oval hole just in front of the stairs a smell of cabbage a lack of ventilation always the same desire to escape though she waited politely while the landlady in the same familiar harsh voice went through the same formula  then before she could flee to the comparatively fresh air of the streets una would politely have to follow the panting landlady to a room that was a horror of dirty carpet lumpy mattress and furniture with everything worn off that could wear off and at last always the same phrases by which una meant to spare the woman well ill think it over thank you so much for showing me the rooms but before i decide want to look around  phrases which the landlady heard ten times a day  she conceived a greathearted pity for landladies they were so patient in face of her evident distaste even their suspiciousness was but the growling of a beaten dog they sighed and closed their doors on her without much attempt to persuade her to stay her heart ached with their lack of imagination they had no more imagination than those landladies of the insect world the spiders with their unchanging instinctive ancestral types of webs  her depression was increased by the desperate physical weariness of the hunt not that afternoon not till two weeks later did she find a room in a large long somber railroad flat on lexington avenue conducted by a curlyhaired young bookkeeper and his pretty wife who provided their clients with sympathy with extensive and scientific data regarding the motionpicture houses in the neighborhood and board which was neither scientific nor very extensive  it was time for una to sacrifice the last material contact with her mother to sell the furniture which she had known ever since as a baby in panama she had crawled from this horsehair chair all the long and perilous way across this same brown carpet to this redplush couch   § 3  it was not so hard to sell the furniture she could even read and burn her fathers letters with an unhappy resoluteness despite her tenderness una had something of youths joy in getting rid of old things as preparation for acquiring the new she did sob when she found her mothers straw hat just as mrs golden had left it on the high shelf of the wardrobe as though her mother might come in at any minute put it on and start for a walk she sobbed again when she encountered the tiny tear in the bottom of the couch which her own baby fingers had made in trying to enlarge a pirates cave that brought the days when her parents were immortal and allwise when the home sittingroom where her father read the paper aloud was a security against all the formidable world outside  but to these recollections una could shut her heart to one absurd thing because it was living una could not shut her heartto the senile canary  possibly she could have taken it with her but she felt confusedly that dickie would not be appreciated in other peoples houses she evaded asking the sessionses to shelter the bird because every favor that she permitted from that smug family was a bond that tied her to their life of married spinsterhood  oh dickie dickie what am i going to do with you she cried slipping a finger through the wires of the cage  the canary hopped toward her and tried to chirp his greeting  even when you were sick you tried to sing to me and mother did love you she sighed i just cant kill youtrusting me like that  she turned her back seeking to solve the problem by ignoring it while she was sorting dressessome trace of her mother in every fold every wrinkle of the waists and lace collarsshe was listening to the bird in the cage  ill think of some wayill find somebody who will want you dickie dear she murmured desperately now and then  after dinner and nightfall with her nerves twanging all the more because it seemed silly to worry over one dissolute old bird when all her life was breaking up she hysterically sprang up snatched dickie from the cage and trotted downstairs to the street  ill leave you somewhere somebody will find you she declared  concealing the bird by holding it against her breast with a hand supersensitive to its warm little feathers she walked till she found a deserted tenement doorway she hastily set the bird down on a stone balustrade beside the entrance steps dickie chirped more cheerily more sweetly than for many days and confidingly hopped back to her hand  oh i cant leave him for boys to torture and i cant take him i cant  in a sudden spasm she threw the bird into the air and ran back to the flat sobbing i cant kill iti canttheres so much death longing to hear the quavering affection of its song once more but keeping herself from even going to the window to look for it with bitter haste she completed her work of getting rid of thingsthingsthingsthe things which were stones of an imprisoning past   § 4  shyness was over una when at last she was in the house of strangers she sat marveling that this square white cubbyhole of a room was hers permanently that she hadnt just come here for an hour or two she couldnt get it to resemble her first impression of it now the hallway was actually a part of her lifeevery morning she would face the picture of a magazinecover girl when she came out of her room  her agitation was increased by the problem of keeping up the maiden modesty appropriate to a golden a young female friend of the sessionses in a small flat with gentlemen lodgers and just one bathroom una was saved by not having a spinster friend with whom to share her shrinking modesty she simply had to take waiting for her turn at the bathroom as a matter of course and insensibly she was impressed by the decency with which these dull ordinary people solved the complexities of their enforced intimacy when she wildly clutched her virgin bathrobe about her and passed a man in the hall he stalked calmly by without any of the teetering apologies which broadbeamed mr sessions had learned from his genteel spouse  she could not at first distinguish among her companions gradually they came to be distinct important they held numberless surprises for her she would not have supposed that a bookkeeper in a fishmarket would be likely to possess charm particularly if he combined that amorphous occupation with being a boardinghouse proprietor yet her landlord herbert gray with his look of a trackathlete his confessions of ignorance and his naïve enthusiasms about whatever in the motion pictures seemed to him heroic large colorful was as admirable as the several youngsters of her town who had plodded through princeton or pennsylvania and come back to practise law or medicine or gentlemanly inheritance of business and his wife round and comely laughing easily wearing her clothes with an untutored grace which made her cheap waists smart was so thoroughly her husbands comrade in everything that these struggling nobodies had all the riches of the earth  the grays took una in as though she were their guest but they did not bother her they were cityborn taught by the city to let other people live their own lives  the grays had taken a flat twice too large for their own use the other lodgers who lived like monks on a bare corridor along the narrow railroad hall were three besides una  a city failure one with a hundred thousand failures a grayhaired neat man who had been everything and done nothing and who now said evasively that he was in the collection business he read dickens and played a masterful game of chess he liked to have it thought that his past was brave with mysterious splendors he spoke hintingly of great lawyers but he had been near to them only as a clerk for a large law firm he was grateful to any one for noticing him like most of the failures he had learned the art of doing nothing at all all sunday except for a two hours walk in central park and one game of chess with herbert gray he dawdled in his room slept regarded his stockingfeet with an appearance of profound meditation yawned picked at the sunday newspaper una once saw him napping on a radiant autumn sunday afternoon and detested him but he was politely interested in her work for troy wilkins carefully exact in saying goodmorning miss and he became as familiar to her as the gasheater in her cubicle  second fellowlodger was a busy reserved woman originally from kansas city who had something to do with some branch library she had solved the problems of womans lack of place in this city scheme by closing tight her emotions her sense of adventure her hope of friendship she never talked to una after discovering that una had no interesting opinions on the best reading for children nine to eleven  these gentle inconsequential city waifs the grays the failure the librarywoman meant no more to una than the crowds who were near yet so detached in the streets but the remaining boarder annoyed her by his noisy whine he was an underbred maverick with sharp eyes of watery blue a thin mustache large teeth and no chin worth noticing he would bounce in of an evening when the others were being decorous and dull in the musty diningroom and yelp how do we all find our seskpadalian selves this bright and balmy evenin how does your perspegacity discipulate herby whats the good word miss golden well well well if here aint our good old friend the rev j pilkington corned beef how r you pilky old mrs cabbage feelin well too well well still discussing the movies herby got any new opinions about mary pickford well well say i met another guy thats as nutty as you herby he thinks that wilhelm jenkins bryan is a great statesman lets hear some more about the sage of free silver herby  the little man was never content till he had drawn them into so bitter an argument that some one would rise throw down a napkin growl well if thats all you know about itif youre all as ignorant as that you simply aint worth arguing with and stalk out when general topics failed the disturber would catechize the librarywoman about louisa m alcott or the failure about his desultory inquiries into christian science or mrs gray about the pictures plastering the diningrooma dozen spiritual revelations of apples and oranges which she had bought at a departmentstore sale  the mavericks name was fillmore j benson strangers called him benny but his more intimate acquaintances those to whom he had talked for at least an hour were requested to call him phil he made a number of pretty puns about his first name he was surprisingly a doctornot the sort that studies science but the sort that studies the gullibility of human naturea doctor of manipulative osteology he had earned a diploma by a correspondence course and had scrabbled together a small practice among retired shopkeepers he was one of the strange impudent race of fakers who prey upon the clever city he didnt expect any one at the grays to call him a doctor  he drank whisky and gambled for pennies was immoral in his relations with women and as thickskinned as he was blatant he had been a newsboy a contractors clerk and climbed up by the application of his wits he read enormouslynewspapers cheap magazines medical books he had an opinion about everything and usually worsted every one at the grays in arguments and he did his patients good by giving them sympathy and massage he would have been an excellent citizen had the city not preferred to train him as a child in its reeling streets to a sharp unscrupulousness  una was at first disgusted by phil benson then perplexed he would address her in stately shakespearean phrases which as a boy he had heard from the gallery of the academy of music he would quote poetry at her she was impressed when he almost silenced the librarywoman in an argument as to whether longfellow or whittier was the better poet by parroting the whole of snow bound  she fancied that phils general peaweevil aspect concealed the soul of a poet but she was shocked out of her pleasant fabling when phil roared at mrs gray say what did the baker use this pie for a bureau or a trunk ive found three pairs of socks and a safetypin in my slab so far  pretty mrs gray was hurt and indignant while her husband growled aw dont pay any attention to that human phonograph amy hes got bats in his belfry  una had acquired a hesitating fondness for the mute gentleness of the others and it infuriated her that this insect should spoil their picnic but after dinner phil benson dallied over to her sat on the arm of her chair and said im awfully sorry that i make such a bum hit with you miss golden oh i can see i do all right youre the only one here that can understand somehow it seems to meyou arent like other women i know theres somethingsomehow its different aa temperament you dream about higher things than just food and clothes oh he held up a deprecating hand dont deny it im mighty serious about it miss golden i can see it even if you havent waked up to it as yet  the absurd part of it was that at least while he was talking mr phil benson did believe what he was saying though he had borrowed all of his sentiments from a magazine story about hobohemians which he had read the night before  he also spoke of reading good books seeing good plays and the lack of good influences in this wicked city  he didnt overdo it he took leave in ten minutesto find good influences in a kelly poolparlor on third avenue he returned to his room at ten and sitting with his shoeless feet cocked up on his bed read a story in racy yarns while beyond the partition about four feet from him una golden lay in bed her smooth arms behind her aching head and worried about phils lack of opportunity  she was finding in his loud impudence a twisted resemblance to walter babsons erratic excitability and that won her for love goes seeking new images of the god that is dead  next evening phil varied his tactics by coming to dinner early just touching unas hand as she was going into the diningroom and murmuring in a small voice ive been thinking so much of the helpful things you said last evening miss golden  later phil talked to her about his longing to be a great surgeonin which he had the tremendous advantage of being almost sincere he walked down the hall to her room and said goodnight lingeringly holding her hand  una went into her room closed the door and for full five minutes stood amazed why she gasped the little man is trying to make love to me  she laughed over the absurdity of it heavens she had her ideal the right man he would probably be like walter babsonthough more dependable but whatever the nature of the paragon he would in every respect be just the opposite of the creature who had been saying goodnight to her  she sat down tried to read the paper tried to put phil out of her mind but he kept returning she fancied that she could hear his voice in the hall she dropped the paper to listen  im actually interested in him she marveled oh thats ridiculous   § 5  now that walter had made a mans presence natural to her una needed a man the excitation of his touch the solace of his voice she could not patiently endure a cloistered vacuousness  even while she was vigorously representing to herself that he was preposterous she was uneasily aware that phil was masculine his talons were strong she could feel their clutch on her hands hes a rat and i do wish he wouldntspit she shuddered but under her scorn was a surge of emotion a man not much of a man yet a man had wanted the contact of her hand been eager to be with her sensations vast as night or the ocean whirled in her small white room desire and curiosity even more made her restless as a wave  she caught herself speculating as she plucked at the sleeve of her black mourning waist i wonder would i be more interesting if i had the orangeandbrown dress i was going to make when mother died oh shame  yet she sprang up from the whiteenameled rocker tucked in her graceless cotton corsetcover stared at her image in the mirror smoothed her neck till the skin reddened   § 6  phil talked to her for an hour after their sundaynoon dinner she had been to church had confessed indeterminate sins to a formless and unresponsive deity she felt righteous and showed it phil caught the cue he sacrificed all the witty things he was prepared to say about mrs grays dumplings he gazed silently out of the window till she wondered what he was thinking about then he stumblingly began to review a sermon which he said he had heard the previous sundaythough he must have been mistaken as he shot several games of kelly pool every sunday morning or slept till noon  the preacher spoke of womans influence you dont know what it is to lack a womans influence in a fellows life miss golden i can see the awful consequences among my patients i tell you when i sat there in church and saw the colored windows he sighed portentously his hand fell across hershis lean paw strong and warmblooded from massaging puffy old men i tell you i just got sentimental i did thinking of all i lacked  phil melted mournfully awayto indulge in a highly cheerful walk on upper broadway with miss becky rosenthal sewer for the sans peur pants and overalls companywhile in her room una grieved over his forlorn desire to be good   § 7  two evenings later when november warmed to a passing indian summer of golden skies that were pitifully far away from the little folk in city streets una was so restless that she set off for a walk by herself  phil had been silent glancing at her and away as though he were embarrassed  i wish i could do something to help him she thought as she poked downstairs to the entrance of the apartmenthouse  phil was on the steps smoking a cigarettesized cigar scratching his chin and chattering with his kinsmen the gutter sparrows  he doffed his derby he spun his cigar from him with a deft flip of his fingers which somehow agitated her she called herself a little fool for being agitated but she couldnt get rid of the thought that only men snapped their fingers like that  goin to the movies miss golden  no i was just going for a little walk  well say walks thats where i live why dont you invite uncle phil to come along and show you the town why i knew this burg when they went picnicking at the reservoir in bryant park  he swaggered beside her without an invitation he did not give her a chance to decline his companyand soon she did not want to he led her down to gramercy park loveliest memory of village days houses of a demure red and white ringing a fenced garden he pointed out to her the princeton club the columbia club the national arts and the players and declared that two men leaving the last were john drew and the most famous editor in america he guided her over to stuyvesant park a barren square out of old london with a quaker school on one side and the voluble ghetto on the other he conducted her through east side streets where jewish lovers parade past miles of pushcarts and venerable rabbis read the talmud between sales of cotton socks and showed her a little café which was a hangout for thieves she was excited by this contact with the underworld  he took her to a lithuanian restaurant on a street which was a débâcle one half of the restaurant was filled with shaggy lithuanians playing cards at filthy tables the other half was a clean haunt for tourists who came to see the slums and here in the heart of these slums saw only one another  wait a while phil said and a bunch of seeingnewyorkers will land here and think were crooks  in ten minutes a vanload of sheepish trippers from the middle west filed into the restaurant and tried to act as though they were used to cocktails una was delighted when she saw them secretly peering at phil and herself she put one hand on her thigh and one on the table leaned forward and tried to look tough while phil pretended to be quarreling with her and the trippers simple souls were enthralled by this glimpse of two criminals una really enjoyed the acting for a moment phil was her companion in play and when the trippers had gone rustling out to view other haunts of vice she smiled at phil unrestrainedly  instantly he took advantage of her smile of their companionship  he was really as simplehearted as the trippers in his tactics  she had been drinking gingerale he urged her now to have a real drink he muttered confidentially have a nip of sherry or a new orleans fizz or a bronx thatll put heart into you not enough to affect you atall but just enough to cheer up on then well go to a dance and really have a time gee poor kid you dont get any fun  no no i never touch it she said and she believed it forgetting the claret she had drunk with walter babson  she felt unsafe  he laughed at her assured her from his medical experience that lots of women need a little tonic and boisterously ordered a glass of sherry for her  she merely sipped it she wanted to escape all their momentary frankness of association was gone she feared him she hated the complaisant waiter who brought her the drink the fat proprietor who would take his pieces of silver though they were the price of her soul the policeman on the pavement who would never think of protecting her and the whole hideous city which benignly profited by saloons she watched another couple down at the end of the rooman obese man and a young pretty girl who was hysterically drunk not because she had attended the womens christian temperance union at panama and heard them condemn the demon rum but because the sickish smell of the alcohol was all about her now she suddenly turned into a crusader she sprang up seized her gloves snapped i will not touch the stuff she marched down the room out of the restaurant and away not once looking back at phil  in about fifteen seconds she had a humorous picture of phil trying to rush after her but stopped by the waiter to pay his check she began to wonder if she hadnt been slightly ridiculous in attempting to slay demon rum by careering down the restaurant but i dont care she said stoutly im glad i took a stand instead of just rambling along and wondering what it was all about the way i did with walter  phil caught up to her and instantly began to complain say you certainly made a sight out of yourselfand out of meleaving me sitting there with the waiter laughing his boob head off at me lord ill never dare go near the place again  your own fault this problem was so clear so unconfused to her  it wasnt all my fault he said you didnt have to take a drink his voice fell to a pathetic whimper i was showing you hospitality the best way i knew how you wont never know how you hurt my feelins  the problem instantly became complicated again perhaps she had hurt his rudimentary sense of courtesy perhaps walter babson would have sympathized with phil not with her she peeped at phil he trailed along with a forlorn baby look which did not change  she was very uncomfortable as she said a brief goodnight at the flat she half wished that he would give her a chance to recant she saw him and his injured feelings as enormously important  she undressed in a tremor of misgiving she put her thin pretty kimono over her nightgown braided her hair and curled on the bed condemning herself for having been so supercilious to the rat who had never had a chance  it was latelong after elevenwhen there was a tapping on the door  she started listened rigidly  phils voice whispered from the hall open your door just half an inch miss golden something i wanted to say  her pity for him made his pleading request like a command she drew her kimono close and peeped out at him  i knew you were up he whispered saw the light under your door i been so worried i didnt mean to shock you or nothing but if you feel i did mean to i want to apologize gee me i couldnt sleep one wink if i thought you was offended  its all right she began  say come into the diningroom everybody gone to bed i want to explaingee you gotta give me a chance to be good if you dont use no good influence over me nobody never will i guess  his whisper was full of masculine urgency husky bold she shivered she hesitated did not answer  all right he mourned i dont blame you none but its pretty hard  ill come just for a moment she said and shut the door  she was excited flushed she wrapped her braids around her head gentle braids of pale gold and her undistinguished face thus framed was young and sweet  she hastened out to the diningroom  what was the parlor by day the grays used for their own bedroom but the diningroom had a big ugly leather settee and two rockers and it served as a secondary livingroom  here phil waited at the end of the settee she headed for a rocker but he piled sofacushions for her at the other end of the settee and she obediently sank down there  listen he said in a tone of lofty lamentation i dont know as i can ever ever make you understand i just wanted to give you a good time i seen you was in mourning and i thinks maybe you could brighten her up a little  i am sorry i didnt understand  una una do you suppose you could ever stoop to helping a bad egg like me he demanded  his hand fell on hers it comforted her chilly hand she let it lie there speech became difficult for her  why why yes she stammered  in reaction to her scorn of him she was all accepting faith  oh if you couldand if i could make you less lonely sometimes  in his voice was a perilous tenderness for the rat trained to beguile neurotic patients in his absurd practice could croon like the very mother of pity  yes i am lonely sometimes she heard herself admittingfaroff dreaming needing the close affection that her mother and walter had once given her  poor little girlyoure so much better raised and educated than me but you got to have friendship jus same  his arm was about her shoulder for a second she leaned against him  all her scorn of him suddenly gathered in one impulse she sprang upjust in time to catch a grin on his face  you gutterrat she said you arent worth my telling you what you are you wouldnt understand you cant see anything but the gutter  he was perfectly unperturbed poor stuff kid weak comeback sounds like a drayma but say listen honest kid you got me wrong whats the harm in a little hugging  she fled she was safe in her room she stood with both arms outstretched she did not feel soiled by this dirty thing she was triumphant in the silhouette of a watertank atop the nextdoor apartmenthouse she saw a strong tower of faith  now i dont have to worry about him i dont have to make any more decisions i know im through no one can get me just because of curiosity about sex again im free i can fight my way through in business and still keep clean i can i was hungry forfor even that rat iuna golden yes i was but i dont want to go back to him ive won  oh walter walter i do want you dear but ill get along without you and ill keep a little sacred image of you     chapter x   the threefourths of una employed in the office of mr troy wilkins was going through one of those periods of unchanging routine when all past drama seems unreal when nothing novel happens nor apparently ever will happensuch a time of dull peacefulness as makes up the major part of our lives  her only definite impressions were the details of daily work the physical aspects of the office and the presence of the boss   § 2  day after day the same details of the job letters arriving assorted opened answered by dictation the answers sealed and stamped and almost every day the same panting crisis of getting off some cosmically important letter the reception of callers welcome to clients considerate but firm assurances to persons looking for positions that there was no opening just at present the suave answering of irritating telephone calls the filing of letters and plans the clipping of realestatetransfer items from newspapers the supervision of bessie kraker and the officeboy  equally fixed were the details of the grubby office itself like many men who have pride in the smartest suburban homes available mr wilkins was content with an office shabby and inconvenient he regarded beautiful offices as in some way effeminate his wasnt effeminate it was undecorative as a filled ashtray despite unas daily following up of the careless scrubwomen with dustcloth and whisk she knew every inch of it as a gardener knows his plot she could never keep from noticing and running her finger along the pebbled glass of the oakandglass partition about mr wilkinss private office each of the hundreds of times a day she passed it and when she lay awake at midnight her fingertips would recall precisely the feeling of that rough surface even to the sharp edges of a tiny flaw in the glass over the bookcase  or she would recall the floorragsymbol of the hard realness of the office grind  it always hung over the twisted bulbous lead pipes below the stationary basin in the womens washroom provided by the septimus building for the women on three floors it was a rag ancient and slategray grotesquely stiff and grotesquely hairy at its frayed edgesa corpse of a scrubrag in rigor mortis una was annoyed with herself for ever observing so unlovely an object but in the moment of relaxation when she went to wash her hands she was unduly sensitive to that eternal rag and to the griminess of the washroomthe cracked and yellowstained washbowl the cold water that stung in winter the rollertowel which she spun round and round in the effort to find a dry clean square space till in a spasm of revulsion she would bolt out of the washroom with her face and hands half dried  womans place is in the home una was doubtless purely perverse in competing with men for the commercial triumphs of running that gray wet towel round and round on its clattering roller and of wondering whether for the entire remainder of her life she would see that dead scrubrag  it was no less annoying a fact that bessie and she had only one wastebasket which was invariably at bessies desk when una reached for it  or that the door of the supplycupboard always shivered and stuck  or that on thursday which is the three pm of the week it seemed impossible to endure the tedium till saturday noon and that invariably her money was gone by friday so that friday lunch was always a mere insult to her hunger and she could never get her gloves from the cleaner till after saturday payday  una knew the office to a point where it offered few beautiful surprises  and she knew the tactics of mr troy wilkins  all managersbosseschiefshave tactics for keeping discipline tricks which they conceive as profoundly hidden from their underlings and which are intimately known and discussed by those underlings there are the bosses who bluff those who lie those who give goodfellowship or grave courtesy in lieu of wages none of these was mr wilkins he was dully honest and clumsily paternal but he was a roarer a grumbler he bawled and ordained in order to encourage industry and keep his lambs from asking for raises thus also he tried to conceal his own mistakes when a missing letter for which everybody had been anxiously searching was found on his own desk instead of in the files he would blare well why didnt you tell me you put it on my desk heh he was a delayer also and in poker patois a passer of the buck he would feebly hold up a decision for weeks then make a whole campaign of getting his office to rush through the task in order to catch up have a form of masculinecommuter hysterics because una and bessie didnt do the typing in a miraculously short time he never cursed he was an ecclesiastical believer that one of the chief aims of man is to keep from saying those mystic words hell and damn but he could make darn it and why in tunket sound as profane as a gamblingden there was included in unas duties the pretense of believing that mr wilkins was the greatest singlehanded villa architect in greater new york sometimes it nauseated her but often he was rather pathetic in his shaky desire to go on having faith in his superseded ability and she would willingly assure him that his rivals the boisterous young firm of soule smith  fissleben were frauds  all these faults and devices of mr troy wilkins una knew doubtless he would have been astonished to hear that fact on evenings in his plateracked muchraftered highly builtin suburban diningroom when he discoursed to the admiring mrs wilkins and the mouselike little wilkinses on the art of office discipline or mornings in the second smoker of the 816 train when he told the other lords of the world that these stenographers are all alikeyou simply cant get em to learn system  it is not recorded whether mr wilkins also knew unas faultsher habit of falling adreaming at 330 and trying to make it up by working furiously at 430 her habit of awing the goodhearted bessie kraker by posing as a nun who had never been kissed nor ever wanted to be her graft of sending the officeboy out for tencent boxes of cocoanut candy and a certain resentful touchiness and ladylikeness which made it hard to give her necessary orders mr wilkins has never given testimony but he is not the villain of the tale and some authorities have a suspicion that he did not find una altogether perfect   § 3  it must not be supposed that una or her million sisters in business were constantly and actively bored by office routine  save once or twice a week when he roared and once or twice a month when she felt that thirteen dollars a week was too little she rather liked mr wilkinshis honesty his desire to make comfortable homes for people his cheerful goodmorning his way of interrupting dictation to tell her antiquated but jolly stories his stolid dependablelooking face  she had real satisfaction in the game of workin winning points and tricks in doing her work briskly and well in helping mr wilkins to capture clients she was eager when she popped in to announce to him that a wary longpursued prospect had actually called she was rather more interested in her days work than are the average of meaningless humanity who sell gingham and teach algebra and cure boils and repair lawnmowers because she was daily more able to approximate perfection to look forward to something betterto some splendid position at twenty or even twentyfive dollars a week she was certainly in no worse plight than perhaps ninetyfive million of her free and notoriously redblooded fellowcitizens  but she was in no better plight there was no drama no glory in affection nor so long as she should be tied to troy wilkinss dwindling business no immediate increase in power and the sameness the unceasing discussions with bessie regarding mr wilkinsmr wilkinss hat mr wilkinss latest command mr wilkinss lost fountainpen mr wilkinss rudeness to the salesman for the skyline roofing company mr wilkinss idiotic friendship for muldoon the contractor mr wilkinss pronounced unfairness to the officeboy in regard to a certain lateness in arrival  at best una got through day after day at worst she was as profoundly bored as an explorer in the arctic night   § 4  una the initiate newyorker continued her study of city ways and city currents during her lunchhours she went down to broad street to see the curb market marveled at the men with telephones in little coops behind opened windows stared at the great newspaper offices on park row the old city hall the mingling on lower broadway of skychallenging buildings with the history of prerevolutionary days she got a momentary prejudice in favor of socialism from listening to an attack upon it by a noontime oratora spotted badly dressed man whose favorite slur regarding socialists was that they were spotted and badly dressed she heard a negro shouting dithyrambics about some religion she could never make out  sometimes she lunched at a newspapercovered desk with bessie and the officeboy on cold ham and beans and small brightcolored cakes which the boy brought in from a bakery sometimes she had boiled eggs and cocoa at a childs restaurant with stenographers who ate baked apples rich napoleons and always coffee sometimes at a cafeteria carrying a tray she helped herself to crackers and milk and sandwiches sometimes at the arden tea room for women only she encountered charityworkers and virulently curious literary ladies whom she endured for the marked excellence of the arden chicken croquettes sometimes bessie tempted her to a chinese restaurant where bessie who came from the east side and knew a trick or two did not order chopsuey like a tourist but noodles and eggs fooyoung  in any case the lunchhour and the catalogue of what she was so vulgar as to eat were of importance in unas history because that hour broke the routine gave her for an hour a deceptive freedom of will of choice between boston beans andnew york beans and her triumphant common sense was demonstrated for she chose light digestible food and kept her head clear for the afternoon while her overlord mr troy wilkins like vast numbers of his fellow business men crammed himself with beefsteakandkidney pudding drugged himself with cigar smoke and pots of strong coffee and shoptalk spoke earnestly of the wickedness of drunkenness and then drunk with food and tobacco and coffee and talk came back dizzy blureyed slownerved and for two hours tried to get down to work  after hours of trudging through routine una went home  she took the elevated now instead of the subway that was important in her life it meant an entire change of scenery  on the elevated beside her all evening hovering over her bed at night was worry  oh i ought to have got all that norris correspondence copied today i must get at it first thing in the morning i wonder if mr wilkins was sore because i stayed out so long for lunch what would i do if i were fired  so would she worry as she left the office in the evening she wouldnt so much criticize herself as suddenly and without reason remember office settings and incidentsstartle at a picture of the tsquare at which she had stared while mr wilkins was telephoning she wasnt weary because she worried she worried because she was weary from the airless unnatural straining life she worried about everything available from her soul to her fingernails but the office offered the largest number of good opportunities  after all say the syndicated philosophers the office takes only eight or nine hours a day the other fifteen or sixteen you are free to do as you wishloaf study become an athlete this illuminative suggestion is usually reinforced by allusions to lincoln and edison  onlyyou arent a lincoln or an edison for the most part and you dont do any of those improving things you have the office with you in you every hour of the twentyfour unless you sleep dreamlessly and forgetwhich you dont probably like una you do not take any exercise to drive workthoughts away  she often planned to take exercise regularly read of it in womens magazines but she could never get herself to keep up the earnest clowning of bedroom calisthenics gymnasiums were either reekingly crowded or too expensiveand even to think of undressing and dressing for a gymnasium demanded more initiative than was left in her fagged organism there was walkingbut city streets become tiresomely familiar of sports she was consistently ignorant  so all the week she was in the smell and sound of the battle until saturday evening with its blessed restthe clean relaxed time which every woman on the job knows  saturday evening no work tomorrow a prospect of thirtysix hours of freedom a leisurely dinner a languorous slowness in undressing a hot bath a clean nightgown and fresh smooth bedlinen una went to bed early to enjoy the contemplation of these luxuries she even put on a lace bedcap adorned with pink silk roses the pleasure of relaxing in bed of looking lazily at the pictures in a new magazine of drifting into slumbernot of stepping into a necessary sleep that was only the anteroom of another days labor  such was her greatest joy in this period of uneventfulness   § 5  una was she hoped trying to think about things naturally one who used that boardinghouse phrase could not think transformingly  she wasnt illuminative about romain rolland or rodin or village welfare she was still trying to decide whether the suffrage movement was ladylike and whether dickens or thackeray was the better novelist but she really was trying to decide  she compiled little lists of books to read movements to investigate she made a somewhat incoherent written statement of what she was trying to do and this she kept in her top bureau drawer among the ribbons collars imitation pearl necklaces handkerchiefs letters from walter and photographs of panama and her mother  she took it out sometimes and relieved the days accumulated suffering by adding such notes as  be nice  human w employes if ever have any of own office wretched hole anyway bec of econ system w used to say why make worse by being cranky  or  study music it brings country and w and poetry and everything take piano les when get time  so una tramped weary always at dusk but always recreated at dawn through one of those periods of timeless unmarked months when all drama seems past and unreal and apparently nothing will ever happen again  then in one week everything became startlingshe found melodrama and a place of friendship     chapter xi   im tired of the grays theyre very nice people but they cant talk said una to bessie kraker at lunch in the office on a february day  how do yuh mean cant talk are they dummies inquired bessie  dummies  yuh sure deef and dumb  why no i mean they dont talk my languagethey dont oh they dont i suppose youd say conversationalize do you see  oh yes said bessie doubtfully say listen miss golden say i dont want to butt in and maybe you wouldnt be stuck on it much but they say its a deadswell place to livemiss kitson the bosss secretary where i was before lived there  say for the love o mike say it where interrupted the officeboy  you shut your nasty trap i was just coming to it the temperance and protection home on madison avenue just above thirtyfourth they say its kind of strict but gee theres a ausgezeichnet bunch of dames there artists and everything and they say they feed you swell and it only costs eight bucks a week  well maybe ill look at it said una dubiously  neither the forbidding name nor bessies moral recommendation made the home for girls sound tempting but una was hungry for companionship she was cold now toward the unvarying unimaginative desires of men among the women artists and everything she might find the friends she needed  the temperance and protection home club for girls was in a solemn fivestory white sandstone structure with a severe doorway of iron grill solid and capablelooking as a national bank una rang the bell diffidently she waited in a hall that despite its mission settee and redtiled floor was barrenly clean as a convent she was admitted to the businesslike office of mrs harriet fike the matron of the home  mrs fike had a brown stringy neck and tan bangs she wore a mannish coat and skirt flat shoes of the kind called sensible by everybody except pretty women and a large silvermounted crucifix  well she snarled  some one id like to find out about coming here to liveto see the place and so on can you have somebody show me one of the rooms  my dear young lady the first consideration isnt to have somebody show you or anybody else a room but to ascertain if you are a fit person to come here  mrs fike jabbed at a compartment of her desk yanked out a corduroybound book boxed its ears slammed it open glared at una in a christian and homelike way and began to shoot questions  whatcha name  una golden  miss uh miss  i didnt quite  miss or mrs i said cant you understand english  see here im not being sent to jail that i know of una rose tremblingly  mrs fike merely waited and snapped sit down you look as though you had enough sense to understand that we cant let people we dont know anything about enter a decent place like this miss or mrs i said  miss una murmured feebly sitting down again  whats your denomination no agnostics or catholics allowed  una heard herself meekly declaring methodist  smoke swear drink liquor got any bad habits  no  got a lover sweetheart gentleman friend if so what name or names  no  thats what they all say let me tell you that later when you expect to have all these male cousins visit you well reserve the privilege to ask questions ever served a jail sentence  now really do i look it  my dear miss wouldnt you feel foolish if i said yes have you i warn you we look these things up  no i have not  well thats comforting age  twentysix  parents living name nearest relatives nearest friends present occupation  even as she answered this last simple question and mrs fikes suspicious query about her salary una felt as though she were perjuring herself as though there were no such place as troy wilkinss officeand mrs fike knew it as though a large policeman were secreted behind the desk and would at any moment pop out and drag her off to jail she answered with tremorous carefulness by now the one thing that she wanted to do was to escape from that christian and strictly supervised napoleon mrs fike and flee back to the grays  previous history mrs fike was grimly continuing and she followed this question by ascertaining unas ambitions health record for insanity and references  mrs fike closed the querybook and observed  well you are rather fresh but you seem to be acceptableand now you may look us over and see whether we are acceptable to you dont think for one moment that this institution needs you or is trying to lift you out of a life of sin or that we suppose this to be the only place in new york to live we know what we wantwe run things on a scientific basisbut we arent so conceited as to think that everybody likes us now for example i can see that you dont like me and my ways one bit but lord love you that isnt necessary the one thing necessary is for me to run this home according to the book and if youre fool enough to prefer a slapdash boardinghouse to this hygienic home why youll make your bedor rather some slattern of a landlady will make itand you can lie in it come with me no first read the rules  una obediently read that the young ladies of the temperance home were forbidden to smoke make loud noises cook or do laundry in their rooms sit up after midnight entertain visitors of any sort except mothers and sisters in any place in the home except in the parlors for that purpose provided they were not permitted to be out after ten unless their names were specifically entered in the outlate book before their going and they were requested to answer all reasonable questions of matron or board of visitors or duly qualified inspectors regarding moral mental physical and commercial wellbeing and progress  una couldnt resist asking i suppose it isnt forbidden to sleep in our rooms is it  mrs fike looked over her through her about her and remarked id advise you to drop all impudence you see you dont do it well we admit east side jews here and they are so much quicker and wittier than you country girls from pennsylvania and oklahoma and heaven knows where that you might just as well give up and try to be ladies instead of humorists come we will take a look at the home  by now una was resolved not to let mrs fike drive her away she would show her she would come and live here just for spite  what mrs fike thought has not been handed down  she led una past a series of closets each furnished with two straight chairs on either side of a table a carbon print of a chillylooking cathedral and a slice of carpet on which one was rather disappointed not to find the label bath mat  these are the receptionrooms where the girls are allowed to receive callers any timeup to a quarter to ten mrs fike said  una decided that they were better fitted for a hairdressing establishment  the livingroom was her first revelation of the temperance home as something besides a prisonas an abidingplace for living eager sensitive girls it was not luxurious but it had been arranged by some one who made allowance for a weakness for pretty things even on the part of young females observing the rules in a christian home there was a broad fireplace builtin bookshelves a long table and in wicker chairs with chintz cushions were half a dozen curious girls una was sure that one of them a fizzyhaired laughing girl secretly nodded to her and she was comforted  up the stairs to a marvelous bathroom with tempting showerbaths a small gymnasium and on the roof a garden and loggia and basketball court it was cool and fresh up here on even the hottest summer evenings and here the girls were permitted to lounge in negligées till after ten mrs fike remarked with a halfsmile  una smiled back  as they went through the bedroom floors with mrs fike stalking ahead a graceful girl in lace cap and negligée came bouncing out of a door between them drew herself up and saluted mrs fikes back winked at una amicably and for five steps imitated mrs fikes aggressive stride  yes i would be glad to come here una said cheerfully to mrs fike who looked at her suspiciously but granted well well look up your references meantime if you likeor dont like i supposeyou might talk to a mrs esther lawrence who wants a roommate  oh i dont think id like a roommate  my dear young lady this place is simply full of young persons who would like and they wouldnt likeand forsooth we must change every plan to suit their high and mighty convenience im not at all sure that we shall have a single room vacant for at least six months and of course  well could i talk to mrslawrence was it  most assuredly i expect you to talk to her come with me  una followed abjectly and the matron seemed well pleased with her reformation of this wayward young woman her voice was curiously anemic however as she rapped on a bedroom door and called oh mrs lawrence  a husky capable voice within yeah what is t  its mrs fike deary i think i have a roommate for you  well you wait ll i get something on will you  mrs fike waited she waited two minutes she looked at a wristwatch in a leather band while she tapped her sensibly clad foot she tried again were waiting deary  there was no answer from within and it was two minutes more before the door was opened  una was conscious of a room pleasant with whiteenameled woodwork a denimcovered couch and a narrow prim brass bed a litter of lingerie and sheets of newspaper and as the dominating center of it all a woman of thirty tall highbreasted fullfaced with a nose that was large but pleasant black eyes that were cool and direct and domineeringmrs esther lawrence  you kept us waiting so long complained mrs fike  mrs lawrence stared at her as though she were an impudent servant she revolved on una and with a selfconfident kindliness in her voice inquired whats your name child  una golden  well talk this over thank you mrs fike  well now mrs fike endeavored be sure you both are satisfied  dont you worry we will all right  mrs fike glared at her and retired  mrs lawrence grinned stretched herself on the couch mysteriously produced a cigarette and asked smoke  no thanks  sit down child and be comfy oh would you mind opening that window not supposed to smoke poor ma fikei just cant help deviling her please dont think im usually as nasty as i am with her she has to be kept in her place or shell worry you to death thanks do sit downwoggle up the pillow on the bed and be comfy you look like a nice kidme im a lazy slatternly goodnatured old hex with all the bad habits there are and a profound belief that the world is a hell of a place but im fine to get along with and so lets take a shot at rooming together if we scrap we can quit instanter and no bad feelings id really like to have you come in because you look as though you were on even if you are rather meek and kitteny and im scared to death theyll wish some tough little mick on to me or some pious sister who hasnt been married and believes in pussyfooting around and taking it all to god in prayer every time i tell her the truth what do you think kiddy  una was by this cocksure disillusioned large person more delighted than by all the wisdom of mr wilkins or the soothing of mrs sessions she felt that except for walter it was the first time since she had come to new york that she had found an entertaining person  yes she said do lets try it  good now let me warn you first off that i may be diverting at times but im no good tomorrow ill pretend to be a misused and unfortunate victim but your young and almost trusting eyes make me feel candid for about fifteen minutes i certainly got a raw deal from my beloved husbandthats all youll hear from me about him by the way im typical of about ten thousand married women in business about whose noble spouses nothing is ever said but i suppose i ought to have bucked up and made good in business im a bum stenog for pitcairn mcclure  stockley the bond house but i cant im too lazy and it doesnt seem worth while and oh we are exploited women who are on jobs the bosses give us a lot of taffy and raise their hatsbut they dont raise our wages and they think that if they keep us till two gm taking dictation they make it all right by apologizing women are a lot more conscientious on jobs than men arebut thats because were fools you dont catch the men staying till sixthirty because the boss has shystered all afternoon and wants to catch up on his correspondence but weof course we dont dare to make dates for dinner lest we have to stay late we dont dare  i bet you do  yeswell im not so much of a fool as some of the restor else more of a one theres mamie magenshes living here shes with pitcairn too youll meet her and be crazy about her shes a lame jewess and awfully plain except shes got lovely eyes but shes got a mind like a tack well shes the little angelpie about staying late and some day shell probably make four thousand bucks a year shell be mayor of new york or executive secretary of the young womens atheist association or something but still she doesnt stay late and plug hard because shes scared but because shes got ambition but most of the womenlord theyre just cowed sheep  yes said una  a million discussions of women in business going ona thousand of them at just that moment perhapsmen employers declaring that they couldnt depend on women in their offices women asserting that women were the more conscientious una listened and was content she had found some one with whom to play with whom to talk and hate the powers she felt an impulse to tell mrs lawrence all about troy wilkins and her mother andand perhaps even about walter babson but she merely treasured up the thought that she could do that some day and politely asked  what about mrs fike is she as bad as she seems  why thats the best little skeleton of contention around here theres three factions some girls say shes just plain devilmean as a floorwalker thats what i thinkshes a rotter and a fourflusher you notice the way she crawls when i stand up to her why they wont have catholics here and im one of those wicked people and she knows it when she asked my religion i told her i was a romanist episcopalian and she sniffed and put me down as an episcopaliani saw her then some of the girls think shes really goodheartedjust gruffbark worse than her bite but you ought to see how she barks at some of the younger girlsscares em stiffand keeps picking on them about regulationsmakes their lives miserable then theres a third section that thinks shes merely institutionalizedtraining makes her as hard as any other kind of a machine youll find lots like her in this townin all the charities  but the girlsthey do have a good time here  yes they do its sort of fun to fight ma fike and all the fool rules i enjoy smoking here twice as much as i would anywhere else and fike isnt half as bad as the board of visitorsbunch of fat rich old upperwestsiders with passementeried bosoms doing teatable charity and asking us impertinent questions and telling a bunch of hardworked slaves to be virtuous and wash behind their earsthe soft ignorant conceited impractical parasites but still its all sort of like a cranky boardingschool for girlsand you know what fun the girls have there with midnight fudge parties and a teacher pussyfooting down the hall trying to catch them  i dont know ive never been to one  welldoesnt matter another thingsome day when you come to know more men know many  very few  well youll find this town is full of bright young men seeking an economical solution of the sex problemto speak politelyand youll find it a relief not to have them on your doorstep s safe here come in with me kid give me an audience to talk to  yes said una   § 2  it was hard to leave the kindly herbert grays of the flat but una made the break and arranged all her silver toiletarticleswhich consisted of a platedsilver hairbrush a germansilver nailfile and a good plain honest rubber combon the bureau in mrs lawrences room  with the shyness of a girl on her first night in boardingschool una stuck to mrs lawrences side in the noisy flow of strange girls down to the diningroom she was used to being selfabsorbed in the noisiest restaurants but she was trembly about the knees as she crossed the room among curious upward glances she found it very hard to use a fork without clattering it on the plate when she sat with mrs lawrence and four strangers at a table for six  they all were splendidly casual and wise and goodlooking with no men about to intimidate themor to attract themthey made a solid phalanx of bland satisfied femininity and una felt more barred out than in an office she longed for a man who would be curious about her or cross with her or perform some other easy customary simplehearted masculine trick  but she was taken into the friendship of the table when mrs lawrence had finished a harangue on the cardinal sin of serving bean soup four times in two weeks  oh shut up lawrence and introduce the new kid said one girl  you wait till i get through with my introductory remarks cassavant im inspired tonight im going to take a plate of bean soup and fit it over ma fikes headupside down  oh give ma fike a rest  una was uneasy she wasnt sure whether this repartee was friendly good spirits or a nagging feud like all the ungrateful human race she considered whether she ought to have identified herself with the noisy esther lawrence on entering the home so might a freshman wonder or the guest of a club always the amiable and vulgar lawrences are most doubted when they are bestintentioned  una was relieved when she was welcomed by the four  mamie magen the lame jewess in whose big brown eyes was an eternal prayer for all of harassed humanity  jennie cassavant in whose eyes was chiefly a prayer that life would keep on being interestingshe the dark slender loquacious observant child who had requested mrs lawrence to shut up  rose larsen like a pretty curlyhaired boy though her shoulders were little and adorable in a whitesilk waist  mrs amesbury a nun of business pale and silent her thin throat shrouded in white net her voice low and selfconscious her very blood seeming whitea woman with an almost morbid air of guarded purity whom you could never associate with the frank crudities of marriage her movements were nervous and small she never smiled you couldnt be boisterous with her yet mrs lawrence whispered she was one of the chief operators of the telephone company and next to the thoughtful and suffering mamie magen the most capable woman she knew  how do you like the tempest and protest miss golden the lively cassavant said airily  i dont  why the temperance and protection home  well i like mrs fikes shoes i should think theyd be fine to throw at cats  good work golden youre admitted  say magen said mrs lawrence golden agrees with me about officesno chance for women  mamie magen sighed and esther she said in a voice which must naturally have been rasping but which she had apparently learned to control like a violinesther dear if you could ever understand what offices have done for me on the east sidealways it was work and work and watch all the pretty girls in our block get t b in garmentfactories or marry fellows that werent any good and have a baby every year and get so thin and worn out and the garmentworkers strikes and picketing on cold nights and now i am in an officeall the fellows are dandy and politenot like the floor superintendent where i worked in a department store he would call down a cashgirl for making change slow i have a chance to do anything a man can do the boss is just crazy to find women that will take an interest in the work like it was their own you know he told you so himself  sure i know the line of guff said mrs lawrence and you take an interest and get eighteen plunks per for doing statistics that they couldnt get a real college male in trousers to do for less than thirtyfive  or put it like this lawrence said jennie cassavant magen admits that the world in general is a muddle and she thinks offices are heaven because by comparison with sweatshops they are halfway decent  the universal discussion was on everybody but una and the nun of business threw everything from facts to bread pills about the table and they enjoyed themselves in as unfeminized and brutal a manner as men in a café una had found some one with whom to talk her own shopand shop is the only reasonable topic of conversation in the world witness authors being intellectual about editors and romanticism lovers absorbed in the technique of holding hands or mothers interested in babies recipes and household ailments  after dinner they sprawled all over the room of una and mrs lawrence and talked about theaters young men and mrs fike for four solid hoursall but the pretty boyish rose larsen who had a young man coming to call at eight even the newcomer una was privileged to take part in giving rose extensive highly detailed and not entirely proper adviceadvice of a completeness which would doubtless have astonished the suitor then dressing somewhere in a furnished room and unconscious of the publicity of his call una also lent miss larsen a pair of silk stockings helped three other girls to coerce her curly hair and formed part of the solemn procession that escorted her to the top of the stairs when the still unconscious young man was announced from below and it was una who was able to see the young man without herself being seen and to win notoriety by being able to report that he had smooth black hair a small mustache and carried a stick  una was living her boardingschool days now at twentysix the presence of so many possible friends gave her selfconfidence and selfexpression she went to bed happy that night home among her own people among the women who noisy or reticent slack or aspiring were joined to make possible a life of work in a world still heavyscented with the ideals of the harem     chapter xii   that same oasis of a week gave to una her first taste of business responsibility of being in charge and generally comporting herself as do males but in order to rouse her thus chance broke the inoffensive limb of unfortunate mr troy wilkins as he was stepping from his small bronchial motorcar to an icy cement block on seven oclock of friday evening  when una arrived at the office on saturday morning she received a telephone message from mr wilkins directing her to take charge of the office of bessie kraker and the officeboy and the negotiations with the comfy coast building and development company regarding the planning of three rows of semidetached villas  for three weeks the office was as different from the treadmill that it familiarly had been as the home club and lawrences controversial room were different from the grays flat she was glad to work late to arrive not at eightthirty but at a quarter to eight to gallop down to a cafeteria for coffee and a sandwich at noon to be patient with callers and to try to develop some knowledge of spelling in that child of nature bessie kraker she walked about the office quickly glancing proudly at its neatness daily with an operators headgear borrowed from the telephone company over her head she spent half an hour talking with mr wilkins taking his dictation receiving his cautions and suggestions reassuring him that in his absence the subway ran and tammany still ruled after an agitated conference with the vicepresident of the comfy coast company during which she was eloquent as an automobile advertisement regarding mr wilkinss former masterpieces with their every modern improvement parquet floors beam ceilings platerack hardwood trim throughout natty and novel decorations una reached the zenith of salesmans virtuesshe closed the deal  mr wilkins came back and hemmed and hawed a good deal he praised the work she hadnt considered well done and pointed out faults in what she considered particularly clever achievements and was laudatory but dissatisfying in general in a few days he in turn reached the zenith of virtue on the part of bosshe raised her salary to fifteen dollars a week she was again merely his secretary however and the office trudged through another normal period when all past drama seemed incredible and all the future drab  but una was certain now that she could manage business could wheedle bessies and face pompous vicepresidents and satisfy querulous mr wilkinses she looked forward she picked at architecture as portrayed in mr wilkinss big books she learned the reason and manner of the rows of semidetached semisuburban semicomfortable semicheap and somewhat less than semiattractive houses  she was not afraid of the office world now she had a part in the city and a home   § 2  she thought of walter babson sometimes when mrs lawrence was petulant or the office had been unusually exhausting she fancied that she missed him but instead of sitting and brooding over folded hands in womans ancient fashion she took a mans unfair advantageshe went up to the gymnasium of the home club and worked with the chestweights and flyingringsa solemn happy busy little figure she laughed more deeply and she felt the enormous rhythm of the city not as a menacing roar but as a hymn of triumph  she could never be intimate with mamie magen as she was with the frankly disillusioned mrs lawrence she never knew whether miss magen really liked her or not her smile which transfigured her sallow face was equally bright for una for mrs fike and for beggars yet it was miss magen whose faith in the purpose of the struggling world inspired una una walked with her up madison avenue past huge old brownstone mansions and she was unconscious of suiting her own quick step to miss magens jerky lameness as the jewess talked of her ideals of a business world which should have generosity and chivalry and the accuracy of a biological laboratory in which there would be no need of charity to employee or to employer  mamie magen was the most highly evolved person una had ever known una had from books and newspapers and walter babson learned that there were such things as socialists and earnest pessimists and the race sketchily called bohemianswriters and artists and social workers who drank claret and made love and talked about the free theater all on behalf of the brotherhood of man una pictured the socialists as always attacking capitalists the pessimists as always being bitter and egotistic bohemians as always being dissipated but as handsome and noisy and gay  but mamie magen was a socialist who believed that the capitalists with their profitsharing and search for improved methods of production were as sincere in desiring the scientific era as were the most burning socialists who loved and understood the most oratorical of the young socialists with their hair in their eyes but also loved and understood the clean little college boys who came into business with a desire to make it not a war but a crusade she was a socialist who was determined to control and glorify business a pessimist who was in her gentle reticent way as scornful of halfchurches halfgovernments halfeducations as the cynical mrs lawrence finally she who was not handsome or dissipated or gay but sallow and lame and spartan knew bohemia better than most of the professional hobohemians as an east side child she had grown up in the classes and parties of the university settlement she had been held upon the then juvenile knees of half the distinguished writers and fighters for reform who had begun their careers as settlement workers she who was still unknown a clerk and a nobody and who wasnt always syntactical was accustomed to people whose names had been made large and sonorous by newspaper publicity and at the age when ambitious lady artists and derailed walter babsons came to new york and determinedly seized on bohemia mamie magen had outgrown bohemia and become a worker  to una she explained the city made it comprehensible made art and economics and philosophy human and tangible una could not always follow her but from her she caught the knowledge that the world and all its wisdom is but a booby blundering schoolboy that needs management and could be managed if men and women would be human beings instead of just business men or plumbers or army officers or commuters or educators or authors or clubwomen or traveling salesmen or socialists or republicans or salvation army leaders or wearers of clothes she preached to una a personal kinghood an education in brotherhood and responsible nobility which took in unas job as much as it did government ownership or reading poetry   § 3  not always was una breathlessly trying to fly after the lame but broadwinged mamie magen she attended high mass at the spanish church on washington heights with mrs lawrence felt the beauty of the ceremony admired the simple classic church adored the padre and for about one day planned to scorn panama methodism and become a catholic after which day she forgot about methodism and catholicism she also accompanied mrs lawrence to a ceremony much less impressive and much less easily forgottento a meeting with a man  mrs lawrence never talked about her husband but in this reticence she was not joined by rose dawn or jennie cassavant jennie maintained that the misfitted mr lawrence was alive very much so that esther and he werent even divorced but merely separated the only sanction mrs lawrence ever gave to this report was to blurt out one night keep up your belief in the mysticism of love and all that kind of sentimental sex stuff as long as you can youll lose it some day fast enough me i know that a woman needs a man just the same as a man needs a womanand just as darned unpoetically being brought up a puritan i never can quite get over the feeling that i oughtnt to have anything to do with menme as i ambut believe me it isnt any romantic ideal i sure want em  mrs lawrence continually went to dinners and theaters with men she told una all the details as women do from the first highly proper handshake down in the pureminded hall of the home club at eight to the less proper goodnight kiss on the dark doorstep of the home club at midnight but she was careful to make clear that one kiss was all she ever allowed though she grew dithyrambic over the charming lonely men with whom she playeda young doctor whose wife was in a madhouse a clever restrained unhappy old broker  once she broke out hang it i want love and thats all there is to itthats crudely all there ever is to it with any woman no matter how much she pretends to be satisfied with mourning the dead or caring for children or swatting a job or being religious or anything else im a lowbrow i cant give you the economics of it and the spiritual brotherhood and all that stuff like mamie magen but i know women want a man and loveall of it  next evening she took una to dinner at a german restaurant as chaperon to herself and a quiet insistent staring goodlooking man of forty while mrs lawrence and the man talked about the opera their eyes seemed to be defying each other una felt that she was not wanted when the man spoke hesitatingly of a cabaret una made excuse to go home  mrs lawrence did not return till two she moved about the room quietly but una awoke  im glad i went with him mrs lawrence said angrily as though she were defending herself  una asked no questions but her good little heart was afraid though she retained her joy in mrs lawrences willingness to take her and her job seriously una was dismayed by mrs lawrences fiercely uneasy interest in men she resented the insinuation that the sharp unexpected longing to feel walters arms about her might be only a crude physical need for a man instead of a mystic fidelity to her lost love  being a lame marcher a mind which was admittedly shocked at each discovery of the aliveness of theory unas observation of the stalking specter of sex did not lead her to make any very lucid conclusions about the matter but she did wonder a little if this whole business of marriages and marriage ceremonies and legal bonds which any clerkly pastor can gild with religiosity was so sacred as she had been informed in panama she wondered a little if mrs lawrences obvious requirement of mans companionship ought to be turned into a sneaking theft of love una golden was not a philosopher she was a workaday woman but into her workaday mind came a low light from the fire which was kindling the world the dual belief that life is too sacred to be taken in war and filthy industries and dull education and that most forms and organizations and inherited castes are not sacred at all   § 4  the aspirations of mamie magen and the alarming frankness of mrs lawrence were not all her life at the home club with pretty rose larsen and half a dozen others she played they went in fluttering beribboned parties to the theater they saw visions at symphony concerts and slipped into exhibits of contemporary artists at private galleries on fifth avenue when spring came they had walking parties in central park in van cortlandt park on the palisades across staten island and picnicked by themselves or with neat trimminded polite men clerks from the various offices and stores where the girls worked they had a perpetual joy in annoying mrs fike by parties on fireescapes by lobster newburgh suppers at midnight they were discursively excited for a week when rose larsen was followed from the surfacecar to the door by an unknown man and they were unhappily excited when without explanations slim daring jennie cassavant was suddenly asked to leave the home club and they had a roselighted dinner when livy hedger announced her engagement to a newark lawyer  various were the home club women in training and work and ways they were awkward stenographers and dependable secretaries fashion artists and departmentstore clerks telephone girls and clever collegebred persons who actually read manuscripts and proof and wrote captions or householddepartment squibs for womens magazinesreal editors or at least real assistant editors persons who knew authors and illustrators as did the great magen they were attendants in dentists offices and teachers in nightschools and filinggirls and manicurists and cashiers and bluelinengowned superwaitresses in artistic tearooms and cliques caste they did have yet their comradeship was very sweet quite real the factional lines were not drawn according to salary or education or family but according to gaiety or sobriety or propriety  una was finding not only her lost boardingschool days but her second youthperhaps her first real youth  though the questions inspired by the exceptional miss magen and the defiant mrs lawrence kept her restless her association with the playgirls her growing acquaintanceship with women who were easyminded who had friends and relatives and a place in the city who did not agonize about their jobs or their loves who received young men casually and looked forward to marriage and a comfortable flat in harlem made una feel the city as her own proper dwelling now she no longer plodded along the streets wonderingly a detached little stranger she walked briskly and contentedly heedless of crowds returning to her own home in her own city most workers of the city remain strangers to it always but chance had made una an insider  it was another chapter in the making of a business woman that spring of happiness and new stirrings in the home club it was another term in the unplanned uninstructed muddling chancegoverned college which civilization unwittingly keeps for the training of men and women who will carry on the work of the world  it passed swiftly and july and vacationtime came to una     chapter xiii   it was hard enough to get mr wilkins to set a definite date for her summer vacation the time was delayed and juggled till mrs lawrence who was to have gone with una had to set off alone but it was even harder for una to decide where to go for her vacation  there was no accumulation of places which she had fervently been planning to see indeed una wasnt much interested in any place besides new york and panama and of the questions and stale reminiscences of panama she was weary she decided to go to a farm in the berkshires largely because she had overheard a girl in the subway say that it was a good place  when she took the train she was brave with a new blue suit a new suitcase a twopound box of candy copies of the saturday evening post and the womans home companion and jack londons people of the abyss which mamie magen had given her all the way to pittsfield all the way out to the farm by stage she sat still and looked politely at every large detached elm every cow or barefoot boy  she had set her methodical mind in order had told herself that she would have time to think and observe yet if a census had been taken of her thoughts not sex nor economics not improving observations of the flora and fauna of western massachusetts would have been found but a halfglad halfhysterical acknowledgment that she had not known how tired and officesoaked she was till now when she had relaxed and a dull recurrent wonder if two weeks would be enough to get the office poison out of her body now that she gave up to it she was so nearly sick that she couldnt see the magic of the sheer green hillsides and unexpected ponds the elmshrined winding road towns demure and white she did not notice the huge innlike farmhouse nor her bare room nor the noisy diningroom she sat on the porch exhausted telling herself that she was enjoying the hills slope down to a pond that was yet bright as a silver shield though its woody shores had blurred into soft darkness the enchantment of frog choruses the cooing pigeons in the barnyard  listen a cow mooing thank the lord im away from new yorkclean forgotten itmight be a million miles away she assured herself  yet all the while she continued to picture the officebessies desk mr wilkinss inkwell the sinister gray scrubrag in the washroom and she knew that she needed some one to lure her mind from the office  she was conscious that some man had left the chattering rockingchair group at the other end of the long porch and had taken the chair beside her  miss golden a thick voice hesitated  yes  say i thought it was you well well the worlds pretty small after all say i bet you dont remember me  in the porch light una beheld a heavyshouldered typical american business man in derby hat and clipped mustache his jowls shining with a recent shave an alert solid man of about fortyfive she remembered him as a man she had been glad to meet she felt guiltily that she ought to know himperhaps he was a wilkins client and she was making future difficulty in the office but place him she could not  oh yes yes of course though i cant just remember your name i always can remember faces but i never can remember names she achieved  sure i know how it is ive often said i never forget a face but i never can remember names well sir you remember sanford hunt that went to the commercial college  oh now i knowyoure mr schwirtz of the lowry paint company who had lunch with us and told me about the paint companymr julius schwirtz  you got me though the fellows usually call me eddiejulius edward schwirtz is my full namemy father was named julius and my mothers oldest brother was named edwardmy old dad used to say it wasnt respectful to him because i always preferred

hardly make more n twentysix or twentyeight hundred keeps me on the jump alrightee fact i got so tired and rundown i hadnt planned to take any vacation at all but the boss himself says to me eddie we cant afford to let you get sick youre the best man weve got he says and you got to take a good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks well i says i was just wondering if you was smart enough to get along without me if i was to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girland i guess that must be you miss goldenand he laughs and says oh yes i guess the business wouldnt go bust for a few days and so i goes down and gets a shave and a haircut and a singe and a shampoothere aint as much to cut as there used to be thoughha haand here i am  yes said una affably  miss una golden of panama and the office did not in the least feel superior to mr eddie schwirtzs robust commonness the men she knew except for pariahs like walter babson talked thus she could admire mamie magens verbal symphonies but with mr schwirtz she was able to forget her little private stock of worries and settle down to her holiday  mr schwirtz hitched forward in his rocker took off his derby stroked his damp forehead laid his derby and both his hands on his stomach rocked luxuriously and took a fresh hold on the conversation  but say here i am gassing all about myself and youll want to be hearing about sandy hunt seen him lately  no ive lost track of himyou do know how it is in such a big city  sure i know how it is i was saying to a fellow just the other day why gosh all fishhooks i was saying it seems like its harder to keep in touch with a fellow here in new york than if he lived in chicagotime you go from the bronx to flatbush or weehawken its time to turn round again and go home well hunts marriedyou know to that same girl that was with us at lunch that dayand hes got a nice little house in secaucus hes still with lowry good job too assistant bookkeeper pulling down his little twentysevenfifty regular and they got a baby and let me tell you she makes him a mighty fine wife mighty bright little woman well now say how are

you are nice bright woman like you sticking in an office office is no place for a woman takes a man to stand the racket homes the place for a woman except maybe some hatchetfaced old battleax like the cashier at our shop shame to spoil a nice home with her why she tried to hold up my vacation money because she said id overdrawn  oh but mr schwirtz what can a poor girl do if you high and mighty men dont want to marry her  pshaw there aint no trouble like that in your case ill gamble  oh but there is if i were pretty like rose larsenshes a girl that stays where i liveoh i could just eat her up shes so pretty curly hair and big brown eyes and a round face like a boy in one of those medieval pictures  thats all right about pretty squabs theyre all right for a bunch of young boys that like a cute nose and a good figger better than they do sense well you notice i remembered you all right when you went and forgot poor old eddie schwirtz yessir by golly teetotally plumb forgot me i guess i wont get over that slam for a while  now that isnt fair mr schwirtz you know it isntits almost dark here on the porch even with the lamps i couldnt really see you and besides i did recognize youi just couldnt think of your name for the moment  yuh that listens fine but poor old eddies heart is clean busted just the sameme thinking of you and your nice complexion and goldie hair and the cute way you talked at our lunchwhenever hunt shut up and gave you a chancehonest i havent forgot yet the way you took off old manwhat was itthe old stiff that ran the commercial college what was his name  mr whiteside una was enormously pleased and interested far off and dim were miss magen and the distressing mrs lawrence and the office of mr troy wilkins was fading  yuh i guess that was it do you remember how you gave us an imitation of him telling the class that if theyd work like sixty they might get to be little tin gods on wheels like himself and how hed always keep dropping his eyeglasses and fishing em up on a cord while he was talkingdont you remember how you took him off why i thought mrs huntthatisive forgotten what her name was before sandy married herwhy i thought shed split laughing she admired you a whole pile lemme tell you i could see that  not unwelcome to the ears of una was this praise but she was properly deprecatory why she probably thought i was just a stuffy stupid ugly old thing as old as  as old as eddie schwirtz heh go on insult me i can stand it lemme tell you i aint fortythree till next october look here now little sister i know when a woman admires another lemme tell you if youd ever traveled for drygoods like i did out of st paul once for a couple of monthsnever again paint and varnish is good enough for eddie any dayand if youd sold a bunch of women buyers youd know how they looked when they liked a thing alrightee not that i want to knock the sex y understand but you know yourself bein a shemale that theres an awful lot of cats among the ladiesgod bless emthat wouldnt admit another lady was beautiful not if she was as goodlooking as lillian russell corking figger and the swellest dresser in town  yes perhapssometimes said una  she did not find mr schwirtz dull  but i was saying it was a cinch to see that sandys girl thought you was ace high alrightee she kept her eyes glommed onto you all the time  but what would she find to admire  uhhuh fishing for compliments  no i am not so there unas cheeks burned delightfully she was back in panama againin panama where for endless hours on dark porches young men tease young women and tell them that they are beautiful mr schwirtz was direct and jolly like panama people but he was so much more active and forceful than henry carson so much more hearty than charlie martindale so distinguished by that knowledge of new york streets and cafés and local heroes which to una the recent convert to new york seemed the one great science  their rockers creaked in complete sympathy  the perfect summer man took up his shepherds tale  theres a whole lot of things shed certainly oughta have admired in you lemme tell you i suppose probably maxine elliott is betterlooking than what you are maybe but i always was crazy over your kind of girlblond hair and nice clear eyes and just shoulderhighkind of a girl that could snuggle down beside a fireplace and look like she grew therenot one of these domineerin sufferin cats females no nor one of these overdressed newyork chickens neither but cute and bright  oh youre just flattering me mr schwirtz mr hunt told me i should watch out for you  no no you got me wrong there i dwell on whatisit mountain and my name is truthful james like the poet says believe me i may be a roughneck drummer but i notice these things  oh oh do you like poetry  without knowing precisely what she was trying to do una was testing mr schwirtz according to the somewhat contradictory standards of culture which she had acquired from walter babson mamie magen esther lawrence mr wilkinss books on architecture and stray copies of the outlook the literary digest current opinion the nation the independent the review of reviews the worlds work colliers and the atlantic monthly which she had been glancing over in the home club library she hadnt learned much of the technique of the arts but she had acquired an uneasy conscience of the sort which rather discredits any book or music or picture which it easily enjoys she was for a moment apologetic to these insistent new standards because she had given herself up to mr schwirtzs low conversation she was not vastly different from a young lady just back in panama from a term in the normal school with new lights derived from a gentlemanly young english teacher with poetic interests and a curly mustache  sure affirmed mr schwirtz i like poetry fine used to read it myself when i was traveling out of st paul and got kind of stuck on a waitress at eau claire this did not perfectly satisfy una but she was more satisfied that he had heard the gospel of culture after he had described with much detail his enjoyment of a fella from boston perfessional reciter they say he writes swell poetry himself gave us a program of kipling and ella wheeler wilcox before the elksreal poetic fella  do you go to concerts symphonies and so on much una next catechized  well no thats where i fall down just between you and i i never did have much time for these highbrows that try to make out theyre so darn much better than common folks by talking about motifs and symphony poems and all that longhaired stuff fellow thats in music goods took me to a philharmonic concert once and i couldnt make head or tail of the stuffconductor batting a poor musician over the ear with his swaggerstick and him a union man oughta kicked to his union about the way the conductor treated him and him coming back with a yawp on the fiddle and getting two laps ahead of the brass band and they all blowing their stuffings out trying to catch up music they call that and once i went to grand operalot of fat dutchmen all singing together like they was selling old rags aw nix give me one of the good old songs like the last rose of summer i bet you could sing that so that even a sportinggoods drummer would cry and think about the sweetheart he had when he was a kid  no i couldnti cant sing a note una said delightedly she had laughed very much at mr schwirtzs humor she slid down in her chair and felt more expansively peaceful than she ever had been in the stress of walter babson  straight now little sister own up dont you get more fun out of hearing raymond hitchcock sing than you do out of a bunch of fiddles and flutes fighting out a piece by vaugner like they was kilkenny cats fess up now dont you get more downright amusement  well maybe i do sometimes but that doesnt mean that all this cheap musical comedy music is as good as opera and so on if we had ourhad musical educations  oh yes thats what they all say but i notice that hitchcock and george m cohan go on drawing big audiences every nightyes and the swellest bestdressed smartest people in new york and brooklyn tooits in the gallery at the opera that you find all these wops and swedes and lord knows whatall and when a bunch of people are out at a lake say you dont ever catch em singing vaugner or lits or gryge or any of them guys if they dont sing in the good old summertime its old black joe or nelly was a lady or something thats really got some melody to it  the neophyte was lured from her newwon altar cold to her knees was the barren stone of the shrine and she feebly recanted yes thats so  mr schwirtz cheerfully took out a cigar smelled it bit it luxuriously removed the band requested permission to smoke lighted the cigar without waiting for an answer to that request sighed happily and dived again  not that im knocking the highbrows y understand this dresssuit music is all right for them that likes it but what i object to is their trying to stuff it down my throat i let em alone and if i want to be a poor old lowbrow and like reglar music i dont see where they get off to be telling me i got to go to concerts honest now aint that the truth  oh yes that way  all these here critics telling what lowbrows us american business men are just between you and i i bet i knock down more good big round iron men every week than ninetenths of these highbrow fiddlersyes and college professors and authors too  yes but you shouldnt make money your standard said una in company with the invisible chorus of mamie magen and walter babson  well then what are you going to make a standard asked mr schwirtz triumphantly  well said una  understan me im a highbrow myself some ways i never could stand these cheap magazines id stop the circulation of every last one of them pass an act of congress to make every voter read some a1 highclass intellectual stuff i read rev henry van dyke and newell dwight hillis and herbert kaufman and billy sunday and all these brainy inspirational fellows and let me tell you i get a lot of talkingpoints for selling my trade out of their spiels too i dont believe in all this cheap fictionthese nasty realistic stories like all the author could see in life was just the bad side of thingsi tell you lifes bad enough without emphasizing the rotten side all these unhappy marriages and poverty and everythingi believe if you cant write bright optimistic cheerful things better not write at all and all these sex stories dont believe in em sensational dont believe in cheap literature of no sort oh of course its all right to read a coupla detective stories or a nice bright clean lovestory just to pass the time away but me i like real classy highgrade writers with none of this slangy dialogue or vulgar stuff specially i like essays on strenuous modern american life about not being in a rut but putting a punch in life yes sir  im glad said una i do like improving books  youve said it little sister say gee you dont know what a luxury it is for me to talk about books and literature with an educated cultured girl like you now take the rest of these people here at the farmnice folks you understand mighty welltraveled broadgauged intelligent folks and all that theres a mr and mrs cannon hes some kind of an executive in the chicago stockyardsnice fat responsible job and he was saying to me mr schwirtz he says mrs c and i had never been to new england till this summer but wed toured every other part of the country and weve done europe thoroughly and put in a month doing florida and now he says i think we can say weve seen every point of interest thats worth an americans time theyre good american people like that welltraveled and nice folks but bookslord they cant talk about books no more than a jersey city bartender so you can imagine how pleased i was to find you here worlds pretty small all right say i just got here yesterday so i suppose well be here about the same length o time if you wouldnt think i was presumptuous id like mighty well to show you some of the country around here we could get up a picnic party ten or a dozen of us and go up on bald knob and see the scenery and have a real jolly time and id be glad to take you down to lesterhamptontheres a real oldfashioned inn down there they say where paul revere stayed one time they say you can get the best kind of fried chicken and corn on cob and real oldfashioned new england blueberry pie would you like to  why i should be very pleased to said una   § 2  mr schwirtz seemed to know everybody at the farm he had been there only thirtysix hours but already he called mr cannon sam and knew that miss vincents married sisters youngest child had recently passed away with a severe and quite unexpected attack of cholera morbus mr schwirtz introduced una to the others so fulsomely that she was immediately taken into the inner political ring he gave her a first lesson in auction pinochle also they had music and recitations at ten and unas shyness was so warmed away that she found herself reciting im only mammys pickaninny coon  she went candlelighted up to a fourposter bed as she lay awake her jobbranded mind could not keep entirely away from the office the work she would have to do when she returned the familiar series of indefinite worries and disconnected office pictures but mostly she let the rustle of the breathing land inspirit her while she thought of mr julius edward schwirtz  she knew that he was ungrammatical but she denied that he was uncouth his deep voice had been very kindly his clipped mustache was trim his nails which had been ragged at that commercialcollege lunch were manicured now he was sure of himself while walter babson doubted and thrashed about all of which meant that the tired officewoman was touchily defensive of the man who liked her  she couldnt remember just where she had learned it but she knew that mr schwirtz was a widower   § 3  the fact that she did not have to get up and go to the office was unas chief impression at awakening but she was not entirely obtuse to the morning to the chirp of a robin the cluck of the hens the creak of a haywagon and the sweet smell of cattle when she arose she looked down a slope of fields so far away that they seemed smooth as a lawn solitary majestic trees cast long shadows over a hilly pasture of crisp grass worn to inviting paths by the cropping cattle beyond the valley was a range of the berkshires with every tree distinct  una was tired but the mornings radiance inspired her my americaso beautiful why do we turn you into stuffy offices and ugly towns she marveled while she was dressing  but as breakfast was not ready her sudden wish to do something magnificent for america turned into what she called a beforecoffee grouch and she sat on the porch waiting for the bell and hoping that the conversational mr schwirtz wouldnt come and converse it was to his glory that he didnt he appeared in masterful whiteflannel trousers and a pressed blue coat and a new panama which looked well on his fleshy but trim head he said mornin cheerfully and went to prowl about the farm  all through the breakfast una caught the effulgence of mr schwirtzs prosperouslooking solidness and almost persuaded herself that his jowls and the slabs of fat along his neck were powerful muscles  he asked her to play croquet una played a game which had been respected in the smartest croqueting circles of panama she defeated him and while she blushed and insisted that he ought to have won mr schwirtz chuckled about his defeat and boasted of it to the group on the porch  i was afraid he told her i was going to find this farm kinda tame usually expect a few more good fellows and highballs in mine but thanks to you little sister looks like ill have a bigger time than a highline poker party  he seemed deeply to respect her and una who had never had the débutantes privilege of ordering men about who had avoided henry carson and responded to walter babson and obeyed chiefs in offices was now at last demanding that privilege she developed feminine whims and desires she asked mr schwirtz to look for her handkerchief and bring her magazine and arrange her chair cushions and take her for a walk to the glade  he obeyed breathlessly  following an old and rutted woodland road to the glade they passed a berkshire abandoned farma solid house of stone and red timbers softened by the long grasses that made the orchard a pleasant place they passed berrybushesraspberry and blackberry and currant now turned wild greengold bushes that were a net for sunbeams they saw yellow warblers flicker away a kingbird swoop a scarlet tanager glisten in flight  wonder what that red bird is he admiringly looked to her to know  why i think thats a cardinal  golly i wish i knew about nature  so do i i dont really know a thing  huh i bet you do  though i ought to living in a small town so long id planned to buy me a birdbook she rambled on giddy with sunshine and a flowerbook and bring them along but i was so busy getting away from the office that i came off without them dont you just love to know about birds and things  yuh i cernly do i cernly do say this beats new york eh i dont care if i never see another show or a cocktail cernly do beat new york cernly does i was saying to sam cannon lord i says i wonder what a fellow ever stays in the city for never catch me there if i could rake in the coin out in the country no sir and he laughed and said he guessed it was the same way with him no sir my idea of perfect happiness is to be hiking along here with you miss golden  he gazed down upon her with a mixture of amorousness and awe the leaves of scruboaks along the road crinkled and shone in the sun she was lulled to slumberous content she lazily beamed her pleasure back at him though a tiny hope that he would be circumspect not be too ardent stirred in her he was touching in his desire to express his interest without ruffling her he began to talk about miss vincents affair with mr starr the wealthy old boarder at the farm in that topic they passed safely through the torrid wilderness of summer shine and tangled blooms  the thwarted boyish soul that persisted in mr schwirtzs barbered unexercised coffeesoaked tobaccofilled whiskyrotted fattily degenerated city body shone through his redveined eyes he was having a fête champêtre he gathered berries and sang all that he remembered of nut brown ale and chased a cow and pantingly stopped under a tree and smoked a cigar as though he enjoyed it in his simple pleasure una was glad she admired him when he showed his trained professional side and explained with rather confusing details why the Ætna automobile varnish company was a success but she fluttered up to her feet became the wilful débutante again and commanded come on mr slow well never reach the glade he promptly struggled up to his feet there was lordly devotion in the way he threw away his halfsmoked cigar it indicated perfect chivalry even though he did light another in about three minutes  the glade was filled with a palegreen light arching trees shut off the heat of the summer afternoon and the leaves shone translucent ferns were in wild abundance they sat on a fallen tree thick upholstered with moss and listened to the trickle of a brook una was utterly happy in her very weariness there was a voluptuous feeling that the air was dissolving the stains of the office  he urged a compliment upon her only once more that day but she gratefully took it to bed with her youre just like this glademake a fellow feel kinda calm and want to be good he said im going to cut outall this boozing and stuff course you understand i never make a habit of them things but still a fellow on the road  yes said una  all evening they discussed croquet lenox florida miss vincent and mr starr the presidential campaign and the food at the farmhouse boarders from the next farmhouse came acalling and the enlarged company discussed the food at both of the farmhouses the presidential campaign florida and lenox the men and women gradually separated relieved of the strain of general and polite conversation the men gratefully talked about business conditions and the presidential campaign and food and motoring and told sly stories about mike and pat or about ikey and jakey while the women listened to mrs cannons stories about her youngest son and compared notes on cooking village improvement societies and what mrs taft would do in washington society if judge taft was elected president miss vincent had once shaken hands with judge taft and she occasionally referred to the incident mrs cannon took una aside and told her that she thought mr starr and miss vincent must have walked down to the village together that afternoon as she had distinctly seen them coming back up the road  yet una did not feel panamaized  she was a grownup person accepted as one not as mrs goldens daughter and her own gossip now passed at par  and all evening she was certain that mr schwirtz was watching her   § 4  the boarders from the two farmhouses organized a tremendous picnic on bald knob with sandwiches and chicken salad and cake and thermos bottles of coffee and a whole pail of beans and a phonograph with seven records with recitations and pastoral merriment and kodaks snapping every two or three minutes with groups sitting about on blankets and once in a while some one explaining why the scenery was so scenic una had been anxious lest mr schwirtz pay her too marked attentions make them as conspicuous as mr starr and miss vincent for in the morning he had hung about waiting for a game of croquet with her but mr schwirtz was equally pleasant to her to miss vincent and to mrs cannon and he was attractively ardent regarding the scenery this cernly beats new york eh especially you being here he said to her aside  they sang ballads about the fire at dusk and trailed home along dark paths that smelled of pungent leafmold mr schwirtz lumbered beside her heaped with blankets and pails and baskets till he resembled a camel in a caravan and encouraged her to tell how stupid and unenterprising mr troy wilkins was when they reached the farmhouse the young moon and the great evening star were low in a wash of turquoise above misty meadows frogs sang una promised herself a long and unworried sleep and the night tingled with an indefinable magic she was absolutely immaculately happy for the first time since she had been ordered to take walter babsons dictation   § 5  mr schwirtz was generous he invited all the boarders to a hayride picnic at hawkinss pond followed by a barn dance he took una and the cannons for a motor ride and insisted on buyingnot giving but buyingdinner for them at the lesterhampton inn  when the débutante una bounced and said she did wish she had some candy he trudged down to the village and bought for her a twopound box of exciting chocolates and when she longed to know how to play tennis he rented balls and two rackets tried to remember what he had learned in two or three games of ten years before and gave her elaborate explanations lest the farmhouse experts mr cannon was said by mrs cannon to be one of the very best players at the winnetka country club see them una and mr schwirtz sneaked out before breakfast their tennis costumes consisted of new canvas shoes they galloped through the dew and swatted at balls ferociouslytwo happy dubs who proudly used all the tennis terms they knew   § 6  mr schwirtz was always there when she wanted him but he never intruded he never was urgent she kept him away for a week but in their second week mr and mrs cannon mr starr miss vincent and the pleasant couple from gloversville all went away and una and mr schwirtz became the elder generation the seniors of the boarders they rather looked down upon the new boarders who came intenderfeet people who didnt know about bald knob or the glade or hawkinss pond people who werent half so witty or comfy as the giants of those golden olden days when mr cannon had ruled una and mr schwirtz deigned to accompany them on picnics even grew interested in their new conceptions of the presidential campaign and croquet and food yet held rather aloof as became the ancien régime took confidential walks together and in secret laughed enormously when the green generation gossiped about them as though they were interested in each other as mr starr and miss vincent had been in the farforgotten time una blushed a little when she discovered that every one thought they were engaged but she laughed at the rumor and she laughed again a nervous young laugh as she repeated it to mr schwirtz  isnt it a shame the way people gossip silly billies she said we never talked that way about mr starr and miss vincentthough in their case we would have been justified  yes bet they were engaged oh say did i tell you about the first day i came here and starr took me aside and says he  in their hourlong talks mr schwirtz had not told much about himself though of his business he had talked often but on an afternoon when they took a book and a lunch and tramped off to a roundtopped grassy hill he finally confided in her and her mild interest in him as an amiable companion deepened to sympathy  the book was the people of the abyss by jack london which mamie magen had given to una as an introduction to a knowledge of social conditions una had planned to absorb it to learn how the shockingly poor live now she read the first four pages to mr schwirtz after each page he said that he was interested at the end of the fourth page when una stopped for breath he commented fine writer that fella london and they say hes quite a fella been a sailor and a miner and all kinds of things ver intimate friend of mine knows him quite wellmet him in friscoand he says hes been a sailor and all kinds of things but hes a socialist tell you i aint got much time for these socialists course im kind of a socialist myself lotsa ways but these here fellas that go around making folks discontented agitators dont suppose its that way with this londonhe must be pretty well fixed and so of course hes probly growing conservative and sensible but most of these socialists are just a lazy bunch of bums that try and see how much trouble they can stir up they think that just because theyre too lazy to find an opening that they got the right to take the money away from the fellas that hustle around and make good trouble with all these socialist guys is that they dont stop to realize that you cant change human nature they want to take away all the rewards for initiative and enterprise just as sam cannon was saying do you spose id work my head off putting a proposition through if there wasnt anything in it for me then nother thing about all this submerged tenththese people of the abyss and all the rest i dont feel a darn bit sorry for them they stick in london or new york or wherever they are and live on charity and if you offered em a good job they wouldnt take it why look here all through the middle west the farmers are just looking for men at three dollars a day and for hired girls theyd give hired girls three and four dollars a week and a good home but do all these people go out and get the jobs not a bit of it theyd rather stay home and yelp about socialism and anarchism and lord knows whatall nother thing i never could figger out what all these socialists and i w ws these i wont works would do if we did divide up and hand all the industries over to them i bet theyd be the very first ones to kick for a return to the old conditions i tell you it surprises me when a good bright man like jack london or this fella upton sinclairthey say hes a welleducated fella toodont stop and realize these things  but said una  then she stopped  her entire knowledge of socialism was comprised in the fact that mamie magen believed in it and that walter babson alternated between socialism anarchism and a desire to own a large house in westchester and write poetry and be superior to the illiterate mass so to the economic spokesman for the great american business man her answer was  but  then look here said mr schwirtz take yourself spose you like to work eight hours a day course you dont neither do i i always thought id like to be a gentleman farmer and take it easy but the good lord saw fit to stick us into these jobs thats all we know about it and we do our work and dont howl about it like all these socialists and radicals and other windjammers that know more than the constitution and congress and a convention of philadelphia lawyers put together you dont want to work as hard as you do and then have to divide up every saturday with some lazy bum of a socialist thats too lazy to support himselfyes or to take a bathnow do you  well no una admitted in face of this triumphant exposure of liberal fallacies  the book slipped into her lap  how wonderful that line of big woolly clouds is there between the two mountains she said id just like to fly through them i am tired the clouds rest me so  course youre tired little sister you just forget about all those guys in the abyss tell you a person on the jobs got enough to do looking out for himself  well said una  suddenly she lay back her hands behind her head her fingers outstretched among the long cool grasses a hum of insects surrounded her the grasses towering above her eyes were a forest she turned her head to watch a ladybug industriously ascend one side of a blade of grass and with equal enterprise immediately descend the other side with the office always in her mind as material for metaphors una compared the ladybugs method to troy wilkinss habit of having his correspondence filed and immediately calling for it again she turned her face to the sky she was uplifted by the bold contrast of cumulus clouds and the radiant blue sky  here she could give herself up to rest she was so secure now with the affable mr schwirtz to guard her against outsidersmore secure and satisfied she reflected than she could ever have been with walter babson a hawk soared above her a perfect thing of sunbrightened grace the grasses smelled warm and pleasant and under her beat the happy heart of the summer land  im a poor old roughneck said mr schwirtz but today up here with you i feel so darn good that i almost think im a decent citizen honest little sister i havent felt so bully for a blue moon  yes and i she said  he smoked while she almost drowsed into slumber to the lullaby of the afternoon  when a blackbird chased a crow above her and she sat up to watch the aerial privateering mr schwirtz began to talk  he spoke of the flight of the wright brothers in france and virginia which were just thenin the summer of 1908arousing the world to a belief in aviation he had as positive information regarding aeroplanes as he had regarding socialism it seemed that a man who was tremendously on the inside of aviationwho was in fact going to use whole tons of aeroplane varnish on aeroplane bodies next month or next seasonhad given mr schwirtz secret advices that within five years by 1913 aeroplanes would be crossing the atlantic daily and conveying passengers and mail on regular routes between new york and chicago though said mr schwirtz in a sophisticated way i dont agree with these crazy enthusiasts that believe aeroplanes will be used in war too easy to shoot em down his information was so sound that he had bought a hundred shares of stock in his customers company in on the ground floor stock at three dollars a share would be worth two hundred a share the minute they started regular passengercarrying  but at that i only took a hundred shares i dont believe in all this stockgambling what i want is sound conservative investments said mr schwirtz  yes i should think youd be awfully practical mused una my three dollars to two hundred youll make an awful lot out of it  well now im not saying anything i dont pretend to be a wisenheimer may be nine or ten yearsnineteen seventeen or nineteen eighteenbefore we are doing a regular business and at that the shares may never go above par but still i guess im middlin practicalnot like these socialists ha ha  how did you ever get your commercial training  the question encouraged him to tell the story of his life  mostly it was a story of dates and towns and jobsjobs he had held and jobs from which he had resigned and all the crushing things he had said to the wicked bosses during those victorious resignings clerk in a general store in a clothingstore in a hardwarestoreall these in ohio a quite excusable almost laudable failure in his own hardwarestore in a tiny wisconsin town half a dozen clerkships collector for a harvester company in nebraska going from farm to farm by buggy traveling salesman for a st paul wholesaler for a chicago clothinghouse married partner with his brotherinlaw in a drug paint and stationery store traveling for a boston painthouse for the lowry paint company of jersey city now with the automobile wax company a typical american business career he remarked though somehow distinctive different a guiding star  una listened murmuringly and he was encouraged to try to express the inner life behind his jobs hesitatingly he sought to make vivid his smallboy life in the hills of west virginia carving initials mowing lawns smoking corn silk being arrested on halloween his fathers death a certain irving who was his friend carrying a paper route during two years of high school his determination to make something of himself his arrival in columbus ohio with just seventyeight centshe emphasized it just seventyeight cents thats every red cent i had when i started out to look for a job and i didnt know a single guy in town his reading of books during the evenings of his first years in ohio he didnt remember their titles exactly he said but he was sure that he read a lot of them  at last he spoke of his wife of their buggyriding of their neat frame house with the lawn and the porch swing of their quarrelshe made it clear that his wife had been finicky and had fool notions but he praised her for having come around and learned that a man is a man and sometimes he means a lot better than it looks like probly he loves her a lot better than a lot of these plushsoled softtongued fellows that give em a lot of guff and loveydovey stuff and dont shell out the cash she was a good sportone of the best  of the death of their baby boy  he was the brightest little kideverybody loved him when i came home tired at night he would grab my fingersee this first fingerand hold it and want me to show him the bunnybook and then he died  mr schwirtz told it simply looking at clouds spread on the blue sky like a thrown handful of white paint  una had hated the word widower it had suggested henry carson and the panama undertaker and funerals and tired men trying to wash children and looking for a new wife to take over that work all the smell and grease of disordered sidestreet kitchens to her now julius edward schwirtz was not a flabbynecked widower but a man who mourned who felt as despairingly as could walter babson the loss of the baby who had crowed over the bunnybook she the motherless almost loved him as she stood with him in the same depth of human grief and she cried a little secretly and thought of her longing for the dead mother as he gently went on  my wife died a year later i couldnt get over it seemed like i could have killed myself when i thought of any mean thing i might have said to hernot meaning anything but hastylike as a man will couldnt seem to get over it evenings were just hell they were soempty even when i was out on the road there wasnt anybody to write to anybody that cared just sit in a hotel room and think about her and i just couldnt realize that she was gone do you know miss golden for months whenever i was coming back to boston from a trip it was her i was coming back to seemed like even though i knew she wasnt thereyes and evenings at home when id be sitting there reading id think i heard her step and id look up and smileand she wouldnt be there she wouldnt ever be there again she was a lot like yousame cute bright sort of a little woman with light hairyes even the same eyeglasses i think maybe thats why i noticed you particular when i first met you at that lunch and remembered you so well afterward though youre really a lot brighter and better educated than what she wasi can see it now i dont mean no disrespect to her she was a good sport they dont make em any better or finer or truer but she hadnt never had much chance she wasnt educated or a live wire like you are you dont mind my saying that do you how you mean to me what she meant  no im glad she whispered  unlike the nimble walter babson mr schwirtz did not make the revelation of his tragedy an excuse for trying to stir her to passion but he had taken and he held her hand among the long grasses and she permitted it  that was all  he did not arouse her still was it walters dark head and the head of walters baby that she wanted to cradle on her breast but for mr schwirtz she felt a good will that was broad as the summer afternoon  i am very glad you told me i do understand i lost my mother just a year ago she said softly  he squeezed her hand and sighed thank you little sister then he rose and more briskly announced getting latebetter be hiking i guess  not again did he even touch her hand but on his last night at the farmhouse he begged may i come to call on you in new york and she said yes please do  she stayed for a day after his departure a long and lonely sunday she walked five miles by herself she thought of the momently more horrible fact that vacation was over that the office would engulf her again she declared to herself that two weeks were just long enough holiday to rest her to free her from the office not long enough to begin to find positive joy  between shudders before the swiftly approaching office she thought of mr schwirtz she still called him that to herself she couldnt fit eddie to his trim bulkiness his maturity  she decided that he was wrong about socialism she feebly tried to see wherein and determined to consult her teacher in ideals mamie magen regarding the proper answers to him she was sure that he was rather crude in manners and speech rather boastful somewhat loquacious  but i do like him she cried to the hillsides and the free sky he would take care of me hes kind and he would learn well go to concerts and things like that in new yorkdear me i guess i dont know any too much about art things myself i dont know why but even if he isnt interesting like mamie magen i like himi think   § 7  on the train back to new york early monday morning she felt so fresh and fit with morning vigorous in her and about her that she relished the thought of attacking the job why she rejoiced every fiber of her was simply soaked with holiday she was so much stronger and happier new york and the business world simply couldnt be the same old routine because she herself was different  but the train became hot and dusty the italians began to take off their collars and handpainted ties  and hot and dusty perspiring and dizzily rushing were the streets of new york when she ventured from the grand central station out into them once more  it was late she went to the office at once she tried to push away her feeling that the berkshires where she had arisen to a cool green dawn just that morning were leagues and years away tired she was but sunburnt and easybreathing she exploded into the office set down her suitcase found herself glad to shake mr wilkinss hand and to answer his cordial well well youre brown as a berry have a good time  the office was different she criedcried to that other earlier self who had sat in a train and hoped that the office would be different  she kissed bessie kraker and by an error of enthusiasm nearly kissed the officeboy and told them about the farmhouse the view from her room the glade bald knob hawkinss pond about chickens and fresh milk and pigeons aflutter she showed them the kodak pictures taken by mrs cannon and indicated mr starr and miss vincent and laughed about them till  oh miss golden could you take a little dictation now mr wilkins called  there was also a pile of correspondence unfiled and the office supplies were low and bessie was behind with her copying and the officeboy had let the place get as dusty as a hayloftand the stiff old gray floorrag was grimly at its post in the washroom  the office isnt changed she said and when she went out at three for belated lunch she added and new york isnt either oh lord i really am back here same old hot streets dont believe there are any berkshires just seems now as though i hadnt been away at all  she sat in negligée on the roof of the home club and learned that rose larsen and mamie magen and a dozen others had just gone on vacation  lord its over for me she thought fifty more weeks of the job before i can get away againa whole year vacation is farther from me now than ever and the same old grind lets see ive got to get in touch with the adine company for mr wilkins before i even do any filing in the morning  she awoke after midnight and worried i mustnt forget to get after the adine company the very first thing in the morning and mr wilkins has got to get bessie and me a wastebasket apiece oh lord i wish eddie schwirtz were going to take me out for a walk tomorrow the old darling that he is id walk anywhere rather than ask mr wilkins for those blame wastebaskets     chapter xiv   mrs esther lawrence was she said bored by the general atmosphere of innocent and bounding girlhood at the temperance home club and she persuaded una to join her in taking a flatthree small roomswhich they made attractive with japanese toweling and russian or at least russianjew brassware here mrs lawrences men came calling and sometimes mr julius edward schwirtz and all of them except una herself had cigarettes and highballs and una confusedly felt that she was getting to be an independent woman  then in january 1909 she left the stiff gray scrubrag which symbolized the routine of mr troy wilkinss office  in a magazine devoted to advertising she had read that mr s herbert ross whom she had known as advertisingmanager of the gas and motor gazette had been appointed advertisingmanager for pembertonsthe greatest manufactory of drugs and toilet articles in the world una had just been informed by mr wilkins that while he had an almost paternal desire to see her successful financially and otherwise he could never pay her more than fifteen dollars a week he used a favorite phrase of commuting captains of commerce personally id be glad to pay you more but fifteen is all the position is worth she tried to persuade him that there is no position which cannot be made worth more he promised to think it over he was still taking a few months to think it overwhile her saturday payenvelope remained as thin as everwhen bessie kraker resigned to marry a mattressrenovator and in bessies place mr wilkins engaged a tall beautiful blonde who was too much of a lady to take orders from una this wrecked unas little office home and she was inspired to write to mr s herbert ross at pembertons telling him what a wise good noble efficient man he was and how much of a privilege it would be to become his secretary she felt that walter babson must have been inexact in ever referring to mr ross as sherbet souse  mr ross disregarded her letter for ten days then so urgently telephoned her to come and see him that she took a taxicab clear to the pemberton building in long island city after paying a weeks lunch money for the taxicab it was rather hard to discover why mr ross had been quite so urgent he rolled about his magnificent mahogany and tapestry office looked out of the window at the long island railroad tracks and told her in confidence what fools all the gas gazette chiefs had been and all his employers since then she smiled appreciatively and tried to get in a tactful remark about a position she did discover that mr ross had not as yet chosen his secretary at pembertons but beyond this una could find no evidence that he supposed her to have come for any reason other than to hear his mellow wisdom and even mellower stories  after more than a month during which mr ross diverted himself by making appointments postponing them forgetting them telephoning telegraphing sending specialdelivery letters being paged at hotels and doing all the useless melodramatic things he could think of except using an aeroplane or a submarine he decided to make her his secretary at twenty dollars a week two days later it occurred to him to test her in regard to speed in dictation and typing and a few other minor things of the sort which her ability as a longdistance listener had made him overlook fortunately she also passed this test  when she told mr wilkins that she was going to leave he used another set of phrases which all sidestreet office potentates knowthey must learn these clichés out of a little redleather manual he tightened his lips and tapped on his deskpad with a blue pencil he looked grieved and said touchingly i think youre making a mistake i was making plans for you in fact i had just about decided to offer you eighteen dollars a week and to advance you just as fast as the business will warrant i uh well i think youre making a mistake in leaving a sure thing a good sound conservative place for something you dont know anything about im not in any way urging you to stay you understand but i dont like to see you making a mistake  but he had also told bessie kraker that she was making a mistake when she had resigned to be married and he had been so very certain that una could never be worth more than fifteen una was rather tart about it though mr ross didnt want her at pembertons for two weeks more she told mr wilkins that she was going to leave on the following saturday  it did not occur to her till mr wilkins developed nervous indigestion by trying to break in a new secretary who couldnt tell a blueprint from a set of specifications that he had his side in the perpetual struggle between illpaid failure employers and illpaid ambitious employees she was sorry for him as she watched him putter and she helped him stayed late and powerfully exhorted her successor mr wilkins revived and hoped that she would stay another week but stay she could not once she knew that she was able to break away from the scrubrag that specter of the washroom and the bleak frosted glass on the semipartition in front of her desk no wage could have helped her every moment here was an edged agony  in this refusal there may have been a trace of aspiration otherwise the whole affair was a hodgepodge of petty people and ignoble motivesof una and wilkins and s herbert ross and bessie kraker who married a mattressrenovator and bessies successor of fifteen dollars a week and everybody trying to deceive everybody else of vague reasons for going and vaguer reasons for letting una go and no reason at all for her remaining in all an ascent from a scrubrag to a glorified soapfactory designed to provide mr pembertons daughtersinlaw with motors  so long as her world was ruled by chance halftraining and lack of clear purpose how could it be other than a hodgepodge   § 2  she could not take as a holiday the two weeks intervening between the wilkins office and pembertons when she left wilkinss exulting this is the last time ill ever go down in one of these rickety elevators she had besides her fifteen dollars in salary one dollar and seventeen cents in the savingsbank  mamie magen gave her the opportunity to spend the two weeks installing a modern filingsystem at herzfeld  cohns  so una had a glimpse of the almost beautiful thing business can be  herzfeld and cohn were jews old whitebearded orthodox jews their unpoetic business was the jobbing of iron beds and una was typical of that new york which the jews are conquering in having nebulous prejudices against the race in calling them mean and grasping and unamerican and wanting to see them shut out of offices and hotels  yet with their merry eyes their quick little foreign cries and gestures of sympathy their laughter that rumbled in their tremendous beards their habit of having coffee and pinochle in the office every friday afternoon their sincere belief that as the bosses they were not omniscient rulers but merely elder fellowworkerswith these unamerican eccentric patriarchal ways herzfeld and cohn had made their office a joyous adventure other people in the trade sniffed at herzfeld and cohn for their quixotic notions of discipline but they made it pay in dividends as well as in affection at breakfast una would find herself eager to get back to work though herzfeld and cohn had but a plain office in an ugly building of brownstone and iron corinthian columns resembling an oldfashioned postoffice and typical of all that block on church street there was such gentleness here as una was not to find in the modern glazedbrick palace of pembertons   § 3  above railroad yards and mean tenements in long island city just across the east river from new york the shining milky walls of pembertons bulk up like a castle overtowering a thatched village it is magnificently the newfashioned scientific efficient business institution except perhaps in one tiny detail king pemberton and his princely sons do not believe in all this nonsense about profitsharing or a minimum wage or an eighthour day or pensions or any of the other fads by which dangerous persons like mr ford the motor manufacturer encourage the lazier workmen to think that they have just as much right to rise to the top as the men who have had nerve and foresight and indeed mr pemberton may be sound he says that he bases wages on the economic law of supply and demand instead of on sentiment and how shrewdly successful are he and his sons is indicated by the fact that pembertons is one of the largest sources of drugs and proprietary medicines in the world the second largest manufactory of sodafountain syrups of rubber celluloid and leather goods of the kind seen in corner drugstores and the third largest manufactory of soaps and toilet articles it has been calculated that ninetythree million women in all parts of the world have ruined their complexions and therefore their souls by pembertons creams and lotions for saving the same and that nearly threetenths of the alcohol consumed in prohibition counties is obtained in pembertons tonics and bloodbuilders and womens specifics the last being regarded by large farmers with beards as especially tasty and stimulating mr pemberton is the napoleon of patent medicine and also the napoleon of drugs used by physicians to cure the effects of patent medicine he is the shakespeare of icecream sodas and the edison of hotwater bags he rules more than five thousand employees and his name is glorious on cartons in drugstores from sandy hook to san diego and chemists shops from hongkong to the scilly isles he is a modern allah and mr s herbert ross is his prophet   § 4  una discovered that mr ross who had been negligible as advertisingmanager of the gas and motor gazette had in two or three years become a light domestic great man because he so completely believed in his own genius and because advertising is the romance the faith the mystery of business mr pemberton though he knew well enough that soapmaking was a perfectly natural phenomenon could never get over marveling at the supernatural manner in which advertising seemed to create something out of nothing it took a cherry fountain syrup which was merely a chemical imitation that under an old name was familiar to everybody it gave the syrup a new name and made twenty million children clamor for it mr pemberton could never quite understand that advertising was merely a matter of salesmanship by paper and ink nor that mr rosss assistants who wrote the copy and drew the pictures and selected the mediums and got the mats over to the agency on time were real advertising men no the trusting old pirate believed it was also necessary to have an ordained advertisingmanager like mr ross a real initiate who could pull a long face and talk about the psychology of the utilitarian appeal and pulling power and all the rest of the theology so he who paid packinggirls as little as four dollars a week paid mr ross fifteen thousand dollars a year and let him have competent assistants and invited him out to the big lonely unhappy pemberton house in the country and listened to his sacerdotal discourses and let him keep four or five jobs at once for besides being advertisingmanager for pembertons mr ross went off to deliver lyceum lectures and chautauqua addresses and club chitchats on the blessings of selling more soap or underwear and for the magazines he wrote prose poems about stars and sympathy and punch and early rising and roadside flowers and argosies and farming and saving money  all this dogelike splendor una discovered but could scarcely believe for in his own office mr ross seemed but as the rest of usa small round man with a clownlike little face and hair cut dutchwise across his forehead when he smoked a big cigar he appeared naughty one expected to see his mother come and judiciously smack him but more and more una felt the force of his attitude that he was a genius incomparable she could not believe that he knew what a gorgeous fraud he was on the same day he received an advance in salary discharged an assistant for requesting an advance in salary and dictated a magazine filler to the effect that the chief duty of executives was to advance salaries she could not chart him thus for thousands of years have servants been amazed at the difference between pontiffs in the pulpit and pontiffs in the pantry  doubtless it helped mr ross in maintaining his sublimity to dress like a clericblack modest suits of straight lines white shirts small black ties but he also wore silk socks which he reflectively scratched while he was dictating he was of an elegance in linen handkerchiefs in a chasedgold cigarettecase in cigarettes with a monogram indeed he often stopped during dictation to lean across the enormous mahogany desk and explain to una how much of a connoisseur he was in tennis flycasting the ordering of small smart dinners at the plaza  he was fond of the word smart  rather smart poster eh he would say holding up the latest creation of his geniusthat is to say of his genius in hiring the men who had planned and prepared the creation  mr ross was as full of ideas as of elegance he gave birth to ideas at lunch at conferences while motoring while being refreshed with a manicure and a violetray treatment at a barbershop in the middle of one of his arduous afternoons he would gallop back to the office with notes on these ideas pant at una in a controlled voice quickyour bookgot a idea and dictate the outline of such schemes as the tranquillity lunch rooma place of silence and expensive food the grand arcadea tenblocklong rival to broadway all under glass the barbershop syndicate with engagement cards sent out every third week to notify customers that the time for a haircut had come again none of these ideas ever had anything to do with assisting mr pemberton in the sale of soap and none of them ever went any farther than being outlined whenever he had dictated one of them mr ross would assume that he had already made a million out of it and in his quiet hypnotizing voice he would permit una to learn what a great man he was hitching his chair an inch nearer to her at each sentence looking straight into her eyes in a manner as unboastful as though he were giving the market price of eggs he would tell her how j pierpont morgan burbank or william randolph hearst had praised him or how much more he knew about electricity or toxicology or frogs or java than anybody else in the world  not only a priest but a virtuoso of business was he and unas chief task was to keep assuring him that he was a great man a very great manin fact as great as he thought he was this task was to the uneasily sincere una the hardest she had ever attempted it was worth five dollars more a week than she had received from troy wilkinsit was worth a million more  she got confidence in herself from the ease with which she satisfied mr ross by her cold canned compliments and though she was often dizzied by the whirling dynamo of pembertons she was not bored by the routine of valeting mr ross in his actual work for mr ross actually did work now and then though his chief duty was to make an impression on old mr pemberton his sons and the other big chiefs still he did condescend to put his o k on pictures on copy and proof for magazine advertisements car cards windowdisplay cutouts and he dictated highly ethical reading matter for the house organ which was distributed to ten thousand drugstores and which spoke well of honesty feminine beauty gardening and pembertons occasionally he had a really useful idea like the celebrated slogan pembertons means pure which you see in every streetcar on every fourth or fifth billboard it is frequent as the in god we trust on our coins and at least as accurate this slogan he told una surpassed a train every hour on the hour or the watch that made the dollar famous or the ham what am or any of the other masterpieces of lyric advertising he had created it after going into a sibyllic trance of five days during which he had drunk champagne and black coffee and ridden about in hansoms delicately brushing his nose with a genuine california poppy from the monterey garden of r l s  if mr ross was somewhat agitating he was calm as the desert compared with the rest of pembertons  his office which was like a milliondollar hotel lobby and unas own den which was like the baggageporters den adjoining the same were the only spots at pembertons where una felt secure outside of them fourteen stories up in the titanic factory was an enormous officefloor which was a wilderness of desks toiletrooms elevators waitingrooms filingcabinets her own personality was absorbed in the cosmic though soapy personality of pembertons instead of longing for a change she clung to her own corner its desk and springback chair and the insurance calendar with a highcolored picture of washingtons farewell she preferred to rest here rather than in the clubroom and restroom for women employees on which mr pemberton so prided himself  una heard rumors of restrooms which were really beautiful really restful but at pembertons the room resembled a far rockaway cottage rented by the week to feebleminded bookkeepers musty it was with curtains awry and it must have been of use to all the branches of the pemberton family in cleaning out their attics here was the old stuffed chair in which pemberton i had died and the cot which had been in the cooks room till she had protested the superstition among the chiefs was that all the women employees were very grateful for this charity the room was always shown to exclamatory visitors who told mr pemberton that he was almost too good but in secret conclaves at lunch the girls called the room the junkshop and said that they would rather go out and sit on the curb  una herself took one lookand one smellat the room and never went near it again  but even had it been enticing she would not have frequented it her caste as secretary forbade for pembertons was as full of caste and politics as a republican national convention caste and politics cliques and factions plots and secrets and dynasties that passed and were forgotten  plots and secrets una saw as secretary to mr ross she remembered a day on which mr ross in her presence assured old pemberton that he hoped to be with the firm for the rest of his life and immediately afterward dictated a letter to the president of a rival firm in the effort to secure a new position he destroyed the carbon copy of that letter and looked at una as serenely as ever una saw him read letters on the desks of other chiefs while he was talking to them saw him listen in on telephone calls and casually thrust his foot into doors in order to have a glimpse of the visitors in offices she saw one of the younger pembertons hide behind a bookcase while his father was talking to his brother she knew that this pemberton and mr ross were plotting to oust the brother and that the young alert purchasing agent was trying to undermine them both she knew that one of the girls in the private telephone exchange was the mistress and spy of old pemberton all of the chiefs tried to emulate the moyenage italians in the arts of smiling poisoningbut they did it so badly they were as fussily ineffectual as a group of schoolboys who hate their teacher not big deals and vast grim power did they achieve but merely a constant current of worried insecurity and they all tended to prove mrs lawrences assertion that the officeworld is a method of giving the largest possible number of people the largest possible amount of nervous discomfort to the end of producing the largest possible quantity of totally useless articles the struggle extended from the chiefs to the clerks they who tramped up and down a corridor waiting till a chief was alone glaring at others who were also manoeuvering to see him they who studied the lightest remark of any chief and rushed to allies with the problem of now what did he mean by that do you think a thousand questions of making an impression on the overlords and of house policythat malicious little spirit which stalks through the business house and encourages people to refuse favors  unas share in the actual work at pembertons would have been only a mornings pastime but her contact with the highvoltage current of politics exhausted herand taught her that commercial rewards come to those who demand and take  the office politics bred caste caste at pembertons was as clearly defined as ranks in an army  at the top were the big chiefs the officers of the company and the heads of departmentsmr pemberton and his sons the treasurer the general manager the purchasingagent the superintendents of the sodafountainsyrup factory of the soapworks of the druglaboratories of the toiletaccessories shops the salesmanager and mr s herbert ross the olympian council were they divinities to whom the lesser clerks had never dared to speak when there were rumors of a change of a cutdown in the force every person on the office floor watched the chiefs as they assembled to go out to lunch togetherbig florid shaven largechinned men talking easily healthy from motoring and golf able in a moments conference at lunch to shift the policy and to bring instant poverty to the families of forty clerks or four hundred workmen in the shops when they jovially entered the elevator together some highstrung stenographer would rush over to one of the older women to weep and be comforted an hour from now her tiny job might be gone  even the chiefs outside associates were tremendous buyers and diplomatic representatives bigchested men with watchchains across their beautiful tight waistcoats and like envoys extraordinary were the efficiency experts whom mr pemberton occasionally had in to speed up the work a bit more beyond the point of human endurance one of these experts a smiling and palehaired young man who talked to mr ross about the new poetry arranged to have officeboys go about with trays of waterglasses at ten twelve two and four thitherto the stenographers had wasted a great deal of time in trotting to the battery of watercoolers in actually being human and relaxed and gossipy for ten minutes a day after the visitation of the expert the girls were so efficient that they never for a second stopped their workexcept when one of them would explode in hysteria and be hurried off to the restroom but no expert was able to keep them from jumping at the chance to marry any one who would condescend to take them out of this efficient atmosphere  just beneath the chiefs was the caste of bright young men who would some day have the chance to be beatified into chiefs they believed enormously in the virtue of spreading the blessings of pembertons patent medicines they worshiped the house policy once a month they met at what they called punch lunches and listened to electrifying addresses by mr s herbert ross or some other inspirer and turned fresh excited eyes on one another and vowed to adhere to the true faith of pembertons and not waste their evenings in making love or reading fiction or hearing music but to read diligently about soap and syrups and window displays and to keep firmly before them the vision of fifteen thousand dollars a year they had quite the best time of any one at pembertons the bright young men they sat in silk shirts and new ties at shiny flattopped desks in rows they answered the telephone with an air they talked about tennis and business conditions and were never never bored  intermingled with this caste were the petty chiefs the officemanagers and bookkeepers who were velvety to those placed in power over them but twangily nagging to the girls and young men under them failures themselves they eyed sourly the stenographers who desired two dollars more a week and assured them that while personally they would be very glad to obtain the advance for them it would be unfair to the other girls they were very strong on the subject of not being unfair to the other girls and their own salaries were based on keeping down overhead oldish men they were wearing lastyear hats and smoking virginia cigarettes at lunch always gossiping about the big chiefs and at night disappearing to homes and families in new jersey or harlem aweencircled as the very chiefs they appeared when they lectured stenographers but they cowered when the chiefs spoke to them and tremblingly fingered their frayed cuffs  such were the castes above the buzzerline  unas caste made up of private secretaries to the chiefs was not above the buzzer she had to leap to the rattlesnake tattoo when mr ross summoned her as quickly as did the newest jewish stenographer but hers was a staff corps small and exclusive and out of the regular line on the one hand she could not associate with the chiefs on the other it was expected of her in her capacity as daily confidante to one of the gods that she should not be friendly in coatroom or restroom or elevator with the unrecognized horde of girls who merely copied or took the bright young mens dictation of letters to drugstores these girls of the common herd were expected to call the secretaries miss no matter what streetcorner impertinences they used to one another  there was no caste though there was much factional rivalry among the slaves beneaththe stenographers copyists clerks waitingroom attendants officeboys elevatorboys they were expected to keep clean and be quickmoving beyond that they were as unimportant to the larger phases of office politics as frogs to a summer hotel only the cashiers card index could remember their names though they were not deprived of the chief human satisfaction and vicefeeling superior the most snufflenosed little mailinggirl on the office floor felt superior to all of the factory workers even the foremen quite as negro houseservants look down on poor white trash  jealousy of position cattishness envy of social standingthese were as evident among the officewomen as they are in a womans club and una had to admit that womans cruelty to woman often justified the prejudices of executives against the employment of women in business that women were the worst foes of woman  to unas sympathies the office proletarians were her own poor relations she sighed over the cheap jackets with silesia linings and raveled buttonholes which nameless copyists tried to make attractive by the clean embroidered linen collars which they themselves laundered in washbowls in the evening she discovered that even after years of experience with actual officeboys and elevatorboys mr ross still saw them only as slangy comicpaper devils then in the elevator she ascertained that the runners made about two hundred trips up and down the dark chutes every day and wondered if they always found it comic to do so she saw the officeboys just growing into the age of interest in sex and acquiring husky male voices and shambling sense of shame yearn at the shrines of pastyfaced stenographers she saw the humanity of all this massnone the less that they envied her position and spoke privily of those snippy private secretaries that think theyre so much sweller than the rest of us  she watched with peculiar interest one stratum the old ladies the whitehaired fairhanded women of fifty and sixty and even seventy spinsters and widows for whom life was nothing but a desk and a job of petty pickingsmailing circulars or assorting letters or checking up lists she watched them so closely because she speculated always will i ever be like that  they seemed comfortable gossipy they were and fond of mothering the girls but now and then one of them would start to weep cry for an hour together with her white head on a spotty deskblotter till she forgot her homelessness and uselessness epidemics of hysteria would spring up sometimes and women of thirtyfive or fortynormally well contentwould join the old ladies in sobbing una would wonder if she would be crying like that at thirtyfiveand at sixtyfive with thirty barren weeping years between always she saw the girls of twentytwo getting tired the women of twentyeight getting dry and stringy the women of thirtyfive in a solid maturity of largebosomed and widowed spinsterhood the old women purring and catty and tragic she herself was twentyeight now and she knew that she was growing sallow that the back of her neck ached more often and that she had no release in sight save the affably dull mr julius edward schwirtz  machines were the pemberton force and their greatest rivals were the machines of steel and wood at least one of which each new efficiency expert left behind him machines for opening letters and sealing them automatic typewriters dictation phonographs pneumatic chutes but none of the other machines was so tyrannical as the timeclock una admitted to herself that she didnt see how it was possible to get so many employees together promptly without it and she was duly edified by the fact that the big chiefs punched it too but she noticed that after punching it promptly at nine in an unctuous manner which said to all beholders you see that even i subject myself to this delightful humility mr s herbert ross frequently sneaked out and had breakfast  she knew that the machines were supposed to save work but she was aware that the girls worked just as hard and long and hopelessly after their introduction as before and she suspected that there was something wrong with a social system in which timesaving devices didnt save time for anybody but the owners she was not big enough nor small enough to have a patent cureall solution ready she could not imagine any future for these women in business except the accidents of marriage or deathor a revolution in the attitude toward them she saw that the comfortable average men of the office sooner or later if they were but faithful and lived long enough had opportunities responsibility forced upon them no such force was used upon the comfortable average women  she endeavored to picture a future in which women the ordinary philoprogenitive unambitious women would have some way out besides being married off or killed off she envisioned a complete change in the fundamental purpose of organized business from the increased production of soapor books or munitionsto the increased production of happiness how this revolution was to be accomplished she had but little more notion than the other average women in business she blindly adopted from mamie magen a halfcomprehended faith in a fabian socialism a socializing that would crawl slowly through practical education and the preaching of kinship through profitsharing and oldage pensions through scientific mosquitoslaying and cancercuring and food reform and the abolition of anarchistic business competition to a goal of tolerable and beautiful life of one thing she was sure this age which should adjudge happiness to be as valuable as soap or munitions would never come so long as the workers accepted the testimony of paid spokesmen like s herbert ross to the effect that they were contented and happy rather than the evidence of their own wincing nerves to the effect that they lived in a polite version of hell she was more and more certain that the workers werent discontented enough that they were too patient with lives insecure and tedious but she refused to believe that the age of comparative happiness would always be a dream for already at herzfeld  cohns she had tasted of an environment where no one considered himself a divinely ruling chief and where it was not a crime to laugh easily but certainly she did not expect to see this age during her own life she and her fellows were doomed unless they met by chance with marriage or death or unless they crawled to the top of the heap and this last she was determined to do though she did hope to get to the top without unduly kicking the shrieking mass of slaves beneath her as the bright young men learned to do  whenever she faced mr rosss imperturbable belief that thingsastheyare were going pretty well that you cant change human nature una would become meek and puzzled lose her small store of revolutionary economics and wonder grope doubt her millennial faith then she would again see the dead eyes of young girls as they entered the elevators at fivethirty and she would rage at all chiefs and bright young men a goldeyeglassed kittenstepping good little thing she was and competent to assist mr ross in his mighty labors yet at heart she was a shawled irish peasant or a muzhik lost in the vastness of the steppes a creature elemental and despairing facing mysterious powers of naturehuman nature     chapter xv   mr julius edward schwirtz was a regular visitant at the flat of mrs lawrence and una mrs lawrence liked him in his presence she abandoned her pretense of being interested in mamie magens arid intellectualism and unas quivering anxieties mr schwirtz was ready for any party whenever he was in off the road  una began to depend on him for amusements mrs lawrence encouraged her to appear at her best before him when he or one of mrs lawrences men was coming the two women had an early and quick dinner of cold ham and canned soup and hastily got out the electric iron to press a frock produced pembertons fleshtinted vanisho powder and the lipstick whose use una hated but which she needed more and more as she came back from the office bloodless and cold they studied together the feminine art of using a new veil a flower or fresh whitekid gloves to change ones appearance  poor una she was thinking now secretly and shamefacedly of the beautifying methods which she saw advertised in every newspaper and cheap magazine she rubbed her red deskcalloused elbows with pembertons coldcream she coldcreamed and massaged her face every night standing wearily before a milky mirror in the rather close and lingeriescattered bedroom solemnly rotating her fingers about her cheeks and forehead stopping to conjecture that the pores in her nose were getting enlarged she rubbed her hair with pembertons olivine and petrol to keep it from growing thin and her neck with cocoanut oil to make it more full she sent for a bottle of mme legrands bustdeveloper and spent several saturday afternoons at the beauty parlors of mme isoldi where in a little booth shut off by a whiterubber curtain she received electrical massages applications of a magic nray hairbrush vigorous coldcreaming and warmcompressing and enormous amounts of advice about caring for the hair follicles from a young woman who spoke french with a jewish accent  by a twist of psychology though she had not been particularly fond of mr schwirtz but had anointed herself for his coming because he was a representative of men yet after months of thus dignifying his attentions the very effort made her suppose that she must be fond of him not mr schwirtz but her own self did she befool with pembertons preparations de paris  sometimes with him alone sometimes with him and mrs lawrence and one of mrs lawrences young businessman attendants una went to theaters and dinners and heterogeneous dances  she was dazzled and excited when mr schwirtz took her to the opening of the champs du pompom the latest potpourri of amusements on broadway all under one roof were a supervaudeville show a smart musical comedy and the fireworks of oneact plays a chinese restaurant and a louis quinze restaurant and a syrian desertcaravan restaurant a ballroom and an iceskating rink a summer garden that in midwinter luxuriated in real trees and real grass and a real brook crossed by japanese bridges mr schwirtz was tireless and extravagant and hearty at the champs du pompom he made una dance and skate he had a box for the vaudeville he gave her caviar canapé and lobster à la rue des trois soeurs in the louis quinze room and sparkling burgundy in the summer garden where mockingbirds sang in the wavering branches above their table una took away an impressionistic picture of the evening  scarlet and shadowy green sequins of gold slim shoulders veiled in costly mist the glitter of spangles the hissing of silk low laughter and continual music quieter than a dream crowds that were not harsh busy folk of the streets but a nodding procession of gallant men and women a kindly cleverness which inspirited her and a dusky perfume in which she could meditate forever like an egyptian goddess throned at the end of incensecurtained aisles great tapestries of velvet and jeweled lights swift smiling servants and the languorous wellbeing of eating strange delicious foods orchids and the scent of poppies and spell of the lotosflower the bead of wine and lips that yearned ecstasy in the oriental pride of a superb jewess who was singing to the demure enchantment of little violins her restlessness satisfied a momentary pang of distrust healed by the brotherly talk of the broadshouldered man who cared for her and nimbly fulfilled her every whim an unvoiced desire to keep him from drinking so many highballs an enduring thankfulness to him when she was back at the flat a defiant joy that he had kissed her goodnightjust once and so tenderly a determination to be good for him and a fear that he had spent too much money on her tonight and a plan to reason with him about whisky and extravagance a sudden hatred of the office to which she would have to return in the morning and a stronger more sardonic hatred of hearing mr s herbert ross pluck out his vestpocket harp and hymn his own praise in a oneman choir cherubic but slightly fat a descent from high gardens of moonlight to the reality of the flat where lawrence was breathing loudly in her sleep the oily smell of hairs tangled in her old hairbrush the sight of the alarmclock which in just six hours would be flogging her off to the mill a sudden frightened query as to what scornful disdain walter babson would fling at her if he saw her glorying in this broadway circus with the heavy mr schwirtz a ghostly nightborn feeling that she still belonged to walter living or dead and a wonder as to where in all the world he might be a defiant protest that she idealized walter that he wasnt so awfully superior to the champs du pompom as this astral body of his was pretending and a still more defiant gratitude to mr schwirtz as she crawled into the tousled bed and mrs lawrence half woke to yawn oh thatyougoldn gawd im sleepy wha time is t   § 2  una was sorry she hated herself as what she called a quitter but now in january 1910 she was at an impasse she could just stagger through each day of s herbert ross and office diplomacies she had been at pembertons for a year and a third and longer than that with mrs lawrence at the flat the summer vacation of 1909 she had spent with mrs lawrence at a jersey coast resort they had been jealous had quarreled and made it up every day like lovers they had picked up two summer men and mrs lawrence had so often gone off on picnics with her man that una had become uneasy felt soiled and come back to the city early for this mrs lawrence had never forgiven her she had recently become engaged to a doctor who was going to akron ohio and she exasperated una by giving her bland advice about trying to get married una never knew whether she was divorced or whether the mysterious mr lawrence had died  but even the difficile lawrence was preferable to the strain at the office una was tired clean through and through she felt as though her very soul had been drained out by a million bloodsucker detailsconstant adjustments to rosss demands for admiration of his filthiest office political deals and the need of keeping friendly with both sides when ross was engaged in one of his frequent altercations with an assistant  often she could not eat in the evening she would sit on the edge of the bed and cry hopelessly with a long feeble peculiarly feminine sobbing till mrs lawrence slammed the door and went off to the motion pictures una kept repeating a little litany she had made regarding the things she wished people would stop doingpraying to be delivered from rosss buoyant egotism from mrs lawrences wearing of unas best veils from mr schwirtzs acting as though he wanted to kiss her whenever he had a whisky breath from the officemanager who came in to chat with her just when she was busiest from the officeboy who always snapped his fingers as he went down the corridor outside her door and from the elevatorboy who sucked his teeth  she was sorry she wanted to climb she didnt want to be a quitter but she was at an impasse  on a january day the pemberton office beheld that most terrifying crisis that can come to a hard slavedriving office as the office put it the old man was on a rampage  mr pemberton senior most hoarily awful of all the big chiefs had indigestion or a poor balancesheet he decided that everything was going wrong he raged from room to room he denounced the new poster the new top for the talcumpowder container the arrangement of the files and the whispering in the amen corner of veteran stenographers he sent out flocks of office memoes everybody trembled mr pembertons sons actually did some work and as the fire spread and the minor bosses in turn raged among their subordinates the girls who packed soap down in the works expected to be fired after a visitation from mr pemberton and three raging memoes within fifteen minutes mr s herbert ross retreated toward the lafayette café and una was left to face mr pembertons bearlike growls on his next appearance  when he did appear he seemed to hold her responsible for all the worlds long sadness meanwhile the printer was telephoning for mr rosss o k on copy the engravers wanted to know where the devil was that colorproof the advertising agency sarcastically indicated that it was difficult for them to insert an advertisement before they received the order and a girl from the cashiers office came nagging in about a bill for india ink  the memoes began to get the range of her desk again and mr pembertons voice could be heard in a distant part of the office approaching menacing allpervading  una fled she ran to a washroom locked the door leaned panting against it as though detectives were pursuing her she was safe for a moment they might miss her but she was insulated from demands of wheres ross miss golden well why dont you know where he is from telephone calls and from memoes whose polite please was a gloved threat  but even to this refuge the familiar sound of the office penetratedthe whirr which usually sounded as a homogeneous murmur but which in her acute sensitiveness she now analyzed into the voices of different typewritersone flat rapid staccato one a steady dull rattle the zzzzz of typewritercarriages being shoved back the roll of closing elevator doors and the rumble of the ascending elevator the long burr of an unanswered telephone at a desk again and again and at last an angry well hello yes yes this s mr jones whatduhyuh want voices mingled a shout for mr brown the hallattendant yelping miss golden wheres miss golden anything for sanford mr smith dyou know if theres anything for sanford always over and through all the enveloping clatter of typewriters and the city roar behind that breaking through the barrier of the door  the individual analyzed sounds again blended in one insistent noise of hurry which assailed unas conscience summoned her back to her work  she sighed washed her stinging eyes opened the door and trailed back toward her den  in the corridor she passed three young stenographers and heard one of them cry yes but i dont care if old alfalfa goes on a rampage twentyfive hours a day im through listen may say what dyou know about me im engaged no honest straight i am look at me ring aw it is not its a regular engagementring im going to be out of this hellhole in two weeks and papa pemberton can work off his temper on somebody else me im going to do a slumber marathon till noon every day  gee  engaged  said the other girls and  engaged going to sleep till noon every day and not see mr ross or mr pemberton thats my idea of heaven thought una  there was a pile of inquiring memoes from mr pemberton and the several department heads on her desk as she looked at them una reached the point of active protest  s herbert runs for shelter when the storm breaks and leaves me here to stand it why isnt he supposed to be here on the job just as much as i am she declaimed why havent i the nerve to jump up and go out for a cup of tea the way he would by jiminy i will  she was afraid of the indefinite menace concealed in all the pemberton system as she signaled an elevator but she did not answer a word when the hallattendant said you are going out miss golden  she went to a germanjewish bakery and lunchroom and reflectively got down thin coffee served in a thick cup a sugarwarted kaffeekuche and two crullers she was less willing to go back to work than she had been in her refuge in the washroom she felt that she would rather be dead than return and subject herself to the strain she was through like the little engaged girl she was a quitter  for half an hour she remained in the office but she left promptly at fivethirty though her desk was choked with work and though mr ross telephoned that he would be back before six which was his chivalrous way of demanding that she stay till seven  mr schwirtz was coming to see her that evening he had suggested vaudeville  she dressed very carefully she did her hair in a new way  when mr schwirtz came she cried that she couldnt go to a show she was clean played out she didnt know what she could do pembertons was too big a threshingmachine for her she was tiredabsolutely all in  poor little sister he said and smoothed her hair  she rested her face on his shoulder it seemed broad and strong and protective  she was glad when he put his arm about her  she was married to mr schwirtz about two weeks later   § 3  she had got herself to call him ed  eddie she could not encompass even in that fortnight of rushing change and bewilderment  she asked for a honeymoon trip to savannah she wanted to rest she had to rest or she would break she said  they went to savannah to the liveoaks and palmettoes and quiet old squares  but she did not rest always she brooded about the unleashed brutality of their first night on the steamer the strong inescapable mansmell of his neck and shoulders the boisterous jokes he kept telling her  he insisted on their staying at a commercial hotel at savannah whenever she went to lie down which was frequently he played poker and drank highballs he tried in his sincerest way to amuse her he took her to theaters restaurants roadhouses he arranged a three days huntingtrip with a darky cook he hired motorboats and motorcars and told her every heres a new one that he heard but she dreaded his casualseeming suggestions that she drink plenty of champagne dreaded his complaints whiney as a small boy come now unie show a little fire i tell you a fellows got a right to expect it at this time she dreaded his frankness of undressing of shaving dreaded his occasional irritated protests of dont be a finicking romantic schoolmiss i may not wear silk underclo and perfume myself like some bum actor but im a regular guy dreaded being alone with him dreaded always the memory of that first cataclysmic night of their marriage and mourned as in secret for year on year thousands of women do mourn oh i wouldnt care now if he had just been gentle been considerate oh ed is good he does mean to care for me and give me a good time but  when they returned to new york mr schwirtz said robustly

walloping country wench than a nice refined city lady why i like refinement yes sir i sure do well it sure was some trip guess we wont forget it in a hurry eh sure is nice to rub up against some southern swells like we did that night at the avocado club and that live bunch of salesmen gosh say ill never forget that jock sanderson he was a comical cuss eh that story of his  no said una ill never forget the trip  but she tried to keep the frenzy out of her voice the frenzy was dying as so much of her was dying she hadnt realized a woman can die so many times and still live dead had her heart been at pembertons yet it had secreted enough life to suffer horribly now when it was again being mauled to death  and she wanted to spare this man  she realized that poor ed schwirtz puttering about their temporary room in a sidestreet family hotel yawning and scratching his head and presumably comfortable in suspenders over a woolen undershirtshe realized that he treasured a joyous memory of their savannah diversions  she didnt want to take joy away from anybody who actually had it she reflected as she went over to the coarselace hotel curtains parted them stared down on the truckfilled street and murmured no i cant ever forget     part iii  man and woman  chapter xvi   for two years una golden schwirtz moved amid the blank procession of phantoms who haunt cheap family hotels the apparitions of the corridors to whom there is no home nor purpose nor permanence mere lodgers for the night though for score on score of tasteless years they use the same alien hotel room as a place in which to take naps and store their trunks and comb their hair and sit waitingfor nothing the men are mysterious they are away for hours or months or they sit in the smokingroom glancing up expectant of fortunes that never come but the men do have friends they are permitted familiarities by the bartender in the café it is the women and children who are most dehumanized the children play in the corridors they become bold and sophisticated they expect attention from strangers at fourteen the girls have long dresses and mature admirers and the boys ape the manners of their shallow elders and discuss brands of cigarettes the women sit and rock emptyhearted and barren of hands when they try to make individual homes out of their fixed molds of roomsthe hard walls the brass bedsteads the inevitable bureaus the small rockers and the transoms that always let in too much light from the hall at nightthen they are only the more pathetic for the small pictures of pulpy babies photographed as cupids the tin souvenirs and the pseudoturkish scarves draped over trunks rob the rooms of the simplicity which is their only merit  for two yearstwo years snatched out of her life and traded for somnambulatory peace una lived this spectral life of one room in a family hotel on a side street near sixth avenue the only other dwellingplaces she saw were the flats of friends of her husband  he often said with a sound of pride we dont care a darn for all these wouldbe social climbers the wife and i lead a regular bohemian life we know a swell little bunch of live ones and we have some pretty nifty parties lemme tell you with plenty poker and hard liquor and onetwo of the bunch have got their own carsi tell you they make a whole lot more coin than a lot of these societycolumn guys even if they dont throw on the agony and we all pile in and go up to some roadhouse and sing and play the piano and have a real time  conceive unaif through the fumes of cheap cigarettes you can make out the low lights of her fading hairsitting there trying patiently to play a good canny fist of pokerwhich as her husband often and irritably assured her she would never learn to do he didnt he said mind her losing his good hardearned money but he hated to see eddie schwirtzs own wife more of a boob than mrs jock sanderson whos a regular guy plays poker like a man  mrs sanderson was a blackhaired bigbosomed woman with a face as hard and smooth and expressionless as a dinnerplate with cackling laughter and a tendency to say oh hell boys apropos of nothing she was a good sport and a good mixer mr schwirtz averred and more and more as the satisfaction of having for his new married mistress a refined lady grew dull he adjured the refined lady to imitate mrs sanderson  fortunately mr schwirtz was out of town twothirds of the time but onethird of the time was a good deal since for weeks before his coming she dreaded him and for weeks after his going she remembered him with chill shame since she hadnt even the wholehearted enthusiasm of hating him but always told herself that she was a prude an abnormal thinblooded creature and that she ought to appreciate eds desire to have her share his good times be coarse and jolly and natural  his extravagance was constant he was always planning to rent an expensive apartment and furnish it but the money due him after each trip he spent immediately and they were never able to move away from the family hotel he had to have taxicabs when they went to theaters he would carol oh dont lets be pikers little sisternothing too good for eddie schwirtz thats my motto and he would order champagne the one sort of good wine that he knew he always overtipped waiters and enjoyed his own generosity generous he really was in a clumsy way he gave to una all he had over from his diversions urged her to buy clothes and go to matinées while he was away and told it as a good joke that he blew himself so extensively on their parties that he often had to take daycoaches instead of sleepers for a week after he left new york una had no notion of how much money he made but she knew that he never saved it she would beg why dont you do like so many of the other travelingmen your mr sanderson is saving money and buying real estate even though he does have a good time lets cut out some of the unnecessary parties and things  rats my mr sanderson is a leetle tight like all them scotch laddies im going to start saving one of these days but what can you do when the firm screws you down on expense allowances and dont hardly allow you one red cent of bonus on new business theres no chance for a man todaythese damn capitalists got everything lashed down i tell you im getting to be a socialist  he did not seem to be a socialist of the same type as mamie magen but he was interested in socialism to this extenthe always referred to it at length whenever una mentioned saving money  she had not supposed that he drank so much always he smelled of whisky and she found quart bottles of it in his luggage when he returned from a trip  but he never showed signs of drunkenness except in his urgent attentions to her after one of their jolly bohemian parties  more abhorrent to her was the growing slackness in his personal habits he had addressed her with great volubility and earnestness upon his belief that now they were married she must get rid of all her virginal booklearned notions about reticence between husband and wife such feminine hankypanky tricks he assured her were the cause of all these finicky unhappy marriages and these rotten divorceslot of fool clubwomen and suffragettes and highbrows expecting a man to be like a nun a mans a man and the sooner a female gets on to that fact and doesnt nag nag nag him and lets him go round being comfortable and natural the kinder hell be to her and the better itll be for all parties concerned every time dont forget that old lady why theres j j vance at our shop married one of these updeedee poetryreading finicky women why he did everything for that woman got a swell little house in yonkers and a vacuum cleaner and a hired girl and everything then my god she said she was lonely didnt have enough housework that was the trouble with her and darned if she doesnt kick when j j comes in all played out at night because he makes himself comfortable and sits around in his shirtsleeves and slippers tell you the first thing these women have gotta learn is that a mans a man and if they learn that they wont need a vote  mr schwirtzs notion of being a man was to perform all hygienic processes as publicly as the law permitted apparently he was proud of his godgiven bodythough it had been slightly bloated since god had given it to himand wanted to inspire her not only with the artistic vision of it but with his care for it his thick woolen undergarments were so uncompromisingly wooleny  nor had mr schwirtz any false modesty in his speech if una had made out a list of all the things she considered the most banal or nauseatingly vulgar she would have included most of the honest fellows favorite subjects and at least once a day he mentioned his former wife at a restaurant dinner he gave a full account of her death embalming and funeral  una identified him with vulgarity so completely that she must often have been unjust to him at least she was surprised now and then by a reassertion that he was a highbrow and that he decidedly disapproved of any sort of vulgarity several times this came out when he found her reading novels which were so coarsely realistic as to admit the sex and sweat of the world  even if they are true to life he said i dont see why its necessary to drag in unpleasant subjects i tell you a fella gets too much of bad things in this world without reading about em in books trouble with all these realists as you call em is that theyre such dirtyminded hounds themselves that all they can see in life is the bad side  una surmised that the writers of such novels might perhaps desire to show the bad side in the hope that life might be made more beautiful but she wasnt quite sure of it and she suffered herself to be overborne when he snorted nonsense these fellas are just trying to show how sensational they can be t say nothing of talking like they was so damn superior to the rest of us dont read em read pure authors like howard bancock binch where whenever any lady gets seduced or anything like that the author shows its because the villain is an atheist or something and he treats all those things in a nice fine decent manner good gawd sometimes a fella d think to see you scrooge up your nose when im shaving that im common as dirt but lemme tell you right now miss im a darn sight too refined to read any of these nasty novels where they go to the trouble of describing homes that aint any better than pigpens oh and another thing i heard you telling mrs sanderson you thought all kids oughta have sex education my gawd i dont know where you get those rotten ideas certainly not from me lemme tell you no kid of mine is going to be made nastyminded by having a lot of stuff like that taught her yes sir actually taught her right out in school  una was sufficiently desirous of avoiding contention to keep to novels which portrayed lifeoffices and family hotels and perspiratory husbandsas all for the best but now and then she doubted and looked up from the pile of her husbands whitefooted blackcotton socks to question whether life need be confined to panama and pemberton and schwirtz  in deference to mr schwirtzs demands on the novelists one could scarce even suggest the most dreadful scene in unas life lest it be supposed that other women really are subject to such horror or that the statistics regarding immoral diseases really mean anything in households such as we ourselves know she had reason to suppose that her husband was damaged goods she crept to an old family doctor and had a fainting joy to find that she had escaped contamination  though said the doctor i doubt if it would be wise to have a child of his  i wont she said grimly  she knew the ways of not having children the practical mr schwirtz had seen to that strangely enough he did not object to birthcontrol even though it was discussed by just the sort of people who wrote these sensational realistic novels  there were periods of reaction when she blamed herself for having become so set in antipathy that she always looked for faults saw as a fault even the love for amusements which had once seemed a virtue in him  she tried wistfully and honestly to be just she reminded herself constantly that she had enjoyed some of the parties with himtheater and a late supper with a couple just back from south america  butthere were so many buts life was all one obliterating but  her worst moments were when she discovered that she had grown careless about appearing before him in that drabbest most ignoble of feminine attirea pair of old corsets that she was falling into his own indelicacies  such marionette tragedies mingled ever with the grander passion of seeing life as a ruined thing her birthright to aspiring cleanness sold for a mess of quicklunch pottage and as she walked in a mist of agony a dumb blind creature heroically distraught she could scarce distinguish between sordidness and the great betrayals so chill and thick was the fog about her  she thought of suicide often but too slow and sullen was her protest for the climax of suicide and the common sense which she still had urged her that some day incredibly there might again be hope oftener she thought of a divorce of that she had begun to think even on the second day of her married life she suspected that it would not be hard to get a divorce on statutory grounds whenever mr schwirtz came back from a trip he would visibly remove from his suitcase bunches of letters in cheaply pretentious envelopes of pink and lavender she scorned to try to read them but she fancied that they would prove interesting to the judges   § 2  when mr schwirtz was away una was happy by contrast indeed she found a more halcyon rest than at any other period since her girlhood and in long hours of thinking and reading and trying to believe in life the insignificant good little thing became a calmbrowed woman  mrs lawrence had married the doctor and gone off to ohio they motored much she wrote and read aloud and expected a baby una tried to be happy in them  una had completely got out of touch with mr and mrs sessions but after her marriage she had gone to call on mamie magen now prosperous and more earnest than ever in a greenwich village flat on jennie cassavant sometime of the home club now obscurely on the stage on curlyhaired rose larsen who had married a young lawyer but una had fancied that they were suspiciously kind to her and in angry pride she avoided them she often wondered what they had heard about mr schwirtz from the talkative mrs lawrence she conceived scenes in which she was haughtily rhapsodic in defending her good sensible husband before them then she would long for them and admit that doubtless she had merely imagined their supercilious pity but she could not go back to them as a beggar for friendship  also though she never admitted this motive to herself she was always afraid that some day if she kept in touch with them her husband would demand why dont you trot out these fussy lady friends of yours ashamed of me eh  so she drifted away from them and at times when she could not endure solitariness she depended upon the women of the family hotel whom she met in the corridors and café and parlor  the aristocrats among them she found were the wives of traveling salesmen good husbands and well loved most of them writing to their wives daily and longing for the time when they could have places in the suburbs with room for chickens and children and love these aristocrats mingled only with the sound middleclass of the hotel women whose husbands were clerks and bookkeepers resident in the city or traveling machinery experts who went about installing small powerplants they gossiped with una about the husbands of the déclassé womenmen suspected to be itinerant quack doctors sellers of dubious mining or motor stock or even crooks and gamblers  there was a group of three or four cheery buxom muchbediamonded muchmassaged women whose occasionally appearing husbands were sleek and overdressed to una these women were cordial they invited her to go shopping to matinées but they stopped so often for cocktails they told so many intimate stories of their relations with their husbands that una was timid before them and edged away from their invitations except when she was desperately lonely doubtless she learned more about the mastery of people from them however than from the sighing countrybred hotel women of whom she was more fond for the cheerful hussies had learned to make the most of their shoddy lives  only one woman in the hotel did una accept as an actual friendmrs wade a solid slangy contented woman with a child to whom she was devoted she had she told una been stuck with a lemon of a husband he was making five thousand a year when i married him and then he went to pieces goodlooking but regular poor white trash so i cleaned housekicked him out hes in boston now touches me for a tenspot now and then i support myself and the kid by working for a department store im a wiz at bossing dressmakersmake a lucile gown out of the rind of an edam cheese take nothing off nobodyespecially you dont see me taking any more husbands off nobody  mostly una was able to make out an existence by herself  she read everythingfrom the lacy sentimentalism of myrtle read to samuel butler and translations of gorky and flaubert she nibbled at histories of art and was confirmed in her economic theology by shallow but earnest manuals of popular radicalism she got books from a branch public library or picked them up at secondhand stalls at first she was determined to be serious in her reading but more and more she took light fiction as a drug to numb her nervesand forgot the tales as soon as she had read them  in ten years of such hypnotic reading mrs una golden schwirtz would not be very different from that mrs captain golden who alone in a flat had read all day and forgotten what she had read and let life dream into death  but now una was still fighting to keep in life  she began to work out her first definite philosophy of existence in essence it was not so very different from the blatant optimism of mr s herbert rossexcept that it was sincere  life is hard and astonishingly complicated she concluded no one great reform will make it easy most of us who workor want to workwill always have trouble or discontent so we must learn to be calm and train all our faculties and make others happy  no more original than this was her formulated philosophythe commonplace creed of a commonplace woman in a rather less than commonplace family hotel the important thing was not the form of it but her resolve not to sink into nothingness she hoped that some day she would get a job again she sometimes borrowed a typewriter from the manager of the hotel and she took down in shorthand the miscellaneous sermonsby baptists catholics reformed rabbis christian scientists theosophists high church episcopalians hindu yogis or any one else handywith which she filled up her dull sundays except as practice in stenography she found their conflicting religions of little value to lighten her life the ministers seemed so much vaguer than the harddriving business men with whom she had worked and the question of what joshua had done seemed to have little relation to what julius schwirtz was likely to do the city had come between her and the panama belief that somehow mysteriously one acquired virtue by enduring dull sermons  she depended more on her own struggle to make a philosophy  that philosophy that determination not to sink into paralyzed despair often broke down when her husband was in town but she never gave up trying to make it vital to her  so through month on month she read rocking slowly in the small wooden rocker or lying on the coarsecoverleted bed while round her the hotel room was still and stalesmelling and fixed and outside the window passed the procession of lifetrucks laden with crates of garments consigned to kansas city and bangor and seattle and bemidji taxicabs with passengers for the mammoth hotels officegirls and policemen and salesmen and all the lusty crew that had conquered the city or were well content to be conquered by it     chapter xvii   late in the summer of 1912 at a time when una did not expect the return of her husband for at least three weeks she was in their room in the afternoon reading salesmanship for women and ruminatively eating lemondrops from a small bag  as though he were a betrayed husband dramatically surprising her mr schwirtz opened the door dropped a large suitcase and stood glaring  well he said with no preliminary so here you are for once you could  why ed i didnt expect to see you for  he closed the door and gesticulated no of course you didnt why aint you out with some of your swell friends that i aint good enough to meet shopping and buying dresses and god knows what  why ed  oh dont whyed me well aint you going to come and kiss me nice reception when a mans come home tired from a hard tripwife so busy reading a book

ive asked you any number of times not to spend so much money for suppers and so forth  yes sure lay it all onto me im fair game for everybody thats looking for a nice soft easy safe boob to kick why look there  while she still sat marveling he pounced on the meek little fivecent bag of lemondrops shook it as though it were a very small kitten and whined look at this candy or something all the while you never have a single cent left when i come homecandy and icecream sodas and matinées and dresses and everything you can think of if it aint one thing its another well youll either save from

i will be as soon as i let the old man get at me judging from the loveletters hes been sending me inviting me to cut a switch and come out to the woodshed with him  oh ed dear what was the trouble  she walked up to him laid her hand on his shoulder her voice was earnest her eyes full of pity he patted her hand seemed from her gentle nearness to draw comfortnot passion he slouched over to the bed and sat with his thick legs stuck out in front of him his hands in his trousers pockets while he mused  oh i dont hardly know what it is all about my sales have been falling off all rightee but good lord thats no fault of mine i work my territory jus as hard as i ever did but i cant meet the competition of the floorwax people theyre making an auto polish nowbetter article at a lower priceand what

shop are jealous of me and one thing and another well now ill go down and spit the old man in the eye couple o times and get canned unless i can talk him out of his bad acting oh ill throw a big bluff ill be the little misunderstood boy but i dont honestly think i can put anything across on him im oh hell i guess im getting old i aint got the pep i used to have not but what j eddie schwirtz can

sure thats the way it goes in this world i tell you im gonna turn socialist  edlisten ed please oh please dont be offended now but dont you think perhaps the boss thinks you drink too much  how could he i dont drink very much and you know it i dont hardly touch a drop except maybe just for sociability god this temperance wave gets my goat lot of hotair females telling me what i can do and what i cant dofella that knows when to drink and when to stop drink why you ought to see some of the boys theres burke mccullough say i bet he puts away forty drinks a day if he does one and i dont know that it hurts him any but me  yes i know dear i was just thinkingmaybe your boss is one of the temperance cranks una interrupted mr schwirtzs arguments regarding the privileges of a manly man sounded very familiar this did not seem to be a moment for letting her husband get into the full swing of them she begged what will you do if they let you out i wish there was something i could do to help  dunno theres a pretty close agreement between a lot of the leading paintandvarnish peoplegentlemans agreementand its pretty hard to get in any place if youre in dutch with any of the others well im going down now and watch em gwillotine me you better not wait to have dinner with me ill be there late thrashing all over the carpet with the old man and then i gotta see some fellas and start something come here una  he stood up she came to him and when he put his two hands on her shoulders she tried to keep her aversion to his touch out of her look  he shook his big bald head he was unhappy and his eyes were old nope he said nope cant be done you mean well but you havent got any fire in you kid cant you understand that there are wives whove got so much passion in em that if their husbands came home cleanlicked like i am theydoh their husbands would just naturally completely forget their troubles in lovereal love with fire in it women that arent ashamed of having bodies but oh lord it aint your fault i shouldnt have said anything theres lots of wives like you more n one mans admitted his wife was like that when hes had a couple drinks under his belt to loosen his tongue youre not to blame but im sorry dont mind my grouch when i came in i was so hot and id been worrying and wanted to blame things onto somebody dont wait for me at dinner if i aint here by seven go ahead and feed goodby   § 2  all she knew was that at six a womans purring voice on the telephone asked if mr eddie schwirtz had returned to town yet that he did not reappear till after midnight that his return was heralded by wafting breezes with whisky laden that in the morning there was a smear of rice powder on his right shoulder and that he was not so urgent in his attentions to her as ordinarily so her sympathy for him was lost but she discovered that she was neither jealous nor indignantmerely indifferent  he told her at breakfast that with his usual discernment he had guessed right when he had gone to the office he had been discharged  went out with some business acquaintances in the eveninggot to pull all the wires i can now he said  she said nothing   § 3  they had less than two hundred dollars ahead but mr schwirtz borrowed a hundred from his friend burke mccullough and did not visibly have to suffer from want of highballs cigars and turkish baths from the window of their room una used to see him cross the street to the café entrance of the huge saffron hoteland once she saw him emerge from it with a fluffy blonde but she did not attack him she was spellbound in a strange apathy as in a dream of swimming on forever in a warm and slatehued sea she was confident that he would soon have another position he had overridden her own opinions about businessthe opinions of the underling who never sees the great work as a rounded wholetill she had come to have a timorous respect for his commercial ability  apparently her wifely respect was not generally shared in the paint business at least mr schwirtz did not soon get his new position  the manager of the hotel came to the room with his bill and pressed for payment and after three weeksafter a night when he had stayed out very late and come home reeking with perfumemr schwirtz began to hang about the room all day long and to soak himself in the luxury of complaining despair  then came the black days  there were several scenes during which she felt like a beggar about to be arrested between mr schwirtz and the landlord before her husband paid part of a bill whose size astounded her  mr schwirtz said that he was expecting something to turn upnothin he could do but wait for some telephone calls he sat about with his stockinged feet cocked up on the bed reading detective stories till he fell asleep in his chair he drank from unlabeled pint flasks of whisky all day once when she opened a bureau drawer of his by mistake she saw half a dozen whiskyflasks mixed with grimy collars and the sour smell nauseated her but on foodthey had to economize on that he took her to a restaurant of fifteencent breakfasts and twentyfivecent dinners it was the parlor floor of an old brownstone housetwo rooms with eggy tablecloths and moldings of dusty stucco  she avoided his presence as much as possible mrs wade the practical dressmaker who was her refuge among the women of the hotel seemed to understand what was going on and gave una a key to her room here una sat for hours when she went back to their room quarrels would spring up apropos of anything or nothing  the fault was hers as much as his she was no longer trying to conceal her distaste while he who had a marital conscience of a sort was almost pathetic in his apologies for being unable to show her a good time and he wanted her soothing he was more and more afraid of her as the despair of the jobless man in the hard city settled down on him he wanted her to agree with him that there was a conspiracy against him  she listened to him and said nothing till he would burst out in abuse  you women that have been in business simply aint fit to be married you think youre too good to help a man yes even when you havent been anything but dub stenographers i never noticed that you were such a whale of a success i dont suppose you remember how you used to yawp to me about the job being too much for you and yet when i want a little sympathy you sit there and hand me the frozen stare like you were the president of the standard oil company and i was a bum officeboy yes sir i tell you business simply unfits a skirt for marriage  no she said not for marriage that has any love and comradeship in it but i admit a business woman doesnt care to put up with being a cow in a stable  what the devil do you mean  maybe she went on the business women will bring about a new kind of marriage in which men will have to keep up respect and courtesy i wonderi wonder how many millions of women in what are supposed to be happy homes are sick over being chambermaids and mistresses till they get dulled and used to it nobody will ever know all these books about women being emancipatedyoud think marriage had changed entirely yet right now in 1912 in panama and this hotelnot changed a bit the business women must simply compel men tooh to shave  she went out perhaps she slammed the door a little in an unemancipated way to mrs wades room  that discussion was far more gentle and coherent than most of their quarrels  it may have been rather to the credit of mr schwirtzit may have been a remnant of the clean pride which the boy eddie schwirtz must once have had that whenever she hinted that she would like to go back to workhe raged so you think i cant support you eh my god i can stand insults from all my old friendsthe fellas that used to be tickled to death to have me buy em a drink but now they dodge around the corner as though they thought i was going to try to borrow four bits from emi can stand their insults but by god it is pretty hard on a man when his own wife lets him know that she dont think he can support her  and he meant it  she saw that felt his resentment but she more and more often invited an ambition to go back to work to be independent and busy no matter how weary she might become to die if need be in the struggle certainly that death would be better than being choked in muck one of them would have to go to work anyway  she discovered that an old acquaintance of his had offered him an eighteendollaraweek job as a clerk in a retail paintshop till he should find something better mr schwirtz was scornful about it and his scorn which had once intimidated una became grotesquely absurd to her  then the hotelmanager came with a curt ultimatum pay up or get out he said  mr schwirtz spent an hour telephoning to various acquaintances trying to raise another hundred dollars he got the promise of fifty he shaved put on a collar that for all practical purposes was quite clean and went out to collect his fifty as proudly as though he had earned it  una stared at herself in the mirror over the bureau and said aloud i dont believe it it isnt you una golden that worked and paid your debts you cant dear you simply cant be the wife of a man who lives by begginga dirty useless stupid beggar oh no no you wouldnt do thatyou couldnt marry a man like that simply because the job had exhausted you why youd die at work first why if you married him for board and keep youd be a prostituteyoud be marrying him just because he was a good provider and probably when he didnt provide any more youd be quitter enough to leave himmaybe for another man you couldnt do that i dont believe life could bully you into doing that oh im hysterical im mad i cant believe i am what i amand yet i am now hes getting that fifty and buying a drink   § 4  mr schwirtz actually came home with fortyfive out of the fifty intact that was because he wanted to be able to pay the hotelmanager and insultingly inform him that they were going to leave the manager bore up under the blow they did move to a furnished housekeepingroom on west nineteenth streetin the very district of gray rooms and pathetic landladies where una had sought a boardinghouse after the death of her mother  as furnished housekeepingrooms go theirs was highly superior most of them are carpetless rusty and small of coalstove and filled with cockroaches and the smell of carbolic acid but the maison schwirtz was almost clean it had an impassioned green carpet a bedspring which scarcely sagged at all a gasrange and at least a dozen vases with rococo handles and blobs of gilt  gee this aint so bad declared mr schwirtz we can cook all our eats here and live on next to nothing per till the big job busts loose  with which he prepared to settle down to a life of leisure he went out and bought a pint of whisky a pound of steak a pound of cheese a loaf of bread six cigars and for her a bar of fudge  so far as una could calculate he had less than forty dollars she burst out on him she seemed to be speaking with the brusque voice of an accomplishing man in that voice was all she had ever heard from executives all the subconsciously remembered mandriving force of the office world she ordered him to go and take the job in the paintshopat eighteen dollars a week or eight dollars a week she briefly but thoroughly depicted him as alcoholsoaked poor white trash she drove him out and when he was gone she started to make their rooms presentable with an energy she had not shown for months she began to dust to plan curtains for the room to plan to hide the bricàbrac to plan to rent a typewriter and get commercial copying to do  if any one moment of life is more important than the others this may have been her crisis when her husband had become a begging pauper and she took charge began not only to think earnest commonplace little una thoughts about mastering life but actually to master it     chapter xviii   so long as mr schwirtz contrived to keep his position in the retail paintstore una was busy at home copying documents and specifications and formletters for a stenographic agency and trying to make a science of quick and careful housework  she suspected that now he had a little money again mr schwirtz was being riotous with other womenas riotous as one can be in new york on eighteen dollars a week with debts and a wife to interfere with his manly pleasures but she did not care she was getting ready to break the cocoon and its grubbiness didnt much matter  sex meant nothing between them now she did not believe that she would ever be in love again in any phase noble or crude while she aspired and worked she lived like a nun in a cell and now that she had something to do she could be sorry for him she made the best possible dinners for him on their gasrange she realizedsometimes not often for she was not a contemplative seer but a battered womanthat their marriage had been as unfair to him as it was to her in smalltown boygang talks behind barns in clerkly confidences as a young man in the chatter of smokingcars and provincial hotel offices he had been trained to know only two kinds of women both very complaisant to smart livewires the bouncing lassies who laughed and kissed and would share with a man his pleasures such as poker and cocktails and rapid motoring to no place in particular and the meek attentive refined kind the wives and mothers who cared for a man and admired him and believed whatever he told them about his business  una was of neither sort for him though for walter babson she might have been quite of the latter kind mr schwirtz could not understand her and she was as sorry for him as was compatible with a decided desire to divorce him and wash off the stain of his damp pulpy fingers with the water of life  but she stayed home and washed and cooked and earned money for himtill he lost his retailstore position by getting drunk and being haughty to a customer  then the chrysalis burst and una was free again free to labor to endeavorto die perhaps but to die clean to quest and meet whatever surprises life might hold   § 2  she couldnt go back to troy wilkinss nor to mr s herbert ross and the little pemberton stenographers who had enviously seen her go off to be married but she made a real business of looking for a job while mr schwirtz stayed home and slept and got mental bedsores and drank himself to deathrather too slowlyon another fifty dollars which he had borrowed after a verdun campaign una was joyous to be out early looking over advertisements visiting typewriter companies employment agencies  she was slow in getting work because she wanted twenty dollars a week she knew that any firm taking her at this wage would respect her far more than if she was an easy purchase  work was slow to come and she who had always been so securely above the rank of paupers who submit to the dreadful surgery of charity became afraid she went at last to mamie magen  mamie was now the executive secretary of the hebrew young womens professional union she seemed to be a personage in her office she had a secretary who spoke of her with adoring awe and when una said that she was a personal friend of miss magen the secretary cried oh then perhaps youd like to go to her apartment at  washington place shes almost always home for tea at five  the small tiredlooking una a business woman again in her old tailormade and a new small hat walked longingly toward washington place and tea  in her seven years in new york she had never known anybody except s herbert ross who took tea as a regular function it meant to her the gentlest of all forms of distinction more appealing than riding in motors or going to the opera that mamie magen had during unas own experience evolved from a home club girl to an executive who had tea at her apartment every afternoon was inspiriting meeting her an adventure  an apartment of buffcolored walls and not bad prints was mamies small but smooth and taking tea in a manner which seemed to una impressively suave were the insiders of the young charityworkers circle but mamies uncouth face and eyes of molten heroism stood out among them all and she hobbled over to una and kissed her when the cluster had thinned she got una aside and invited her to the southern kitchen on washington square  una did not speak of her husband i want to get on the job again and i wish youd help me i want something at twenty a week im more than worth it and a chance to really climb was all she said and mamie nodded  and so they talked of mrs harriet fike of the home club of dreams and work and the fight for suffrage unas marriage slipped awayshe was ardent and unstained again  mamies nod was worth months of mr schwirtzs profuse masculine boasts within ten days mamies friend mr fein of truax  fein the realestate people sent for una and introduced her to mr daniel t truax she was told to come to work on the following monday as mr truaxs secretary at twentyone dollars a week  she went home defiant determined to force her husband to let her take the job she didnt need to use force heslippered and drowsy by the windowsaid thats fine thatll keep us going till my big job breaks ill hear about it by next week anyway then in threefour weeks you can kick truax  fein in the face and beat it say girlie thats fine say tell you what ill do lets have a little party to celebrate ill chase out and rush a growler of beer and some wienies  no ive got to go out again  cant you stop just long enough to have a little celebration ii been kind of lonely last few days little sister you been away so much and im too broke to go out and look up the boys now  he was peering at her with a real wistfulness but in the memory of mamie magen the lame woman of the golden heart una could not endure his cackling enthusiasm about the job he would probably never get  no im sorry she said and closed the door from the walk she saw him puzzled and anxious at the window his face was becoming so ruddy and fatuous and babyish she was sorry for himbut she was not big enough to do anything about it her sorrow was like sympathy for a mangy alley cat which she could not take home  she had no place to go she walked for hours planlessly and dined at a bakery and lunchroom in harlem sometimes she felt homeless and always she was prosaically footsore but now and then came the understanding that she again had a chance     chapter xix   so toward the end of 1912 when she was thirtyone years old mrs una golden schwirtz began her business career as confidential secretary to mr truax of truax  fein  her old enemy routine was constantly in the field routine of taking dictation of getting out the letters prompting mr truaxs memory as to who mrs a was and what mr b had telephoned keeping plats and plans and memoes in order making out cards regarding the negotiations with possible sellers of suburban estates she did not as she had hoped always find this routine one jolly round of surprises she was often weary sometimes bored  but in the splendor of being independent again and of having something to do that seemed worth while she was able to get through the details that never changed from day to day and she was rewarded for the whole job was made fascinating by human contact she found herself enthusiastic about most of the people she met at truax  feins she was glad to talk with them to work with them to be taken seriously as a brain a loyalty a woman  by contrast with two years of hours either empty or filled with schwirtz the officeworld was of the loftiest dignity it may have been that some of the men she met were schwirtzes to their wives but to her they had to be fellowworkers she did not believe that the long hours the jealousies the worry or mr truaxs belief that he was several planes above ordinary humanity were desirable or necessary parts of the life at truax  feins here too she saw nine hours of daily strain aging slim girls into skinny females but now her whole point of view was changed instead of looking for the evils of the business world she was desirous of seeing in it all the blessings she could and without ever losing her belief that it could be made more friendly she was nevertheless able to rise above her own personal weariness and see that the world of jobs offices business had made itself creditably superior to those other muddled worlds of politics and amusement and amorous schwirtzes she believed again as in commercial college she had callowly believed that business was beginning to see itself as communal worldruling and beginning to be inspired to communal kingly virtues and responsibility  looking for the good sometimes in her joy of escape looking for it almost with the joy of an s herbert ross in picking little lucrative flowers of sentiment along the roadside she was able to behold more daily happiness about her  fortunately truax  feins was a good office not too hard not too strained and factional like pembertons not wavering like troy wilkinss despite mr truaxs tendency to courteous whining it was doing its work squarely and quietly that was fortunate offices differ as much as officemanagers and had chance condemned una to another nervetwanging pembertons her slight strength might have broken she might have fallen back to schwirtz and the gutter  peaceful as reapers singing on their homeward path now seemed the teasing voices of men and girls as in a group they waited for the elevator at fivethirtyfive the cheerful goodnight mrs schwirtz was a vesper benediction altogether sweet with its earnest of rest and friendship  tranquillity she found when she stayed late in the deserted office here no schwirtz could reach her here her toil counted for something in the worlds workin the making of suburban homes for men and women and children she sighed and her breast felt barren as she thought of the children but tranquillity there was and a brilliant beauty of the city as across dark spaces of evening were strung the jewels of light as in small french restaurants sounded desirous violins on warm evenings of autumn una would lean out of the window and be absorbed in the afterglow above the north river smokeclouds from jersey factories drifting across the long carmine stain air sweet and cool and the yellowlighted windows of other skyscrapers giving distant companionship she fancied sometimes that she was watching the afterglow over a far northern lake among the pines and with a sigh more of content than of restlessness she turned back to her work time ceased to exist when she worked alone of time and of the office she was manager what if she didnt go out to dinner till eight she could dine whenever she wanted to if a clumsy man called eddie schwirtz got hungry he could get his own dinner what if she did work slowly there were no telephone messages no mr truax to annoy her she could be leisurely and do the work as it should be done she was no longer afraid of the rustling silence about her as una golden had been at troy wilkinss she was a woman now and trained to fill the blank spaces of the deserted office with her own colored thoughts  hours of bustling life in the daytime office had their human joys as well una went out of her way to be friendly with the ordinary stenographers and as there was no vast pembertonian system of caste she succeeded and had all the warmth of their little confidences nor after her extensive experience with messrs schwirtz sanderson and mccullough did even the noisiest of the salesmen offend her she laughed at the small signs they were always bringing in and displaying oh forget it ive got troubles of my own or is that you again another half hour gone to hell the salesmanager brought this latter back from philadelphia and hung it on his desk and when the admiring citizenry surrounded it una joined them as a married woman she was not expected to be shocked by the word hell  but most beautiful was christmas eve when all distinctions were suspended for an hour before the office closed when mr truax distributed gold pieces and handshakes when chas the hattilted salesmanager stood on a chair and sang a solo mr fein hung holly on all their desks and for an hour stenographers and salesmen and clerks and chiefs all were friends  when she went home to schwirtz she tried to take some of the holiday friendship she sought to forget that he was still looking for the hypothetical job while he subsisted on her wages and was increasingly apologetic she boasted to herself that her husband hated to ask her for money that he was large and strong and masculine  she took him to dinner at the pequoit in a room of gold and tapestry but he got drunk and wept into his sherbet that he was a drag on her and she was glad to be back in the office after christmas   § 2  the mist of newness had passed that confusion of the recent arrival in office or summer hotel or revengeful reception and she now saw the office inhabitants as separate people she wondered how she could ever have thought that the salesmanager and mr fein were confusingly alike or have been unable to get the salesmens names right  there was the chief mr daniel t truax usually known as d t a fussily courteous whiner with a rabbity face his pink nose actually quivered a little yellow mustache and a little round stomach himself and his business he took very seriously though he was far less tricky than mr pemberton the real estate board of trade was impressed by his unsmiling insistence on the dignity of the profession and always asked him to serve on committees it was mr truax who bought the property for subdevelopment and though he had less abstract intelligence than mr fein he was a better judge of what the people want of just how high to make restrictions on property and what whim would turn the commuters north or south in their quest for homes  there was the superchief the one person related to the firm whom una hatedmrs d t truax she was not officially connected with the establishment and her office habits were irregular mostly they consisted in appearing at the most inconvenient hours and asking maddening questions she was fat massaged glittering wheezyvoiced nagging una peculiarly hated mrs truaxs nails unas own fingertips were hard with typing her manicuring was a domestic matter of clipping and hypocritical filing but to mrs truax manicuring was a lifework because of much clipping of the cuticle the flesh at the base of each nail had become a noticeably raised cushion of pink flesh her nails were too pink too shiny too shapely and sometimes they were an unearthly white at the ends because of nailpaste left under them at that startling whiteness una stared all the while mrs truax was tapping her fingers and prying into the private morals of the pretty hallgirl and enfilading una with the lorgnon that so perfectly suited her upper west side jowls  collating mrs truax and the matrons of the visiting board of the temperance home club una concluded that women trained in egotism but untrained in business ought to be legally enjoined from giving their views to young women on the job  the most interesting figure in the office was mr fein the junior partner a harvard jew who was perfectly the new type of business man serious tall spectacled cleanshaven leanfaced taking business as a profession and kindly justice as a religion studying efficiency but hating the metamorphosis of clerks into machines he was the distinction and the power of truax  fein at first una had thought him humorless and negligible but she discovered that it was he who pulled mr truax out of his ruts his pious trickeries his cramping economies she found that mr fein loved books and the opera and that he could be boyish after hours  then the salesmanager that driving but festive soul mr charles salmond whom everybody called chaspronounced chaaza good soul who was a little tiresome because he was so consistently an anthology of new york he believed in broadway the follies good clothes a motorcar palm beach and the value of the salvation army among the lower classes when mr fein fought for real beauty in their suburban developments it was chas who echoed all of new york by rebelling we arent in business for our healththis idealistic game is o k for the guys that have the cash but you cant expect my salesmen to sell this simplicity and highthinking stuff to prospects that are interested in nothing but a sound investment with room for a garage and two kids  sixty or seventy salesmen clerks girlsthese una was beginning to know  finally there was a keen wideawake woman willing to do anything for anybody not forward but not to be overriddena woman with a slight knowledge of architecture and a larger knowledge of the way of promotion a woman whom una took seriously and the name of this paragon was mrs una golden schwirtz  round these human islands flowed a sea of others she had a sense of flux and change and energy of hundreds of thousands of people rushing about her alwayscrowds on broadway and fifth avenue and sixth and on thirtyfourth street where stood the zodiac building in which was the office crowds in the hall of the zodiac building examining the blackandwhite directory board with its list of two hundred offices or waiting to surge into one of the twelve elevatorsthose packed vertical railroads a whole village life in the hallway of the zodiac building the imperial elevatorstarter in a uniform of blue and gold and merely regal elevatorrunners with less gold and more faded blue the oldest of the elevatorboys harry the greek who knew everybody in the building the cigarstand with piles of cigarettes cans of advertised tobacco maple fudge wrapped in tinfoil stamps and even a few cigars also the keeper thereof an italian with an air of swounding romance more romantic italians in the glassinclosed barbershopdesperate desmond devils with white coats like undress uniforms and mustaches that recalled the riviera and baccarat and a secretservice count the two manicuregirls of the barbershop princesses reigning among admirers from the offices upstairs janitors with brooms and charwomen with pails and a red sarcastic man the engineer and a meek puppet who was merely the superintendent of the whole thing una watched these village people to whom the zodiac hall was main street and in their satisfied conformation to a life of marble floors and artificial light she found such settled existence as made her feel at home in this town with its eighteen strata called floors she too at least during the best hours of the day lived in the zodiac buildings microcosm  and to her office penetrated the ever flowing crowdssalesmen buyers of real estate inquirers persons who seemed to have as a hobby the collection of realestate folders indeed her most important task was the strategy of handling callersthe callers who came to see mr truax himself and were passed on to una by the hallgirl to the clever secretary the management of callers becomes a question of scientific tactics and una was clever at it because she liked people  she had to recognize the type of awkward shabby visitor who looks like a beggar but has in his pocket the cash for investment in lots and the insinuating caller with tailormade garments and a smart tie who presents himself as one who yearns to do a good turn to his dear dear personal friend mr d t truax but proves to be an insuranceagent or a salesman of addingmachines she had to send away the women with highpitched voices and purely imaginary business who came in for nothing whatever and were willing to spend all of their own time and mr truaxs in obtaining the same women with unsalable houses to sell or improbable lots to buy dissatisfied clients or mere cranksold shattered unhappy women to whom una could give sympathy but no time she was expert at standing filially listening to them at the elevator while all the time her thumb steadily pressed the elevator signal  una had been trained perhaps as much by enduring mr schwirtz as by pleasing mr s herbert ross to be firm to say no to keep mr truaxs sacred rites undisturbed she did not conventionally murmur mr truax is in a conference just now and if you will tell me the nature of your business instead she had surprising delightful convincing things for mr truax to be doing just at that particular moment  from mr truax himself she learned new ways of delicately getting rid of people he did not merely rise to indicate that an interview was over but also arranged a system of counterfeit telephonecalls with una calling up from the outside office and mr truax answering yes ill be through now in just a moment as a hint for the visitor he even practised such playacting as putting on his hat and coat and rushing out to greet an important but unwelcome caller with oh im so sorry im just going outlate f important engagementgiven m secretary full instructions and i know shell take care of you jus as well as i could personally and returning to his private office by a rear door  mr truax like mr s herbert ross gave una maxims but his had very little to do with stars and argosies and the road to success and vivisection and the abstract virtues they concerned getting to the office on time and never letting a customer bother him if an office salesman could take care of the matter  so round una flowed all the energy of life and she of the listening and desolate hotel room and the overshadowing stormclouds was happy again  she began to make friendships chas the officemanager stopped often at her desk to ridiculeand mr fein to praisethe plans she liked to make for gardensuburbs which should be filled with poets thatched roofs excellent plumbing artistic conversation fireplaces incinerators books and convenient trains  some day said mr fein to her well do that sort of thing just as the sage foundation is doing it at forest hills and he smiled encouragingly  some day said mr truax when youre head of a womens realestate firm after you women get the vote and rusty oldfashioned people like me are out of the way perhaps you can do that sort of thing and he smiled encouragingly  rot said chas and amiably chucked her under the chin     chapter xx   truax  fein was the first firm toward which una was able to feel such loyalty as is supposed to distinguish all young aspirantsloyalty which is so well spoken of by bosses and which is so generally lacking among the bossed partly this was her virtue partly it was the firms and partly it was merely the accident of her settling down  she watched the biological growth of truax  fein with fascination was excited when they opened a new subdivision and proudly read the halfpage advertisements thereof in the sunday newspapers  that loyalty made her study real estate not merely stenography for to most stenographers their work is the same whether they take dictation regarding real estate or bookpublishing or felt slippers or the removal of taconite they understand transcription but not what they transcribe she read magazinessystem printers ink real estate record solemnly studying recorded conveyances and plans filed for new construction work and mechanics liens she got ideas for houses from architectural magazines garden magazines womens magazines but what most indicated that she was a real devotee was the fact that after glancing at the frontpage headlines the society news and the joke column in her morning paper she would resolutely turn to the real estate field  on sundays she often led mr schwirtz for a walk among the new suburban developments for always no matter what she did at the office no matter how much mr truax depended on her or mr fein praised her she went home to the same cabbagerosecarpeted housekeepingroom and to a mr schwirtz who had seemingly not stirred an inch since she had left him in the morning mr schwirtz was of a harem type and not much adapted to rustic jaunting but he obediently followed his master and tried to tell stories of the days when he had known all about real estate while she studied model houses the lay of the land the lines of sewers and walks  that was loyalty to truax  fein as much as desire for advancement  and that same loyalty made her accept as fellowworkers even the noisiest of the salesmenand even beatrice joline  though mr truax didnt believe in women salesmen one woman briskly overrode his beliefs miss beatrice joline of the gramercy park jolines who cheerfully called herself one of the nouveau pauvre and condescended to mere upper west side millionaires and had to earn her frocks and tea money she earned them too but she declined to be interested in office regulations or office hours she sold suburban homes as a free lance and only to the very best people she darted into the office now and then slender tall shoulderswinging an exclamationpoint of a girl in a smart check suit and a bendel hat she ignored una with a coolness which reduced her to the status of a new stenographer all the office watched miss joline with hypnotized envy always in offices those who have social position outside are observed with secret awe by those who have not  once when mr truax was in the act of persuading an unfortunate propertyowner to part with a long island estate for approximately enough to buy one lot after the estate should be subdivided into six hundred lots miss joline had to wait she perched on unas desk outside mr truaxs door swung her heels inspected the fingerends of her chamois gloves and issued a command to una to perform conversationally  una was thinking id like to spank youand then id adore you youre what storywriters call a thoroughbred  while unconscious that a secretary in a tabbygray dress and gold eyeglasses was venturing to appraise her miss joline remarked in a high clear voice beastly bore to have to wait isnt it i suppose you can rush right in to see mr truax any time you want to mrs ummmmm  schwirtz rotten name isnt it una smiled up condescendingly  miss joline stopped kicking her heels and stared at una as though she might prove to be human after all  oh no its a very nice name she said fancy being called joline now schwirtz sounds rather like schenck and thats one of the smartest of the old names uh would it be too much trouble to see if mr truax is still engaged  he is miss joline i feel like doing something ive wanted to do for some time of course we both know you think of me as that poor little dub mrs whatshername d ts secretary  why really  or perhaps you hadnt thought of me at all im naturally quite a silent little dub but ive been learning that its silly to be silent in business so ive been planning to get hold of you and ask you where and how you get those suits of yours and what i ought to wear you see after you marry ill still be earning my living and perhaps if i could dress anything like you i could fool some business man into thinking i was clever  as i do you mean said miss joline cheerfully  well  oh i dont mind but my dear good womanoh i suppose i oughtnt to call you that  i dont care what you call me if you can tell me how to make a seventeenfifty suit look like vogue isnt it awful miss joline that us lower classes are interested in clothes too  my dear girl even the beautiful the accomplished beatrice jolineill admit itknows when she is being teased i went to boardingschool and if you think i havent ever been properly and thoroughly and oh most painstakingly told what a disgusting natural snob i am you ought to have heard tomlinson or any other of my dear friends taking me down i rather fancy youre kinderhearted than they are but anyway you dont insult me half so scientifically  im so sorry i tried hard im a wellmeaning insulter but i havent the practice  my dear i adore you isnt it lovely to be frank when us females get into mr truaxs place well have the most wonderful time insulting each other dont you think but really please dont think i like to be rude but you see we jolines are so poor that if i stopped it all my business acquaintances would think i was admitting how poor we are so im practically forced to be horrid now that weve been amiable to each other what can i do for you does that sound businesslike enough  i want to make you give me some hints about clothes i used to like terribly crude colors but ive settled down to tessie things that are safethis gray dress and brown and black  well my dear im the best little dressmaker you ever saw and i do love to lay down the law about clothes with your hair and complexion you ought to wear clear blues order a wellmadebe sure its wellmade no matter what it costs get some clever little jew socialist tailor off in the outskirts of brooklyn or some heathenish place and stand over him a wellmade tailored suit of not too dark navy blue with matching blue crêpe de chine blouses with nice soft white collars and cuffs of crêpe or chiffonand change em often  what about a party dress ought i to have satin or chiffon or blue net or what  well satin is too dignified and chiffon too perishable and blue net is too tessie why dont you try black net over black satin you know theres really lots of color in black satin if you know how to use it get good materials and then you can use them over and over againperhaps white chiffon over the black satin  white over black  though miss joline stared down with one of the quick secretive smiles which una hated the smile which reduced her to the rank of a novice her eyes held miss joline made her continue her oracles  yes said miss joline and it isnt very expensive try it with the black net first and have soft little folds of white tulle along the edge of the décolletageits scarcely noticeable but it does soften the neckline and wear a string of pearls get these artifico pearls a dollarninety a string now you see how useful a snob is to the world id never give you all this godlike advice if i didnt want to advertise what an authority i am on smart fashions for limited incomes  youre a darling said una  come to tea said miss joline  they did go to tea but before it while miss joline was being voluble with mr truax una methodically made notes on the art of dress and filed them for future reference despite the fact that with the support of mr schwirtz as her chief luxury she had only sixteen dollars in the world she had faith that she would sometime take a womans delight in dress and a business womans interest in it this had been an important hour for her though it cannot be authoritatively stated which was the more importantlearning to dress or learning not to be in awe of a joline of gramercy park  they went to tea several times in the five months before the sudden announcement of miss jolines engagement to wally castle of the tennis and racquet club and at tea they bantered and were not markedly different in their use of forks or choice of pastry but never were they really friends una of panama daughter of captain golden and wife of eddie schwirtz could comprehend walter babson and follow mamie magen and even rather despised that diogenes of an enameled tub mr s herbert ross but it seemed probable that she would never be able to do more than ask for bread and railway tickets in the language of beatrice joline whose dead father had been ambassador to portugal and friend to henry james and john hay   § 2  it hurt a little but una had to accept the fact that beatrice joline was no more likely to invite her to the famous and shabby old house of the jolines than was mrs truax to ask her advice about manicuring they did however have dinner together on an evening when miss joline actually seemed to be working late at the office  lets go to a café des enfants said miss joline such a party and honestly i do like their coffee and the nice shiny bathroom walls  yes said una its almost as much of a party to me as running a typewriter lets go dutch to the martha washington  verra well though i did want buckwheats and little sausages exciting  huh said una who was unable to see any adventurous qualities in a viand which she consumed about twice a week  miss jolines clean litheness her gaiety that had never been made timorous or grateful by defeat or sordidness her whirlwind of nonsense blended in a cocktail for una at dinner schwirtz money difficulties weariness did not exist her only trouble in the entire universe was the reconciliation of her admiration for miss jolines amiable superiority to everybody her gibes at the salesmen and even at mr truax with mamie magens philanthropic socialism so far as this history can trace she never did reconcile them  she left miss joline with a laugh and started home with a songthen stopped she foresaw the musty room to which she was going the slatternly incubus of a man sawwith just such distinctness as had once dangled the stiff gray scrubrag before her eyesschwirtzs every detail bushy chin stained and collarless shirt trousers like old chaircovers probably he would always be like this probably he would never have another job but she couldnt cast him out she had married him in his own words as a good provider she had lost the bet she would be a good loserand a good provider for him always perhaps always that mass of spoiled babyhood waiting at home for her always apologetic and humbleshe would rather have the old grumbling dominant male  she tried to push back the moment of seeing him again her steps dragged but at last inevitably grimly the house came toward her she crept along the moldy hall opened the door of their room saw him  she thought it was a stranger an intruder but it was veritably her husband in a new suit that was fiercely pressed and shaped in new gleaming oxblood shoes with a haircut and a barber shave he was bending over the bed which was piled with new shirts afroamerican ties new toilet articles and he was packing a new suitcase  he turned slowly enjoying her amazement he finished packing a shirt she said nothing standing at the door teetering on his toes and watching the effect of it all on her he lighted a large cigar  some class eh he said  well  nifty suit eh and how are those for swell ties  very nice from whom did you borrow the money  now that cernly is a nice sweet way to congratulate friend hubby oh sure man lands a job works his head off getting it gets an advance for some new clothes hes simply got to have and of course everybody else congratulates himeverybody but his own wife she sniffs at himnot a word about the new job of course first crack outa the box she gets busy suspecting him and says who you been borrowing of now and this after always acting as though she was an abused little innocent that nobody appreciated  he was in midcurrent swimming strong and waving his cigar above the foaming waters but she pulled him out of it with i am sorry i ought to have known im a beast i am glad awfully glad youve got a new job what is it  new company handling a new kind of motor for rowboatsconverts em to motorboats in a jiffyoutboard motors they call em got a swell territory and plenty bonus on new business  oh isnt that fine its such a fine surpriseand its cute of you to keep it to surprise me with all this while  well s a matter of fact i just got on to it today ran into burke mccullough on sixth avenue and he gave me the tip  oh a forlorn little oh it was she had pictured him proudly planning to surprise her and she longed to have the best possible impression of him because of a certain plan which was hotly being hammered out in her brain she went on as brightly as possible  and they gave you an advance thats fine  well no they didnt exactly but burke introduced me to his clothier and i got a swell line of credit  oh  now for the love of pete dont go ohing and ahing like that youve handed me the pickled visage since i got the rowdydow on my last jobgood lord you acted like you thought i liked to sponge on you now let me tell you ive kept account of every red cent youve spent on me and i expect to pay it back  she tried to resist her impulse but she couldnt keep from saying as nastily as possible how nice when  oh ill pay it back all right trust you for that you wont fail to keep wising me up on the fact that you think im a drunken bum youll sit around all day in a hotel and take it easy and have plenty time to figger out all the things you can roast me for and then spring them on me the minute i get back from a trip all tired out like you always used to  oh i did not she wailed  sure you did  and what do you mean by my sitting around from now on  well what the hell

take care of yourself ill do the same  what d yuh mean  i mean this  she darted at the bed yanked from beneath it her suitcase and into it began to throw her toilet articles  mr schwirtz sat upon the bed and laughed enormously  you women cernly are a sketch he caroled going back to mamma are you sure thats what the first mrs schwirtz was always doing lets see once she got as far as the depot before she came back and admitted that she was a chump i doubt if you get that far youll stop on the step youre too tightwad to hire a taxi even to try to scare me and make it unpleasant for me  una stopped packing stood listening now her voice unmelodramatic again she replied  youre right about several things i probably was thoughtless about leaving you alone eveningsthough it is not true that i ever left you without provision for supper and of course youve often left me alone back there in the hotel while you were off with other women  now whos insinuating he performed another characteristic peroration she did not listen but stood with warning hand up a small but pluckylooking traffic policeman till he ceased then went on  but i cant really blame you even in this day when people like my friend mamie magen think that feminism has won everything i suppose there must still be a majority of men like youmen whove never even heard of feminism who think that their women are breed cattle i judge that from the conversations i overhear in restaurants and streetcars and these pretty vaudeville jokes about marriage that you love so and from movie pictures of wives beating husbands and from the fact that women even yet havent the vote i suppose that you dont really know many men besides the mucky cattledrover sort and i cant blame you for thinking like them  say what is all this cattle business about i dont seem to recall we were discussing stockyards are you trying to change the conversation so you wont even have to pack your grip before you call your own bluff about leaving me dont get it at all at all  you will get it my friend as i say i can seenow its too latehow mean i must have been to you often ive probably hurt your feelings lots of times  you have all right  but i still dont see how i could have avoided it i dont blame myself either we two simply never could get togetheryoure twothirds the oldfashioned brute and im at least onethird the new independent woman we wouldnt understand each other not if we talked a thousand years heavens alive just see all these silly discussions of suffrage that men like you carry on when the whole thing is really so simple simply that women are intelligent human beings and have the right  now who mentioned suffrage if youll kindly let me know what youre trying to get at then  you see we two never could understand each other so im just going to clean house get rid of things that clutter it up im going tonight and i dont think i shall ever see you again so do try to be pleasant while im packing this last time oh im free again and so are you you poor decent man lets congratulate each other   § 3  despite the constant hammering of mr schwirtz who changed swiftly from a tyrant to a bewildered orphan una methodically finished her packing went to a hotel and within a week found in brooklyn near the heights a pleasant whiteandgreen thirdfloorfront  her salary had been increased to twentyfive dollars a week  she bought the blue suit and the crêpe de chine blouse recommended by miss beatrice joline she was still sorry for mr schwirtz she thought of him now and then and wondered where he had gone but that did not prevent her enjoying the mirrors reflection of the new blouse   § 4  while he was dictating to una mr truax monologized i dont see why we cant sell that boutell family a lot we wouldnt make any profit out of it now anywaythats nearly eaten up by the overhead weve wasted on them but i hate to give them up and your friend mr fein says that we arent scientific salesmen if we give up the office problems that everybody takes a whack at and seems to fail on  more and more mr truax had been recognizing una as an intelligence and often he teased her regarding her admiration for mr feins efficiency now he seemed almost to be looking to her for advice as he plaintively rambled on  every salesman on the staff has tried to sell this asinine boutell family and failed weve got the lotsgive em anything from a fifteenthousanddollarrestriction waterfront highclass development to an odd lot behind an italian truckfarm theyve been considering a lot at villa estates for a month now and they arent  let me try them  let you try them  try to sell them  of course if you want toin your own time outside this is a matter that the selling department ought to have disposed of but if you want to try  i will ill try them on a saturday afternoonnext saturday  but what do you know about villa estates  i walked all over it just last sunday talked to the resident salesman for an hour  thats good i wish all our salesmen would do something like that  all week una planned to attack the redoubtable boutells she telephoned sounding as wellbred and clever as she could and made an appointment for saturday afternoon the boutells were going to a matinée mrs boutells grating voice informed her but they would be pleased t see mrs schwirtz after the show all week una asked advice of chas the salesmanager who between extensive exhortations to keep away from sellingbecause its the hardest part of the game and believe me it gets the least gratitudegave her instructions in the tactics of presenting a proposition to a client convincing a prospect of the salesmans expert knowledge of values clinching the deal talking points and desirability of location  wednesday evening una went out to villa estates to look it over again and she conducted a long imaginary conversation with the boutells regarding the nearness of the best school in nassau county  but on saturday morning she felt ill at the office she wailed on the shoulder of a friendly stenographer that she would never be able to follow up this her first chance to advance  she went home at noon and slept till four she arrived at the boutells flat looking like a dead leaf she tried to skip into the presence of mrs boutella dragon with a frizzand was heavily informed that mr boutell wouldnt be back till six and that anyway they had talked over the villa estates proposition and decided it wasnt quite time to come to a decisionbe better to wait till the weather cleared up so a body can move about  oh mrs boutell i just cant argue it out with you una howled i do know villa estates and its desirability for you but this is my very first experience in direct selling and as luck would have it i feel perfectly terrible today  you poor lamb soothed mrs boutell you do look terrible sick you come right in and lie down and ill have my lithuanian make you a cup of hot beeftea  while mrs boutell held her hand and fed her beeftea una showed photographs of villa estates and became feebly oratorical in its praises and when mr boutell came home at sixthirty they all had a light dinner together and went to the movingpictures and through them talked about real estate and at eleven mr boutell uneasily took the fountainpen which una resolutely held out to him and signed a contract to purchase two lots at villa estates and a check for the first payment  una had climbed above the rank of assistant to the rank of people who do things     chapter xxi   to una and to mr fein it seemed obvious that since women have at least half of the family decision regarding the purchase of suburban homes women salesmen of suburban property should be at least as successful as men but mr truax had a number of good sound conservative reasons why this should not be so and therefore declined to credit the evidence of una beatrice joline and saleswomen of other firms that it really was so  yet after solving the boutell office problem una was frequently requisitioned by chas to talk to women about the advantages of sites for themselves and their children while regular and intelligent that is male salesmen worked their hypnotic arts on the equally regular and intelligent men of the families where formerly it had seemed an awesome miracle like chemistry or poetry to close a deal and bring thousands of dollars into the office now una found it quite normal responsibility gave her more poise and willingness to take initiative her salary was raised to thirty dollars a week she banked two hundred dollars of commissions and bought a japaneseblue silk negligée a wristwatch and the gown of black satin and net recommended by miss joline yet officially she was still mr truaxs secretary she took his dictation and his moods  her greatest reward was in the friendship of the careful diligent mr fein   § 2  she never forgot a dinner with mr fein at which for the first time she heard a complete defense of the employers positionsaw the office world from the standpoint of the bosses  i never believed id be friendly with one of the capitalists una was saying at their dinner but i must admit that you dont seem to want to grind the faces of the poor  i dont i want to wash em  im serious  my dear child so am i declared mr fein then apparently addressing his mixed grill he considered its nonsense to say that its just the capitalists that ail the world its the slackers show me a man that we can depend on to do the necessary thing at the necessary moment without being nudged and well keep raising him before he has a chance to ask us even  no you dontthat is i really think you do mr fein personally but most bosses are so afraid of a big payroll that they deliberately discourage their people till they lose all initiative i dont know perhaps theyre victims along with their employees just now i adore my work and i do think that business can be made as glorious a profession as medicine or exploring or anything but in most offices it seems to me the biggest ideal the clerks have is safetya twofamily house on a stupid street in flatbush as a reward for being industrious doesnt matter whether they enjoy living there if theyre just secure and you do knowmr truax doesnt but you do knowthat the whole office system makes pale timid nervous people out of all the clerks  but good heavens child the employers have just as hard a time talk about being nervous take it in our game the salesman does the missionary work but the employer is the one who has to worry take some big deal that seems just about to get acrossand then falls through just when you reach for the contract and draw a breath of relief or say youve swung a deal and have to pay your rent and office force and you cant get the commission thats due you on an accomplished sale and your clerks dash in and want a raise under threat of quitting just at the moment when youre wondering how youll raise the money to pay them their present salaries on time those are the things that make an employer a nervous wreck hes got to keep it going i tell you theres advantages in being a wageslave and having the wages coming  but mr fein if its just as hard on the employers as it is on the employees then the whole system is bad  good lord of course its bad but do you know anything in this world that isnt badthats anywhere near perfect except maybe bach fugues religion education medicine war agriculture art pleasure anythingall systems are choked with clumsy outworn methods and ignorancethe whole human race works and plays at about tenpercent efficiency the only possible ground for optimism about the human race that i can see is that in most all lines experts are at work showing up the deficienciesproving that alcohol and war are bad and consumption and greek unnecessaryand making a beginning you dont do justice to the big offices and mills where they have real efficiency tests and if a man doesnt make good in one place they shift him to another  there arent very many of them in all the offices ive ever seen the bosss indigestion is the only test of employees  yes yes i know but that isnt the point the point is that they are making such testsbeginning to take the schools where they actually teach future housewives to cook and sew as well as to read aloud but of course i admit the very fact that there can be and are such schools and offices is a terrible indictment of the slatternly schools and badtempered offices we usually do have and if you can show up this system of shutting people up in treadmills why go to it and good luck the longer people are stupidly optimistic the longer well have to wait for improvements but believe me my dear girl for every ardent radical who says the whole thing is rotten theres ten clever advertisingmen who think its virtue to sell new brands of soappowder that are no better than the old brands and a hundred old codgers who are so broken into the office system that they think they are perfectly happydont know how much fun in life they miss still theyre no worse than the adherents to any other paralyzed system look at the comparatively intelligent people who fall for any freak religious system and let it make their lives miserable i suppose that when the world has no more war or tuberculosis then offices will be exciting places to work inbut not till then and meantime if the typical business man with a taste for fishing heard even so mild a radical as i am hed sniff the fellow dont know what hes talking about everybody in all the offices i know is perfectly satisfied  yes changes will be slow i suppose but that doesnt excuse bosses of today for thinking they are little tin gods  no of course it doesnt but people in authority always do that the only thing we can do about it is for us personally to make our offices as clean and amusing as we can instead of trying to buy yachts but dont ever think either that capitalists are a peculiar race of fiends different from anarchists or scrubwomen or that well have a millennium about next election weve got to be anthropological in our view its taken the human race about five hundred thousand years to get where it is and presumably it will take quite a few thousand more to become scientific or even to understand the need of scientific conduct of everything im not at all sure that theres any higher wisdom than doing a days work and hoping the subway will be a little less crowded next year and in voting for the best possible man and then forgetting all the weltschmertz and going to an opera it sounds pretty raw and crude doesnt it but living in a world thats raw and crude all you can do is to be honest and not worry  yes said una  she grieved for the sunsetcolored ideals of mamie magen for the fine strained hysterical enthusiasms of walter babson as an enchantment of thought which she was dispelling in her effort to become a good sound practical business woman mr feins drab opportunist philosophy disappointed her yet in contrast to mr schwirtz mr truax and chas he was hyperbolic and after their dinner she was gushingly happy to be hearing the opportunist melodies of il trovatore beside him   § 3  the merryton realty company had failed and truax  fein were offered the small development property of crosshampton hill gardens at so convenient a price that they could not refuse it though they were already carrying as many properties as they could easily handle in a characteristic monologue mr truax asked a select audience consisting of himself his inkwell and una what he was to do  shall i try to exploit it and close it out quick ive got half a mind to go back to the old tentandbrassband method and auction it off the salesmen have all they can get away with i havent even a good reliable resident salesman i could trust to handle it on the grounds  let me try it said una give me a months trial as salesman on the ground and see what i can do just run some doubleleaded classified ads and forget it you can trust me you know you can why ill write my own ads even view of long island sound and beautiful rolling hills near to family yacht club with swimming and sailing i know i could manage it  mr truax pretended not to hear but she rose leaned over his desk stared urgently at him till he weakly promised well ill talk it over with mr fein but you know it wouldnt be worth a bit more salary than youre getting now and what would i do for a secretary  i dont worry about salary think of being out on long island now that spring is coming and ill find a successor and train her  well said mr truax while una took her pencil and awaited dictation with a heart so blithe that she could scarcely remember the symbols for yours of sixteenth instant received     chapter xxii   of the year and a half from march 1914 to the autumn of 1915 which una spent on long island as the resident salesman and director of crosshampton hill gardens this history has little to say for it is a treatise regarding a commonplace woman on a job and at the gardens there was no job at all but one long summer day of flushed laughter it is true that values were down on the north shore at this period and sales slow it is true that una in high tan boots and a tweed suit from a sportinggoods house supervised carpenters in constructing a bungalow as local office and dwellingplace for herself it is true that she quarreled with the engineer planning the walks and sewers usurped authority and discharged him and had to argue with mr truax for three hours before he sustained her decision also she spent an average of nine hours a day in waiting for people or in showing them about and serving tea and biscuits to dusty female villahunters and she herself sometimes ran a lawnmower and cooked her own meals but she had respect achievement and she ranged the open hills from the stirring time when dogwood blossoms filled the ravines with a fragrant mist round the calendar and on till the elms were gorgeous with a second autumn and sunsets marched in naked glory of archangels over the connecticut hills beyond the flaming waters of long island sound slowmoving but gentle were the winter months for she became a part of the commuting town of crosshampton harbor not as the negligible daughter of a panama captain golden but as a woman with the glamour of independence executive position city knowledge and a certain marital mystery she was invited to parties at which she obediently played bridge to dances at the harbor yacht club to meetings of the village friendly society a gay easygoing group with cocktailmixers on their sideboards and motors in their galvanizediron garages but also with savingsbank books in the drawers beneath their unit bookcases took her up as a woman who had learned to listen and smile and she went with them to friendly unexacting dances at the yearround inn conducted by charley duquesne in the impoverished duquesne mansion on smiley point she liked charley and gave him advice about bedroom chintzes for the inn and learned how a hotel is provisioned and served charley did not know that her knowledge of chintzes was about two weeks old and derived from a buyer at wanamacys he only knew that it solved his difficulties  she went into the city about once in two weeks just often enough to keep in touch with truax fein chas and mamie magen the last of whom had fallen in love with a socialistic gentile charities secretary fallen out again and was quietly dedicating all her life to hebrew charities  una closed the last sale at crosshampton hill gardens in the autumn of 1915 and returned to town to the officeworld and the job her record had been so clean and promising that she was able to demand a newlycreated positionwoman salesmanager at twentyfive hundred dollars a year selling direct and controlling five other women salesmen  mr truax still didnt believe in women salesmen and his lack of faith was more evident now that una was back in the office una grew more pessimistic as she realized that his idea of women salesmen was a pure high aloof thing which wasnt to be affected by anything happening in his office right under his nose but she was too busy selling lots instructing her women aides and furnishing a fourroom flat near stuyvesant park to worry much about mr truax and she was sure that mr fein would uphold her she had the best of reasons for that assurance namely that mr fein had hesitatingly made a formal proposal for her hand in marriage  she had refused him for two reasonsthat she already had one husband somewhere or other and the more cogent reason that though she admired mr fein found him as cooling and pleasant as lemonade on a july evening she did not love him did not want to mother him as she had always wanted to mother walter babson and as now and then when he had turned to her she had wanted to mother even mr schwirtz  the incident brought mr schwirtz to her mind for a day or two but he was as clean gone from her life as was mr henry carson of panama she did not know and did not often speculate whether he lived or continued to die if the world is very small after all it is also very large and life and the world swallow up those whom we have known best and they never come back to us   § 2  una had like a freshman envying the seniors like a lieutenant in awe of the council of generals always fancied that when she became a real executive with a salary of several thousands and people coming to her for orders she would somehow be a different person from the good little secretary she was astonished to find that in her private office and her new flat and in her new velvet suit she was precisely the same yearning meek efficient woman as before but she was happier despite her memories of schwirtz and the fear that some time some place she would encounter him and be claimed as his wife and despite a less frequent fear that america would be involved in the great european war una had solid joy in her office achievements in her flat in taking part in the vast suffrage parade of the autumn of 1915 and feeling comradeship with thousands of women  despite mr feins picture of the woes of executives una found that her new power and responsibility were inspiring as her little stenographers wage had never been nor though she did have trouble with the women responsible to her at times though she found it difficult to secure employees on whom she could depend did una become a female troy wilkins  she was able to work out some of the aspirations she had cloudily conceived when she had herself been a slave she did find it possible to be friendly with her aides to be on tea and luncheon and gossip terms of intimacy with them to confide in them instead of tricking them to use frank explanations instead of arbitrary rules and she was rewarded by their love and loyalty her chief quarrels were with mr truax in regard to raising the salaries and commissions of her assistant saleswomen  behind all these discoveries regarding the state of being an executive behind her days work and the evenings at her flat when mamie magen and mr fein came to dinner there were two tremendous secrets  for her personal life her life outside the office she had found a way out such as might perhaps solve the question of loneliness for the thousands of other emptyhearted fruitlessly aging officewomen not love of a man she would rather die than have schwirtzs clumsy feet trampling her reserve again and the pleasant men who came to her flat werejust pleasant no she told herself she did not need a man or mans love but a childs love and presence she did need  she was going to adopt a child that was her way out  she was thirtyfour now but by six of an afternoon she felt forty youth she would findyouth of a childs laughter and the healing of its downy sleep  she took counsel with mamie magen who immediately decided to adopt a child also and praised una as a discoverer and with the good housekeeping women she knew at crosshampton harbor she was going to be very careful she would inspect a dozen different orphanasylums  meanwhile her second secret was making life pregnant with interest  she was going to change her job againfor the last time she hoped she was going to be a creator a real manager unhampered by mr truaxs unwillingness to accept women as independent workers and by the growing animosity of mrs truax   § 3  unas interest in the yearround inn at crosshampton harbor the results obtained by reasonably good meals and a little chintz and her memory of the family hotel had led her attention to the commercial possibilities of innkeeping  she was convinced that despite the ingenuity and care displayed by the managers of the great urban hotels and the clever resorts no calling included more unimaginative slackers than did innkeeping she had heard travelingmen at pembertons and at truax  feins complain of sour coffee and lumpy beds in the hotels of the smaller towns of knives and forks that had to be wiped on the napkins before using of shirtsleeved proprietors who loafed within reach of the cuspidors while their wives tried to get the work done  she began to read the hotel news and the hotel bulletin and she called on the manager of a supplyhouse for hotels  she read in the bulletin of bob sidney an extravelingman who in partnership with a small capitalist had started a syndicate of inns he advertised the white line hotels fellowdrummers when you see the white line sign hung out you know youre in for good beds and good coffee  the idea seemed good to her she fancied that travelingmen would go from one white line hotel to another the hotels had been established in a dozen towns along the pennsylvania railroad in norristown reading williamsport and others and now bob sidney was promising to invade ohio and indiana the blazed white line across the continent caught unas growing commercial imagination and she liked several of mr sidneys ideas the hotels would wire ahead to others of the line for accommodations for the traveler and a man known to the line could get credit at any of its houses by being registered on identifying cards  she decided to capture mr sidney she made plans  in the spring she took a mysterious two weeks leave of absence and journeyed through new york state pennsylvania ohio and indiana the woman who had quite recently regarded it as an adventure to go to brooklyn was so absorbed in her big idea that she didnt feel selfconscious even when she talked to men on the train if they smacked their lips and obviously said to themselves gee this is easynot a bad little dame she steered them into discussing hotels what they wanted at hotels and didnt get what was their favorite hotel in towns in from fifteen hundred to forty thousand inhabitants and precisely what details made it the favorite  she stayed at two or three places a day for at least one mealhotels in tiny towns she had never heard of and in larger towns that were fumbling for metropolitanism she sought out all the summer resorts that were open so early she talked to travelers men and women to hackdrivers and to grocers supplying hotels to proprietors and their wives to clerks and waitresses and bellboys and unconsidered observant porters she read circulars and the catalogues of furniture establishments  finally she visited each of mr bob sidneys white line hotels aside from their arrangements for accommodations and credit their superior cleanliness good mattresses and coffee with a real taste she did not find them preferable to others in their rows of cuspidors and shouldering desks and barren offices hung with insurance calendars and diningrooms ornamented with portraits of decomposed ducks they were typical of all the hotels she had seen  on the train back to new york she formulated her suggestions for hotels among which in her own words were the following  1 make the offices decent roomsrem livingroom at gray wolf lodge take out desksguests to register and pay bills in small office off livingroomkeep letters there too not much room needed and cant make pleasant room with miserable old desk sticking out into it  2 cut out the cuspidors have special room where drummers can play cards and tell stories and spit allow smoking in office but make it pleasant rem chintz and wicker chairs at 3 each small round tables with readinglamps maybe fireplace  3 better pastry and soup and keep coffee up to standard one surprise in each mealfor example novel form of eggs good salad or canned lobster cocktail rem the same old pork beans cornbeef steak deadly cold boiled potato everywhere i went  4 more attractive diningrooms esp small tables for 2 and 4 cater more to local customers with à la carte menusnot long but good  5 women housekeepers and pay em good  6 hygienic kitchens and advertise em  7 train employees as rem trav man told me united cigar stores do  8 better accom for women rem several traveling mens wives told me they would go on many trips w husbands if they could get decent hotels in all these towns  9 not ape n y hotels nix on gilt and palms and marble but clean and tasty food and dont have things like desks just because most hotels do   § 4  three hours after una reached new york she telephoned to the object of her secret commercial affections the unconscious mr robert sidney at the white line hotels office she was so excited that she took ten minutes for calming herself before she telephoned every time she lifted the receiver from its hook she thrust it back and mentally apologized to the operator but when she got the office and heard mr bob sidneys raw voice shouting yas this s mist sidney una was very cool  this is mrs schwirtz realty salesman for truax  fein ive just been through pennsylvania and i stayed at your white line hotels of course i have to be an expert on different sorts of accommodations and i made some notes on your hotelssome suggestions you might be glad to have if you care to we might have lunch together tomorrow and ill give you the suggestions  why uh why  of course im rather busy with our new long island operations so if you have a date tomorrow the matter can wait but i thought youd better have the suggestions while they were fresh in my mind but perhaps i can lunch with you week after next if  no no lets make it tomorrow  very well will you call for me heretruax  fein zodiac building  una arose at sixthirty next morning to dress the part of the great business woman and before she went to the office she had her hair waved  mr bob sidney called for her he was a simple energetic soul with a derby on the back of his head cheerful cleanshaven largechinned hoarsevoiced rapidly revolving a chewed cigar she the commonplace was highly evolved in comparison with mr sidney and there was no nervousness in her as she marched out in a twentydollar hat and casually said lets go to the waldorfits convenient and not at all bad  on the way over mr sidney fairly massaged his head with his agitated derbycocked it over one eye and pushed it back to the crown of his headin his efforts to find out what and why was mrs una schwirtz he kept appraising her it was obvious that he was trying to decide whether this mysterious telephone correspondent was an available widow who had heard of his charms he finally stumbled over the grating beside the waldorf and bumped into the carriagestarter and dropped his dead cigar but all the while una steadily kept the conversation to the vernal beauties of pennsylvania  thanks to rice powder and the pride of a new hat she looked cool and adequate but she was thinking all the time i never could keep up this beatricejoline pose with mr fein or mr ross poor una with them shed just have to blurt out that she wanted a job  she sailed up to a corner table by a window the waiter gave the menu to mr sidney but she held out her hand for it this is my lunch im a business woman not just a woman she said to mr sidney and she rapidly ordered a lunch which was shockingly imitative of one which mr fein had once ordered for her  prett hot day for april said mr sidney  yes is the white line going well  yump doing a landoffice business  youre having trouble with your day clerk at brockenfelt i see  how juh know  oh she merely smiled  well that guys a fourflush came to us from the new willard and to hear him tell it youd think he was the guy that put the will in the willard but hes a creditgrabber thats what he is makes me think nev forget one time i was up in boston and i met a coon porter and he told me he was a friend of the president of the pullman company and had persuaded him to put on steel cars bet a hat he believed it himself thats bout like this fellow hes going to get the razoo gee i hope you aint a friend of his  una had perfectly learned the boeotian dialect so strangely spoken by mr sidney and she was able to reply  oh no no indeed he ought to be fired he gave me a room as though he were the superintendent of a free lodginghouse  but its so hard to get trained employees that i hate to even let him go just to show you the way things go just when i was trying to swing a deal for a new hotel i had to bust off negotiations and go and train a new crew of chambermaids at sandsonville myself youd died laughing to seen me making beds and teaching those birds to clean a spittador beggin your pardon but it certainly was some show and i do by gum know a travelingman likes his bed tucked in at the foot oh its fierce the traveling public kicks if they get bum service and the help kick if you demand any service from em and the boss gets it right in the collarbutton both ways from the ace  well im going to tell you how to have trained service and how to make your hotels distinctive theyre good hotels as hotels go and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences as you promise but your hotels are not distinctive im going to tell you how to make them so  una had waited till mr sidney had disposed of his soup and filet mignon she spoke deliberately almost sternly she reached for her new silver link bag drew out immaculate typewritten schedules and while he gaped she read to him precisely the faults of each of the hotels her suggested remedies and her general ideas of hotels with less cuspidors more originality and a room where travelingmen could be at home on a rainy sunday  now you know and i know she wound up that the proprietors ideal of a hotel is one to which travelingmen will travel sixty miles on saturday evening in order to spend sunday there you take my recommendations and youll have that kind of hotels at the same time women will be tempted there and the local trade will go there when wife or the cook is away or they want to give a big dinner  it does sound like it had some possibilities said mr sidney as she stopped for breath after quite the most impassioned invocation of her life  she plunged in again  now the point of all this is that i want to be the general manager of certain departments of the linecatering service decoration and so on ill keep out of the financial end and well work out the buying together you know its women who make the homes for people at home and why not the homes for people traveling im woman salesmanager for truax  feinsell direct and six women under me ill show you my record of sales ive been secretary to an architect and studied architecture a little and plenty other jobs now you take these suggestions of mine to your office and study em over with your partner and well talk about the job for me by and by  she left him as quickly as she could got back to her office and in a shaking spasm of weeping relapsed into the old timorous una   § 5  tedious were the negotiations between una and mr sidney and his partner they wanted her to make their hotelsand yet they had never heard of anything so nihilistic as actually having hotel offices without desks they wanted her and yet they didnt quite know about adding any more overhead at this stage of the game  meantime una sold lots and studied the economical buying of hotel supplies she was always willing to go with mr sidney and his partner to lunchbut they were brief lunches she was busy she said and she had no time to drop in at their office when mr sidney once tried to hold her hand not seriously but with his methodical system of never failing to look into any possibilities she said sharply dont try thatlets save a lot of time by understanding that im what you would call straight he apologized and assured her that he had known she was a highclass genuwine lady all the time  the very roughness which in mr schwirtz had abraised her interested her in mr sidney she knew better now how to control human beings she was fascinated by a comparison of her four average citizensfour men not vastly varied as seen in a streetcar yet utterly different to one working with them schwirtz the lumbering troy wilkins the roaring truax the politely whining and bob sidney the hesitating  the negotiations seemed to arrive nowhere  then unexpectedly bob sidney telephoned to her at her flat one evening partner and i have just decided to take you on if youll come at thirtyeight hundred a year  una hadnt even thought of the salary she would gladly have gone to her new creative position at the three thousand two hundred she was then receiving but she showed her new training and demanded  four thousand two hundred  well split the difference and call it four thousand for the first year  all right  una stood in the center of the room she had succeeded on her job then she knew that she wanted some one with whom to share the good news  she sat down and thought of her almostforgotten plan to adopt a child   § 6  mr sidney had during his telephone proclamation suggested come down to the office tomorrow and get acquainted havent got a very big force you know but theres a couple of stenographers good girls crazy to meet
