nathaniel hawthorne    there is a volume of what were once newspapers each on a small halfsheet yellow and timestained of a coarse fabric and imprinted with a rude old type  their aspect conveys a singular impression of antiquity in a species of literature which we are accustomed to consider as connected only with the present moment  ephemeral as they were intended and supposed to be they have long outlived the printer and his whole subscriptionlist and have proved more durable as to their physical existence than most of the timber bricks and stone of the town where they were issued  these are but the least of their triumphs the government the interests the opinions in short all the moral circumstances that were contemporary with their publication have passed away and left no better record of what they were than may be found in these frail leaves  happy are the editors of newspapers  their productions excel all others in immediate popularity and are certain to acquire another sort of value with the lapse of time  they scatter their leaves to the wind as the sibyl did and posterity collects them to be treasured up among the best materials of its wisdom  with hasty pens they write for immortality  it is pleasant to take one of these little dingy halfsheets between the thumb and finger and picture forth the personage who above ninety years ago held it wet from the press and steaming before the fire  many of the numbers bear the name of an old colonial dignitary  there he sits a major a member of the council and a weighty merchant in his highbacked armchair wearing a solemn wig and grave attire such as befits his imposing gravity of mien and displaying but little finery except a huge pair of silver shoebuckles curiously carved  observe the awful reverence of his visage as he reads his majestys most gracious speech and the deliberate wisdom with which he ponders over some paragraph of provincial politics and the keener intelligence with which he glances at the shipnews and commercial advertisements  observe and smile  he may have been a wise man in his day but to us the wisdom of the politician appears like folly because we can compare its prognostics with actual results and the old merchant seems to have busied himself about vanities because we know that the expected ships have been lost at sea or mouldered at the wharves that his imported broadcloths were long ago worn to tatters and his cargoes of wine quaffed to the lees and that the most precious leaves of his ledger have become wastepaper  yet his avocations were not so vain as our philosophic moralizing  in this world we are the things of a moment and are made to pursue momentary things with here and there a thought that stretches mistily towards eternity and perhaps may endure as long  all philosophy that would abstract mankind from the present is no more than words  the first pages of most of these old papers are as soporific as a bed of poppies  here we have an erudite clergyman or perhaps a cambridge professor occupying several successive weeks with a criticism on tate and brady as compared with the new england version of the psalms  of course the preference is given to the native article  here are doctors disagreeing about the treatment of a putrid fever then prevalent and blackguarding each other with a characteristic virulence that renders the controversy not altogether unreadable  here are president wigglesworth and the rev dr colman endeavoring to raise a fund for the support of missionaries among the indians of massachusetts bay  easy would be the duties of such a mission now  herefor there is nothing new under the sunare frequent complaints of the disordered state of the currency and the project of a bank with a capital of five hundred thousand pounds secured on lands  here are literary essays from the gentlemans magazine and squibs against the pretender from the london newspapers and here occasionally are specimens of new england honor laboriously light and lamentably mirthful as if some very sober person in his zeal to be merry were dancing a jig to the tune of a funeralpsalm  all this is wearisome and we must turn the leaf  there is a good deal of amusement and some profit in the perusal of those little items which characterize the manners and circumstances of the country  new england was then in a state incomparably more picturesque than at present or than it has been within the memory of man there being as yet only a narrow strip of civilization along the edge of a vast forest peopled with enough of its original race to contrast the savage life with the old customs of another world  the white population also was diversified by the influx of all sorts of expatriated vagabonds and by the continual importation of bondservants from ireland and elsewhere so that there was a wild and unsettled multitude forming a strong minority to the sober descendants of the puritans  then there were the slaves contributing their dark shade to the picture of society  the consequence of all this was a great variety and singularity of action and incident many instances of which might be selected from these columns where they are told with a simplicity and quaintness of style that bring the striking points into very strong relief  it is natural to suppose too that these circumstances affected the body of the people and made their course of life generally less regular than that of their descendants  there is no evidence that the moral standard was higher then than now or indeed that morality was so well defined as it has since become  there seem to have been quite as many frauds and robberies in proportion to the number of honest deeds there were murders in hotblood and in malice and bloody quarrels over liquor  some of our fathers also appear to have been yoked to unfaithful wives if we may trust the frequent notices of elopements from bed and board  the pillory the whippingpost the prison and the gallows each had their use in those old times and in short as often as our imagination lives in the past we find it a ruder and rougher age than our own with hardly any perceptible advantages and much that gave life a gloomier tinge in vain we endeavor to throw a sunny and joyous air over our picture of this period nothing passes before our fancy but a crowd of sadvisaged people moving duskily through a dull gray atmosphere  it is certain that winter rushed upon them with fiercer storms than now blocking up the narrow forestpaths and overwhelming the roads along the seacoast with mountain snow drifts so that weeks elapsed before the newspaper could announce how many travellers had perished or what wrecks had strewn the shore  the cold was more piercing then and lingered further into the spring making the chimneycorner a comfortable seat till long past mayday  by the number of such accidents on record we might suppose that the thunderstone as they termed it fell oftener and deadlier on steeples dwellings and unsheltered wretches  in fine our fathers bore the brunt of more raging and pitiless elements than we  there were forebodings also of a more fearful tempest than those of the elements  at two or three dates we have stories of drums trumpets and all sorts of martial music passing athwart the midnight sky accompanied with theroar of cannon and rattle of musketry prophetic echoes of the sounds that were soon to shake the land  besides these airy prognostics there were rumors of french fleets on the coast and of the march of french and indians through the wilderness along the borders of the settlements  the country was saddened moreover with grievous sicknesses  the smallpox raged in many of the towns and seems though so familiar a scourge to have been regarded with as much affright as that which drove the throng from wall street and broadway at the approach of a new pestilence  there were autumnal fevers too and a contagious and destructive throatdistemperdiseases unwritten in medical hooks  the dark superstition of former days had not yet been so far dispelled as not to heighten the gloom of the present times  there is an advertisement indeed by a committee of the legislature calling for information as to the circumstances of sufferers in the late calamity of 1692 with a view to reparation for their losses and misfortunes  but the tenderness with which after above forty years it was thought expedient to allude to the witchcraft delusion indicates a good deal of lingering error as well as the advance of more enlightened opinions  the rigid hand of puritanism might yet be felt upon the reins of government while some of the ordinances intimate a disorderly spirit on the part of the people the suffolk justices after a preamble that great disturbances have been committed by persons entering town and leaving it in coaches chaises calashes and other wheelcarriages on the evening before the sabbath give notice that a watch will hereafter be set at the fortificationgate to prevent these outrages  it is amusing to see boston assuming the aspect of a walled city guarded probably by a detachment of churchmembers with a deacon at their head  governor belcher makes proclamation against certain loose and dissolute people who have been wont to stop passengers in the streets on the fifth of november otherwise called popes day and levy contributions for the building of bonfires  in this instance the populace are more puritanic than the magistrate  the elaborate solemnities of funerals were in accordance with the sombre character of the times  in cases of ordinary death the printer seldom fails to notice that the corpse was very decently interred  but when some mightier mortal has yielded to his fate the decease of the worshipful suchaone is announced with all his titles of deacon justice councillor and colonel then follows an heraldic sketch of his honorable ancestors and lastly an account of the black pomp of his funeral and the liberal expenditure of scarfs gloves and mourning rings  the burial train glides slowly before us as we have seen it represented in the woodcuts of that day the coffin and the bearers and the lamentable friends trailing their long black garments while grim death a most misshapen skeleton with all kinds of doleful emblems stalks hideously in front  there was a coach maker at this period one john lucas who scents to have gained the chief of his living by letting out a sable coach to funerals it would not be fair however to leave quite so dismal an impression on the readers mind nor should it be forgotten that happiness may walk soberly in dark attire as well as dance lightsomely in a galadress  and this reminds us that there is an incidental notice of the dancingschool near the orangetree whence we may infer that the salutatory art was occasionally practised though perhaps chastened into a characteristic gravity of movement  this pastime was probably confined to the aristocratic circle of which the royal governor was the centre  but we are scandalized at the attempt of jonathan furness to introduce a more reprehensible amusement he challenges the whole country to match his black gelding in a race for a hundred pounds to be decided on metonomy common or chelsea beach nothing as to the manners of the times can be inferred from this freak of an individual  there were no daily and continual opportunities of being merry but sometimes the people rejoiced in their own peculiar fashion oftener with a calm religious smile than with a broad laugh as when they feasted like one great family at thanksgiving time or indulged a livelier mirth throughout the pleasant days of electionweek  this latter was the true holiday season of new england  military musters were too seriously important in that warlike time to be classed among amusements but they stirred up and enlivened the public mind and were occasions of solemn festival to the governor and great men of the province at the expense of the fieldoffices  the revolution blotted a feastday out of our calendar for the anniversary of the kings birth appears to have been celebrated with most imposing pomp by salutes from castle william a military parade a grand dinner at the townhouse and a brilliant illumination in the evening  there was nothing forced nor feigned in these testimonials of loyalty to george the second  so long as they dreaded the reestablishment of a popish dynasty the people were fervent for the house of hanover and besides the immediate magistracy of the country was a barrier between the monarch and the occasional discontents of the colonies the waves of faction sometimes reached the governors chair but never swelled against the throne  thus until oppression was felt to proceed from the kings own hand new england rejoiced with her whole heart on his majestys birthday  but the slaves we suspect were the merriest part of the population since it was their gift to be merry in the worst of circumstances and they endured comparatively few hardships under the domestic sway of our fathers  there seems to have been a great trade in these human commodities  no advertisements are more frequent than those of a negro fellow fit for almost any household work a negro woman honest healthy and capable a negro wench of many desirable qualities a negro man very fit for a taylor  we know not in what this natural fitness for a tailor consisted unless it were some peculiarity of conformation that enabled him to sit crosslegged  when the slaves of a family were inconveniently prolificit being not quite orthodox to drown the superfluous offspring like a litter of kittensnotice was promulgated of a negro child to be given away  sometimes the slaves assumed the property of their own persons and made their escape among many such instances the governor raises a hueandcry after his negro juba  but without venturing a word in extenuation of the general system we confess our opinion that caesar pompey scipio and all such great roman namesakes would have been better advised had they stayed at home foddering the cattle cleaning dishesin fine performing their moderate share of the labors of life without being harassed by its cares  the sable inmates of the mansion were not excluded from the domestic affections in families of middling rank they had their places at the board and when the circle closed round the evening hearth its blaze glowed on their dark shining faces intermixed familiarly with their masters children  it must have contributed to reconcile them to their lot that they saw white men and women imported from europe as they had been from africa and sold though only for a term of years yet as actual slaves to the highest bidder  slave labor being but a small part of the industry of the country it did not change the character of the people the latter on the contrary modified and softened the institution making it a patriarchal and almost a beautiful peculiarity of the times  ah  we had forgotten the good old merchant over whose shoulder we were peeping while he read the newspaper  let us now suppose him putting on his threecornered goldlaced hat grasping his cane with a head inlaid of ebony and motherofpearl and setting forth through the crooked streets of boston on various errands suggested by the advertisements of the day  thus he communes with himself i must be mindful says he to call at captain scuts in creek lane and examine his rich velvet whether it be fit for my apparel on electiondaythat i may wear a stately aspect in presence of the governor and my brethren of the council  i will look in also at the shop of michael cario the jeweller he has silver buckles of a new fashion and mine have lasted me some halfscore years  my fair daughter miriam shall have an apron of gold brocade and a velvet maskthough it would be a pity the wench should hide her comely visage and also a french cap from robert jenkinss on the north side of the townhouse  he hath beads too and earrings and necklaces of all sorts these are but vanities nevertheless they would please the silly maiden well  my dame desireth another female in the kitchen wherefore i must inspect the lot of irish lasses for sale by samuel waldo aboard the schooner endeavor as also the likely negro wench at captain bulfinchs  it were not amiss that i took my daughter miriam to see the royal waxwork near the towndock that she may learn to honor our most gracious king and queen and their royal progeny even in their waxen images not that i would approve of imageworship  the camel too that strange beast from africa with two great humps to be seen near the common methinks i would fain go thither and see how the old patriarchs were wont to ride  i will tarry awhile in queen street at the bookstore of my good friends kneeland  green and purchase dr colmans new sermon and the volume of discourses by mr henry flynt and look over the controversy on baptism between the rev peter clarke and an unknown adversary and see whether this george whitefield be as great in print as he is famed to be in the pulpit  by that time the auction will have commenced at the royal exchange in king street  moreover i must look to the disposal of my last cargo of west india rum and muscovado sugar and also the lot of choice cheshire cheese lest it grow mouldy  it were well that i ordered a cask of good english beer at the lower end of milk street  then am i to speak with certain dealers about the lot of stout old vidonia rich canary and oportowines which i have now lying in the cellar of the old south meetinghouse but a pipe or two of the rich canary shall be reserved that it may grow mellow in mine own winecellar and gladden my heart when it begins to droop with old age  provident old gentleman but was he mindful of his sepulchre did he bethink him to call at the workshop of timothy sheaffe in cold lane and select such a gravestone as would best please him  there wrought the man whose handiwork or that of his fellowcraftsmen was ultimately in demand by all the busy multitude who have left a record of their earthly toil in these old timestained papers and now as we turn over the volume we seem to be wandering among the mossy stones of a burialground   ii the old french war  at a period about twenty years subsequent to that of our former sketch we again attempt a delineation of some of the characteristics of life and manners in new england our textbook as before is a file of antique newspapers the volume which serves us for a writingdesk is a folio of larger dimensions than the one before described and the papers are generally printed on a whole sheet sometimes with a supplemental leaf of news and advertisements they have a venerable appearance being overspread with a duskiness of more than seventy years and discolored here and there with the deeper stains of some liquid as if the contents of a wineglass had long since been splashed upon the page  still the old book conveys an impression that when the separate numbers were flying about town in the first day or two of their respective existences they might have been fit reading for very stylish people such newspapers could have been issued nowhere but in a metropolis the centre not only of public and private affairs but of fashion and gayety  without any discredit to the colonial press these might have been and probably were spread out on the tables of the british coffeehouse in king street for the perusal of the throng of officers who then drank their wine at that celebrated establishment  to interest these military gentlemen there were bulletins of the war between prussia and austria between england and france on the old battleplains of flanders and between the same antagonists in the newer fields of the east indiesand in our own trackless woods where white men never trod until they came to fight there  or the travelled american the petitmaitre of the coloniesthe ape of london foppery as the newspaper was the semblance of the london journalshe with his gray powdered periwig his embroidered coat lace ruffles and glossy silk stockings goldenclockedhis buckles of glittering paste at kneeband and shoestraphis scented handkerchief and chapeau beneath his arm even such a dainty figure need not have disdained to glance at these old yellow pages while they were the mirror of passing times  for his amusement there were essays of wit and humor the light literature of the day which for breadth and license might have proceeded from the pen of fielding or smollet while in other columns he would delight his imagination with the enumerated items of all sorts of finery and with the rival advertisements of half a dozen perukemakers  in short newer manners and customs had almost entirely superseded those of the puritans even in their own city of refuge  it was natural that with the lapse of time and increase of wealth and population the peculiarities of the early settlers should have waxed fainter and fainter through the generations of their descendants who also had been alloyed by a continual accession of emigrants from many countries and of all characters  it tended to assimilate the colonial manners to those of the mothercountry that the commercial intercourse was great and that the merchants often went thither in their own ships indeed almost every man of adequate fortune felt a yearning desire and even judged it a filial duty at least once in his life to visit the home of his ancestors  they still called it their own home as if new england were to them what many of the old puritans had considered it not a permanent abidingplace but merely a lodge in the wilderness until the trouble of the times should be passed  the example of the royal governors must have had much influence on the manners of the colonists for these rulers assumed a degree of state and splendor which had never been practised by their predecessors who differed in nothing from republican chiefmagistrates under the old charter  the officers of the crown the public characters in the interest of the administration and the gentlemen of wealth and good descent generally noted for their loyalty would constitute a dignified circle with the governor in the centre bearing a very passable resemblance to a court their ideas their habits their bode of courtesy and their dress would have all the fresh glitter of fashions immediately derived from the fountainhead in england  to prevent their modes of life from becoming the standard with all who had the ability to imitate them there was no longer an undue severity of religion nor as yet any disaffection to british supremacy nor democratic prejudices against pomp  thus while the colonies were attaining that strength which was soon to render them an independent republic it might have been supposed that the wealthier classes were growing into an aristocracy and ripening for hereditary rank while the poor were to be stationary in their abasement and the country perhaps to be a sister monarchy with england  such doubtless were the plausible conjectures deduced from the superficial phenomena of our connection with a monarchical government until the prospective nobility were levelled with the mob by the mere gathering of winds that preceded the storm of the revolution  the portents of that storm were not yet visible in the air  a true picture of society therefore would have the rich effect produced by distinctions of rank that seemed permanent and by appropriate habits of splendor on the part of the gentry  the people at large had been somewhat changed in character since the period of our last sketch by their great exploit the conquest of louisburg  after that event the newenglanders never settled into precisely the same quiet race which all the world had imagined them to be  they had done a deed of history and were anxious to add new ones to the record  they had proved themselves powerful enough to influence the result of a war and were thenceforth called upon and willingly consented to join their strength against the enemies of england on those fields at least where victory would redound to their peculiar advantage  and now in the heat of the old french war they might well be termed a martial people  every man was a soldier or the father or brother of a soldier and the whole land literally echoed with the roll of the drum either beating up for recruits among the towns and villages or striking the march towards the frontiers  besides the provincial troops there were twentythree british regiments in the northern colonies  the country has never known a period of such excitement and warlike life except during the revolutionperhaps scarcely then for that was a lingering war and this a stirring and eventful one  one would think that no very wonderful talent was requisite for an historical novel when the rough and hurried paragraphs of these newspapers can recall the past so magically  we seem to be waiting in the street for the arrival of the postriderwho is seldom more than twelve hours beyond his timewith letters by way of albany from the various departments of the army  or we may fancy ourselves in the circle of listeners all with necks stretched out towards an old gentleman in the centre who deliberately puts on his spectacles unfolds the wet newspaper and gives us the details of the broken and contradictory reports which have been flying from mouth to mouth ever since the courier alighted at secretary olivers office  sometimes we have an account of the indian skirmishes near lake george and how a ranging party of provincials were so closely pursued that they threw away their arms and eke their shoes stockings and breeches barely reaching the camp in their shirts which also were terribly tattered by the bushes  then there is a journal of the siege of fort niagara so minute that it almost numbers the cannonshot and bombs and describes the effect of the latter missiles on the french commandants stone mansion within the fortress  in the letters of the provincial officers it is amusing to observe how some of them endeavor to catch the careless and jovial turn of old campaigners  one gentleman tells us that he holds a brimming glass in his hand intending to drink the health of his correspondent unless a cannon ball should dash the liquor from his lips in the midst of his letter he hears the bells of the french churches ringing in quebec and recollects that it is sunday whereupon like a good protestant he resolves to disturb the catholic worship by a few thirtytwo pound shot  while this wicked man of war was thus making a jest of religion his pious mother had probably put up a note that very sabbathday desiring the prayers of the congregation for a son gone a soldiering  we trust however that there were some stout old worthies who were not ashamed to do as their fathers did but went to prayer with their soldiers before leading them to battle and doubtless fought none the worse for that  if we had enlisted in the old french war it should have been under such a captain for we love to see a man keep the characteristics of his country       the contemptuous jealousy of the british army from the general      downwards was very galling to the provincial troops  in one of the      newspapers there is an admirable letter of a new england man      copied from the london chronicle defending the provincials with an      ability worthy of franklin and somewhat in his style  the letter      is remarkable also because it takes up the cause of the whole      range of colonies as if the writer looked upon them all as      constituting one country and that his own  colonial patriotism had      not hitherto been so broad a sentiment  these letters and other intelligence from the army are pleasant and lively reading and stir up the mind like the music of a drum and fife it is less agreeable to meet with accounts of women slain and scalped and infants dashed against trees by the indians on the frontiers  it is a striking circumstance that innumerable bears driven from the woods by the uproar of contending armies in their accustomed haunts broke into the settlements and committed great ravages among children as well as sheep and swine  some of them prowled where bears had never been for a century penetrating within a mile or two of boston a fact that gives a strong and gloomy impression of something very terrific going on in the forest since these savage beasts fled townward to avoid it  but it is impossible to moralize about such trifles when every newspaper contains tales of military enterprise and often a huzza for victory as for instance the taking of ticonderoga long a place of awe to the provincials and one of the bloodiest spots in the present war  nor is it unpleasant among whole pages of exultation to find a note of sorrow for the fall of some brave officer it comes wailing in like a funeral strain amidst a peal of triumph itself triumphant too  such was the lamentation over wolfe  somewhere in this volume of newspapers though we cannot now lay our finger upon the passage we recollect a report that general wolfe was slain not by the enemy but by a shot from his own soldiers  in the advertising columns also we are continually reminded that the country was in a state of war  governor pownall makes proclamation for the enlisting of soldiers and directs the militia colonels to attend to the discipline of their regiments and the selectmen of every town to replenish their stocks of ammunition  the magazine by the way was generally kept in the upper loft of the village meetinghouse  the provincial captains are drumming up for soldiers in every newspaper sir jeffrey amherst advertises for batteauxmen to be employed on the lakes and gives notice to the officers of seven british regiments dispersed on the recruiting service to rendezvous in boston  captain hallowell of the province shipofwar king george invites ablebodied seamen to serve his majesty for fifteen pounds old tenor per month by the rewards offered there would appear to have been frequent desertions from the new england forces we applaud their wisdom if not their valor or integrity  cannon of all calibres gunpowder and balls firelocks pistols swords and hangers were common articles of merchandise  daniel jones at the sign of the hat and helmet offers to supply officers with scarlet broadcloth goldlace for hats and waistcoats cockades and other military foppery allowing credit until the payrolls shall be made up  this advertisement gives us quite a gorgeous idea of a provincial captain in full dress  at the commencement of the campaign of 1759 the british general informs the farmers of new england that a regular market will be established at lake george whither they are invited to bring provisions and refreshments of all sorts for the use of the army  hence we may form a singular picture of petty traffic far away from any permanent settlements among the hills which border that romantic lake with the solemn woods overshadowing the scene  carcasses of bullocks and fat porkers are placed upright against the huge trunks of the trees fowls hang from the lower branches bobbing against the heads of those beneath butterfirkins great cheeses and brown loaves of household bread baked in distant ovens are collected under temporary shelters or pineboughs with gingerbread and pumpkinpies perhaps and other toothsome dainties  barrels of cider and sprucebeer are running freely into the wooden canteens of the soldiers  imagine such a scene beneath the dark forest canopy with here and there a few struggling sunbeams to dissipate the gloom  see the shrewd yeomen haggling with their scarletcoated customers abating somewhat in their prices but still dealing at monstrous profit and then complete the picture with circumstances that bespeak war and danger  a cannon shall be seen to belch its smoke from among the trees against some distant canoes on the lake the traffickers shall pause and seem to hearken at intervals as if they heard the rattle of musketry or the shout of indians a scoutingparty shall be driven in with two or three faint and bloody men among them  and in spite of these disturbances business goes on briskly in the market of the wilderness  it must not be supposed that the martial character of the times interrupted all pursuits except those connected with war  on the contrary there appears to have been a general vigor and vivacity diffused into the whole round of colonial life  during the winter of 1759 it was computed that about a thousand sledloads of country produce were daily brought into boston market  it was a symptom of an irregular and unquiet course of affairs that innumerable lotteries were projected ostensibly for the purpose of public improvements such as roads and bridges  many females seized the opportunity to engage in business as among others alice quick who dealt in crockery and hosiery next door to deacon beautineaus mary jackson who sold butter at the brazenhead in cornhill abigail hiller who taught ornamental work near the orangetree where also were to be seen the king and queen in waxwork sarah morehead an instructor in glasspainting drawing and japanning mary salmon who shod horses at the south end harriet pain at the buck and glove and mrs henrietta maria caine at the golden fan both fashionable milliners anna adams who advertises quebec and garrick bonnets prussian cloaks and scarlet cardinals opposite the old brick meetinghouse besides a lady at the head of a wine and spirit establishment  little did these good dames expect to reappear before the public so long after they had made their last courtesies behind the counter  our greatgrandmothers were a stirring sisterhood and seem not to have been utterly despised by the gentlemen at the british coffeehouse at least some gracious bachelor there resident gives public notice of his willingness to take a wife provided she be not above twentythree and possess brown hair regular features a brisk eye and a fortune  now this was great condescension towards the ladies of massachusetts bay in a threadbare lieutenant of foot  polite literature was beginning to make its appearance  few native works were advertised it is true except sermons and treatises of controversial divinity nor were the english authors of the day much known on this side of the atlantic  but catalogues were frequently offered at auction or private sale comprising the standard english books history essays and poetry of queen annes age and the preceding century  we see nothing in the nature of a novel unless it be the two mothers price four coppers  there was an american poet however of whom mr kettell has preserved no specimenthe author of war an heroic poem he publishes by subscription and threatens to prosecute his patrons for not taking their books  we have discovered a periodical also and one that has a peculiar claim to be recorded here since it bore the title of the new england magazine a forgotten predecessor for which we should have a filial respect and take its excellence on trust  the fine arts too were budding into existence at the old glass and picture shop in cornhill various maps plates and views are advertised and among them a prospect of boston a copperplate engraving of quebec and the effigies of all the new england ministers ever done in mezzotinto  all these must have been very salable articles  other ornamental wares were to be found at the same shop such as violins flutes hautboys musical books english and dutch toys and london babies  about this period mr dipper gives notice of a concert of vocal and instrumental music  there had already been an attempt at theatrical exhibitions  there are tokens in every newspaper of a style of luxury and magnificence which we do not usually associate with our ideas of the times  when the property of a deceased person was to be sold we find among the household furniture silk beds and hangings damask tablecloths turkey carpets pictures pierglasses massive plate and all things proper for a noble mansion  wine was more generally drunk than now though by no means to the neglect of ardent spirits  for the apparel of both sexes the mercers and milliners imported good store of fine broadcloths especially scarlet crimson and skyblue silks satins lawns and velvets gold brocade and gold and silver lace and silver tassels and silver spangles until cornhill shone and sparkled with their merchandise  the gaudiest dress permissible by modern taste fades into a quakerlike sobriety compared with the deep rich glowing splendor of our ancestors  such figures were almost too fine to go about town on foot accordingly carriages were so numerous as to require a tax and it is recorded that when governor bernard came to the province he was met between dedham and boston by a multitude of gentlemen in their coaches and chariots  take my arm gentle reader and come with me into some street perhaps trodden by your daily footsteps but which now has such an aspect of halffamiliar strangeness that you suspect yourself to be walking abroad in a dream  true there are some brick edifices which you remember from childhood and which your father and grandfather remembered as well but you are perplexed by the absence of many that were here only an hour or two since and still more amazing is the presence of whole rows of wooden and plastered houses projecting over the sidewalks and bearing iron figures on their fronts which prove them to have stood on the same sites above a century  where have your eyes been that you never saw them before  along the ghostly streetfor at length you conclude that all is unsubstantial though it be so good a mockery of an antique townalong the ghostly street there are ghostly people too  every gentleman has his threecornered hat either on his head or under his arm and all wear wigs in infinite varietythe tie the brigadier the spencer the albemarle the major the ramillies the grave fullbottom or the giddy feathertop  look at the elaborate laceruffles and the squareskirted coats of gorgeous hues bedizened with silver and gold  make way for the phantomladies whose hoops require such breadth of passage as they pace majestically along in silken gowns blue green or yellow brilliantly embroidered and with small satin hats surmounting their powdered hair make way for the whole spectral show will vanish if your earthly garments brush against their robes  now that the scene is brightest and the whole street glitters with imaginary sunshinenow hark to the bells of the old south and the old north ringing out with a sudden and merry peal while the cannon of castle william thunder below the town and those of the diana frigate repeat the sound and the charlestown batteries reply with a nearer roar  you see the crowd toss up their hats in visionary joy  you hear of illuminations and fireworks and of bonfires built oil scaffolds raised several stories above the ground that are to blaze all night in king street and on beacon hill  and here come the trumpets and kettledrums and the tramping hoofs of the boston troop of horseguards escorting the governor to kings chapel where he is to return solemn thanks for the surrender of quebec  march on thou shadowy troop and vanish ghostly crowd and change again old street for those stirring times are gone  opportunely for the conclusion of our sketch a fire broke out on the twentieth of march 1760 at the brazenhead in cornhill and consumed nearly four hundred buildings  similar disasters have always been epochs in the chronology of boston  that of 1711 had hitherto been termed the great fire but now resigned its baleful dignity to one which has ever since retained it  did we desire to move the readers sympathies on this subject we would not be grandiloquent about the sea of billowy flame the glowing and crumbling streets the broad black firmament of smoke and the blast or wind that sprang up with the conflagration and roared behind it  it would be more effective to mark out a single family at the moment when the flames caught upon an angle of their dwelling then would ensue the removal of the bedridden grandmother the cradle with the sleeping infant and most dismal of all the dying man just at the extremity of a lingering disease  do but imagine the confused agony of one thus awfully disturbed in his last hour his fearful glance behind at the consuming fire raging after him from house to house as its devoted victim and finally the almost eagerness with which he would seize some calmer interval to die  the great fire must have realized many such a scene  doubtless posterity has acquired a better city by the calamity of that generation  none will be inclined to lament it at this late day except the lover of antiquity who would have been glad to walk among those streets of venerable houses fancying the old inhabitants still there that he might commune with their shadows and paint a more vivid picture of their times   iii  the old tory  again we take a leap of about twenty years and alight in the midst of the revolution  indeed having just closed a volume of colonial newspapers which represented the period when monarchical and aristocratic sentiments were at the highestand now opening another volume printed in the same metropolis after such sentiments had long been deemed a sin and shamewe feel as if the leap were more than figurative  our late course of reading has tinctured us for the moment with antique prejudices and we shrink from the strangely contrasted times into which we emerge like one of those immutable old tories who acknowledge no oppression in the stamp act  it may be the most effective method of going through the present file of papers to follow out this idea and transform ourself perchance from a modern tory into such a sturdy kingman as once wore that pliable nickname  well then here we sit an old gray withered sourvisaged threadbare sort of gentleman erect enough here in our solitude but marked out by a depressed and distrustful mien abroad as one conscious of a stigma upon his forehead though for no crime  we were already in the decline of life when the first tremors of the earthquake that has convulsed the continent were felt  our mind had grown too rigid to change any of its opinions when the voice of the people demanded that all should be changed  we are an episcopalian and sat under the highchurch doctrines of dr caner we have been a captain of the provincial forces and love our king the better for the blood that we shed in his cause on the plains of abraham  among all the refugees there is not one more loyal to the backbone than we  still we lingered behind when the british army evacuated boston sweeping in its train most of those with whom we held communion the old loyal gentlemen the aristocracy of the colonies the hereditary englishman imbued with more than native zeal and admiration for the glorious island and its monarch because the farintervening ocean threw a dim reverence around them  when our brethren departed we could not tear our aged roots out of the soil  we have remained therefore enduring to be outwardly a freeman but idolizing king george in secrecy and silenceone true old heart amongst a host of enemies  we watch with a weary hope for the moment when all this turmoil shall subside and the impious novelty that has distracted our latter years like a wild dream give place to the blessed quietude of royal sway with the kings name in every ordinance his prayer in the church his health at the board and his love in the peoples heart meantime our old age finds little honor  hustled have we been till driven from townmeetings dirty water has been cast upon our ruffles by a whig chambermaid john hancocks coachman seizes every opportunity to bespatter us with mud daily are we hooted by the unbreeched rebel brats and narrowly once did our gray hairs escape the ignominy of tar and feathers  alas only that we cannot bear to die till the next royal governor comes over we would fain be in our quiet grave  such an old man among new things are we who now hold at armslength the rebel newspaper of the day  the very figurehead for the thousandth time elicits it groan of spiteful lamentation  where are the united heart and crown the loyal emblem that used to hallow the sheet on which it was impressed in our younger days  in its stead we find a continental officer with the declaration of independence in one hand a drawn sword in the other and above his head a scroll bearing the motto we appeal to heaven  then say we with a prospective triumph let heaven judge in its own good time  the material of the sheet attracts our scorn  it is a fair specimen of rebel manufacture thick and coarse like wrappingpaper all overspread with little knobs and of such a deep dingy blue color that we wipe our spectacles thrice before we can distinguish a letter of the wretched print  thus in all points the newspaper is a type of the times far more fit for the rough hands of a democratic mob than for our own delicate though bony fingers  nay we will not handle it without our gloves  glancing down the page our eyes are greeted everywhere by the offer of lands at auction for sale or to be leased not by the rightful owners but a rebel committee notices of the town constable that he is authorized to receive the taxes on such all estate in default of which that also is to be knocked down to the highest bidder and notifications of complaints filed by the attorneygeneral against certain traitorous absentees and of confiscations that are to ensue  and who are these traitors  our own best friends names as old once as honored as any in the land where they are no longer to have a patrimony nor to be remembered as good men who have passed away  we are ashamed of not relinquishing our little property too but comfort ourselves because we still keep our principles without gratifying the rebels with our plunder  plunder indeed they are seizing everywhereby the strong hand at sea as well as by legal forms oil shore  here are prizevessels for sale no french nor spanish merchantmen whose wealth is the birthright of british subjects but hulls of british oak from liverpool bristol and the thames laden with the kings own stores for his army in new york  and what a fleet of privateerspirates say weare fitting out for new ravages with rebellion in their very names  the free yankee the general greene the saratoga the lafayette and the grand monarch  yes the grand monarch so is a french king styled by the sons of englishmen  and here we have an ordinance from the court of versailles with the bourbons own signature affixed as if new england were already a french province  everything is frenchfrench soldiers french sailors french surgeons and french diseases too i trow besides french dancingmasters and french milliners to debauch our daughters with french fashions  everything in america is french except the canadas the loyal canadas which we helped to wrest from france  and to that old french province the englishman of the colonies must go to find his country  o the misery of seeing the whole system of things changed in my old days when i would be loath to change even a pair of buckles  the british coffeehouse where oft we sat brimful of wine and loyalty with the gallant gentlemen of amhersts army when we wore a redcoat toothe british coffeehouse forsooth must now be styled the american with a golden eagle instead of the royal arms above the door  even the street it stands in is no longer king street  nothing is the kings except this heavy heart in my old bosom  wherever i glance my eyes they meet something that pricks them like a needle  this soapmaker for instance this hobert hewes has conspired against my peace by notifying that his shop is situated near liberty stump  but when will their misnamed liberty have its true emblem in that stump hewn down by british steel  where shall we buy our next years almanac  not this of weatherwises certainly for it contains a likeness of george washington the upright rebel whom we most hate though reverentially as a fallen angel with his heavenly brightness undiminished evincing pure fame in an unhallowed cause  and here is a new book for my evenings recreationa history of the war till the close of the year 1779 with the heads of thirteen distinguished officers engraved on copperplate  a plague upon their heads  we desire not to see them till they grin at us from the balcony before the townhouse fixed on spikes as the heads of traitors  how bloodyminded the villains make a peaceable old man  what next  an oration on the horrid massacre of 1770  when that blood was shedthe first that the british soldier ever drew from the bosoms of our countrymenwe turned sick at heart and do so still as often as they make it reek anew from among the stones in king street  the pool that we saw that night has swelled into a lakeenglish blood and americanno all british all blood of my brethren  and here come down tears  shame on me since half of them are shed for rebels  who are not rebels now even the women are thrusting their white hands into the war and come out in this very paper with proposals to form a societythe lady of george washington at their headfor clothing the continental troops  they will strip off their stiff petticoats to cover the ragged rascals and then enlist in the ranks themselves  what have we here  burgoynes proclamation turned into hudibrastic rhyme  and here some verses against the king in which the scribbler leaves a blank for the name of george as if his doggerel might yet exalt him to the pillory  such after years of rebellion is the hearts unconquerable reverence for the lords anointed  in the next column we have scripture parodied in a squib against his sacred majesty  what would our puritan greatgrandsires have said to that  they never laughed at gods word though they cut off a kings head  yes it was for us to prove how disloyalty goes hand in hand with irreligion and all other vices come trooping in the train  nowadays men commit robbery and sacrilege for the mere luxury of wickedness as this advertisement testifies  three hundred pounds reward for the detection of the villains who stole and destroyed the cushions and pulpit drapery of the brattle street and old south churches  was it a crime  i can scarcely think our temples hallowed since the king ceased to be prayed for  but it is not temples only that they rob  here a man offers a thousand dollarsa thousand dollars in continental ragsfor the recovery of his stolen cloak and other articles of clothing horsethieves are innumerable  now is the day when every beggar gets on horseback  and is not the whole land like a beggar on horseback riding post to the davil  ha here is a murder too  a woman slain at midnight by all unknown ruffian and found cold stiff and bloody in her violated bed  let the hueandcry follow hard after the man in the uniform of blue and buff who last went by that way  my life on it he is the bloodstained ravisher  these deserters whom we see proclaimed in every columnproof that the banditti are as false to their stars and stripes as to the holy red crossthey bring the crimes of a rebel camp into a soil well suited to them the bosom of a people without the heart that kept them virtuoustheir king  here flaunting down a whole column with official seal and signature here comes a proclamation  by whose authority  ah the united statesthese thirteen little anarchies assembled in that one grand anarchy their congress  and what the import  a general fast  by heaven for once the traitorous blockheads have legislated wisely  yea let a misguided people kneel down in sackcloth and ashes from end to end from border to border of their wasted country  well may they fast where there is no food and cry aloud for whatever remnant of gods mercy their sins may not have exhausted  we too will fast even at a rebel summons pray others as they will there shall be at least an old man kneeling for the righteous cause  lord put down the rebels  god save the king  peace to the good old tory  one of our objects has been to exemplify without softening a single prejudice proper to the character which we assumed that the americans who clung to the losing side in the revolution were men greatly to be pitied and often worthy of our sympathy  it would be difficult to say whose lot was most lamentable that of the active tories who gave up their patrimonies for a pittance from the british pensionroll and their native land for a cold reception in their miscalled home or the passive ones who remained behind to endure the coldness of former friends and the public opprobrium as despised citizens under a government which they abhorred  in justice to the old gentleman who has favored us with his discontented musings we must remark that the state of the country so far as can be gathered from these papers was of dismal augury for the tendencies of democratic rule it was pardonable in the conservative of that day to mistake the temporary evils of a change for permanent diseases of the system which that change was to establish  a revolution or anything that interrupts social order may afford opportunities for the individual display of eminent virtues but its effects are pernicious to general morality most people are so constituted that they can be virtuous only in a certain routine and an irregular course of public affairs demoralizes them  one great source of disorder was the multitude of disbanded troops who were continually returning home after terms of service just long enough to give them a distaste to peaceable occupations neither citizens nor soldiers they were very liable to become ruffians  almost all our impressions in regard to this period are unpleasant whether referring to the state of civil society or to the character of the contest which especially where native americans were opposed to each other was waged with the deadly hatred of fraternal enemies  it is the beauty of war for men to commit mutual havoc with undisturbed goodhumor  the present volume of newspapers contains fewer characteristic traits than any which we have looked over  except for the peculiarities attendant on the passing struggle manners seem to have taken a modern cast  whatever antique fashions lingered into the war of the revolution or beyond it they were not so strongly marked as to leave their traces in the public journals  moreover the old newspapers had an indescribable picturesqueness not to be found in the later ones whether it be something in the literary execution or the ancient print and paper and the idea that those same musty pages have been handled by people once alive and bustling amid the scenes there recorded yet now in their graves beyond the memory of man so it is that in those elder volumes we seem to find the life of a past age preserved between the leaves like a dry specimen of foliage  it is so difficult to discover what touches are really picturesque that we doubt whether our attempts have produced any similar effect
