scene ii       at out eleven oclock the following night an wandas room on the      ground floor in soho  in the light from one closeshaded      electric bulb the room is but dimly visible  a dying fire burns      on the left  a curtained window in the centre of the back wall      a door on the right  the furniture is plushcovered and      commonplace with a kind of shabby smartness  a couch without      back or arms stands aslant between window and fire       on this wanda is sitting her knees drawn up under her staring      at the embers  she has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over      it her bare feet are thrust into slippers  her hands are      crossed and pressed over her breast  she starts and looks up      listening  her eyes are candid and startled her face alabaster      pale and its pale brown hair short and squarecut curls      towards her bare neck  the startled dark eyes and the faint      rose of her lips are like colourstaining on a white mask       footsteps as of a policeman very measured pass on the      pavement outside and die away  she gets up and steals to the      window draws one curtain aside so that a chink of the night is      seen  she opens the curtain wider till the shape of a bare      witchlike tree becomes visible in the open space of the little      square on the far side of the road  the footsteps are heard      once more coming nearer  wanda closes the curtains and cranes      back  they pass and die again  she moves away and looking down      at the floor between door and couch as though seeing something      there  shudders covers her eyes goes back to the couch and      down again just as before to stare at the embers  again she is      startled by noise of the outer door being opened  she springs      up runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door  by      the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the      dark windowcurtains listening  there comes the sound of      subdued knocking on her door  she stands in breathless terror      the knocking is repeated  the sound of a latchkey in the door      is heard  her terror leaves her  the door opens a man enters      in a dark fur overcoat  wanda  in a voice of breathless relief with a rather foreign accent  oh its you larry  why did you knock  i was so frightened  come in  she crosses quickly and flings her arms round his neck  recoilingin a terrorstricken whisper  oh  who is it  keith  in a smothered voice  a friend of larrys  dont be frightened       she has recoiled again to the window and when he finds the      switch and turns the light up she is seen standing there      holding her dark wrapper up to her throat so that her face has      an uncanny look of being detached from the body  gently  you neednt be afraid  i havent come to do you harm quite the contrary  holding up the keys  larry wouldnt have given me these would he if he hadnt trusted me       wanda does not move staring like a spirit startled out of the      flesh  after looking round him  im sorry to have startled you  wanda  in a whisper  who are you please  keith  larrys brother       wanda with a sigh of utter relief steals forward to the couch      and sinks down  keith goes up to her  hed told me  wanda  clasping her hands round her knees  yes  keith  an awful business  wanda  yes oh yes  awfulit is awful  keith  staring round him again  in this room  wanda  just where you are standing  i see him now always falling  keith  moved by the gentle despair in her voice  youlook very young  whats your name  wanda  wanda  keith  are you fond of larry  wanda  i would die for him       a moments silence  keith  iive come to see what you can do to save him  wanda wistfully  you would not deceive me  you are really his brother  keith

wanda  five month  keith  so you have not been out since       wanda shakes her head  what have you been doing  wanda  simply  crying  pressing her hands to her breast  he is in danger because of me  i am so afraid for him  keith  checking her emotion  look at me       she looks at him  if the worst comes and this man is traced to you can you trust yourself not to give larry away  wanda  rising and pointing to the fire  look  i have burned all the things he have given meeven his picture  now i have nothing from him  keith  who has risen too  good  one more question  do the police know youbecauseof your life       she looks at him intently and shakes her head  you know where larry lives  wanda  yes  keith  you mustnt go there and he mustnt come to you       she bows her head then suddenly comes close to him  wanda  please do not take him from me altogether  i will be so careful  i will not do anything to hurt him  but if i cannot see him sometimes i shall die  please do not take him from me       she catches his hand and presses it desperately between her      own  keith  leave that to me  im going to do all i can  wanda  looking up into his face  but you will be kind       suddenly she bends and kisses his hand  keith draws his hand      away and she recoils a little humbly looking up at him again      suddenly she stands rigid listening  in a whisper  listen  someoneout there       she darts past him and turns out the light  there is a knock on      the door  they are now close together between door and window   whispering  oh  who is it  keith  under his breath  you said no one comes but larry  wanda  yes and you have his keys  oh if it is larry i must open       keith shrinks back against the wall  wanda goes to the door  opening the door an inch  yes  please  who       a thin streak of light from a bullseye lantern outside plays      over the wall  a policemans voice says all right miss      your outer doors open  you ought to keep it shut after dark      you know  wanda  thank you air       the sound of retreating footsteps of the outer door closing      wanda shuts the door  a policeman  keith  moving from the wall  curse  i must have left that door suddenlyturning up the light  you told me they didnt know you  wanda  sighing  i did not think they did sir  it is so long i was not out in the town not since i had larry       keith

can believe  look here  you drifted together and youll drift apart you know  better for him to get away and make a clean cut of it  wanda  uttering a little moaning sound  oh sir  may i not love

a piano playing a faint festive tune is heard afar      off  he mutters staring at the fire       flamesflame and flickerashes  no more no more the moon is dead and all the people in it       he sits on the couch with a piece of paper on his knees adding      a few words with a stylo pen to what is already written       the girl in a silk wrapper coming back through the curtains      watches him  larry  looking up  its all hereive confessed  reading  please bury us together  laurence darrant  january 28th about six pm  theyll find us in the morning  come and have supper my dear love       the girl creeps forward  he rises puts his arm round her and      with her arm twined round him smiling into each others faces      they go to the table and sit down       the curtain falls for a few seconds to indicate the passage of      three hours  when it rises again the lovers are lying on the      couch in each others arms the lilies stream about them  the      girls bare arm is round larrys neck  her eyes are closed his      are open and sightless  there is no light but firelight       a knocking on the door and the sound of a key turned in the      lock  keith enters  he stands a moment bewildered by the      halflight then calls sharply larry and turns up the light      seeing the forms on the couch he recoils a moment  then      glancing at the table and empty decanters goes up to the couch  keith  muttering  asleep  drunk  ugh       suddenly he bends touches larry and springs back  what  he bends again shakes him and calls  larry larry       then motionless he stares down at his brothers open      sightless eyes  suddenly he wets his finger and holds it to the      girls lips then to larrys       he bends and listens at their hearts catches sight of the      little box lying between them and takes it up  my god       then raising himself he closes his brothers eyes and as he      does so catches sight of a paper pinned to the couch detaches      it and reads  i lawrence darrant about to die by my own hand confess that i       he reads on silently in horror finishes letting the paper      drop and recoils from the couch on to a chair at the      dishevelled supper table  aghast he sits there  suddenly he      mutters  if i leave that theremy namemy whole future       he springs up takes up the paper again and again reads  my god  its ruin       he makes as if to tear it across stops and looks down at      those two covers his eyes with his hand drops the paper and      rushes to the door  but he stops there and comes back      magnetised as it were by that paper  he takes it up once more      and thrusts it into his pocket       the footsteps of a policeman pass slow and regular outside      his face crisps and quivers he stands listening till they die      away  then he snatches the paper from his pocket and goes past      the foot of the couch to the fore  all myno  let him hang       he thrusts the paper into the fire stamps it down with his      foot watches it writhe and blacken  then suddenly clutching      his head he turns to the bodies on the couch  panting and like      a man demented he recoils past the head of the couch and      rushing to the window draws the curtains and throws the window      up for air  out in the darkness rises the witchlike skeleton      tree where a dark shape seems hanging  keith starts back  whats that  what       he shuts the window and draws the dark curtains across it      again  fool  nothing       clenching his fists he draws himself up steadying himself      with all his might  then slowly he moves to the door stands a      second like a carved figure his face hard as stone       deliberately he turns out the light opens the door and goes       the still bodies lie there before the fire which is licking at      the last blackened wafer   curtain
